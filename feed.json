      "A slab of Brooklyn wall that the artist Banksy emblazoned with a bandaged, heart-shaped balloon is emerging after more than a decade in storage",
      "NEW YORK -- When the enigmatic street artist Banksy spray-painted a heart-shaped balloon covered with a Band-Aid on the wall of a Brooklyn warehouse, the nondescript brick building was instantly transformed into an art destination and the canvas of an unlikely graffiti battle.",
      "Almost as soon as Banksy revealed the piece back in 2013, an anonymous tagger brazenly walked up and spray painted the words \u201cOmar NYC\u201d in red beside the balloon, to the dismay of onlookers.",
      "Days later, someone stenciled \u201cis a little girl\u201d in white and pink beside Omar\u2019s tag, followed by a seemingly sarcastic phrase in black: \u201cI remember MY first tag.\u201d Some think it was Banksy himself who secretly returned to the scene to add the rejoinder.",
      "The apparent graffiti battle didn\u2019t end there. Another tagger also attempted to leave his mark but was stymied by security guards. Today the phrase \u201cSHAN\u201d is still visible in light purple paint.",
      "Maria Georgiadis, whose family owned the now-demolished warehouse and ultimately removed the section of wall to preserve the artwork, says the graffiti pastiche is quintessentially New York.",
      "\u201cIt looks like a war going on,\u201d she said recently. \u201cThey\u2019re literally going at it on the wall.\u201d",
      "The preserved wall, dubbed \u201cBattle to Survive a Broken Heart,\u201d will be going up for sale May 21 at Guernsey\u2019s, the New York auction house.",
      "Georgiadis, a Brooklyn schoolteacher, says the sale is bittersweet. Her father, Vassilios Georgiadis, ran his roofing and asbestos abatement company from the warehouse adorned with the balloon.",
      "He died four years ago at age 67 from a heart attack, which is why some of the proceeds from the sale will be donated to the American Heart Association.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just very significant to us because he loved it and he was just so full of love,\u201d Maria Georgiadis said on a recent visit to the art warehouse where the piece was stored for more than a decade. \u201cIt\u2019s like the bandage heart. We all have love, but we\u2019ve all went through things and we just put a little Band-Aid over and just keep on moving, right? That\u2019s how I take it.\u201d",
      "The nearly 4-ton, 6-foot-tall (3.6-metric ton, 1.8-meter-tall) wall section is one of a number of guerrilla works the famously secretive British artist made during a New York residency in 2013.",
      "At the time, Banksy heralded the work by posting on his website photos and an audio track recorded partly in a squeaky, helium-induced voice.",
      "Guernsey auction house President Arlan Ettinger said it is impossible to know for certain because Banksy works clandestinely. But he said the neat stenciling and wording \u201cstrongly suggest that this was a gentle way for Banksy to put the other artist in his place.\u201d",
      "Ulrich Blanch\u00e9, an art history lecturer at Heidelberg University in Germany, called the piece a \u201cvery well executed\u201d stencil notable partly because of Banksy's decision to place it in Brooklyn\u2019s port area of Red Hook.",
      "\u201cThis part of NYC was not easy to reach at that time,\u201d he said by email. \u201cBanksy wanted people to go to places in NYC they never have seen and love them as well.\u201d",
      "But Blanche questioned whether the additional stenciled text was truly the work of Banksy, saying the word choice and design don\u2019t appear to comport with the artist\u2019s style at the time.",
      "\u201cTo call a graffiti guy a \u2018girl\u2019 is not something Banksy would do in 2013. This is misogynic and immature in a sexist way,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThree different fonts that do not match and three colors \u2014 why should he do that? Too unnecessarily elaborated without reasons. So I think this was added by someone else.\u201d",
      "Blanch\u00e9 also said he is ambivalent about the pending sale, noting Banksy usually doesn't authorize his street pieces for sale. At the same time, he understands the burden placed on property owners to protect and maintain them.",
      "\u201cBanksy\u2019s works should be preserved, but for the community they were made for,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should not be turned into goods. They are made and thought for a specific location. Not portable. Not sellable.\u201d",
      "Spokespersons for Banksy didn't respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Maria Georgiadis\u2019 brother, Anastasios, said his father had also hoped to keep the piece in Red Hook after having cut it out of the wall and framed in thick steel for safekeeping.",
      "The elder Georgiadis, he said, envisioned the work as the centerpiece of a retail and housing development on the property, a dream he didn't realize. The property has since been sold off by the family.",
      "Ettinger said it is difficult to say what the piece might fetch. There is little precedent for a sale of a Banksy piece of this size, he said.",
      "In 2018, a canvas that was part of Banksy's \u201cGirl With Balloon\u201d series sold in London for 1.04 million pounds ($1.4 million), only to famously self-destruct in front of a stunned auction crowd.",
      "Maria Georgiadis said she hopes whoever buys the \u201dBroken Heart\u201d finds the same beauty and meaning her father drew from the piece.",
      "When Banksy painted it, the family business had been recovering from destructive floods caused by Hurricane Sandy the prior year. Georgiadis recalls her father had no idea who Banksy was but was moved by the simple image.",
      "\u201cMy dad had it in his head that Banksy knew what we went through,\u201d she said. \u201cHe goes, \u2018Can you believe it Maria? It\u2019s a heart.\u2019\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aiming to slash public subsidies to PBS and NPR as he alleged \u201cbias\u201d in the broadcasters\u2019 reporting",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aiming to slash public subsidies to PBS and NPR as he alleged \u201cbias\u201d in the broadcasters\u2019 reporting.",
      "The order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal agencies \u201cto cease Federal funding for NPR and PBS\" and further requires that that they work to root out indirect sources of public financing for the news organizations. The White House, in a social media posting announcing the signing, said the outlets \u201creceive millions from taxpayers to spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\u201d",
      "It's the latest move by Trump and his administration to utilize federal powers to control or hamstring institutions whose actions or viewpoints he disagrees with. Since taking office, Trump has ousted leaders, placed staff on administrative leave and cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to artists, libraries, museums, theaters and others, through takeovers of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Trump has also pushed to withhold federal research and education funds from universities and punish law firms unless they agreed to eliminate diversity programs and other measures Trump has found objectionable.",
      "The broadcasters get roughly half a billion dollars in public money through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and have been preparing for the possibility of stiff cuts since Trump's election, as Republicans have long complained about them.",
      "Paula Kerger, PBS\u2019 CEO and president, said in a statement last month that the Trump administration\u2019s effort to rescind funding for public media would \u201cdisrupt the essential service PBS and local member stations provide to the American people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more American than PBS, and our work is only possible because of the bipartisan support we have always received from Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cThis public-private partnership allows us to help prepare millions of children for success in school and in life and also supports enriching and inspiring programs of the highest quality.\u201d",
      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting sued Trump earlier this week over his move to fire three members of its five-person board, contending that the president was exceeding his authority and that the move would deprive the board of a quorum needed to conduct business.",
      "Just two weeks ago, the White House said it would be asking Congress to rescind funding for the CPB as part of a $9.1 billion package of cuts. That package, however, which budget director Russell Vought said would likely be the first of several, has not yet been sent to Capitol Hill.",
      "The move against PBS and NPR comes as his administration has been working to dismantle the U.S. Agency for Global Media, including Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which were designed to model independent news gathering globally in societies that restrict the press. Those efforts have faced pushback from federal courts, who have ruled in some cases that the Trump administration may have overstepped its authority in holding back funds appropriated to the outlets by Congress.",

      "John Hauldren has been a Chicago Cubs fan all his life",
      "CHICAGO -- John Hauldren has been a Chicago Cubs fan all his life. During the team\u2019s last homestand, he got a text message from a high school friend. It was the first text he had received from him.",
      "Cubs center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong had just used \u201cFront to Back\u201d \u2014 a song from Hauldren's electronic music group, Levity \u2014 as his walkup music in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "\u201cI was like \u2018What? Like, no way,'\" Hauldren recalled. \u201cI, like, had to do my research for myself.\u201d",
      "Sure enough, it was true. Hauldren confirmed the authenticity of the moment through a tangential connection to the emerging star.",
      "Crow-Armstrong's girlfriend has a cousin who is friends with the girlfriend of PJ Carberry, another member of Levity.",
      "\u201cMy girlfriend, her cousin and her sister actually all just went to go watch them in Arizona,\u201d Crow-Armstrong said. \u201cI had already been talking about making one of their songs my walkout, so I just decided to do it.\u201d",
      "Crow-Armstrong, a 23-year-old Southern California native, also uses Larry June's \u201cStill Boomin\u201d for his walkup song. He said he isn't a big fan of dubstep \u2014 the subset of electronic dance music where Levity lands most of the time \u2014 but he likes Levity's stuff.",
      "Music is a prominent part of Crow-Armstrong's daily routine, and he enjoys the process of picking a walkup song.",
      "\u201cMusic\u2019s the best thing ever. I mean, literally, universally, it is the best thing ever,\u201d he said.",
      "Hauldren, 26, has a similar opinion when it comes to Crow-Armstrong\u2019s baseball team. Hauldren is the youngest of four siblings in a White Sox family from suburban Chicago. He grew up going to White Sox games on the South Side.",
      "But he was always a Cubs fan.",
      "\u201cIt just kind of stuck, and a lot of my friends were Cubs fans, too,\u201d he said. \u201cSo thankfully my dad would suck up his pride or whatever you would call it and take me to a Cubs game every once in a while.\u201d",
      "The beginning of Levity goes back to Hauldren and Carberry connecting at the University of Iowa in 2017. They met Josh Tarum through mutual friends, and they started making music together.",
      "Hauldren and Carberry live in Chicago, and Hauldren worked on much of \u201cFront to Back\u201d at their place in Bucktown \u2014 not far from Wrigley Field.",
      "\u201cMy window is the skyline of Chicago and stuff,\u201d Hauldren said. \u201cAnd so seeing that song get played at Wrigley Field when it was made watching the skyline of Chicago and being very close to Wrigley Field was just insane to me.\u201d",
      "After Crow-Armstrong used the song as his walkup music, Hauldren posted on Instagram about how much it meant to him. He tagged Crow-Armstrong in the post, and the two talked. They are hoping to meet up at some point.",
      "Levity played Coachella this year, and it is going to Lollapalooza this summer in Chicago's Grant Park. But Hauldren said his connection with Crow-Armstrong ranks right up there when it comes to his most memorable experiences with his group.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just very happy that if someone ever plays a walkout song for us, that it was the Cubs,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I couldn\u2019t be happier that, you know, of all the teams that it was my team.\u201d",

      "Black style will have its moment as the biggest night in fashion gets underway",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Fashion icons like Dapper Dan, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and the late Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley are known for their distinctive approaches to sartorial style \u2014 bold splashes of color, luxurious fabrics, playful construction, capes \u2014 but fashion savants and historians agree that a common thread weaves their tailored looks together: dandyism.",
      "The history-laden style movement will be front and center as part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute spring exhibit, \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,\u201d kicking off with the biggest night in fashion, Monday's Met Gala.",
      "Inspired by Monica Miller\u2019s book \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,\u201d the exhibit focuses on Black style and specifically menswear from the 18th century to present day, with dandyism as a unifying theme.",
      "Once used to describe the aristocratic style and leisurely pursuits of figures like Regency England's Beau Brummell, dandyism has been recontextualized over the years to embody liberation and resistance through exuberant self-expression.",
      "This evolution of the term began with the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Miller, guest curator of the Met exhibit, writes how, in the 18th century, young, dandified Black servants in England were forced to wear gold, brass or silver collars with padlocks and fine livery \u2014 uniforms for slaves and servants \u2014 that signaled their owners' wealth.",
      "\u201cThey wanted the enslaved person to stand out almost as if they were a luxury item,\u201d said Jonathan Square, Parsons School of Design assistant professor and one of the advisers on the Met exhibit.",
      "Slaves arrived in America with few or no belongings. What they had left, they treasured, be it beads or small precious objects, Miller writes.",
      "\u201cThis is as true for those who were deliberately dressed in silks and turbans, whose challenge was to inhabit the clothing in their own way, as for those who were more humbly attired, who used clothing as a process of remembrance and mode of distinction (and symbolic and sometimes actual escape from bondage) in their new environment,\u201d Miller explains in her book.",
      "Stripped of their identities, enslaved people often added their own flair to their tailored Sunday best looks for church or on holidays.",
      "Post-Emancipation, Black Americans had the chance to reclaim their autonomy and carve out new lives for themselves, paving the way for the Harlem Renaissance.",
      "Black Americans fled the South for cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and New York in a period dubbed the Great Migration. From the 1920s to the 1930s, New York's Harlem neighborhood became an influential and fertile landscape for Black cultural expression. From Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston to Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong, its prominent minds reshaped the fabric of American culture and challenged prejudiced beliefs.",
      "The Harlem Renaissance gave fashion a soul, said Brandice Daniel, founder of Harlem's Fashion Row, an agency that connects designers of color with retailers and brand opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt was this birthplace of this visual identity that spoke to what we now call Black excellence,\u201d she said.",
      "The renaissance meant living and dressing boldly for Black Americans, pushing past societal confines and making themselves visible. Adding their own twist on mainstream looks, women donned furs and beaded dresses while men experimented with tailored fabrics, pristine fedora hats, two-toned oxfords and billowing silhouettes.",
      "\u201cMany of us have a photo of our grandfather decked out with the suiting, but it\u2019s also the stance and the kind of posture and the assertion of presence,\u201d said Tara Donaldson, co-author of \u201cBlack In Fashion: 100 Years Of Style, Influence, and Culture.\u201d",
      "W.E.B. Du Bois, a pivotal figure of the era who often appeared in a three-piece suit, a frock coat and top hat, understood the power of self-fashioning, said Valerie Steele, director of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. At the 1900 Paris Exposition, Du Bois mounted a photographic exhibit centered on showcasing Black Americans\u2019 economic, social and cultural contributions to combat stereotypes.",
      "\u201cThat kind of self-fashioning is very much a way of reclaiming a sense of self-respect that had been denied by a society that aggressively was saying, \u2018No, no you can\u2019t have that,\u2019\u201d Steele said.",
      "One style that arose out of the Harlem Renaissance, directly linked to dandyism, was the zoot suit. The suit, defined by high-waisted draped pants and oversized jackets with exaggerated shoulders and large lapels, was subversive simply by taking up space. Because of fabric rations during World War II, owning a zoot suit, with its excessive use of fabric, was an act of protest, Square said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s meant to be a provocation,\u201d Square said. \u201cBut also, it\u2019s a form of protection, covering a part of your body, sort of saying, \u2018You don\u2019t have access to this.\u2019\u201d",
      "The style was quickly adopted by Mexican American and Filipino American men in Los Angeles. In 1943, servicemen and police officers attacked Black, Mexican and Filipino men in what was labeled the Zoot Suit Riots. The zoot suit lives on today in the gender-fluid designs of Willy Chavarria.",
      "Dandyism was not limited to men. Following World War I, women began breaking down fashion's gender norms. With her tuxedo and top hat, blues singer and entertainer Gladys Bentley epitomized how women in the Harlem Renaissance blurred gender lines and adopted more masculine styles of dress.",
      "Singer and actor Mon\u00e1e, who sits on this year\u2019s Met Gala\u2019s host committee, is not shy about standing out on a red carpet in her tailored, playful looks. Mon\u00e1e's distinct style and flourishes with oversized hats, whimsically tailored suits and ornate bow ties personify the dandy style.",
      "As Mon\u00e1e and the rest of the starry guest list arrive in their glamorous \u201cTailored for You\u201d looks, Monday will be a night to remember all the dandies who styled out before.",
      "\u201cBlack people, Black men are finally getting their flowers for being true style icons,\u201d said designer Ev Bravado, co-founder of Who Decides War. \u201cIt is amazing to see the ancestral work being put on display.\u201d",

      "In a career that has spanned Shakespeare and \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d T",
      "NEW YORK -- One of the toughest things about appearing on Broadway might not be the acting or the hours. It's squeezing your resume to under 100 words for your bio in Playbill. T.R. Knight tried to include all of it, initially.",
      "\u201cI was getting angry at myself for getting precious about what to include and what not to include,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, 'You are being ridiculous.'\u201d",
      "So instead of trying to fit in a career that has spanned Shakespeare and \u201cGrey's Anatomy,\u201d a David Mamet play and \u201c The Flight Attendant, \u201d Knight changed direction.",
      "\u201cThere once was an actor named Knight,\u201d his Playbill blurb now reads. \u201cWho knew his stage-left from stage-right/He went to do some TV/But now he's happy to be/Back in front of the glowing footlights.\u201d",
      "What has lured him back on Broadway is the jaw-dropping prequel to the Netflix hit show \u201cStranger Things,\u201d a play with levitating cats, shattered mirrors and Vegas showgirls.",
      "Set in Hawkins, Indiana, 20 years before the events of the first season, \u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow\u201d focuses on the creation of a monster, the villainous Vecna, played by \u2014 Louis McCartney. Knight portrays his father.",
      "We are introduced to a shy, awkward teen Henry Creel \u2014 who later will be Vecna \u2014 as he moves to Hawkins and goes to high school. He has strange powers and worries a lot.",
      "His father is not in a great place, suffering from PTSD and drinking too much. \u201cI think he desperately wants to be a good husband and a good father, and I think he knows that he is failing at both,\u201d says Knight. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the tools to stop it.\u201d",
      "Knight was a \u201cStranger Things\u201d fan even before he joined the play, looking forward to every season. He was asked to audition for a different character but was drawn to the father after reading the script.",
      "\u201cAlthough our damage is different, I felt that I understood that damage in a way that I did not understand this other character,\u201d he says. \u201cI just felt it strong enough in my gut that it felt like it could be a better match.\u201d",
      "\u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow\u201d co-director Justin Martin says Knight is constantly changing his approach and always surprising, calling him a \u201cRenaissance man in terms of his acting\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always about the work. He\u2019s very much interested in very, very different characters and different styles of acting. And so he constantly is pushing himself. Every time he does the scene it\u2019s slightly different,\u201d says Martin. \u201cHe\u2019s going, \u2018What else can I find? What else could I mine?\u2019 which I love in an actor.\u201d",
      "The \u201cStranger Things\u201d play was also attractive to Knight because of its director: Stephen Daldry, the three-time Tony Award-winner who helmed \u201cBilly Elliot: The Musical.\u201d",
      "Knight recalls being blown away by the way Daldry told the story without sentimentality of an 11-year-old boy who just wants to dance.",
      "\u201cThe way he was able to distill that down in such a brutally beautiful, honest way left me \u2014 when I left that theater \u2014 I remember being both empty and filled up at the same time if that\u2019s possible.\u201d",
      "Knight and his husband have moved back to the New York area after years in Los Angeles, wanting to do more theater, something he calls \u201chome.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still so challenging, still immensely challenging, maddeningly challenging to me \u2014 theater \u2014 but I love it,\u201d he says. \u201cI just missed it.\u201d",
      "Knight grew up in Minneapolis and spent two years at the city\u2019s storied Guthrie Theater before moving to New York at 25. He became a household name in the hit ABC medical drama \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d which he left after five seasons.",
      "He feels like a new chapter is opening, one with confidence and maturity. The move coincides with a change in his creative work and life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time and maybe it\u2019s a time where I can let go of a lot of the nonsense that I have maybe worried about \u2014 maybe? Do you like the way I said, maybe worried about in the past? The nonsense has kind of plagued me.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In 2019, David Corenswet gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly where he said his \u201cpie in the sky ambition\u201d was to play Superman",
      "In true Clark Kent form, the new Superman would like to correct the record.",
      "David Corenswet gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly in 2019 where he said his \u201cpie in the sky ambition\u201d was to play Superman.",
      "At that point, the role was not on the market. And Corenswet, a Julliard graduate and Philadelphia native, was just making a name for himself in the industry, with plum breakout roles in two Ryan Murphy Netflix series: \u201cThe Politician\u201d and \u201cHollywood.\u201d Tall, dark, and you know, handsome, people had told him that he looked like Superman for a long time. He did not, he told The Associated Press in a recent interview, think that he was going to get the chance to play him.",
      "But a few years later he was actually cast to lead James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d which will begin a new, hopefully high-flying, era for the DC universe of films when it hits theaters on July 11. And that once innocent quote took on a life of its own. Many headlines and stories misinterpreted the phrase and wrote that he said it was his dream role, as though he'd manifested it into existence.",
      "\u201cI said it was my pie in the sky ambition, which I meant to mean that there was no (expletive) way it was ever going to happen,\u201d Corenswet, 31, said. \u201cI sort of was thinking of it as, \u2018Oh, who wouldn\u2019t love to get to play an iconic role like that? Wouldn\u2019t it be amazing and impossible if we lived in a universe where that could even be considered?\u2019\u201d",
      "Right around the time when Gunn was starting to think about casting his new Superman movie, he decided to watch his friend Ti West\u2019s movie \u201cPearl.\u201d In that darkly comedic horror, Corenswet stood out to him as an interesting and charismatic presence. He played a projectionist at a local movie theater who catches Pearl\u2019s attention (and, later, faces her wrath). West had nice things to say about him too.",
      "\u201cDavid was one of the very first auditions that I got,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cInstantly, it was a relief because he had a playful charm about him that was not evident in \u2018Pearl.' He had a sense of humor. That made me go, \u2018Ooh, this might be a really good match.\u2019\u201d",
      "That was just the beginning of the long casting process. Even Nicholas Hoult, who was ultimately cast as Lex Luthor, was up for the part. And though it was \u201cextensive,\u201d Corenswet said it was one of the most \u201csatisfying audition processes\u201d he\u2019s ever gone through \u2014 not because he booked the role, but because he felt he got the opportunity to show them what he had to offer.",
      "Gunn laughed that Corenswet actually has a lot of Superman in him.",
      "\u201cSuperman is a square and David is a square,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cHe listens to American Songbook. Like Dean Martin and Cole Porter. That\u2019s what he listens to on his iPad. That\u2019s weird. But oh, so Superman.\u201d",
      "When Gunn called him with the good news, the first person he told was his wife. The second was his sister, who couldn\u2019t pick up the phone because she was on a golf course.",
      "\u201cShe texted, \u2018Is it possible that was a phone call with super good news?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018Yes. Super good news.\u2019\u201d",
      "It may be something of a Superman tradition to try on your predecessor\u2019s costume during a screen test. Henry Cavill did it with Christopher Reeve\u2019s, and Corenswet did it with Cavill\u2019s, which he called a \u201cmarvel of engineering.\u201d",
      "But the first time Corenswet put on his own Superman costume was not some magical, transportive moment. In fact, he said, it was \u201cwonderfully mundane.\u201d The suit was still in its beginning stages, not totally put together and even a little small, as he\u2019d already started putting on weight for the role.",
      "\u201cI remember the feeling of kind of growing into the suit and the suit growing around me fitting by fitting,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cWe had such an amazing costume team and they built the suit around me over the course of many weeks and months and it started to feel just a little bit like home for me.\u201d",
      "The first time he felt the impact of it was through the eyes of other people. To him, it was old hat, but when he walked onto set the first time in the suit he noticed something different from the cast and crew.",
      "\u201cI saw their faces sort of light up and I went, \u2018Wait a minute, these people aren\u2019t that fond of me,\u2019\u201d he laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s when it hits you.\u201d",
      "There are almost three roles involved in playing Superman. There\u2019s the person he is with his parents and the people he grew up with. There\u2019s Clark Kent of the Daily Planet. And then there\u2019s Superman.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a public facing character, he\u2019s a symbol,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cThere\u2019s a presentational element to it, because he does want to present an image of calm and authority. While he doesn\u2019t always feel that way, he always wants to make other people feel that way as Superman.\u201d",
      "To prepare for Clark Kent, Corenswet looked at the All-Star Superman comic and how Christopher Reeve changed his posture when Lois left the room, but he also drew inspiration for the voice and demeanor way outside of the canon: His brother-in-law, who is 6\u20198\u201d and 270 pounds, but is the \u201cquietest, most wonderful man.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s where I sort of took the spirit of Clark,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cHe\u2019s this big presence, but he\u2019s desperately trying to be as small as possible and as quiet as possible.\u201d",
      "Gunn has promised that the film is \u201ca personal journey for Superman that\u2019s entirely new.\u201d He\u2019s a character who is \u201cpretty damn good, but flawed.\u201d And anyone who has seen the trailer knows there will be romance with Rachel Brosnahan\u2019s Lois Lane \u2014 but there\u2019s even a different spin on that.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s in love with her,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cShe\u2019s the one that needs the convincing in the relationship. It\u2019s not him. You really see where he needs her in his life.\u201d",
      "Corenswet said that in addition to the action and thrills, the movie also has a Preston Sturges quality to it with \u201clonging romance and witty comedy.\u201d Fitting for their reporter characters, \u201cHis Girl Friday\u201d was also a big reference with \u201cthe rhythm, the patter and the feeling of two people in love who really are an equal match for the other.\u201d",
      "The movie is the start of a new era for DC films, and will raise Corenswet\u2019s profile immeasurably. He\u2019s been in big movies before, including \u201cTwisters.\u201d But being Superman is different.",
      "\u201cThe thing that it changed about my life immediately was that I had this amazing mission that I got to go on of playing the part and getting to be a piece of making this awesome film,\u201d he said. \"I have so many new friends now. James brings together such a familial cast and crew. And shooting the film is sort of like an extended summer camp.\u201d",
      "Adding to the summer camp vibes: On the last day they even gathered to watch a little blooper reel that Gunn had put together. But what will happen come release is not really something he can fathom at this point.",
      "\u201cI expect some things will change when the film comes out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know, one still has to wake up and eat breakfast.\u201d",

      "Think \u201cThe Bear,\u201d translated to Napoleonic-era France",
      "He\u2019s a dream in the kitchen \u2014 and elsewhere in the house. He makes a mean cream-puff tower. And he\u2019s got moves like Jagger.",
      "Alas, Antonin Car\u00eame has been dead since the 1830s, but nobody\u2019s perfect, right?",
      "Most people have heard of Napoleon, but not many are familiar \u2014 even in France \u2014 with the story of this chef who cooked for him and his contemporaries, rising from a poor kitchen boy to become a standard-bearer of French cuisine. Now a new Apple TV+ period drama, \u201cCar\u00eame,\u201d argues that he was the very first celebrity chef. There's even a \u201cTop Chef\u201d style cooking contest in front of a panel of judges.",
      "But for the vibe, think \u201cThe Bear,\u201d set in post-revolutionary Paris. Car\u00eame even directs his staff at one point to say \u201cOui, chef.\u201d (And we could totally imagine him, like Jeremy Allen White, in a Calvin Klein underwear ad, if those had existed back then.)",
      "The series, which drops its first two episodes Wednesday, also shows how Car\u00eame wasn\u2019t just a cook, or master pastry maker, or, well, sex god. We watch as he's pulled into political intrigue by his boss, the cunning diplomat Talleyrand, and used as a spy.",
      "Still, his goal was to be the best chef in the world. The show\u2019s first season ends with an extraordinary outdoor coronation banquet that Car\u00eame creates for thousands of people. When he places, in triumph, a tall white chef\u2019s hat on his head for the first time, it's as if he's crowning himself \u2014 and marking his ascent to celebrity.",
      "Benjamin Voisin, who's in virtually every scene, plays Car\u00eame with a scruffy head of hair, a gold earring and a bad-boy swagger that's consciously based on Mick Jagger, circa \u201970s.",
      "Director Martin Bourboulon says the choice for the role was obvious once Voisin walked into the audition room.",
      "\u201cWhen you find the right actor for the right part, 80% of the job is done,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were very impressed with his youthful attitude but also his rock \u2018n\u2019 roll attitude. He is absolutely Car\u00eame in real life \u2014 very attractive for everyone, a young man who is maybe sometimes a bit insouciant, or careless. \u201c",
      "Perhaps not surprisingly, the show plays up the sex factor. The first scene sets the tone with Car\u00eame and his lover, Henriette, in a food-tasting session that morphs immediately into sex, but then duty calls: Napoleon\u2019s soldiers are coming for dinner.",
      "Bourboulon says that first scene was very intentional, establishing in a few minutes the three main themes of the series: food, sex and politics. Did we mention sex?",
      "Of course, he wasn\u2019t an accomplished chef, so Voisin was given intensive lessons.",
      "\u201cI spent two months in the kitchen to learn the customs of the great French tradition,\u201d the actor says. He focused on learning how to realistically convey what Car\u00eame did best: invent dishes of wild whimsy, especially flamboyant dessert creations like a huge pyramid, or the \u201ccroquembouche\u201d tower \u2014 a cascade of cream puffs. Car\u00eame is also known for inventing the vol-au-vent, an airy French pastry shell.",
      "But even so, this master pastry maker can't even chop an onion correctly when he arrives for work at his first big kitchen job. The job of teaching him falls to the talented sous-chef in Talleyrand's kitchen, Agathe (Alice Da Luz).",
      "Da Luz trained alongside Voisin on the kitchen brigade at the Ferrandi culinary school in Paris \u2014 and vastly improved her skill set. \u201cWe really learned the choreography of a kitchen, we really learned technique,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd today I can boast that I cut onions at a crazy speed.\u201d",
      "The actors had a dream workspace: The production spent six weeks building a huge, airy kitchen where they work for Talleyrand \u2014 unlike the cramped, smoky kitchens that would be more historically accurate.",
      "Viewers may feel the need to brush up on their history. The show takes place shortly after Napoleon seized political power in 1799 and became first consul, on his way to later declaring himself emperor.",
      "The actors had to brush up, too.",
      "Voisin says he knew about \u201cthe victories and defeats of Bonaparte,\u201d but had to learn from scratch the story of Car\u00eame.",
      "Lyna Khoudri, who plays mysterious Henriette \u2014 who may or may not be on her lover\u2019s side \u2014 notes: \u201cWe\u2019re making a series about the heritage of French culinary art, a story I didn\u2019t know. I found out why we\u2019re so famous for our cuisine in France.\u201d",
      "Da Luz had studied the period at school but dove into it more deeply once she was cast. There was not a lot to read about Agathe, but she read everything she could find. And then, she says, \u201cI let my imagination go,\u201d inspired to bring a woman out of the shadows of history.",
      "J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier, who plays Talleyrand (actual name Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord), also engaged in extensive research. \u201cIt\u2019s a character who has led a thousand lives,\u201d he said, \u201cwho lived through almost a century of history, at a time when people were guillotined for not much. So ... he must have been very clever.\u201d",
      "The show, for Renier, is in large part about ambition. \u201cAll these characters have a goal, a dream to achieve,\u201d he says. \u201cThe question is, what are we ready to win or lose to achieve this dream?\u201d",
      "The production is lush throughout the whole season, beginning with the gorgeous country homes \u2014 filmmakers scouted 60 of them, and chose 12. They created new dinner services to dress the tables, and made 3,000 candles to light all the candelabras \u2014 different hues for different rooms. There were 96 vases of fresh flowers at all times in Talleyrand\u2019s home, according to production notes.",
      "As for costumes, some 1,000 of them were made from scratch, because the filmmakers had a specific vision of clothing that was not period-accurate but also not completely modern.",
      "Then there was that crazy banquet that ends the season. Filming at the Parc de Saint-Cloud, which boasts dramatic fountains, the production created a giant tent covered with \u201can extraordinary amount of velvet,\u201d and loaded down the tables with food, including a 60 kilo (132 pound) leg of lamb and a 50 kilo (110-pound) tuna.",
      "They also made 5,000 cream puffs, which were assembled into grand, towering structures \u2014 befitting not only a new emperor but the world\u2019s first celebrity chef.",

      "The film and book were based on the holiday-anti-war classic, \u201cHappy Xmas (War Is Over),\u201d that Ono's parents released in 1971. Sean was born to John Lennon and Yoko Ono four years later.",
      "\u201cThe tale of our pigeon felt like it needed to be put into an illustrated book,\u201d Sean Lennon said in a statement. \u201cOur wish is that parents will be able to share this story with their kids. War is a difficult subject, and we hope this book will serve as a conversation starter for families and friends.\u201d",
      "The book is written by Sean Lennon, \u201cWar Is Over!\u201d writer-director Dave Mullins and producer Brad Booker. The illustrations are by Max Narciso.",

      "Tardy photographers",
      "NEW YORK -- Like all brides, Elana Goldin had high hopes for her wedding photos and video.",
      "\u201cI loved their images,\u201d she said of the company picked by her dad and future mother-in-law. \u201cThey were award-winning. They were in a ton of magazines. I really liked the vibe of the owner.\u201d",
      "The feeling didn't last.",
      "The photographer, who showed up 45 minutes late with a team of two, wasn't the owner, as the company had promised. She was someone Goldin had never spoken to. The fill-in had a bad attitude from the start, said Goldin, who lives in Chicago and got married last May in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.",
      "Among other things, the photographer criticized Goldin's bridal shoes, jewelry and perfume as second rate for traditional close-up shots, and she picked apart the bouquets without permission to get images before the ceremony.",
      "\u201cShe and the florist got into a fight. There was friction from the moment she walked in,\u201d Goldin said.",
      "Looking back, Goldin said she would have done a few things differently.",
      "We asked wedding planners and photographers to also weigh in on how they think photo disaster can be averted.",
      "Goldin wishes she had been more assertive. She had provided a shotlist ahead of time, but the photographer assigned to the bride and bridesmaids started making demands on where she wanted Goldin to pose.",
      "\u201cI'm in my dress and she said let\u2019s take a picture in the shower, because it was a very big, glamorous shower. My sister was like, absolutely not. Not happening,\u201d Goldin recalled.",
      "At the venue, the photographer insisted on taking photos outside. The weather was rainy and windy, and the lighting was dreary.",
      "\u201cIt was disgusting outside. My dress got all dirty at the bottom. My hair starts frizzing. The bridesmaids came out and our hair was blowing everywhere. The pictures were awful,\u201d Goldin said.",
      "You love them dearly. But New Jersey-based wedding planner Danielle Rothweiler of Rothweiler Event Design advises against it.",
      "\u201cI always tell my couples, stop hiring your friends and family because if something goes wrong, think of that conversation that you\u2019re going to have. No one wants that,\u201d she said.",
      "One client took up an uncle on his offer to shoot her wedding as his gift. He missed half the shots and didn't understand the importance of timing. He also spent a good amount of time just being a guest and not taking pictures at all.",
      "\u201cShe never said anything. The pictures weren't great,\u201d Rothweiler said. \u201cI have a wedding coming up this year and half the vendor list is friends and family and I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m so scared about it.\u201d",
      "Michelle Jackson, who owns the photo vendor Bambino International based in Cincinnati, Ohio, said some basic questions about equipment can go a long way.",
      "Make sure your photographers have back up camera bodies and other crucial equipment of the same quality as their primary gear, she said. Cameras with dual slots for SD cards or XQD cards are optimal.",
      "\u201cEverything's being copied onto two cards,\u201d she said. \u201cThe worst disaster for a photographer is you have no pictures at all because of equipment failure. Couples don't think about that.\u201d",
      "In the same vein, San Francisco wedding photographer Oscar Urizar, the proprietor of Red Eye Collection in San Francisco, said couples should ensure they have the rights to personal use of their photos. That allows them to print, share and display them for non-commercial purposes.",
      "\u201cI started in the film industry. If you didn\u2019t get your negatives, you couldn\u2019t print your photos. It's kind of that same thinking,\u201d he said.",
      "There's nothing more chaotic than organizing group shots at weddings. The larger the wedding, the more chaotic it can be.",
      "Wedding planner Tirusha Dave, founder of the luxury market Bravura Brides, serves South Asian couples around the world with guest lists up to 300 or more.",
      "She puts together a shareable document and asks couples to list every person expected in each group shot, but she doesn't stop there. She has them designate one person to serve as wrangler. The wrangler must know every person in the group by sight so they can be chased down if necessary.",
      "\u201cI tell my couples, I\u2019m really great at what I do but I don't know your second cousins, your extended aunts and uncles,\u201d Dave said.",
      "Each group is assigned a number that's announced when it's time to gather.",
      "Dallas-area photographer April Pinto, founder and co-owner of April Pinto Photography, has a stable of shooters. They can juggle up to four weddings a week.",
      "They sink or swim by how well the timeline is observed. Not an easy task, Pinto said, \u201cwhen you have a coordinator timing you and the mother of the groom who wasn\u2019t on the Zoom call making her own agenda and stressing out the bride. We're in the middle of all of that.\u201d",
      "But that's just part of the challenge. The other part?",
      "The rowdy bridesmaid, Pinto said. She's somebody who might have had a bit too much Champagne and feels like she should be in charge.",
      "\u201cIf a bridesmaid is feeling a little too spicy, we try to give her tasks,\u201d Pinto said. \u201cI find that keeping people in general engaged and involved can go a long way. You can turn all that stress into a happy time.\u201d",

      "Superman already has a lot on his shoulders",
      "Superman already has a lot on his shoulders. It seems unfair to add the fate of the summer movie season to his list. But he's not alone \u2014 Marvel Studios is also returning to theaters in a big way with two movies this summer, \u201cThunderbolts\u201d and \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps.\u201d",
      "Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic brought the movie business to a halt, and two years after the strikes, the industry has yet to fully recover. Critics may have complained of superhero fatigue, but after several summers of depleted offerings, it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re a vital part of the mix.",
      "Superheroes alone don't make for a healthy marketplace, however, and this year studios have set a full slate for every kind of moviegoer, with over 40 wide releases spanning genres.",
      "\u201cThis is the summer where all this product that we\u2019ve all been working on for the last few years is finally coming into the marketplace, so I\u2019m very optimistic,\u201d says Joseph Kosinski, who directed \u201cF1\u201d with Brad Pitt.",
      "Summer begins early in Hollywood, on the first weekend in May and that kick-off can make or break that pivotal 123 day corridor that has historically accounted for around 40% of the annual box office.",
      "After the strikes upended the 2024 summer calendar, this year Disney is back in that familiar first weekend spot with \u201cThunderbolts.\" Memorial Day weekend could also be a behemoth with the live action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning.\" With a new \u201cJurassic World,\u201d a live action \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d and the Formula One movie also on the schedule through June and July, the summer season has the potential to be the biggest in the post-COVID era.",
      "There are also family pics (\u201cSmurfs,\u201d \u201cElio\"); action and adventures (\u201cBallerina,\u201d \u201cThe Karate Kid: Legends\u201d); horrors, thrillers and slashers (\u201c28 Years Later,\u201d \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer,\u201d \u201cM3GAN 2.0\"); romances (\u201cMaterialists,\u201d \u201cJane Austen Wrecked My Life\u201d); dramas (\u201cSorry, Baby,\u201d \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d); a new Wes Anderson movie (\u201cThe Phonecian Scheme\u201d); and comedies (\u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d \u201cBride Hard,\u201d \u201cThe Naked Gun\u201d).",

It\u2019s taking a very real person and putting them in the middle of this outrageous situation and outrageous world and playing with that. I think it\u2019s a lot of fun because of that.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s working on an incredibly large scale in terms of world building, but it\u2019s also no different from all of the great comedies and dramas that I\u2019ve done,\u201d says \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d director Matt Shakman. \u201cIn the end, it comes down to character, it comes down to relationships, it comes down to heart and humor.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople say, like, do you feel pressure and the most pressure I feel is from myself as a fan and to Steven Spielberg, to not disappoint him,\" says \u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d director Gareth Edwards. \u201cWeirdly what\u2019s great about doing a Jurassic movie is that everybody knows deep down that like half the reason they\u2019re in this business is because of that film and Steven\u2019s work.\u201d",
      "Before the pandemic, all but one summer since 2007 broke the $4 billion mark. Since 2020, only one has: 2023, led by \u201cBarbie.\u201d",
      "The unstable economy might work in the industry\u2019s favor, at least when it comes to moviegoing. Even with increased ticket prices, theatrical movies remain the most affordable entertainment outside of the home and attendance tends to increase during recession years. The annual domestic box office crossed $10 billion for the first time in 2009.",
      "\u201cBy the end of this summer, hopefully people aren\u2019t talking about being in a funk anymore and it feels like we got our mojo back and we\u2019re off to the races,\" Kosinski, who directed the pandemic-era hit \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d says.",

      "The first of three accusers involved in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape retrial has taken the witness stand",
      "NEW YORK -- When Harvey Weinstein' s landmark 2020 #MeToo conviction was overturned, accuser Miriam Haley was frank about her feelings about participating in a retrial: \u201cI definitely don\u2019t want to actually go through that again.\u201d",
      "But on Tuesday, Haley became the first of the former movie tycoon\u2019s accusers to take the witness stand as prosecutors seek to convict him again. Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "As Haley started what are expected to be multiple days of testimony, she walked quickly to the witness stand without looking at Weinstein. The ex-studio boss, sitting between his lawyers, looked at her as she passed by and again when prosecutors asked her to identify him from the stand.",
      "Haley told the jury that when she went to meet Weinstein on the sidelines of the 2006 Cannes film festival, all she wanted was work.",
      "But Weinstein commented on her legs, asked for a massage and, when she balked, asked her to give him one, she recalled.",
      "\u201cDid you have any interest whatsoever in the defendant, Harvey Weinstein, romantically or sexually?\u201d prosecutor Nicole Blumberg asked Haley, 48.",
      "\u201cNo, I did not, and I was there to try and find work,\u201d said Haley, who\u2019d been an assistant to another producer.",
      "Her testimony so far closely echoes what she told the prior jury, though she hasn't yet gotten to the July 2006 date when she has said Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her. She recounted earlier interactions with Weinstein that alternated between being personally off-putting and professionally encouraging for her.",
      "Haley said she left the Cannes meeting crying and feeling humiliated. But she accepted when Weinstein arranged a basic assistant job for her on his company's reality show \u201cProject Runway\u201d in June 2006.",
      "After the roughly three-week gig ended and Haley thanked him by email, Weinstein communicated that he'd heard good things about her work and invited her to meet at a Manhattan hotel lobby, she said as prosecutors displayed her 2006 calendar with the meeting noted.",
      "She and Weinstein talked business, and he was \u201cvery respectful and quite charming\u201d and talked about other potential job opportunities, she recalled.",
      "\u201cWere you flirty or suggesting anything sexual between you and the defendant at that meeting?\" the prosecutor asked.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Haley replied.",
      "She said another meeting in Weinstein's office also went pleasantly and professionally, and so did a ride with him, his assistant and his driver back to her apartment \u2014 and then the Hollywood honcho suddenly suggested she accompany him to Paris fashion shows.",
      "Haley said she had no interest in going but gave a vague response, \u201ctrying to be polite.\u201d They said goodbye.",
      "Yet Weinstein repeatedly asked her to come to Paris with him for fashion shows, even showing up uninvited and barging into her apartment to try to persuade her, she said.",
      "Haley told jurors she again declined, but Weinstein was \u201cinsistent and overwhelming,\u201d so she told him: \u201cI heard about your reputation with women.\u201d",
      "Weinstein took a step back, seeming offended, and quizzed her about what she meant, she recalled. She told jurors she actually hadn't heard much about Weinstein at that point but was just trying to avoid the Paris trip.",
      "Eventually, Weinstein left the apartment and backed off, she said.",
      "Almost two decades later, a series of sexual assault and sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein would energize the #MeToo movement's demands to hold powerful men accountable for misconduct toward women.",
      "Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, is expected to continue testifying Wednesday.",
      "The retrial is happening because New York's highest court found the original trial was tainted by \u201cegregious\u201d judicial rulings and prejudicial testimony.",
      "The retrial includes charges based on allegations from Haley and another accuser from the original trial, Jessica Mann, who was once an aspiring actor. She alleges that Weinstein raped her in 2013.",
      "He\u2019s also being tried, for the first time, on an allegation of forcing oral sex on former model Kaja Sokola in 2006. Her claim wasn't part of the first trial.",
      "Mann and Sokola also are expected to testify at some point.",
      "Weinstein's attorneys have argued that all three accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting work in show business.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they give permission for their names to be used. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.",

      "The annual AFI Life Achievement Award presentation is always a starry night in Hollywood, but Saturday\u2019s ceremony at the Dolby Theatre brought together legendary stars from a seemingly bygone era of cinema to honor Francis Ford Coppola",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Steven Spielberg proclaimed \u201cThe Godfather\u201d the \u201cgreatest American film ever made,\u201d Robert De Niro teasingly bemoaned being cast in the sequel and not the original and Harrison Ford fought back tears reflecting on his role in the 1974 film, \u201cThe Conversation.\u201d",
      "At the center of it all was Francis Ford Coppola, who on Saturday received the AFI Life Achievement Award at a ceremony at Dolby Theatre that brought together legendary stars from a seemingly bygone era of cinema,",
      "A founding AFI trustee, Coppola\u2019s recognition from the organization was a kind of full circle moment for the \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d director.",
      "\u201cWhen I was a kid there was the Oscars and that was it. Now they\u2019re going to have an award show for the best award show,\u201d the 86-year-old said on the red carpet ahead of the show. \u201cBut this is a little different because it\u2019s a personal recognition of the people that you\u2019ve known all your life and your colleagues over many years, so it\u2019s like a homecoming in a way.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou, sir, are peerless. You have taken what came before and redefined the canon of American film,\u201d Spielberg said.",
      "Coppola sat between Spielberg and George Lucas, as actors and fellow filmmakers like Spike Lee, Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino and Morgan Freeman took turns gushing over the Oscar winner.",
      "\u201cDreamer of dreams on a dime, teller of tales that cost and lost millions. But tonight, (expletive) the bankers and the bank,\u201d Freeman said to laughs and cheers.",
      "Lucas, Coppola\u2019s longtime friend and colleague, presented him with the award. The pair have known each other for decades and cofounded their own production company, American Zoetrope, in 1969.",
      "\u201cYou rounded up a bunch of young film students, gathered us together. We moved to San Francisco, hoping to beat the system. And we did. Like the filmmakers from the dawn of the art form, we had no rules. We wrote them, and you were holding the pen,\u201d Lucas said.",
      "Coppola was mostly stoic throughout the ceremony as Hollywood sang his praises \u2014 until he accepted the award at the end of the night. He beamed as he approached the stage and thanked the room, which was filled with some of his family members as well as multigenerational A-listers.",
      "\u201cNow I understand here, this place that created me, my home, isn\u2019t really a place at all, but you \u2014 friends, colleagues, teachers, playmates, family, neighbors, all the beautiful faces are welcoming me back,\u201d he said. \u201cI am and will always be nothing more than one of you.\u201d",
      "Coppola was the 50th recipient of the award first handed out to John Ford in 1973.",
      "Guests were served wine from the Francis Ford Coppola Winery and after dinner \u2014 true to his Italian heritage \u2014 a trio of cannolis. Actors who have worked with Coppola painted a unified picture of him as a director, reminiscing on how they were invited to participate and educated about film in a way that empowered them.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very professorial. He talks about history and things and even older movies in the scene he\u2019s inspired by,\u201d said \u201cThe Godfather III\u201d star Andy Garcia. \u201cYou go into working with him in a movie, and you go in seeking an associate\u2019s degree and you would walk out with a master\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Coppola last year released his long-in development \u201cMegalopolis,\u201d a Roman epic set in a modern New York. The film drew mixed reviews from critics and flopped with audiences. Coppola, though, has maintained he was compelled to make \u201cMegalopolis\u201d as an artist, not as a businessman. He self-financed the film.",
      "\u201cFor a year in our culture when the importance of the arts is minimized, and our industry is seemingly out in the open that the only metric to judge a film\u2019s success is by how much money it makes, I hang on to individuals like Francis for inspiration, who live through their convictions,\u201d said Adam Driver, who starred in the film.",
      "Last year\u2019s AFI honoree was Nicole Kidman. Other recent recipients include John Williams, Mel Brooks, Denzel Washington and Julie Andrews.",

      "The Vietnam War produced some of the most classic films of the late 1970s and 1980s",
      "\u201cMe love you long time,\u201d a Vietnamese sex worker tells the U.S. troops, swiveling her hips as she hawks her services. \u201cYou party?\u201d The first female character in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Vietnam War classic \u201cFull Metal Jacket,\u201d she appears for just a moment \u2014 and halfway through the film.",
      "Likewise, it\u2019s an hour into Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d when a helicopter suddenly deposits three women onto a stage. They're scantily clad Playboy Bunnies, choppered in to rile up the troops. They, too, appear for just a few minutes.",
      "The Vietnam War produced some of the most unforgettable films of the late 1970s and 1980s, as top Hollywood filmmakers like Kubrick, Coppola, Oliver Stone and others grappled with its painful legacy. Few, however, had classic, or even three-dimensional, female characters \u2014 with the notable exception of \u201cComing Home,\u201d which won Jane Fonda an Oscar.",
      "But while these films were almost exclusively about how war dehumanized men \u2014 with female characters mere devices to tell that story \u2014 the opposite was often true of Vietnamese films about the conflict. Many of these were told from a female viewpoint \u2014 the stories of brave and loyal women, for example, left to hold families together.",
      "Here are some ways that classic Vietnam War films used female characters to tell their stories:",
      "Michael Cimino\u2019s multi-Oscar-winning \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d focuses on three lifelong buddies from a Pennsylvania steel town who go off to fight, with traumatic results.",
      "Since the 1978 drama starts and ends at home, there\u2019s room for a female character in Meryl Streep\u2019s Linda, girlfriend of Nick (Christopher Walken) who also connects with Michael (Robert De Niro). An early-career Streep was such a magnetic presence as Linda \u2014 earning an Oscar nomination \u2014 that it disguised a fairly thin role that mainly advanced the men's narrative.",
      "A rare contrast was Hal Ashby\u2019s \u201cComing Home\u201d the same year, in which Fonda and Jon Voight both won Oscars for the tale of a Marine wife embroiled in an intense affair with a wounded veteran at the rehab center where she volunteers.",
      "\u201cThis is the only Hollywood film set during the Vietnam War that\u2019s told from the point of view of a female character,\u201d says filmmaker Tony Bui, who also teaches Vietnam War cinema at Columbia University. \u201cThat's really saying something.\u201d",
      "Its tortured journey to the screen is a drama in itself, but 1979's \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d with Martin Sheen as an army captain tasked with assassinating a renegade U.S. colonel (Marlon Brando), is considered a masterpiece of the genre. As in many Hollywood Vietnam films, women are extras in villages, screaming and running from gunfire and deadly explosions \u2014 or killed brutally for no reason at all.",
      "Then there are the Playboy Bunnies, who gyrate to \u201cSuzy Q\u201d as the troops become increasingly frenzied with erotic excitement and eventually storm the stage.",
      "Lan Duong, assistant professor of cinema studies at the University of Southern California, sees Coppola trying to make a connection between sex, warfare and masculinity.",
      "\u201cWith American white women in particular, they\u2019re seen as part of the American mythology around manhood,\u201d Duong says. Full-blooded manhood with raging hormones, she says, is \u201cas American as apple pie.\u201d",
      "In 1986's \u201cPlatoon,\u201d Stone's Oscar-winning depiction of jungle warfare, representation of women comes in a horrific scene in which U.S. troops kills hundreds of innocent villagers, evoking the real-life My Lai massacre. During the slaughter, idealistic soldier Chris (Charlie Sheen) comes upon soldiers raping young women. \u201cShe\u2019s a human being!\u201d he screams. They reply: \u201cYou don\u2019t belong in \u2019Nam, man.\u201d",
      "These women are given no voice. They appear \u201conly in relation to the violence inflicted by men,\u201d Bui says.",
      "In Brian de Palma\u2019s \u201cCasualties of War\u201d (1989), the tragic rape victim actually becomes a central character in the plot. This does not mean, however, that we learn much of anything about this Vietnamese girl (Thuy Thu Le).",
      "Based on a real event, the film follows five soldiers whose leader (Sean Penn) devises a sickening plan: The group will kidnap a young girl for \u201crecreation\u201d during a mission.",
      "Only Pvt. Eriksson (Michael J. Fox) objects. The four others not only rape the girl, but eventually pump her with bullets. Eriksson takes the case to superiors, who advise him to drop it. But Eriksson persists, and the men earn punishment.",
      "Though important, this brutalized girl is again voiceless. \u201cShe goes from suffering, to suffering more, and then gets killed \u2014 that\u2019s her arc,\u201d says Bui, who includes the movie in a Criterion Channel collection he has curated on Vietnam films.",
      "Kubrick\u2019s memorable 1987 \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d contains two brief, stereotypical scenes involving sex workers. But the most interesting scene involving a female character comes during battle, where a sniper targeting U.S. troops turns out to be a terrified girl in pigtails. As she lies mortally wounded, she begs quietly, \u201cShoot me.\u201d The soldiers oblige.",
      "The stereotypical nature of the sex worker scenes is, for Bui, redeemed somewhat by the character of the sniper (Ngoc Le), whose courage is acknowledged.",
      "In Bui's own \u201cThree Seasons,\u201d a 1999 Vietnamese-American production, sex worker Lan (Diep Bui) is central to the story, an exploration of postwar life in Ho Chi Minh City. A cyclo driver falls in love with Lan and trails her around the city, trying to help her find a better life.",
      "Bui says his research has found that more than half of Vietnamese films about the conflict have female protagonists. One of the most famous, H\u1ea3i Ninh\u2019s landmark \u201cThe Little Girl of Hanoi\u201d (1974), follows a young girl (Lan H\u01b0\u01a1ng) searching for her family in bombed-out Hanoi.",
      "Another, \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh\u2019s \u201cWhen the Tenth Month Comes\u201d (1984), tells the story of Duyen (L\u00ea V\u00e2n), a young wife and mother in the rural north whose husband goes to war. Her ailing father-in-law asks frequently why the soldier has not written home. Duyen learns one day that her husband's been dead for a year and enlists a local schoolteacher to help her hide that by forging eloquent letters.",
      "The character is emblematic of the way Vietnamese culture has long portrayed the woman: fierce, loyal and resilient in the face of adversity, argues Duong.",
      "\u201cShe is beautiful. She\u2019s suffering. She\u2019s loyal to the memory of her dead husband,\u201d notes Duong. \u201cIt\u2019s been argued by \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh himself ... that she's a symbol for the nation itself. So it becomes a really rich metaphor for filmmakers.\u201d",
      "The risk, she adds, is that such characters, serving as symbols, can also lack dimension.",
      "Stone is one of the only directors to have explicitly addressed the minimal role of women in his Vietnam works, saying \u201cPlatoon\u201d was deliberately a male-driven narrative.",
      "But with his third and last Vietnam War film, \u201cHeaven & Earth\u201d (1993), Stone shifted to the perspective of a real-life Vietnamese woman: Le Ly (Hiep Thi Le), who endures rape and torture as a young woman, then moves to California with her troubled American military husband (Tommy Lee Jones).",
      "\u201cThere is some truth to the criticism of my treatment of women,\u201d Stone said while making the film. \u201cI have a lot to learn about everything, not just women.\u201d",
      "Making his point crystal clear, Stone dedicates the film at the end to his mother, Jacqueline Stone.",

      "But everyone inside the club's historic Racecourse Ground knew what was coming, and within seconds of the whistle the field was a sea of red as Wrexham supporters celebrated wildly.",

      "Reynolds and McElhenney were part of a full house of nearly 13,000 fans.",
      "\u201cThe stadium and atmosphere is incredible, it\u2019s a massive club and a big project, it will be a special week now,\u201d said striker Sam Smith, who scored two goals in the win.",
      "Who knows what's next for a team that has defied the odds since the actors bought it for $2.5 million in 2021 and turned it into a household name around the world.",
      "\u201cThe owners have come in and done an amazing job.

      "Wrexham just needed victory then to clinch the second promotion place in League One.",
      "Reynolds posed for selfies with fans outside and served drinks behind the bar in a marquee set up outside the nearby Turf pub, which has earned world renown from the docuseries \u201cWelcome to Wrexham.\u201d",
      "Fans erupted in cheers after the final whistle of Wycombe\u2019s loss, which was shown on a big screen.",
      "Wrexham just needed to finish the job off against fourth-placed Charlton and eased nerves with two goals in the space of three minutes in the first half. Oliver Rathbone\u2019s long shot in the 15th minute was followed by Smith\u2019s volley.",
      "When Smith headed in a third in the 81st the outcome was in no doubt and Wrexham's fans serenaded the players with chants of \u201cWe are going up.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Kentucky is reporting a 30.2% drop in drug overdose deaths in 2024",
      "The number of overdose deaths in Kentucky last year dropped by 30.2% \u2014 down to 1,410 lives lost \u2014 giving state leaders a surge of confidence that prevention and treatment efforts are making progress against an addiction epidemic they say is shattering families across the state.",
      "This was the third straight yearly decrease in drug overdose deaths for the state, although prior declines were substantially smaller. Kentucky has long been plagued by high rates of addiction to opioid painkillers, and fatal overdoses surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when treatment was hard to get and people were socially isolated.",
      "Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who announced the latest overdose statistics on Thursday, called the results a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d reflecting years of painstaking work to combat the spread and use of drugs.",
      "\u201cThis is what we have been hoping for and praying for,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here ought to give everyone who\u2019s worked so hard to get to this point ... hope that we can do even more.\"",
      "State Attorney General Russell Coleman, a Republican, said Kentuckians should \u201crejoice in every life saved from this scourge,\u201d but warned that powerful illicit drugs like fentanyl continue to pose a threat.",
      "\"As little as one pill can and is killing our sons and daughters,\u201d Coleman said in a statement.",
      "Fentanyl and methamphetamine continued to be the most prevalent drugs contributing to overdose deaths in Kentucky.",
      "Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who has steered huge sums of federal funding to his home state to combat its addiction woes, said he was encouraged by the gains in combating the drug crisis, from stemming the flow of illicit drugs to offering treatment services in communities.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always worked to keep Kentucky at the forefront of our national response to the drug crisis,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. \"We are finally making progress in restoring the Southern Border, but there\u2019s still a lot of work left to do in the commonwealth to help those struggling with addiction.\u201d",
      "Kentucky's drop reflected broader gains achieved in the U.S. There were about 97,000 U.S. overdose deaths in the 12 months that ended last June 30, according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was down 14% from the estimated 113,000 for the prior 12-month period.",
      "Overdose death rates nationwide began steadily climbing in the 1990s because of opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths led by other opioids like heroin and more recently fentanyl.",
      "Beshear, seen as a potential candidate for the White House in 2028, said plenty of groups were deserving of credit for Kentucky's big decline in overdose deaths. He praised law enforcement efforts to remove dangerous drugs from circulation and the work of addiction treatment centers and other recovery services. And he credited those Kentuckians battling addiction who reached out for help.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s your first, fifth or 10th attempt, we want to stand behind you,\" the governor said. \"We want to provide you the best help that we can.\u201d",
      "Other factors, he said, include the distribution of Narcan, which can reverse overdoses of opioids, as well as the availability of addiction services through Medicaid and the work of syringe exchange programs.",
      "\u201cRegardless of what the politics say, syringe exchange programs work,\" Beshear said. \"They help us get to know people and they help us to save lives.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Coleman has rolled out a youth-focused initiative aimed at keeping young people away from deadly substances.",
      "With all those efforts, the challenge now is to continue driving down fatal overdoses, Beshear said.",
      "\u201cIt ought to tell us that an epidemic that arose in our time, we should be able to defeat in our time,\u201d the governor said.",

      "The medical team at the DF Star Hospital in Brasilia said that he left intensive care on Wednesday and there is no set discharge date from the facility. His health condition is stable and he has begun receiving a liquid diet.",
      "Bolsonaro underwent a 12-hour surgery on April 13 to remove intestinal adhesions and reconstruct the abdominal wall. It was the sixth procedure related to long-term effects of being stabbed in the abdomen during a campaign rally in September 2018.",
      "He has been in and out of hospitals since the attack and underwent multiple surgeries during his presidency from 2019-2022.",
      "Doctors described the latest surgery as the \u201cmost complex\u201d since the stabbing, requiring a \u201cvery delicate and prolonged post-surgery.\u201d",
      "Bolsonaro was admitted with severe abdominal pain to a hospital in Santa Cruz, a small city in Rio Grande do Norte, on April 11 and then transferred to a hospital in the state\u2019s capital, Natal. His family later requested his transfer to Brasilia.",
      "He had been preparing for a trip across northeast Brazil to promote his Liberal Party\u2019s right-wing agenda, eyeing next year\u2019s presidential election, though he himself is barred from running. The region traditionally has been a political bastion of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration is again trying to rehire some staffers who were recently fired amid mass layoffs at the agency",
      "WASHINGTON -- For the second time in recent months, the Food and Drug Administration is bringing back some recently fired employees, including staffers who handle travel bookings for safety inspectors.",
      "More than 20 of the agency\u2019s roughly 60 travel staff will be reinstated, according to two FDA staffers notified of the plan this week, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters.",
      "Food scientists who test samples for bacteria and study potentially harmful chemicals also have been told they will get their jobs back, but have yet to receive any official confirmation.",
      "The same uncertainty hangs over employees who process agency records for release to lawyers, companies and journalists under the Freedom of Information Act. About 100 of those staffers were recently eliminated, according to an agency official with direct knowledge of the situation.",
      "But in recent days the FDA has missed multiple court-ordered deadlines to produce documents, which could result in hefty fines. That's prompted plans to bring back a significant number of those staffers.",
      "The apparent reversals are the latest examples of the haphazard approach to agency cuts that have shrunk FDA\u2019s workforce by an estimated 20%, or about 3,500 jobs, in addition to an unspecified number of retirements, voluntary buyouts and resignations.",
      "In February, the FDA laid off about 700 provisional employees, including food and medical device reviewers, only to rehire many of them within days after pushback from industry, Congress and other parties.",

      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has repeatedly said that no FDA scientists were fired as part of the reductions. But at least two dozen food scientists who worked in a San Francisco testing laboratory and a Chicago research center were let go in March.",
      "An HHS spokesperson suggested the apparent mix-up was due to \u201cthe fractured, outdated HR infrastructure we inherited from the Biden administration and are now actively overhauling.\u201d The spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about which employees are being reinstated but said the administration will \u201cstreamline operations and fix the broken systems left to us.\u201d",
      "About 15 scientists working in FDA\u2019s Division of Food Processing Science and Technology in Chicago were told last week they be will reinstated, according to a staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters. But a week later there has been no written confirmation and the scientists have not returned to the office. The group\u2019s research includes studying ways to prevent harmful bacteria from growing on produce and preventing the spread of microplastics and other particles from food packaging.",
      "\u201cI hope Commissioner Makary continues to assess these ill-informed cuts and works to bring back impacted employees expeditiously,\u201d said Susan Mayne of Yale University, the FDA\u2019s former food director. \u201cHis legacy as commissioner is on the line.\u201d",
      "With more than 15,000 employees remaining across various U.S. and foreign offices, the FDA\u2019s core responsibilities are reviewing new drugs, medical products and food ingredients as well as inspecting thousands of factories.",
      "Makary has said no inspectors or medical reviewers were fired as part of the recent reductions. But current and former FDA officials note that those frontline employees are often supported by teams of administrative staff.",
      "FDA inspectors, for example, have long relied on travel bookers to coordinate trips to India and other countries that often involve visa permissions, security measures, ground transportation, tech support, translation services and other logistics. Inspectors can spend up to half the year traveling, a grueling workload that makes recruiting and retaining staff a challenge.",
      "For a brief period last month, inspectors were told they would be booking their own travel. The FDA set up a hotline to assist with making the arrangements. Then, agency leaders developed a plan to hire an outside contractor to perform the work.",

      "NEW YORK -- More U.S. women died around the time of childbirth last year, reversing two years of decline, according to provisional data posted Wednesday.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 688 people died last year during pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. That\u2019s up from 669 deaths in 2023, but down from 2022 and 2021, when it was the highest level in more than 50 years.",

      "The CDC counts women who die while pregnant, during childbirth and up to 42 days after birth from conditions related to pregnancy. Excessive bleeding, blood vessel blockages and infections are leading causes.",
      "Such deaths spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the coronavirus was particularly dangerous to pregnant women. And, in the worst days of the pandemic, burned out physicians may have added to the risk by ignoring pregnant women\u2019s worries, experts say.",
      "The waning of COVID-19 is considered a major reason for the declines in maternal deaths in 2022 and 2023, experts say.",
      "But those improvements are now being offset by other factors that may reduce access to medical care, experts say. They say the list includes the closure of rural hospitals and the U.S. Supreme Court decision that did away with the federally established right to abortion, which caused some doctors to feel constrained about providing care during pregnancy-related medical emergencies.",
      "The U.S. has one of the highest maternal mortality rate among wealthy nations. Past research has found wide racial disparities in such deaths, with Black women dying at a far higher rate than white women.",

    "story": [
      "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill to change the language in the state's abortion laws in an effort to clarify when doctors are allowed to perform an abortion during a medical emergency",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The Texas Senate approved changes Tuesday to the state\u2019s strict abortion ban that both Republicans and Democrats say would clarify medical exceptions and has drawn support from women who were told they could not end their pregnancies despite life-threatening complications.",
      "The unanimous passage of the bill in the GOP-controlled Senate \u2014 by a 31-0 vote \u2014 marked a rare moment of bipartisanship on an issue that for years has roiled the state Capitol as Texas Republicans have defended one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion bans and launched criminal investigations into alleged violations.",
      "Under Senate-passed changes, Texas' ban would specify that doctors are allowed to perform an abortion if a patient is experiencing a \u201clife-threatening\u201d condition capable of causing death, and \"not necessarily one actively injuring the patient.\u201d The bill would also require doctors to receive training on the revised law.",
      "If approved by the state House and signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, the revisions would mark the first time Texas lawmakers have modified language in the near-total abortion ban since it took effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe know there are cases where moms who should have been treated were denied treatment,\u201d Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes said on the floor of the chamber before the vote, urging lawmakers to adopt changes that make the law \"crystal clear.\u201d",
      "Texas' ban would still have no exception in cases of rape or incest and the law would not spell out specific medical exceptions, which Senate Democrats noted even as they said they would support it and predicted it would save lives.",
      "\u201cI will vote for it, but this policy is no less cruel for being made clear,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Sarah Eckhardt said.",
      "Republican lawmakers in Kentucky passed a similar bill in March that added specific medical exceptions to the state's ban, which also prohibits all abortions except in medical emergencies. Last year, South Dakota released an instructional video for doctors to clarify the state's abortion restrictions.",
      "The Texas bill comes following years of the state's abortion ban successfully navigating court challenges and scrutiny from doctors and abortion rights advocates. The advocates say the state's laws are too vague when defining what is considered a \u201clife-threatening condition.\u201d",
      "Hughes, who is one of the architects of the state's stringent abortion ban, said he introduced the bill to \u201cremove any doubt\u201d that doctors can perform an abortion when the mother's life is at risk.",
      "Texas law currently prohibits all abortions, including in cases of rape or incest, except in instances to save the life of the mother. Physicians can face up to 99 years in prison and be fined up to $100,000 if they perform an illegal abortion.",
      "Several women challenged existing medical exceptions under Texas law as too narrow. They called the new legislation a small step in the right direction and would allow doctors to act more urgently. Kaitlyn Kash, who was denied an abortion after experiencing serious pregnancy complications, said at a news conference this month that she was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the bill.",
      "The Texas Supreme Court in 2024 said that the state's abortion laws were not too vague, ruling against several women who were denied an abortion after experiencing serious pregnancy complications. The Texas Medical Board also declined to list specific medical exceptions allowed under the law.",
      "In March, Texas filed criminal charges against a Houston midwife for allegedly providing illegal abortions, and the state is also suing a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman.",

      "Utah became the first state to pass a ban last month, approving legislation that bars cities and communities from deciding whether to add the mineral to their water systems.",
      "Fluoride has come under increased scrutiny under the influence of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is setting the gears of government in motion to stop fluoridating water.",

      "Now some lawmakers in each of those states are trying to roll back the benefits, citing concerns from businesses about costs.",
      "The efforts mark the latest attempt by legislators to alter laws backed by the voters they represent. In February, for example, Michigan enacted revisions to a paid sick leave law initiated by voters seven years ago, delaying the date when small businesses must comply and allowing a longer period before new employees are eligible.",
      "Though some voters are outraged, some lawmakers contend that citizen activists who crafted the initiatives overlooked the realities of running a business.",
      "Restaurant owner Tim Hart, who employs about two dozen workers at his steakhouse in Hannibal, Missouri, said the paid sick leave requirement imposes a double financial hit because he must pay one person to stay home and another to fill the shift.",
      "\u201cWhen this goes into effect, we very likely won\u2019t survive,\u201d said Hart, who has urged the state Senate to halt the law.",

      "\u201cI just took some pain medication and just went into work anyway and just worked past the pain,\u201d Eiker said. \u201cIt would have been nice to have stayed home.\u201d",
      "Federal law requires many employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for personal or family medical issues. But there is no federal mandate to pay for sick days.",
      "Nonetheless, 79% of private-sector employees received paid sick leave last year, according to the Department of Labor. Part-time workers were significantly less likely to receive the benefit than their full-time counterparts. And just 58% of employees in the bottom quarter of income earners received paid sick leave, compared with 94% in the top quartile.",
      "Though still discretionary for many employers, the number of states mandating paid sick leave has grown significantly since Connecticut enacted the first such law in 2012. Last year's ballot measures raised the total to 18 states and the District of Columbia. Three additional states require paid leave for any reason, without specifying sickness.",
      "Many paid sick leave laws, including the ones in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska, apply to any employer with at least one worker. But some states exempt the smallest businesses, with cutoffs ranging from five to 25 employees. The number of annual paid sick days also varies.",
      "On Tuesday the state Supreme Court upheld Missouri's paid sick leave law against a challenge from business groups. But efforts to revise it continue.",
      "In March, Republican House members passed legislation to repeal the paid sick leave requirement. That was then blocked by minority-party Democrats in the Senate. So Republicans are pushing an alternative that would delay the law until later this year, exempt smaller businesses and take away workers' ability to sue over alleged violations.",
      "The intent is to \u201cjust make it a little less onerous on employers,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Mike Bernskoetter, a small business owner who is backing the bill.",

      "Legislation pushed by Republican lawmakers in Nebraska state would carve out exceptions from paid sick leave for 14- and-15-year-old employees, temporary and seasonal agricultural workers and businesses with 10 or fewer employees.",
      "The legislation also would strip workers of the ability to sue employers who retaliate against them for using paid sick leave.",
      "Supporters of the revisions say they aim to protect small businesses from higher costs. Opponents say they are essentially gutting the law.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about just whole swaths of the ballot language being stricken by this,\u201d state Sen. John Cavanaugh said during recent debate. \u201cThat is a huge overstep by this Legislature to say that we know better than the people who voted for this.\u201d",
      "A bill by state Rep. Justin Ruffridge would exempt seasonal workers and businesses with fewer than 50 employees from the sick leave requirement. That could exclude many catering to Alaska's summer tourists.",
      "Ruffridge, a member of the House\u2019s Republican minority, said small business owners should be able to choose whether to spend money on sick leave benefits or other measures to grow their businesses.",

      "The Trump administration is expected to soon say whether it intends to stand by strict drinking water standards for forever chemicals set last year",
      "In pain so bad he couldn\u2019t stand, Chris Meek was rushed to the hospital with a life-threatening ruptured gallbladder. When he emerged from surgery, he learned he had kidney cancer that thankfully hadn\u2019t yet spread.",
      "Meek, a social studies teacher in Wilmington, North Carolina, was 47 at the time. But he remained confused for years about why, as someone seemingly not at risk, he had gotten cancer until Emily Donovan, a parent of students at his school, gave a guest talk about high levels of harmful forever chemicals known as PFAS in North Carolina's environment. When Donovan mentioned kidney cancer, the possible cause of Meek's diagnosis finally clicked.",
      "Until then, Meek said, he \u201chad no idea what PFAS was.\u201d",
      "Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight.",
      "In a decision with consequences for tens of millions of Americans, the Trump administration is expected to soon say whether it intends to stand by those strict standards and defend the limits against a water utility industry challenge in federal court.",
      "In North Carolina, runoff from a Chemours plant contaminated the Cape Fear River, creating a crisis for cities like Wilmington that use it for drinking water. Amid public outcry, Wilmington effectively eliminated it from tap water.",
      "Other U.S. communities \u2014 often near military bases or industrial sites \u2014 did the same when test results were frightening and public pressure, local leadership or state law forced PFAS-laden wells offline or prompted installation of expensive filtering systems, according to Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.",
      "The EPA said the PFAS found in North Carolina, often called GenX chemicals, can be toxic to the kidney. While other types of PFAS may raise kidney cancer risk, little research has focused on the link between kidney cancer and GenX, according to Sue Fenton, director of the Center for Human Health and the Environment at North Carolina State University. Chemours said evidence doesn't support arguments that GenX at low levels is a health threat. The company has sharply reduced PFAS discharges.",
      "So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the recently set EPA limits, but most aren't above by much. Forcing this group to reduce PFAS more than doubles the rule\u2019s health benefits but roughly triples its costs, the EPA has said.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s rule set standards for two common types of PFAS at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. Standards for several other PFAS chemicals were set, too, and utilities must meet those levels by 2029.",
      "Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -\u2013 among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has championed fossil fuels and the rollback of major clean air and water rules. His history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals in drinking water.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an issue that touches people in a very tangible way across the political spectrum, including in Lee Zeldin\u2019s former district,\" said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.",
      "Zeldin has offered clues about what the EPA could do. The agency estimated the rule would cost about $1.5 billion annually and Zeldin said recently that communities struggling to afford a fix for PFAS that are just above the standard might be handled differently than wealthy places with lots of it.",
      "\u201cWhat we are going to have to be is extremely thoughtful in figuring this out,\u201d he said.",
      "On Monday, the EPA said it will establish an agency lead for PFAS, develop wastewater limits for PFAS manufacturers and investigate sources that pose an immediate danger to drinking water, among other actions.",
      "Soon, the EPA must tell a federal appeals court in Washington whether the rule should stand or be rewritten, although weakening it could be complicated because the Safe Drinking Water Act prevents new rules from being looser than previous ones. The agency could, however, encourage exemptions and deadline extensions, according to Erik Olson, an attorney with the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council supporting the current standards in the court case.",
      "Consider Avondale, Arizona, outside of Phoenix, which produces PFAS results modestly above the limits. Officials have done detailed testing and are planning to enhance water treatment. All told, lowering PFAS may cost Avondale more than $120 million, according to Kirk Beaty, the city\u2019s public utility director.",
      "That\u2019s money a city like Avondale \u201cjust doesn\u2019t have sitting in a back room somewhere,\" Beaty said, adding he\u2019ll defer to federal experts to dictate what\u2019s acceptable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping we\u2019re a little further ahead of everybody else. If the regulation changes, well you know, we may let off the gas a little bit, we may not,\u201d he said, adding that it is hard to justify spending extra money to do more than what\u2019s required when the cost falls on residents.",
      "If the government decides higher amounts of PFAS are acceptable, that could confuse people, especially in areas where the public is already concerned.",
      "\u201cIf we enter into a gray area over what\u2019s healthy and what\u2019s not healthy, then utilities are at risk of being caught up in a debate for which they have no real responsibility nor expertise to decide on,\u201d said Karine Roug\u00e9, CEO for municipal water at Veolia North America, a water operations company.",
      "The American Water Works Association, an industry group, filed the court challenge to the new rule. It agrees that certain PFAS should be regulated but argues the EPA\u2019s standards go too far, underestimate costs and are \u201cneither feasible nor cost-effective.\u201d There are serious consequences for residents' water bills, it says.",
      "The burden of complying will fall heavily on small utilities that can least afford it. Many water providers already struggle to maintain their existing infrastructure, some experts say. On top of everything else, they face new requirements to replace lead pipes. The AWWA wants the EPA to extend the PFAS and lead deadlines by two years.",
      "There is money available to help. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS and utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters that help as well.",
      "Meek, who successfully recovered after surgery from cancer and is now 59, is planning to sue over his illness. He once didn\u2019t second-guess using tap water. Now he reaches for bottled water.",
      "Donovan, who introduced Meek to PFAS and helped start Clean Cape Fear, says if the government\u2019s standards are weakened, it\u2019ll relieve pressure on utilities to effectively treat the water.",
      "Previously, \u201cour local utilities could tell us publicly that the water met or exceeded all state and federal guidelines because there weren\u2019t any,\u201d she said.",

      "A woman pleaded not guilty Monday to fatally stabbing a Kansas City, Missouri, paramedic as she was being taken to a hospital in an ambulance.",
      "Shanetta Bossell, 39, was arrested Sunday after trying to drive off in the ambulance as others were tending to paramedic Graham Hoffman's chest wound, according to court records. She has been jailed on $1 million bond on charges of first-degree murder, armed criminal action, assault and resisting arrest. No attorney is listed for her in online court records.",
      "The 29-year-old paramedic had worked for the Kansas City Fire Department for three years and was remembered for his commitment to the job.",
      "\u201cOur community grieves his loss at such a young age with his entire life ahead of him,\u201d Clay County prosecuting attorney Zachary Thompson said at a news conference Sunday night.",
      "Police spotted Bossell walking along the shoulder of a highway early Sunday, her finger cut and bleeding, according to the probable cause affidavit. She had been freed on bond just two days earlier in a resisting arrest case that Thompson said involved an assault on a law enforcement officer.",
      "While en route to the hospital, the driver heard Hoffman frantically call for help, saying Bossell had a knife. The driver stopped and then rushed to the back. As he flung open the door, he heard Hoffman say, \"She stabbed me in the heart,\u201d the affidavit said.",
      "An officer who was following the ambulance then witnessed Bossell get into the vehicle's cab and attempt to put it into drive, according to the affidavit. The officer ultimately was able to wrestle her to the ground. But during the fray, she bit his arm, and he hit her in the head with his firearm to get her to let go, the affidavit said.",
      "A second ambulance arrived and the crew rushed Hoffman to the hospital, where he died later that afternoon.",
      "Thompson said any conviction on the murder charge could draw a life sentence without possibility of parole \u2014 or even a death sentence. But he did not elaborate on prosecution plans and said police continue to investigate what he described as a \u201chorrific\u201d crime.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet me be perfectly clear,\" he said. \"Our office will use all legal, moral, and ethical tools at our disposal to ensure justice for Graham, his family and the entire community.\u201d",

      "The Vietnam War ended 50 years ago but the disaster unleashed by American use of Agent Orange continues unabated",
      "DA NANG, Vietnam -- The Vietnam War ended on April 30, 1975, when the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon fell to Communist forces. But millions of people still face daily battles with its chemical legacy.",
      "Nguyen Thanh Hai, 34, is one of millions with disabilities linked to Agent Orange. Born with severe developmental challenges, it's a struggle for him to complete tasks others take for granted: buttoning the blue shirt he wears to a special school in Da Nang, practicing the alphabet, drawing shapes or forming simple sentences.",
      "Hai grew up in Da Nang, the site of a U.S. air base where departing troops left behind huge amounts of Agent Orange that have lingered for decades, leeching into food and water supplies in areas like Hai's village and affecting generations of residents.",
      "Across Vietnam, U.S. forces sprayed sprayed 72 million liters (19 million gallons) of defoliants during the war to strip the enemy's cover. More than half was Agent Orange, a blend of herbicides.",
      "Agent Orange was laced with dioxin, a type of chemical linked to cancer, birth defects and lasting environmental damage. Today, 3 million people, including many children, still suffer serious health issues associated with exposure to it.",
      "Vietnam has spent decades cleaning up the toxic legacy of the war, in part funded by belated U.S. assistance, but the work is far from complete. Now, millions in Vietnam are worried that the U.S. may abandon Agent Orange cleanup as President Donald Trump slashes foreign aid.",
      "When the war ended, the U.S. turned its back on Vietnam, eager to turn the page on a painful chapter in its history.",
      "But Vietnam was left with dozens of dioxin hotspots spread across 58 of its 63 provinces.",
      "Vietnam says the health impacts last generations, threatening the children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren of people exposed to the chemicals with health complications ranging from cancer to birth defects that affects the spine and nervous system.",
      "But the science about the human health impact \u2014 both to those exposed to Agent Orange and the generations that follow \u2014 remains unsettled. This is partly because when the two countries finally started working together in 2006, they focused on finding dioxin in the environment and clearing it instead of studying the still-contentious topic of its impact on human health, said Charles Bailey, co-author of the book \u201cFrom Enemies to Partners: Vietnam, the U.S. and Agent Orange.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe science of causality is still incomplete,\u201d said Bailey.",
      "Vietnam identifies Agent Orange victims by checking family history, where they lived, and a list of health problems linked to the poison. And Hai's disabilities were very likely linked to the spraying of the defoliant, added Bailey.",
      "The 34-year-old dreams of becoming a soldier like his grandfather, was unable to leave home for years, waiting alone while his family went out to work. It was only five years ago that he began attending a special school. \u201cI am happy here because I have many friends,\u201d he said. Other students at the school hope to become tailors or makers of incense sticks.",
      "The contamination also denuded Vietnam\u2019s natural defenses. Nearly half of its mangrove trees, which shield shores from strong storms, were destroyed. Much of its tropical forest was irrevocably damaged, while the herbicide also leached the soil of nutrients in some of Vietnam\u2019s most climate-vulnerable areas.",
      "In the decades after the war ended, the recovering country fenced off heavily contaminated sites like Da Nang airport and began providing support to impacted families.",
      "But the U.S. largely ignored growing evidence of health impacts \u2014 including on its own veterans \u2014 until the mid-2000s, when it and began funding cleanup in Vietnam. In 1991, the U.S. recognized that certain diseases could be related to exposure to Agent Orange and made veterans who had them eligible for benefits.",
      "Since 1991, it has spent over $155 million to aid people with disabilities in areas affected by Agent Orange or littered by unexploded bombs, according to the U.S. State Department. The two countries have also cooperated to recover war dead, with the U.S. aiding Vietnam\u2019s search for its own missing.",
      "Cleaning up Agent Orange is expensive and often dangerous. Heavily polluted soil needs to be unearthed and heated in large ovens to very high temperatures, while less contaminated soil can be buried in secure landfills.",
      "Despite years of work, large sites still need to cleared. In Da Nang, where an air base was contaminated during storage and transportation of Agent Orange, the U.S. completed a $110 million cleanup in 2018 but an area the size of 10 soccer fields still remains heavily contaminated.",
      "Cooperation on war legacy issues also laid a foundation for growing U.S.-Vietnam ties, culminating in 2023 when Vietnam elevated the U.S. to its highest diplomatic status of comprehensive strategic partner.",
      "\u201cThe United States considers Vietnam a key partner in advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific,\u201d former U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in Vietnam in 2023.",
      "But Donald Trump\u2019s cuts to USAID stalled key projects in Vietnam, and while many have resumed, doubts remain about U.S. reliability.",
      "Vietnam now has to negotiate a new reality where the U.S. president says the country can no longer afford to help other countries.",
      "The country can\u2019t handle the toxic chemicals that still persist without help, said Nguyen Van An, the chairman of Association for Victims of Agent Orange in Danang. \u201cWe always believe that the U.S. government and the manufacturers of this toxic chemical must have the responsibility to support the victims,\u201d he said.",
      "He said he hoped that any stoppages to ongoing projects due to shifting politics in Washington would be temporary.",
      "Insufficient data means that experts can't definitely say when the risk to human health will end. But the more urgent problem is if that cleanup efforts are interrupted, the now-exposed contaminated soil could get into waterways and harm more people.",
      "A 10-year project to clear the some 500,000 cubic meters (650,000 cubic yards) of dioxin-contaminated soil \u2014 enough to fill 40,000 trucks \u2014 at Bien Hoa airbase was launched in 2020. It stopped for a week in March and then restarted.",
      "But Bailey, who worked on issues related to the Agent Orange in Vietnam for years, said future USAID funding for the cleanup and a $30 million program for people with disabilities was uncertain.",
      "With federal cuts to USAID, most staffers in Vietnam are expected to be gone by later this year, leaving nobody to administer funding for remediation programs, even if it is not cut itself.",
      "\u201cThis basically leaves a very large mountain of contaminated soil. Only 30% of which has been dealt with and that is less contaminated,\u201d said Bailey.",
      "He added that less than half of the soil at Bien Hoa had been treated and much of the remaining soil was heavily contaminated and needed to be treated in an as-yet unbuilt incinerator.",
      "Tim Rieser, who was retired Sen. Patrick Leahy\u2019s foreign policy aide when the Vermont Democrat secured the original funding for Vietnam War remediation projects and is now a senior advisor to Sen. Peter Welch, said Congress still supports the programs but it would be hard for them to continue without staff.",
      "\"For more than 30 years, the U.S. and Vietnam have worked together to rebuild relations by dealing with the worst legacies of the war, like Agent Orange,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the Trump administration is mindlessly shutting everything down, with no concern for the impact of their actions on relations with an important partner in the Indo-Pacific.\u201d",
      "The U.S. embassy in Hanoi didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Chuck Searcy, an American Vietnam War veteran who has worked on humanitarian programs in the country since 1995, said he worries that trust built over years could erode very rapidly. He pointed out that those who benefit from U.S. funded projects to address war legacies are \u201cinnocent victims.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been victimized twice, once by the war and the consequences that they\u2019ve suffered. And now by having the rug pulled out from under them,\u201d he said.",

      "Colombia's capital has South America\u2019s only supervised room for drug use, aimed at reducing harm and preventing overdoses and now a topic of the International Conference on Harm Reduction, which has been taking place since Sunday in Bogota",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- The left arm of Christian Camilo Amaya is tattooed with a skull pierced by a syringe, which he says represents the use of cocaine and heroin. He frequently shot up on streets of Bogota, but he has recently switched to South America's only supervised room for drug use, aimed at reducing harm and preventing overdoses.",
      "Non-profit organization Accion Tecnica Social runs the supervised room named Cambie (or Change in English) in Colombia's capital. Since it opened in June 2023, 14 users had their overdoses treated with injections of naloxone, a drug that reverses overdoses. The last such case was a year ago.",
      "Amaya often carries a black plastic bag with more than a dozen used syringes, which he puts in a red container for biological waste, as protocols for using the room dictate. He denies being addicted to heroin, but argues the supervised room gives him syringes and training on hygienic injections and overdose prevention.",
      "\u201cI know what substances do to me, so I know I shouldn\u2019t be a frequent user for that very reason, to avoid becoming addicted,\u201d Amaya told The Associated Press in the unmarked drug use room in one of the city\u2019s impoverished neighborhoods.",
      "The initiative is one of the topics of the International Conference on Harm Reduction, which started Sunday in Bogota. It is the first time the conference has been held in Latin America in the past three decades, as the leftist administration of President Gustavo Petro pushes for a revision in the international drug control system of the United Nations.",
      "The supervised consumption room currently has 87 registered users, 26% of whom are Venezuelan migrants, who come to inject themselves or receive syringes, food, guidance on lower-risk injection techniques, or overdose management.",
      "Of the users who come to the room, 91% use heroin, 7% inject cocaine, and less than 2% use speedballs, a mixture of cocaine and heroin. Official data on heroin use in Colombia is scarce.",
      "The project was born in 2022 when organizers started contacting users directly to identify their needs. It received technical advice from other countries, especially Mexico.",
      "For David Moreno, who works at Cambie, the most difficult part of reversing an overdose is not injecting the naloxone but avoiding a follow-up overdose.",
      "\u201cOnce I had a user who would get very violent when she came back from an overdose. She would start hurting herself, then she would take off my jacket and tie it, and I\u2019d have to restrain her,\u201d said Moreno.",
      "\u201cWhen it happens, I am calm. But when the user leaves... Wow, my adrenaline rushes.\u201d",
      "Sam Rivera, the executive-director of OnPoint, a nonprofit organization in New York City that operates supervised injection centers, toured the small, nearly 65-foot room with three patient cubicles before AP's visit.",
      "\u201cI look at it as a mini version of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Rivera said. He argues the initiative is also good for public security.",
      "\u201cI always tell people to come visit an overdose prevention center. When you hear about it, it sounds dangerous or it sounds bad because it sounds like you\u2019re enabling people to use,\" he added. \u201cThese are people who are going to use. So instead of using outside, in danger, leaving these supplies in the street, everything happens inside, everything stays inside.\u201d",

      "U.S. health officials are pushing to get artificial colors out of the nation's food supply",
      "ST. LOUIS -- As pressure grows to get artificial colors out of the U.S. food supply, the shift may well start at Abby Tampow\u2019s laboratory desk.",
      "On an April afternoon, the scientist hovered over tiny dishes of red dye, each a slightly different ruby hue. Her task? To match the synthetic shade used for years in a commercial bottled raspberry vinaigrette \u2014 but by using only natural ingredients.",
      "\u201cWith this red, it needs a little more orange,\u201d Tampow said, mixing a slurry of purplish black carrot juice with a bit of beta-carotene, an orange-red color made from algae.",
      "Tampow is part of the team at Sensient Technologies Corp., one of the world\u2019s largest dyemakers, that is rushing to help the salad dressing manufacturer \u2014 along with thousands of other American businesses \u2014 meet demands to overhaul colors used to brighten products from cereals to sports drinks.",
      "\u201cMost of our customers have decided that this is finally the time when they\u2019re going to make that switch to a natural color,\u201d said Dave Gebhardt, Sensient\u2019s senior technical director. He joined a recent tour of the Sensient Colors factory in a north St. Louis neighborhood.",
      "Last week, U.S. health officials announced plans to persuade food companies to voluntarily eliminate petroleum-based artificial dyes by the end of 2026.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called them \u201cpoisonous compounds\u201d that endanger children\u2019s health and development, citing limited evidence of potential health risks.",
      "The federal push follows a flurry of state laws and a January decision to ban the artificial dye known as Red 3 \u2014 found in cakes, candies and some medications \u2014 because of cancer risks in lab animals. Social media influencers and ordinary consumers have ramped up calls for artificial colors to be removed from foods.",
      "The FDA allows about three dozen color additives, including eight remaining synthetic dyes. But making the change from the petroleum-based dyes to colors derived from vegetables, fruits, flowers and even insects won\u2019t be easy, fast or cheap, said Monica Giusti, an Ohio State University food color expert.",
      "\u201cStudy after study has shown that if all companies were to remove synthetic colors from their formulations, the supply of the natural alternatives would not be enough,\u201d Giusti said. \u201cWe are not really ready.\u201d",
      "It can take six months to a year to convert a single product from a synthetic dye to a natural one. And it could require three to four years to build up the supply of botanical products necessary for an industrywide shift, Sensient officials said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s 150 million pounds of beet juice sitting around waiting on the off chance the whole market may convert,\u201d said Paul Manning, the company's chief executive. \u201cTens of millions of pounds of these products need to be grown, pulled out of the ground, extracted.\u201d",
      "To make natural dyes, Sensient works with farmers and producers around the world to harvest the raw materials, which typically arrive at the plant as bulk concentrates. They\u2019re processed and blended into liquids, granules or powders and then sent to food companies to be added to final products.",
      "Natural dyes are harder to make and use than artificial colors. They are less consistent in color, less stable and subject to changes related to acidity, heat and light, Manning said. Blue is especially difficult. There aren't many natural sources of the color and those that exist can be hard to maintain during processing.",
      "Also, a natural color costs about 10 times more to make than the synthetic version, Manning estimated.",
      "\u201cHow do you get that same vividness, that same performance, that same level of safety in that product as you would in a synthetic product?\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complexity associated with that.\u201d",
      "Companies have long used the Red 3 synthetic dye to create what Sensient officials describe as \u201cthe Barbie pink.\u201d",
      "To create that color with a natural source might require the use of cochineal, an insect about the size of a peppercorn.",
      "The female insects release a vibrant red pigment, carminic acid, in their bodies and eggs. The bugs live only on prickly pear cactuses in Peru and elsewhere. About 70,000 cochineal insects are needed to produce 1 kilogram, about 2.2 pounds, of dye.",
      "\u201cIt's interesting how the most exotic colors are found in the most exotic places,\u201d said Norb Norbrega, who travels the world scouting new hues for Sensient.",
      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. About 1 in 5 food products in the U.S. contains added colors, whether natural or synthetic, Manning estimated. Many contain multiple colors.",
      "FDA requires a sample of each batch of synthetic colors to be submitted for testing and certification. Color additives derived from plant, animal or mineral sources are exempt, but have been evaluated by the agency.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that the approved dyes are safe when used according to regulations and that \u201cmost children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",
      "But critics note that added colors are a key component of ultraprocessed foods, which account for more than 70% of the U.S. diet and have been associated with a host of chronic health problems, including heart disease, diabetes and obesity.",
      "\u201cI am all for getting artificial food dyes out of the food supply,\u201d said Marion Nestle, a food policy expert. \u201cThey are strictly cosmetic, have no health or safety purpose, are markers of ultraprocessed foods and may be harmful to some children.\u201d",
      "Color is powerful driver of consumer behavior and changes can backfire, Giusti noted. In 2016, food giant General Mills removed artificial dyes from Trix cereal after requests from consumers, switching to natural sources including turmeric, strawberries and radishes.",
      "But the cereal lost its neon colors, resulting in more muted hues \u2014 and a consumer backlash. Trix fans said they missed the bright colors and familiar taste of the cereal. In 2017, the company switched back.",
      "\u201cWhen it\u2019s a product you already love, that you\u2019re used to consuming, and it changes slightly, then it may not really be the same experience,\u201d Giusti said. \u201cAnnouncing a regulatory change is one step, but then the implementation is another thing.\u201d",
      "Kennedy, the health secretary, said U.S. officials have an \u201cunderstanding\u201d with food companies to phase out artificial colors. Industry officials told The Associated Press that there is no formal agreement.",
      "However, several companies have said they plan to accelerate a shift to natural colors in some of their products.",
      "PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said most of its products are already free of artificial colors, and that its Lays and Tostitos brands will phase them out by the end of this year. He said the company plans to phase out artificial colors \u2014 or at least offer consumers a natural alternative \u2014 over the next few years.",
      "Representatives for General Mills said they\u2019re \u201ccommitted to continuing the conversation\u201d with the administration. WK Kellogg officials said they are reformulating cereals used in the nation\u2019s school lunch programs to eliminate the artificial dyes and will halt any new products containing them starting next January.",
      "Sensient officials wouldn\u2019t confirm which companies are seeking help making the switch, but they said they\u2019re ready for the surge.",
      "\u201cNow that there\u2019s a date, there\u2019s the timeline,\u201d Manning said. \u201cIt certainly requires action.\u201d",

      "Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves has taken another step in his shift toward a tough-on-crime stance, announcing plans to build a new prison in the Central American nation modeled on the maximum security gang prison in El Salvador",
      "SAN JOSE, Costa Rica -- Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves took another step in his shift toward a tough-on-crime stance, announcing plans to build a new prison in the Central American nation modeled on the maximum security gang prison in El Salvador.",
      "With the announcement Friday during a visit to the Reforma prison, Chaves was channeling El Salvador President Nayib Bukele who he recognized last year with Costa Rica\u2019s highest diplomatic honor for his decimation of that country\u2019s gangs.",
      "In addition to building a new prison, Chaves said the small shops selling things inside existing prisons would be shut down. Permission for conjugal visits would be restricted and authorities would tighten the ability of families to bring food to inmates.",
      "The restrictions were aimed at stopping drugs being brought into prisons and other illicit activities.",
      "Costa Rica continues to struggle with historically high homicide numbers.",
      "In 2023, Costa Rica set a homicide record with 907, down somewhat in 2024 to 880. So far this year, the country is on nearly the same homicide pace as last year, according to government data.",
      "Chaves spoke Friday of an \u201calliance\u201d with El Salvador and said he was working to line up financing for the new prison.",
      "Bukele built his massive new prison to hold alleged gang members among the 85,000 people arrested under his state of emergency for three years as his administration crushed the country\u2019s powerful street gangs.",
      "That prison has received even more attention since the U.S. government shipped more than 200 Venezuelans it accused of gang ties in March. El Salvador's prisons have been criticized as legal black holes where a lack of due process makes it difficult for people to get out.",
      "Bukele had visited the same Costa Rican prison last year with Chaves.",
      "Relatives of inmates saw the measures as harsh and have protested.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t have privileges, they\u2019re rights, they took away their right to see their childen, the right to have a visit and to eat food from home,\u201d said Katherine L\u00f3pez, the wife of an inmate.",

      "Polls have opened in Singapore\u2019s general election that is seen as the first key test of support for Prime Minister Lawrence Wong",
      "SINGAPORE -- Polls opened Saturday in Singapore\u2019s general election that is seen as the first key test of support for Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who took office last year.",
      "His People\u2019s Action Party is widely expected to comfortably extend its 66-year dominance in the city-state. But the election is being closely watched as people express unhappiness over tight government control and a high cost of living.",
      "Wong, a U.S.-trained economist who is also finance minister, has appealed for a resounding mandate to steer trade-reliant Singapore through economic turbulence following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff hikes. The government has lowered its trade forecast and warned of a possible recession.",
      "\u201cThis election is couched as a test of the support for the leadership of PM Lawrence Wong but it also will reflect how politics in Singapore are changing, namely an embrace of alternative voices and a younger generation seeing the PAP\u201d under a younger leader, Southeast Asia political expert Bridget Welsh said.",
      "Wong, 52, succeeded Lee Hsien Loong, who stepped down a year ago after two decades at the helm. Lee remained in the Cabinet as a senior minister. But his retirement as premier ended a family dynasty started by his father, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore\u2019s first leader, who built the former colonial backwater into one of the world\u2019s richest nations during 31 years in office.",
      "Voting in Singapore is compulsory, with nearly 2.76 million people eligible to cast ballots. The PAP has secured five of the 97 parliamentary seats because they were unopposed. Voting ends at 8.p.m., and results will be announced the same night.",
      "The PAP is seen as a beacon of stability and prosperity, but Singapore\u2019s reputation for tight government control and the rising cost of living in one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities also has led to growing unhappiness, especially among younger voters. Widening income disparity, increasingly unaffordable housing, overcrowding and restrictions on free speech have loosened the PAP\u2019s grip on power.",
      "The PAP\u2019s share of the popular vote slipped to a near-record low of 61% in 2020 elections, down from nearly 70% in 2015. Although it kept 83 out of 93 parliamentary sets, the opposition gained grounds with a record 10 seats.",
      "Eugene Tan, law professor with the Singapore Management University, said young voters \u2014 estimated to be about a quarter of the electorate \u2014 are more receptive to appeals for greater political diversity and competition in Singapore. Young people flocked to the Workers Party\u2019s rallies during the nine-day campaign period.",
      "The opposition says giving it a stronger presence in Parliament will allow a more balanced political system and greater accountability. But they face an uphill task, often hamstrung by a lack of resources and fragmented support. Critics said gerrymandering also gives the PAP an advantage. The biggest opposition contender, the Workers Party, is fielding only 26 seats with smaller parties contesting others.",
      "Wong has sought to refresh the PAP, which fielded 32 new faces as several veterans bowed out. He has engaged younger voters through social media and promised to develop a more balanced and inclusive Singapore. With some of his ministers in close fights with the WP, Wong has warned more votes for the opposition would weaken the PAP team in navigating economic troubles ahead.",
      "A further dip in the PAP\u2019s popular support or ceding more seats to the opposition would be a blow for Wong.",
      "\u201cExpectations are to not reach below 60% popular vote. This is the threshold. If there are improvements, this will empower PM Wong and his broad changes within the PAP. If PM Wong does badly... there might be a challenge to his leadership,\u201d Welsh said.",

    "story": [
      "Many Australians arriving at polling places on Saturday followed their civic duty with a democracy sausage",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Many Australians arriving at polling places on Saturday followed their civic duty by eating what\u2019s become known as a democracy sausage, a cultural tradition as Aussie as koalas and Vegemite, and for some just as important as casting their vote.",
      "The grilled sausage wrapped in a slice of white bread and often topped with onions and ketchup is a regular fixture of Antipodean public life. But when offered at polling places on election day, the humble treat is elevated to a democracy sausage \u2014 a national, if light-heated, symbol for electoral participation.",
      "Or, as a website tracking real-time, crowd-sourced democracy sausage locations on polling day notes: \u201cIt\u2019s practically part of the Australian Constitution.\u201d",
      "But the tradition is far from political. Cooking and selling the snacks outside polling places is the most lucrative fundraising event of the year for many school and community groups.",
      "Democracy sausages are served everywhere Australians vote. Ahead of Saturday\u2019s ballot, and on election day, they were due to appear at polling places for citizens abroad on nearly every continent \u2014 at Australian embassies in New York, Riyadh, Nairobi and Tokyo, and even at a research station in Antarctica.",
      "The friends who run the apolitical and nonpartisan website democracysausage.org began the project in 2013, when they struggled to find information about which polling places would offer food on election day, spokesperson Alex Dawson told The Associated Press.",
      "Now Dawson and his friends help voters choose their polling place with a site that has expanded to catalogue details of gluten free, vegan and halal democracy sausage options, and the availability of other treats such as cake and coffee. It makes for a hectic election day.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll usually rope in a few friends to keep an eye on incoming submissions about either stalls that we don\u2019t already know about, or tip-offs to find out if a location has run out of sausages,\u201d Dawson said. The volunteers take a lunchtime break to cast their own votes, and, naturally, enjoy a democracy sausage.",
      "At the 2022 election, the website registered 2,200 of Australia\u2019s 7,000 polling places as serving democracy sausages or other snacks and Dawson expected at least that number would participate on Saturday. Groups running the stalls made $4.1 million Australian dollars ($2.6 million) in profits in 2022, he said.",
      "No one\u2019s sure who coined the term democracy sausage. But fundraising snacks have been served at Australia\u2019s voting booths for close to a century, said Judith Brett, a professor of politics at Melbourne\u2019s LaTrobe University and author of the book \u201cFrom Secret Ballot to Democracy Sausage: How Australia Got Compulsory Voting.\u201d",
      "What began with polling place bake sales in the 1920s became election day sausage sizzles in the 1980s with the invention of the portable barbeque grill. The democracy sausage\u2019s success is partly because of how Australia votes.",
      "Elections always occur on Saturdays and are family affairs \u2014 voters arrive with their children and dogs. And turning up to vote is required by law, resulting in turnouts higher than 90% and ensuring a captive market for democracy sausage sales.",
      "Brett attributed the sausage\u2019s appeal to the Australian sense of humor \u2014 \u201cIt was a bit of a joke,\u201d she said \u2014 and its grassroots origins.",
      "\u201cGovernment didn\u2019t think it up, a political party didn\u2019t think it up as a slogan,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that binds everyone together,\u201d Dawson said. In 2016, the Australian National Dictionary Centre named \u201cdemocracy sausage\u201d as its word of the year.",
      "The sausage has also proved a political cipher, a way for aspiring leaders to show they\u2019re humble enough to consume a cheap piece of meat wrapped in bread, at times with mixed results. Photographs of politicians eating democracy sausages in bizarre and ungainly ways have become memes or episodes of Australian political folklore.",
      "\u201cIt has been a way, I think, of connecting a younger generation, a social media generation, into the civic rituals of election day,\u201d Brett said.",
      "Some commentators suggest that early voting could spell the end for the democracy sausage. More than 4 million Australians went to the polls before election day, a new record. But Dawson said he wasn\u2019t worried, because those who voted early could still drop by a polling place on Saturday to buy a snack.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve heard reports of people who are tourists over here, foreign students, that will go along to election days just to get the sausages,\u201d he added. \u201cI think that\u2019s a great piece of Australian culture for people to take home with them.\u201d",

      "The RSF said on its Telegram channel Friday that it destroyed vehicles belonging to the army and seized their weapons and ammunition during the battle for Al Nahud. The paramilitary group also claimed that it managed to secure the city's facilities and markets after defeating the army.",
      "The war erupted on April 15, 2023, with pitched battles between the military and the RSF in the streets of the capital Khartoum that quickly spread to other parts of the country.",
      "RSF attacks in Al Nahud have killed more than 300 unarmed civilians, the Preliminary Committee of Sudan Doctors\u2019 Trade Union said on Facebook on Friday. The Associated Press couldn\u2019t independently verify that figure.",
      "The Resistance Committees of Al Nahud condemned the RSF attacks, which it said began Thursday morning.",
      "\u201cThey invaded the city, stormed residential neighborhoods, terrorized unarmed civilians, and committed cold-blooded murders against innocent civilians whose only crime was to cling to their dignity and refuse to leave their homes to the machine of killing and terror,\u201d the Resistance Committees said Thursday on Facebook.",
      "An army loss of Al Nahud would impact its operational capabilities in Northern Kordofan state, according to the Sudan War Monitor, an open source collaborative project that has been documenting the two-year-war. Al Nahud is a strategic town because it\u2019s located along a main road that the army could use to advance into the Darfur region, which the RSF mostly controls.",
      "Al Nahud also shelters displaced people fleeing from Al-Obeid, Umm Kadada, Khartoum and El-Fasher \u2014 the provincial capital of North Darfur province, according to the Darfur Victims Support Organization.",
      "Meanwhile, in North Darfur, the fighting has killed at least 542 people in the last three weeks, though the actual death toll is likely higher, according to U.N. Human Rights Chief Volker T\u00fcrk. This figure includes the recent RSF attacks on El Fasher and Abu Shouk displacement camp, which killed at least 40 civilians.",
      "\u201cThe horror unfolding in Sudan knows no bounds,\u201d said T\u00fcrk i n a statement on Thursday.",
      "T\u00fcrk also mentioned \u201cextremely disturbing\u201d reports of extrajudicial killings committed by RSF, with at least 30 men in civilian clothing executed by the paramilitary fighters in Al Salha in southern Omdurman.",
      "\u201cI have personally alerted both leaders of the RSF and SAF to the catastrophic human rights consequences of this war. These harrowing consequences are a daily, lived reality for millions of Sudanese. It is well past time for this conflict to stop,\u201d said T\u00fcrk.",
      "The war in Sudan has killed at least 20,000 people, but the real toll is probably far higher. Nearly 13 million people have fled their homes, 4 million of them streaming into neighboring countries.",
      "Half the population of 50 million faces hunger. The World Food Program has confirmed famine in 10 locations and warns it could spread further, putting millions at risk of starvation.",

      "The government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in a statement underscored its historical position to not recognize the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and asserted that international law does not allow the body to \u201cinterfere\u201d or \u201cattempt to prohibit\u201d an election.",
      "The government\u2019s statement came a day after the court, based in The Hague, issued the ruling at the request of Guyana, which accused Venezuela of violating an earlier order by planning to hold elections May 25 for a governor and other officials to administer the Essequibo region.",
      "The Essequibo \u201cis an inalienable part of the Venezuelan territory and a legacy of our liberators,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cIts defense is a historical, constitutional, and a moral mandate that unites the entire Bolivarian Homeland. No international pressure, judicial blackmail, or foreign tribunal will make us back down from this conviction.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In a protected part of the Amazon, Bacuri, a young manatee that was found stranded and alone, is being raised in captivity",
      "CAXIUANA NATIONAL FOREST, Brazil -- Deep in silence, as if under a spell, children watch intently as Bacuri, a young Amazonian manatee, glides around a small plastic pool. When he surfaces for air, some of them exchange wide smiles. The soft rustle of rainforest leaves punctuated by bird song adds to the magic of the moment.",
      "The children from riverside communities traveled for hours by boat just to meet Bacuri at the field station of the Emilio Goeldi Museum, Brazil\u2019s oldest research institute in the Amazon. Despite their endangered status, manatees are still hunted and their meat illegally sold, and they are increasingly threatened by climate change. Environmentalists hope that by engaging local communities, Bacuri and others like him will be spared.",
      "The Amazonian manatee is the region\u2019s largest mammal but is rarely seen, much less up close. The reasons for this are twofold: The manatee has acute hearing and will vanish into the murky water at the slightest sound; and its population has dwindled after being overhunted for hundreds of years, mostly for its tough hides that were exported to Europe and Central America.",
      "To help the manatee population recover, several institutions are rescuing orphaned manatee calves, rehabilitating them and reintroducing them to the wild.",
      "Bacuri weighed just 22 pounds (10 kilograms) \u2014 a fraction of the more than 900 pounds (400 kilograms) of an adult manatee \u2014 when he was rescued and taken to the museum's research center in the federally protected Caxiuana National Forest. He was named after the local community that found him. Two years and several thousand milk bottles later, Bacuri has grown to about 130 pounds (60 kilos).",
      "Three institutions are responsible for his care. The Goeldi Museum provides facilities and educates nearby communities. The federal Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation assigns two staffers for 15-day shifts to feed Bacuri three bottles of milk a day as well as chopped beets and carrots, and clean the pool every 48 hours. The nonprofit Instituto Bicho d'Agua\u2014 meaning institute of water animals in Portuguese \u2014 oversees veterinary care, dietary planning and caregiver training.",
      "During their visit, the children learn that female manatees are pregnant for about a year then nurse their young for two more, feeding them from nipples behind their front flippers \u2014 the manatee equivalent of armpits. This long reproductive cycle is one reason the manatee population has not recovered from the commercial hunting that persisted until the mid-20th century.",
      "They also learn the species is endangered and that they are the ones who must protect it.",
      "\u201cYou are the main guardians,\u201d biologist Tatyanna Mari\u00facha, head of the scientific base, tells the children, who spend the rest of the day drawing and making Play-Doh models of Bacuri.",
      "With its auditorium, dormitories, observation towers, cafeteria and laboratories, the research station \u2014 two hours by speedboat from Portel, the nearest city \u2014 stands in stark contrast to nearby communities comprising clusters of wooden houses on stilts where families rely on cassava farming, fishing and harvesting a\u00e7a\u00ed berries. School field trips and community outreach aim to narrow the gap.",
      "\u201cCaxiuana is their home,\u201d Mari\u00facha told The Associated Press. \u201cWe can\u2019t just come here and do things without their consent.\u201d",
      "Local knowledge will play a key role when Bacuri is finally released. He is the only manatee calf under care at Caxiuana. Once he has fully transitioned to a plant-based diet, he\u2019ll spend time in a river enclosure before his release. That site will be selected based on where residents say wild manatees feed and pass through.",
      "If all goes as planned, Bacuri will be the first released in the Caxiuana area. Two other calves rescued in poor health died in captivity, a sadly common outcome.",
      "While subsistence hunting isn\u2019t a major threat to the species, some fishermen still sell manatee meat illegally in nearby towns. Brazil banned hunting of all wild animals in 1967, with two exceptions: Indigenous peoples are allowed to hunt, and others can kill a wild animal to satisfy the hunger of the hunter or his family.",
      "The threat of hunters has become harder to manage due to climate change, said Miriam Marmontel, a senior researcher at the Mamirau\u00e1 Institute for Sustainable Development, hundreds of miles (kilometers) upstream along the Amazon River.",
      "Dozens of dolphins died near Mamiraua in 2023, likely due to soaring water temperatures during a historic drought. Manatees avoided mass mortality then because they typically inhabit deep pools during the dry season, but recent droughts have dramatically reduced the water level, making manatees more vulnerable to poachers.",
      "\u201cAs climate change accelerates, manatees may begin to suffer from heat stress too,\u201d Marmontel said. \u201cThey also have a thermal limit, and eventually it may be crossed.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s why reintroduction efforts are so important.",
      "Around 60 rescued manatees are being cared for across the state of Para, where Caxiuana is located. Bicho d\u2019Agua is caring for four in partnership with the Federal University of Para and Brazil's environmental agency. One of the four, named Coral, was found near \u00d3bidos and airlifted 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) to the institute's facility in Castanhal. She arrived dehydrated and with severe skin burns, likely from sun exposure.",
      "\u201cThe population has declined so much that every hunted animal impacts the species,\u201d Renata Emin, president of Bicho d\u2019Agua, told AP. \u201cThat\u2019s why any effort matters, not just because one individual may return to the wild and help rebuild the population but because of the community and government engagement it inspires.\u201d",

      "BERLIN -- The German domestic intelligence service said Friday it has classified the Alternative for Germany party, which placed second in national elections in February, as a \u201cright-wing extremist effort\u201d \u2014 making it subject to greater and broader surveillance of its activities.",
      "The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution cited the \u201cextremist character\u201d of the party, known as AfD, and said it \u201cdisregards human dignity\u201d \u2014 in particular by taking aim at those who moved to Germany from mostly Muslim countries.",
      "\u201cAs of today ... (the agency) has classified the Alternative for Germany (AfD) as a confirmed right-wing extremist effort due to the extremist character of the entire party that disregards human dignity,\u2032 it said.",
      "The AfD has already been under enhanced surveillance by authorities in some regions, but the announcement by the domestic spy agency means the agency's officials can use informants and other tools such as audio and video recordings to monitor the party\u2019s activities nationwide.",
      "The office, which has warned of growing extremism in Germany, cited court decisions in two German regions in recent years that detailed party efforts to undermine a free and democratic order.",

      "\u201cThe ethnic and descent-based understanding of the people prevailing within the party is incompatible with the free democratic basic order,\u201d the intelligence service said, adding that the party's political positions have underpinned \u201ccontinuous agitation\u201d against minorities and stirred fear and hostility toward them.",

      "Under the move, any surveillance of AfD activities must abide by a \u201cprinciple of proportionality\u201d under German law.",

      "As Europe marks Victory Day over Nazi Germany, Londoner John Goldsmith still remembers the rationing, the blackouts and the bombs that devastated his neighborhood in east London",
      "LONDON -- John Goldsmith was too young to fight in World War II, but he remembers the rationing, the blackouts and the bombs that devastated his neighborhood in east London. And he remembers the party when peace returned to Europe.",
      "Church bells rang across the city, bonfires were lit and conga lines snaked through Piccadilly Circus as people filled the streets to celebrate the Allied victory over Nazi Germany. For a 14-year-old boy, May 8, 1945, also brought something else: an end to the tedium of wartime rules and restrictions.",
      "\u201cWell, it was such a contrast. Suddenly, freedom! Mucking about. Doing all sorts of things that were frowned upon as not being the right thing to do,\u201d Goldsmith, now 94, said.",
      "\u201cBut now, for instance, all these wonderful pictures of Piccadilly and places like that. Buses covered with people standing on the roof just going barmy \u2014 not necessarily due to drink or anything of that nature. But definitely, they were letting their hair down,\u2019\u2019 he added with a giggle.",
      "Victory in Europe Day was a moment of relief for a city scarred by bombing raids and rocket attacks that killed an estimated 30,000 civilians throughout the war and didn\u2019t end until just a few weeks earlier. But it was also a time to look forward to the safe return of husbands, sons, brothers \u2014 and sisters \u2014 who were serving abroad, and to hope that lives put on hold in 1939 might soon return to normal.",
      "While D-Day was all about the troops who landed on the beaches of northern France to begin the liberation of Europe, V-E Day was a moment for the public, for everyone who sacrificed for the common good.",
      "Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who had inspired Britain during its darkest days, caught the mood of the nation when he announced the victory at 3 p.m. on May 8.",
      "\u201cMy dear friends, this is your hour,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not victory of a party or of any class. It\u2019s a victory of the great British nation as a whole.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a message Goldsmith wants people to remember before the World War II generation fades from the scene. A retired architect and amateur artist, he has long regaled his family with stories of his boyhood in the Bow neighborhood of east London. After a bit of prodding from his wife, Margaret, he recently began sketching the scenes so others could see what he lived through.",
      "\u201cThe soldiers, the airmen, the sailors can\u2019t operate without the people supporting them and backing them,\u2019\u2019 Goldsmith said. \u201cSo if we the people don\u2019t contribute, the armored elements will collapse. So it\u2019s so important that V-E Day should be \u2026 the people\u2019s day.\u2019\u2019",
      "While Londoners had been anticipating the end of the fighting in Europe for weeks, the announcement was like the cork popping out of a giant bottle of champagne in a city that had lived in the shadow of war for six years.",
      "Nowhere was the relief felt more deeply than in the East End, where thousands of homes, schools and businesses were reduced to rubble as Nazi bombers pounded docks and warehouses along the River Thames during the onslaught that became known as The Blitz. When Buckingham Palace was bombed on Sept. 13, 1940, Queen Elizabeth reportedly told a policeman she was glad, because \u201cit makes me feel I can look the East End in the face.\u201d",
      "Goldsmith's drawings capture the day The Blitz began, with Nazi bombers filling the air and fires turning the night sky a molten volcanic red behind the docks. There's also the time a cricket match was suspended as one of the flying bombs known as \u201cdoodlebugs\u201d soared overhead, and the ghostly image of a rent collector emerging from a cloud of dust after a V-2 rocket, a type of long-range ballistic missile, obliterated a block of houses.",
      "The last V-2 to hit London destroyed an apartment building less than two miles from his home on March 27, 1945.",
      "Eighty years later, Goldsmith holds back tears when he remembers the moment he heard that the Nazis had surrendered.",
      "He and his friends were playing street soccer using a tennis ball \u2014 soccer balls being scarce after six years of war \u2014 when a young boy ran out of the nearby dairy and shouted simply, \u201cIt\u2019s over!\u201d",
      "\u201cI have to be very careful now, because I could break up,\u2019\u2019 Goldsmith said, pausing to collect himself. \u201cBut that was the point when you realized: \u2018I didn\u2019t have to worry anymore.\u2019\u201d",
      "People had seen the end coming, but didn\u2019t dare to believe it could be true.",
      "In an era before television, Londoners flocked to the cinema to watch the weekly newsreels that charted the Allied advance toward Berlin. Goldsmith, who was just 8 when the war broke out, tracked the progress of the troops through the newspaper, carefully clipping the headlines and maps. By early 1945, he realized the surrender of the Third Reich was near.",
      "When the news finally came, it unleashed a wave of joy that lasted for days.",
      "Goldsmith remembers climbing the steps of St. John\u2019s Church in Bethnal Green to see over the crowds that lined the streets as King George VI and Queen Elizabeth drove through East London to celebrate with the locals.",
      "There were street parties and bonfires. Everyone contributed what they could with food still in short supply.",
      "\u201cThe favorite table from the lounge was brought out in the center of the street and linked with all the other personal possessions covered up with cloth and that sort of thing,\u201d Goldsmith remembered. \u201cFood was magicked from somewhere, and kids gorged themselves on all sorts of cakes.\u201d",
      "But the celebrations were bittersweet, tempered by the knowledge that V-E Day wasn't the end of the war.",
      "\u201cThere was a sudden realization. There was still the Japanese situation in the Far East,\" Goldsmith said. \"And people then buckled down.\u2019\u2019",

      "\u201cConclave,\u201d the film may have introduced movie-goers to the spectacular ritual and drama of a modern conclave, but the periodic voting to elect a new pope has been going on for centuries and created a whole genre of historical trivia",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 \u201cConclave,\u201d the movie, may have introduced movie-goers to the spectacular ritual and drama of a modern conclave, but the periodic voting to elect a new pope has been going on for centuries and created a whole genre of historical trivia.",
      "Here are some fun facts about conclaves past, derived from historical studies including Miles Pattenden's \u201cElecting the Pope in Early Modern Italy, 1450\u20131700\u201d and interviews with experts including Elena Cangiano, an archeologist at Viterbo's Palazzo dei Papi (Palace of the Popes).",
      "In the 13th century, it took almost three years \u2014 1,006 days to be exact \u2014 to choose Pope Clement IV's successor, making it the longest conclave in the Catholic Church\u2019s history. It's also where the term conclave comes from \u2014 \"under lock and key,\" because the cardinals who were meeting in Viterbo, north of Rome, took so long the town's frustrated citizens locked them in the room.",
      "The secret vote that elected Pope Gregory X lasted from November 1268 to September 1271. It was the first example of a papal election by \u201ccompromise,\u201d after a long struggle between supporters of two main geopolitical medieval factions \u2014 those faithful to the papacy and those supporting the Holy Roman Empire.",
      "Gregory X was elected only after Viterbo residents tore the roof off the building where the prelates were staying and restricted their meals to bread and water to pressure them to come to a conclusion. Hoping to avoid a repeat, Gregory X decreed in 1274 that cardinals would only get \u201cone meal a day\u201d if the conclave stretched beyond three days, and only \u201cbread, water and wine\u201d if it went beyond eight. That restriction has been dropped.",
      "Before 1274, there were times when a pope was elected the same day as the death of his predecessor. After that, however, the church decided to wait at least 10 days before the first vote. Later that was extended to 15 days to give all cardinals time to get to Rome. The quickest conclave observing the 10-day wait rule appears to have been the 1503 election of Pope Julius II, who was elected in just a few hours, according to Vatican historian Ambrogio Piazzoni. In more recent times, Pope Francis was elected in 2013 on the fifth ballot, Benedict XVI won in 2005 on the fourth and Pope Pius XII won on the third in 1939.",
      "The first conclave held under Michelangelo's frescoed ceiling in the Sistine Chapel was in 1492. Since 1878, the world-renowned chapel has become the venue of all conclaves. \u201cEverything is conducive to an awareness of the presence of God, in whose sight each person will one day be judged,\u201d St. John Paul II wrote in his 1996 document regulating the conclave, \u201cUniversi Dominici Gregis.\u201d The cardinals sleep a short distance away in the nearby Domus Santa Marta hotel or a nearby residence.",
      "Most conclaves were held in Rome, with some taking place outside the Vatican walls. Four were held in the Pauline Chapel of the papal residence at the Quirinale Palace, while some 30 others were held in St. John Lateran Basilica, Santa Maria Sopra Minerva or other places in Rome. On 15 occasions they took place outside Rome and the Vatican altogether, including in Viterbo, Perugia, Arezzo and Venice in Italy, and Konstanz, Germany and Lyon, France.",
      "Between 1378-1417, referred by historians to as the Western Schism, there were rival claimants to the title of pope. The schism produced multiple papal contenders, the so-called anti-popes, splitting the Catholic Church for nearly 40 years. The most prominent anti-popes during the Western Schism were Clement VII, Benedict XIII, Alexander V, and John XXIII. The schism was ultimately resolved by the Council of Constance in 1417, which led to the election of Martin V, a universally accepted pontiff.",
      "The cloistered nature of the conclave posed another challenge for cardinals: staying healthy. Before the Domus Santa Marta guest-house was built in 1996, cardinal electors slept on cots in rooms connected to the Sistine Chapel. Conclaves in the 16th and 17th centuries were described as \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cbadly smelling,\u201d with concern about disease outbreaks, particularly in summer, according to historian Miles Pattenden. \u201cThe cardinals simply had to have a more regular and comfortable way of living because they were old men, many of them with quite advanced disease,\u201d Pattenden wrote. The enclosed space and lack of ventilation further aggravated these issues. Some of the electors left the conclave sick, often seriously.",
      "Initially, papal elections weren\u2019t as secretive but concerns about political interference soared during the longest conclave in Viterbo. Gregory X decreed that cardinal electors should be locked in seclusion, \u201ccum clave\u201d (with a key), until a new pope was chosen. The purpose was to create a totally secluded environment where the cardinals could focus on their task, guided by God\u2019s will, without any political interference or distractions. Over the centuries, various popes have modified and reinforced the rules surrounding the conclave, emphasizing the importance of secrecy.",
      "Pope John XII was just 18 when he was elected in 955. The oldest popes were Pope Celestine III (elected in 1191) and Celestine V (elected in 1294) who were both nearly 85. Benedict XVI was 78 when he was elected in 2005.",
      "There is no requirement that a pope be a cardinal, but that has been the case for centuries. The last time a pope was elected who wasn\u2019t a cardinal was Urban VI in 1378. He was a monk and archbishop of Bari. While the Italians have had a stranglehold on the papacy over centuries, there have been many exceptions aside from John Paul II (Polish in 1978) and Benedict XVI (German in 2005) and Francis (Argentine in 2013). Alexander VI, elected in 1492, was Spanish; Gregory III, elected in 731, was Syrian; Adrian VI, elected in 1522, was from the Netherlands.",

    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long been on a campaign against Iran's nuclear program and his opposition helped convince President Trump to withdraw from an Obama era deal meant to rein it in",
      "JERUSALEM -- When the U.S. and Iran met for nuclear talks a decade ago, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu railed against an emerging deal from the world\u2019s most public stages, including in a fiery speech to Congress seen as a direct challenge to the Obama administration as it was wrapping up the talks.",
      "Now, as the sides sit down to discuss a new deal, Netanyahu has fallen silent.",
      "Netanyahu sees an Iran with nuclear weapons as an existential threat to Israel, and he is just as wary of any new U.S. agreement with its archenemy that may not meet his standards. Yet he finds himself shackled with Donald Trump in the White House.",
      "Netanyahu is unwilling to publicly criticize a president who has shown broad support for Israel, whom he deems to be Israel's greatest friend, and who doesn't take well to criticism.",
      "He \u201ccan't do anything that goes against Trump. He's paralyzed,\u201d said Yoel Guzansky, an Iran expert at the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv-based think tank.",
      "Israel is in a position of power against Iran after a series of strategic achievements over the past 18 months in the wars that have shaken the Middle East. It thrashed Iran\u2019s allies in Lebanon, Gaza and Syria, and directly attacked Iran last year, neutralizing some of its key air defenses. Experts say Israel now has a window of opportunity for what could be an effective strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, with possibly less regional blowback.",
      "Yet Israel\u2019s leader was recently unable to galvanize Trump to prioritize a strike against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities \u2014 which would likely hinge on U.S. military assistance to be successful. With the U.S. negotiating with Iran, Israel has little legitimacy to pursue a military option on its own.",
      "\u201cNetanyahu is trapped,\u201d said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv. \u201cHe was banking on Israel\u2019s position relative to Iran to improve under Trump. In practice, it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu and his nationalist supporters hoped Trump\u2019s return to the White House would be advantageous because of his history of support for Israel. They thought that, under Trump, the U.S. might back a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities.",
      "But Trump\u2019s approach to Iran \u2014 as well as on other issues, such as tariffs \u2014 has shown the relationship is more complicated, and that Trump\u2019s interests don\u2019t entirely align with Netanyahu\u2019s.",
      "Netanyahu has long accused Iran of developing a nuclear weapon and went on a global campaign against the Obama deal. He painted the nuclear program as an existential threat to Israel and the world, and said the agreement was too weak to contain it. Israel remains the Mideast's only nuclear-armed state, an advantage it would like to keep.",
      "With Netanyahu's strong encouragement, Trump backed out of the deal struck by Obama. And since returning to the White House, Trump has given Israel free rein in its war against Hamas in Gaza, been soft on the worsening humanitarian crisis in the territory and launched strikes against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have attacked Israel since the start of the war.",
      "But now that the U.S. has returned to the negotiating table with Iran, Netanyahu would risk jeopardizing his good ties with the president if he were to publicly oppose one of his administration\u2019s key foreign policy initiatives.",
      "The last time Netanyahu crossed the temperamental Trump was when he congratulated Joe Biden for his election win in 2020. Trump was apparently offended by the perceived disloyalty, and their ties went into deep freeze.",
      "Israel is communicating to Washington its priorities for any deal. As part of that, it understood that should Israel choose to carry out a strike on Iran, it would likely be doing so alone \u2014 so long as negotiations were underway, according to an Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.",
      "In a speech in Jerusalem this week, Netanyahu said he had discussed his terms for a deal with Trump. He explained that it would need to dismantle all the infrastructure of Iran's nuclear program and that it should work to prevent Iran from developing ballistic missiles capable of delivering a bomb.",
      "\"I said to President Trump that I hope that this is what the negotiators will do. We\u2019re in close contact with the United States. But I said one way or the other \u2013 Iran will not have nuclear weapons,\u201d he said.",
      "Netanyahu has said he would favor a strict diplomatic agreement similar to Libya\u2019s deal in 2003 to destroy its nuclear facilities and allow inspectors unfettered access. However, it is not clear if Trump will set such strict conditions \u2014 and Iran has rejected giving up its right to enrich.",
      "The Trump-led talks with Iran began earlier this month and have advanced to expert discussions over how to rein in Iran's nuclear program and prevent it from being able to obtain atomic weapons, should it choose to pursue them. Iran says its program is for peaceful purposes, though some officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb.",
      "While Trump has said a military option remains on the table, and has moved military assets to the region, he says he prefers a diplomatic solution. Planned talks between Iran and the United States this weekend were postponed on Thursday.",
      "Since Trump scrapped the Obama-era agreement in 2018, Iran has ramped up its nuclear enrichment and increased its uranium stockpile.",
      "Netanyahu's 2015 speech to Congress against Obama's deal \u2014 at the invitation of Republicans \u2014 was made without consulting the White House. Obama did not attend.",
      "That was just one of many instances in which Netanyahu was seen as cozying up to Republicans, driving a wedge in what has traditionally been bipartisan support for Israel. That, coupled with Netanyahu's strained relationship with the Biden administration over Israel's conduct in Gaza, has meant that Netanyahu can't rely on Democratic allies to take up his cause.",
      "Still, Netanyahu would struggle to find any Republicans willing to publicly confront the president on this issue. And he himself will struggle to criticize a deal if one is clinched; instead, he might send surrogates like his far-right allies to do so, said Gilboa of Bar-Ilan University.",
      "But until then, Gilboa said, Netanyahu's best hope is that the talks fail.",
      "\u201cThat, for him, will be the best case scenario.\u201d",

      "South Korea is holding an early presidential election on June 3 after conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol was ousted over his imposition of martial law. Han was appointed prime minister, the No. 2 post, by Yoon, and he served as acting leader after Yoon was suspended and later removed from office.",
      "Han also was prime minister under liberal President Roh Moo-hyun from 2007 to 2008 and has served as trade minister, finance minister and ambassador to the U.S. during his 40-year career in public service. He has never held elected office but has risen politically as the main conservative People Power Party struggles in the wake of Yoon\u2019s ouster.",
      "Han does not belong to a political party, but contenders in the PPP have said they are willing to field a single candidate among them and Han. PPP members are scheduled to nominate their party's candidate Saturday.",
      "Han said that if elected, he would launch a body to amend the constitution so the president and the assembly share powers based on the principle of checks and balances. His revisions would also bar the political circle and the judiciary branch from meddling in each other's sectors.",
      "In South Korea, executive power is heavily concentrated on a president, and there have been calls for change.",
      "The election June 3 will give the new president a full, single five-year term. But Han said he would serve three years to finish the constitutional revision and then leave.",

      "Lee's main liberal opposition Democratic Party stepped up its offensive against Han, saying he is abandoning his duties as the government's caretaker and lacks the moral standing to run for the presidency as a No. 2 official in the Yoon administration, responsible for many policy failures.",

      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro is pressing on his struggling plan to overhaul the country\u2019s labor laws",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Thursday pressed on with his struggling plan to overhaul the country\u2019s labor laws, sending Congress a referendum proposal whose questions for voters include whether workdays should be limited to eight hours and whether workers should receive double pay if they work during holidays.",
      "With much of his agenda repeatedly blocked by Congress, Petro is now betting that the same lawmakers who twice rejected his labor reform will allow voters to decide whether they want his proposed changes. Congress has one month to approve or reject the 12-question referendum.",
      "Petro, Colombia\u2019s first ever leftist president, sought to rally support for his project by participating in a union demonstration in the capital, Bogota, marking Labor Day.",
      "\u201cThe people of Colombia want to vote for their fundamental rights, for their dignity,\" Petro said before thousands of demonstrators, asking them to not vote to reelect any lawmaker who votes against the referendum.",
      "If approved by lawmakers, Petro will have to issue a decree summoning Colombians to the polls within three months. Questions for voters would include whether daytime workdays should end at 6 p.m. and whether open-ended contracts should be offered to workers to prioritize job stability.",
      "But overcoming Congress is not Petro\u2019s only concern in seeing his project become a reality. He needs referendum participation to exceed 13 million \u2013 that\u2019s more than the number of votes he obtained to become president \u2013 and more than half of those votes must be in favor of his proposal.",
      "Analysts agree that Petro has the upper hand in several scenarios, even if Congress does not approve the referendum or if he fails to obtain the necessary votes at the polls. In the former scenario, Sandra Borda, political science professor at the University of the Andes, said lawmakers would give Petro\u2019s government the tools to \u201cplay the victim\u201d and strengthen its rhetoric against Congress.",
      "\u201cThe message the government has constantly tried to send is that Congress is no longer an entity that represents the interests of the people... but rather defends the interests, as they call them, of the private sector oligarchies,\u201d Borda said.",
      "On the other hand, if voters end up going to the polls, the government could consider itself the winner by securing support from its electoral base, said Javier Garay, a political science professor at the Externship University of Colombia. He noted that the referendum\u2019s underlying purpose is to test the government\u2019s electoral support ahead of the 2026 presidential election.",
      "Union members who were among the thousands of people demonstrating Thursday in Bogota expressed support for the referendum.",
      "\u201cThe referendum is a vindication of workers\u2019 rights, which have been a struggle for decades and were taken away from us by previous far-right governments,\u201d said Jes\u00fas Parra, 53, one of the protesters.",

      "NEW YORK -- Tesla sales plunged by more than half last month in several European countries in a sign that Elon Musk could struggle to revive the company after he shifts from his Washington work to running the automaker again.",
      "Tesla sales collapsed in April by more than two-thirds from a year earlier in Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark, according to auto groups and government agencies Friday. Sales at the Austin, Texas, company dropped by 59% in France and 38% in Norway.",
      "The countries are not major drivers of sales overall, but they are the first to report April results and thus a foretaste of possible trouble elsewhere as Tesla reels from protests and boycotts over Musk wading into politics.",
      "In Germany, where he told voters their country was lost if they didn't vote for a candidate widely derided for her extreme views, sales plunged 62% in the first three months this year. German sales for April are not out yet.",
      "Financial analysts covering Tesla are worried about the Musk backlash but caution it's not clear exactly how much to blame politics for the hit. Other factors suppressing sales include Tesla's aging model lineup and new offerings from rival electric vehicles makers, such as China BYD.",
      "Tesla also had to shut down factories for several weeks this year while upgrading its best selling Model Y sport utility vehicle, pinching supply. And the company is still waiting for European regulators to approve its partial self-driving features in its cars, a big selling point in the U.S. and China.",
      "\u201cWe could see sales come back once they get it,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein, though he added about the April figures, \u201cIt's never a good thing when you have large sales declines like this.\u201d",
      "The disappointing numbers come a little over a week since Musk told investors on a first-quarter conference call that he would be stepping back from his work in Washington as President Donald Trump's chain-saw wielding cost-cutting czar. Musk has shut down whole government departments as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and thrown tens of thousands of public workers out of their jobs.",
      "On the call, Musk said he would be spending only one or two days a week on DOGE work starting in May, acceding to demands that he refocus on his job as Tesla's chief executive officer.",
      "The stock has been rising since that announcement despite crumbling financial figures. Profits in the first quarter fell 71%.",
      "The sales hit in April was the worst in Sweden, where Mobility Sweden said they fell 81%. That was followed by a 74% plunge in the Netherlands and a 67% drop in Denmark, according to the Dutch trade association BOVAG and Mobility Denmark respectively.",
      "The Norwegian Road Traffic Information Council reported a 38% drop in that country.",

      "Wall Street extended its gains to a ninth straight day, marking its longest winning streak since 2004 and reclaiming the ground it lost since President Donald Trump escalated his trade war in early April. The rally on Friday was spurred by a better-than-expected report on the job market and resurgent hope of a ratcheting down of the trade showdown with China. The S&P 500 climbed 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.4%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.5%. Treasury yields rose in the bond market after the government reported that employers added more jobs than forecast in April.",
      "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.",
      "Stocks rallied in afternoon trading on Wall Street Friday following a stronger-than-expected report on the U.S. job market.",
      "The S&P 500 gained 1.6%, putting the index on track for a ninth straight day of gains. That would mark the longest winning streak for the benchmark index in two decades.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 582 points, or 1.4%, as of 2:35 p.m. Eastern. The Nasdaq composite rose 1.8%.",
      "The gains were broad. Roughly 90% of stocks and every sector in the S&P 500 advanced. Technology stocks were among the companies doing the heaviest lifting. Microsoft rose 2.6% and Nvidia rose 3%. Apple, however, fell 4% after the iPhone maker estimated that tariffs will cost it $900 million.",
      "Banks and other financial companies also made solid gains. JPMorgan Chase rose 2.4% and Visa added 1.3%.",
      "Employers added 177,000 jobs in April. That marks a slowdown in hiring from March, but it was solidly better than economists anticipated. However, the latest job figures don\u2019t yet reflect the effects on the economy of President Donald Trump\u2019s across-the-board tariffs against America\u2019s trading partners. Many of the more severe tariffs that were supposed to go into effect in April were delayed by three months, with the notable exception of tariffs against China.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen how financial markets will react if the administration moves forward with their initial tariff plan, so unless they take a different tack in July when the 90-day pause expires, we will see market action similar to the first week of April,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management.",
      "The S&P 500 slumped 9.1% during the first week of April as Trump announced a major escalation of his trade war with more tariffs. The market has now clawed back its losses since then, helped by a string of resilient earnings reports from U.S. companies, hopes for de-escalation of trade tensions with China and expectations that the Federal Reserve will still be able to cut rates a few times this year.",
      "The job market is being closely watched for signs of stress amid trade war tensions. Strong employment has helped fuel solid consumer spending and economic growth over the last few years. Economists are now worried about the impact that taxes on imports will have on consumers and businesses, especially about how higher costs will hurt hiring and spending.",
      "The economy is already showing signs of stress. The U.S. economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace during the first quarter of the year. It was slowed by a surge in imports as businesses tried to get ahead of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "The current round of tariffs and the on-again-off-again nature of Trump\u2019s policy has overshadowed planning for businesses and households. Companies have been cutting and withdrawing financial forecasts because of the uncertainty over how much tariffs will cost them and how much they will squeeze consumers and sap spending.",
      "Hopes remain that Trump will roll back some of his tariffs after negotiating trade deals with other countries. China has been a key target, with tariffs of 145%. Its Commerce Ministry said Beijing is evaluating overtures from the U.S. regarding the tariffs.",
      "Investors had a relatively quiet day of earnings reports following a busy week. Exxon Mobil was up 0.6%, recovering from an early slide, after reporting its lowest first-quarter profit in years. Rival Chevron rose 1.6% after it also reported its smallest first-quarter profit in years.",
      "Falling crude oil prices have weighed on the sector. Crude oil prices in the U.S. are down about 17% for the year. They fell below $60 per barrel this week, which is a level at which many producers can no longer turn a profit.",
      "Block slumped 20.5% after reporting a sharp drop in first-quarter profit that fell short of analysts' forecasts. The financial technology company behind Cash App cited a pullback in consumer spending on travel and other discretionary items as a key reason for the results.",
      "Treasury yields rose in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.32% from 4.22% late Thursday.",

      "\u201cIt was ash. There was nothing,\u201d Heline said.",
      "The couple, who have two daughters, have lived in the neighborhood for more than 30 years. They couldn\u2019t imagine giving up and not rebuilding.",
      "\u201cNot only are we building another house, we\u2019re building the exact same house again,\u201d Heline said, noting the new home will have some upgrades including fire-resistant materials and sprinklers for the exterior of the house.",
      "Recently, they cleared debris from the land where the house once stood, a particularly onerous task because the home featured a large basement into which much of the structure collapsed as it burned.",
      "Heline isn't sure when construction will begin, but figures it could be two or three years. She wonders, however, what the neighborhood will look like by then.",
      "\u201cWhat are you going back to? You\u2019re going back to a moonscape? Are you there and no one else is on your block, or are you going back to a construction zone for many more years?\" she said.",
      "The Eaton wildfire destroyed many of the more than 270 historic Janes Cottages in Altadena, including the three-bedroom home Tim Vordtriede shared with his wife and two young children.",
      "The family had only lived in the roughly 100-year-old house for three years.",
      "\u201cWe just loved the storybook cottage and the vibe, and of course the grander vibe of Altadena,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was perfect.\u201d",
      "Vordtriede, 44, has decided to rebuild, but not just yet. For now, he is using his experience as a construction project manager to help others who also lost their homes.",
      "He co-founded Altadena Collective, a group providing assistance with home designs and guidance on how to navigate the complex and lengthy approval process for rebuilding permits. Of the roughly two dozen clients that the group is serving, at reduced cost, three are in the early stages of the permitting process.",
      "Even after projects reach shovel-ready status, homeowners will have to wait perhaps more than a year before they can move in, he said.",
      "\u201cMy first statement when anyone walks in the door is: We\u2019re not here to help you design your dream home,\u201d Vordtriede said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a dream time. This is a nightmare, and our job is to get you out of the nightmare as soon as possible.\u201d",

      "Home ownership is receding further out of reach for most Americans as elevated mortgage rates and rising prices stretch the limits of what buyers can afford",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Home ownership is receding further out of reach for most Americans as elevated mortgage rates and rising prices stretch the limits of what buyers can afford.",
      "A homebuyer now needs to earn at least $114,000 a year to afford a $431,250 home -- the national median listing price in April, according to data released Thursday by Realtor.com",
      "The analysis assumes that a homebuyer will make a 20% down payment, finance the rest of the purchase with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, and that the buyer\u2019s housing costs won't exceed 30% of their gross monthly income \u2014 an often-used barometer of housing affordability.",
      "Based off the latest U.S. median home listing price, homebuyers need to earn $47,000 more a year to afford a home than they would have just six years ago. Back then, the median U.S. home listing price was $314,950, and the average rate on a 30-year mortgage hovered around 4.1%. This week, the rate averaged 6.76%.",
      "The annual income required to afford a median-priced U.S. home first crossed into the six figures in May 2022 and hasn't dropped below that level since. Median household income was about $80,600 annually in 2023, according to the U.S. Census bureau.",
      "In several metro areas, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and Boston, the annual income needed to afford a median-priced home tops $200,000. In San Jose, it's more than $370,000.",
      "Rock-bottom mortgage rates turbocharged the housing market during the pandemic, fueling bidding wars for homes that pushed up sale prices sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars above a seller initial asking price. U.S. home prices soared more than 50% between 2019 and 2024.",
      "The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from their pandemic-era lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. In March, they posted their largest monthly drop since November 2022.",
      "It's not all bad news for prospective homebuyers.",
      "Home prices are rising much more slowly than during the pandemic housing market frenzy. The national median sales price of a previously occupied U.S. home rose 2.7% in March from a year earlier to $403,700, an all-time high for March, but the smallest annual increase since August.",
      "In April, the median price of a home listed for sale rose only 0.3% from a year earlier, according to Realtor.com.",
      "Buyers who can afford current mortgage rates have a wider selection of properties now than a year ago.",
      "Active listings \u2014 a tally that encompasses all homes on the market except those pending a finalized sale \u2014 surged 30.6% last month from a year earlier, according to Realtor.com. Home listings jumped between 67.6% and 70.1% in San Diego, San Jose and Washington D.C.",
      "As properties take longer to sell, more sellers are reducing their asking price. Some 18% of listings had their price reduced last month, according to Realtor.com.",
      "\u201cSellers are becoming more flexible on pricing, underscored by the price reductions we\u2019re seeing, and while higher mortgage rates are certainly weighing on demand, the silver lining is that the market is starting to rebalance,\u201d said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. \"This could create opportunities for buyers who are prepared.\u201d",

      "The company said the idling of two Pennsylvania plants, one in Steelton and one in Conshohocken, and one in Riverdale, Illinois, is due to \u201cinsufficient demand and pricing\u201d and nothing to do with President Donald Trump's tariffs.",

      "The White House plans to unveil President Donald Trump\u2019s 2026 budget, his first since returning to power",
      "WASHINGTON -- The White House is planning on Friday to unveil President Donald Trump's 2026 budget, a sweeping framework that is expected to propose steep reductions, if not a wholesale zeroing out, of various federal programs as part of his administration's priorities.",
      "Budgets do not become law but serve as a touchstone for the upcoming fiscal year debates. Often considered a statement of values, this first budget since Trump's return to the White House carries the added weight of defining the Republican president's second-term pursuits, alongside his party in Congress.",
      "The White House's Office of Management and Budget, headed by Russell Vought, a chief architect of Project 2025, confirmed Friday's planned release. It is expected to be the so-called \u201cskinny\u201d version of topline numbers, with more details to come.",
      "\u201cDetails soon,\u201d Vought said during a Cabinet meeting this week at the White House.",
      "The nation's estimated $7 trillion-plus federal budget has been growing steadily, with annual deficits fast approaching $2 trillion and the annual interest on the debt almost $1 trillion. That's thanks mostly to the spike in emergency COVID-19 pandemic spending, changes in the tax code and climbing costs of Medicare, Medicaid and other programs, largely to cover the nation's health needs as people age. The nation's debt load, at $36 trillion, is ballooning.",
      "This year's presidential budget request is expected to show deep reductions in spending, some reflective of the cuts already made by Trump's actions and adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, including the slashing of the government workforce. It also could point to potential new revenue streams, possibly from Trump's tariffs program.",
      "Democrats are prepared to lambast Trump's budget as further evidence that the Republican administration is intent on gutting government programs that Americans depend on.",
      "It comes as Congress is already deep into the slog of drafting of Trump's big bill of tax breaks, spending cuts and bolstered funds for the administration's mass deportation effort \u2014 a package that, unlike the budget, would actually carry the force of law.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, who spoke with Trump multiple times this week, is racing to have the president's \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d approved by the House by Memorial Day and sent on to the Senate.",
      "\u201cWe had a very productive and encouraging meeting at the White House this morning, and the remaining pieces of \u2018The One, Big Beautiful Bill!\u2019 are coming together very well,\" Johnson, R-La., said in a statement after Thursday's meeting with Trump and various committee chairmen.",
      "But there remain deep differences among the Republicans, who are trying to pass that big bill over the objections of Democrats.",
      "\"We are awaiting some final calculations on a few of the tax components, and we expect to be able to complete that work on a very aggressive schedule,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Meantime, Cabinet officials are expected to start making the trek to Capitol Hill to testify about their various requests in the president's budget.",
      "It's Congress, under its constitutional powers, that decides the spending plans, approves the bills that authorize federal programs and funds them through the appropriations process. Often, that system breaks down, forcing lawmakers to pass stopgap spending bills to keep the government funded and avoid federal shutdowns.",
      "Vought is also expected on Capitol Hill in the weeks ahead as the Trump administration presses its case to Congress for funds.",
      "Among the more skilled conservative budget hands in Washington, Vought has charted a career toward this moment. He served during the first Trump administration in the same role and, for Project 2025, wrote an extensive chapter about the remaking of the federal government.",
      "Vought has separately been preparing a $9 billion package that would gut current 2025 funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which involves Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. Trump signed an executive order late Thursday that instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal agencies to cease funding for PBS and NPR.",
      "Vought has said that package of so-called budget rescissions would be a first of potentially more, as the Trump administration tests the appetite in Congress for lawmakers to go on record and vote to roll back the money.",

      "European Union privacy watchdogs have fined TikTok 530 million euros",
      "LONDON -- European Union privacy watchdogs fined TikTok 530 million euros ($600 million) on Friday after a four-year investigation found that the video sharing app's data transfers to China breached the EU's strict data privacy rules.",
      "Ireland's Data Protection Commission also sanctioned TikTok for not being transparent with users about where their personal data was being sent and ordered the company to comply with the rules within six months.",
      "The Irish national watchdog serves as TikTok's lead data privacy regulator in the 27-nation EU because the company's European headquarters is based in Dublin.",
      "\u201cTikTok failed to verify, guarantee and demonstrate that the personal data of (European) users, remotely accessed by staff in China, was afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the EU,\u201d Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said in a statement.",
      "TikTok said it disagreed with the decision and plans to appeal.",
      "The company said in a blog post that the decision focuses on a \u201cselect period\u201d ending in May 2023, before it embarked on a data localization project called Project Clover that involved building three data centers in Europe.",
      "\u201cThe facts are that Project Clover has some of the most stringent data protections anywhere in the industry, including unprecedented independent oversight by NCC Group, a leading European cybersecurity firm,\" said Christine Grahn, TikTok's European head of public policy and government relations. \u201cThe decision fails to fully consider these considerable data security measures.\u201d",
      "TikTok, whose parent company ByteDance is based in China, has been under scrutiny in Europe over how it handles personal information of its users amid concerns from Western officials that it poses a security risk over user data sent to China. In 2023, the watchdog fined the company hundreds of millions of euros in a separate child privacy investigation.",
      "The Irish watchdog said its investigation found that TikTok failed to address \u201cpotential access by Chinese authorities\u201d to European users' personal data under Chinese laws on anti-terrorism, counter-espionage, cybersecurity and national intelligence that were identified as \u2018materially diverging\u2019 from EU standards.\u201d",
      "Grahn said TikTok has \u201chas never received a request for European user data from the Chinese authorities, and has never provided European user data to them.\u201d",
      "Under the EU rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, European user data can only be transferred outside of the bloc if there are safeguards in place to ensure the same level of protection.",
      "The investigation, which opened in September 2021, also found that TikTok's privacy policy at the time did not name third countries, including China, where user data was transferred. The watchdog said the policy, which has since been updated, failed to explain that data processing involved \u201cremote access to personal data stored in Singapore and the United States by personnel based in China.\u201d",
      "TikTok faces further scrutiny from the Irish regulator, which said that the company had provided inaccurate information to throughout the inquiry by saying that it didn't store European user data on Chinese servers. It wasn't until April that it informed the regulator that it discovered in February that some data had in fact been stored on Chinese servers.",
      "Doyle said that the watchdog is taking the recent developments \u201cvery seriously\" and \u201cconsidering what further regulatory action may be warranted.\u201d",

      "Japan\u2019s finance minister says the nation\u2019s massive holdings of U.S. Treasurys can be \u201ca card on the table\u201d in negotiations over tariffs with the Trump administration",
      "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s massive holdings of U.S. Treasurys can be \u201ca card on the table\u201d in negotiations over tariffs with the Trump administration, Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said Friday.",
      "\u201cIt does exist as a card, but I think whether we choose to use it or not would be a separate decision,\u201d Kato said during a news show on national broadcaster TV Tokyo.",
      "Kato did not elaborate and he did not say Japan would step up sales of its holdings of U.S. government bonds as part of its talks over President Donald Trump's tariffs on exports from Japan.",
      "Earlier, Japanese officials including Kato had ruled out such an option.",
      "Japan is the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt, at $1.13 trillion as of late February. China, also at odds with the Trump administration over trade and tariffs, is the second largest foreign investor in Treasurys.",
      "Kato stressed that various factors would be on the negotiating table with Trump, implying that a promise not to sell Treasurys could help coax Washington into an agreement favorable for Japan.",
      "Trump has disrupted decades of American trade policies, including with key security allies like Japan, by i mposing big import taxes, or tariffs, on a wide range of products.",
      "A team of Japanese officials was in Washington this week for talks on the tariffs.",
      "The U.S. is due to soon begin imposing a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts, as well as an overall 10% baseline tariff. The bigger tariffs will hurt at a time when Japanese economic growth is weakening.",
      "Asian holdings of Treasurys have remained relatively steady in recent years, according to the most recent figures.",
      "But some analysts worry China or other governments could liquidate their U.S. Treasury holdings as trade tensions escalate.",
      "U.S. government bonds are traditionally viewed as a safe financial asset, and recent spikes in yields of those bonds have raised worries that they might be losing that status due to Trump\u2019s tariff policies.",

      "The hard-right party Reform UK led by Nigel Farage has won a seat in Parliament and hundreds of council in local elections across England",
      "LONDON -- The hard-right party Reform UK led by Nigel Farage snatched a seat in Parliament from the governing Labour Party and won hundreds of local council seats from the opposition Conservatives in elections that Farage hailed Friday as a turning point towards ending the two parties' poltiical dominance.",
      "Reform's Sarah Pochin was declared winner of the seat of Runcorn and Helsby in northwest England by six votes after a recount, defeating Labour candidate Karen Shore by the narrowest of margins.",
      "It was a significant defeat for Labour, which easily won the district in last year's national election. The special election was held because Labour lawmaker Mike Amesbury was forced to quit after he was convicted of punching a constituent in a drunken rage.",
      "Farage said that \u201cit\u2019s a very, very big moment indeed\u201d that shows Reform can win against both Labour and the right-of-center opposition Conservatives.",
      "\u201cThis marks the end of two-party politics as we\u2019ve known it for over a century,\u201d he said.",
      "The Runcorn victory gives Reform, which garnered about 14% of the vote in last year\u2019s national election, five of the 650 seats in the House of Commons, compared to 403 for Labour and 121 for the Conservatives.",
      "But Reform appears to have momentum. National polls now suggest its support equals or surpasses that of Labour and the Conservatives, and it hopes to displace the Conservatives as the country\u2019s main party on the right before the next national election, due by 2029.",
      "The local elections held Thursday in many areas of England were a sobering rebuff to Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s center-left Labour government, 10 months after it was elected in a landslide.",
      "Farage\u2019s party is targeting working-class voters who once backed Labour. Starmer\u2019s popularity has plunged as his government struggles to kick-start a sluggish economy. The government has raised the minimum wage, strengthened workers\u2019 rights and pumped money into the state-funded health system \u2014 but also hiked employer\u2019 taxes and cut welfare benefits.",
      "Starmer said that he understood why many voters are discontented.",
      "\u201cMy response is: We get it,\u201d he said. \u201cI am determined that we will go further and faster on the change that people want to see.\u201d",
      "The results were an even bigger blow to the Conservatives, whose voters switched to Reform in droves.",
      "Reform, which didn't exist when these areas last voted four years ago, won hundreds of municipal seats in the elections for six mayoralties and the control of 23 local councils, mostly at the Tories' expense.",
      "Reform won control of several county-level local authorities, including previous Conservative strongolds Staffordshire and Lincolnshire in central England, Durham in the north and Farage's home county of Kent in the southeast.",
      "Reform candidate Andrea Jenkyns, a former Conservative lawmaker, won the newly created mayoralty of the Greater Lincolnshire region of east-central England. Labour retained three other mayoralties and the Conservatives won one.",
      "The victories will bring pressure for Reform to deliver on transport, garbage collection, potholes and all the other unglamorous demands of everyday politics.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who could now face a party revolt, posted on X that she was \u201cdetermined to win back the trust of the public and the seats we\u2019ve lost.\u201d",
      "The results give only a partial snapshot of voter sentiment. Many areas, including London, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, didn't hold elections. Turnout for local polls is typically much lower than in a national election.",
      "And Reform isn't the only story. The centrist Liberal Democrats made gains by winning more affluent, socially liberal voters away from the Conservatives.",
      "Reform UK is the latest in a series of parties led by Farage, a veteran hard-right politician who was crucial in taking Britain out of the European Union through a 2016 referendum. A charismatic campaigner, he is a divisive figure who has said that many migrants come to the U.K. from cultures \u201calien to ours.\u201d",
      "Reform blends Farage\u2019s long-standing political themes \u2014 strong borders, curbing immigration \u2014 with policies reminiscent of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. During the campaign Farage said that he plans \u201ca DOGE for every county\u201d in England, inspired by Elon Musk\u2019s contentious spending-slashing agency.",
      "University of Strathclyde political scientist John Curtice said that the results showed that politics in Britain, long dominated by the two big parties, has fragmented.",
      "\u201cReform are now posing a big threat to both Conservative and Labour,\" he told the BBC.",
      "As to whether two-party dominance will continue, \u201cthe question mark on that has just got three or four times bigger,\u201d Curtice said.",

      "The emergency appeal is the first in a string of applications to the high court involving DOGE's swift-moving work across the federal government.",
      "It comes after a judge in Maryland restricted the team's access to Social Security under federal privacy laws. The agency holds personal records on nearly everyone in the country, including school records, bank details, salary information and medical and mental health records for disability recipients, according to court documents.",
      "The government says the team needs access to target waste in the federal government. Musk, now preparing to step back from his work with DOGE, has been focused on Social Security as an alleged hotbed of fraud. The billionaire entrepreneur has described it as a \u201c Ponzi scheme \u201d and insisted that reducing waste in the program is an important way to cut government spending.",
      "Solicitor General John Sauer argued Friday that the judge\u2019s restrictions disrupt DOGE\u2019s important work and inappropriately interfere with executive-branch decisions. \u201cLeft undisturbed, this preliminary injunction will only invite further judicial incursions into internal agency decision-making,\u201d he wrote.",
      "He asked the justices to block the order from U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander in Maryland as the lawsuit plays out.",
      "An appeals court previously refused to immediately to lift the block on DOGE access, though it split along ideological lines. Conservative judges in the minority said there\u2019s no evidence that the team has done any \u201ctargeted snooping\u201d or exposed personal information.",
      "The lawsuit was originally filed by a group of labor unions and retirees represented by the group Democracy Forward. The Supreme Court asked them for a response to the administration's appeal by May 12.",
      "More than two dozen lawsuits have been filed over DOGE's work, which has included deep cuts at federal agencies and large-scale layoffs.",
      "Hollander found that DOGE's efforts at Social Security amounted to a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d based on \u201clittle more than suspicion\u201d of fraud.",
      "Her order does allow staffers to access data that has been made anonymous, but the Trump administration has said DOGE can't work effectively with those restrictions.",
      "Elizabeth Laird with the nonprofit group Center for Democracy and Technology said wide-ranging access to sensitive personal data poses a serious threat. \u201cIf DOGE gets a hold of this information, it opens the floodgates on a host of potential harms. It also normalizes a very dangerous practice for other federal agencies,\u201d she said.",
      "The nation's court system has been ground zero for pushback to President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping conservative agenda, with about 200 lawsuits filed challenging policies on everything from immigration to education to mass layoffs of federal workers.",
      "Among those that have reached the Supreme Court so far, the justices have handed down some largely procedural rulings siding with the administration but have rejected the government\u2019s broad arguments in other cases.",

      "China has imposed duties of up to 125% on U.S. products, with some exemptions. It has also ordered other retaliation, such as tighter restrictions on exports of some strategically important minerals used for high-tech products such as electric vehicles.",
      "The official manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to a 16-month low of 49.0 from 50.5 in March. That\u2019s on a scale where 50 marks the break between expansion and contraction. A private survey by the financial information group Caixin fell to 50.4 from 51.2.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. House has voted to block California's vehicle emission standards",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Republican-controlled U.S. House voted Thursday to block California from enforcing first-in-the-nation rules phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.",
      "The move comes a day after the chamber voted to halt California standards to cut tailpipe emissions from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, as well as curb smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.",
      "\u201cThe passage of these resolutions is a victory for Americans who will not be forced into purchasing costly EVs because of California\u2019s unworkable mandates,\u201d House Republicans Brett Guthrie of Kentucky and Morgan Griffith of Virginia, said in a statement. \u201cIf not repealed, the California waivers would lead to higher prices for both new and used vehicles, increase our reliance on China, and strain our electric grid.\u201d",
      "California for decades has been given the authority to adopt vehicle emissions standards that are stricter than the federal government's. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 announced plans to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles in the state by 2035, as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.",
      "State regulators then formalized the rules, some other states announced plans to follow them, and the Biden administration approved the state's waiver to implement them in December, a month before President Donald Trump returned to office.",
      "This week's House votes fell largely along party lines, though some Democrats joined Republicans to advance them. That would be against the advice of the Senate Parliamentarian, who sides with the U.S. General Accountability Office in saying California\u2019s policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.",
      "Republicans used the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules. The Trump administration in 2019 revoked California\u2019s ability to enforce its own emissions standards, but Biden later restored the state\u2019s authority.",
      "But the California standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, wrote in a letter to Congress in March.",
      "Newsom said the effort is another signal of Republicans' ideological shift over the decades from an era in which former presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan signed landmark environmental laws to one in which Trump is pushing for environmental rollbacks on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change.",
      "\u201cClean air didn\u2019t used to be political,\" Newsom said in a statement. \u201cOur vehicles program helps clean the air for all Californians, and we\u2019ll continue defending it.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the California Air Resources Board, which passed the vehicle emission standards, said the agency \u201cwill continue its mission to protect the public health of Californians impacted by harmful air pollution.\u201d",
      "It is unclear what will happen in the Senate. The Senate Parliamentarian in April reaffirmed the GAO\u2019s findings that California\u2019s Clean Air Act waivers are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, according to California Sen. Adam Schiff's office.",
      "\u201cWe will fight this latest attack on California\u2019s power to protect its own residents, and I will urge my colleagues in the Senate to recognize the severe implications of proceeding with this violation of states\u2019 rights, as well as the dangerous precedent it would set by flouting the unanimous opinion of Congress\u2019 trusted arbiters,\" the Democrat said in a statement.",
      "Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Safe Climate Transport Campaign, called the use of the Congressional Review Act a \u201cbackdoor move\u201d that \u201cshows just how recklessly Republicans behave.\u201d",

      "Losses from heat and drought have cut production forecasts in Brazil and Vietnam, the world's largest coffee growers. Global production is still expected to increase, but not as much as commodity market investors had expected. That's sent coffee prices up, largely because of continued high demand in Europe, the U.S., and China.",
      "Prices peaked in February but have remained high, forcing roasters like Col\u00f3n to weigh how much of that cost to absorb and how much to pass on to consumers.",
      "The beans Col\u00f3n was roasting cost her $5.50 per pound in early March, more than double what they cost in September. And that was for mixed, midrange beans. Specialty coffees \u2014 grown in delicate climates to slow growth and add flavor \u2014 can cost even more.",
      "President Donald Trump's current 10% tariffs cover most coffee-producing countries, including Brazil, Ethiopia and Colombia, and are expected to drive up costs for Americans. Amid his chaotic tariff pronouncements \u2014 at one point he threatened 46% tariffs on Vietnam imports and 32% on Indonesia imports before pausing them \u2014 American coffee roasters are rethinking their supply chains.",

The world\u2019s best coffee thrives near the equator, where seasons are long, and in high altitudes, where slow growing allows beans to gather flavor. But Puerto Rico, where Col\u00f3n and her husband have roots, isn't a serious option, either \u2014 labor costs are too high and she worries about the increasing risk of crop-damaging hurricanes.",
      "She shrugs off buying coffee from Hawaii and California, which she says is either poor quality, overpriced or both.",
      "In February, global coffee green exports were down 14.2% from a year earlier, according to the International Coffee Organization\u2019s market report. The shortage led to the highest price ever for raw coffee in February, breaking the record set in 1977 when severe frost wiped out 70% of Brazil\u2019s coffee plants.",
      "Climate isn\u2019t the only thing driving up prices, said Daria Whalen, a buyer for San Francisco-based Ritual Coffee Roasters. Inflation is driving up the cost of labor, fertilizers, and borrowing, she said.",
      "She described being in Mexico in April seeking to finalize contracts between Trump\u2019s fits and starts on tariffs. It reminded her of being in Colombia a month earlier as Trump threatened and then backed away from tariffs that would have affected coffee prices.",
      "\u201cIt was kind of like roller coaster day, because at the end of the day it didn\u2019t exist,\u201d Whalen said.",
      "Some of the recent rise in coffee prices may be from importers buying extra in anticipation of the tariffs. Col\u00f3n believes prices will go still higher as import taxes begin being paid. And with consumer confidence hitting a 12-year low, Col\u00f3n could see a decrease in demand for her premium coffee.",
      "\u201cIt is tough on our end because it drives the price up, tough on the consumer end because they have to pay more and tough on the farmers' end because they may be experiencing really significant losses,\u201d Col\u00f3n said.",
      "Yet she's committed to expanding.",
      "In December, she and her husband took out a $50,000 loan to buy a custom coffee roaster from Turkey that will triple capacity. They\u2019re trying to increase sales by adding new wholesale clients like coffee shops, and selling directly to homes via a beans-of-the-month-style subscription service.",
      "The Col\u00f3ns have raised the wholesale price on a pound of roasted beans by 25 cents. They're considering doing the same for pour-overs and espresso drinks at their two retail locations.",
      "At one of those, called Melo, one couple said they don't look at the coffee's price on the receipt. For them, it's a treat.",
      "\u201cWe know we could go find coffee cheaper somewhere else,\u201d said Rob Newell, a high school biology teacher, as he held a cooing infant daughter alongside his wife, who is also a teacher. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just because we\u2019re new parents, but you get, like, cabin fever staying in the house all day.\u201d",
      "Col\u00f3n is also seeking to cut costs.",
      "The warehouse where she roasts has some extra space, so she's weighing stacking up more bags of raw beans there to save as much as $500 on monthly storage costs in port cities.",
      "She's tried to cultivate relationships with farmers to minimize price spikes and control bean quality. She described working with a farmer in Colombia as coffee prices were spiking in February to lock in a one-year contract that avoided the worst of the increase.",
      "And like many small business owners, she's had to get used to the complexity of tariffs.",
      "In January, she turned down a pitch from a Montreal coffee importer who suggested the U.S. dollar's strength in Canada would allow her to save money by importing through their warehouse. She feared that tariffs on Canada could increase prices. Plus, the coffee would have to cross an extra border, risking delays. And the value of the dollar has been up and down.",
      "\u201cI want things to be less complicated instead of more,\" she said.",

      "Hawaii lawmakers are ready to hike a tax imposed on travelers staying in hotels, vacation rentals and other short-term accommodations and earmark the new money for programs to cope with a warming planet",
      "HONOLULU -- In a first-of-its kind move, Hawaii lawmakers are ready to hike a tax imposed on travelers staying in hotels, vacation rentals and other short-term accommodations and earmark the new money for programs to cope with a warming planet.",
      "State leaders say they'll use the funds for projects like replenishing sand on eroding beaches, helping homeowners install hurricane clips on their roofs and removing invasive grasses like those that fueled the deadly wildfire that destroyed Lahaina two years ago.",
      "A bill scheduled for House and Senate votes on Wednesday would add an additional 0.75% to the daily room rate tax starting Jan. 1. It's all but certain to pass given Democrats hold supermajorities in both chambers and party leaders have agreed on the measure. Gov. Josh Green has said he would sign it into law.",
      "Officials estimate the increase would generate $100 million in new revenue annually.",
      "\u201cWe had a $13 billion tragedy in Maui and we lost 102 people. These kind of dollars will help us prevent that next disaster,\u201d Green said in an interview.",
      "Green said Hawaii was the first state in the nation to do something along these lines. Andrey Yushkov, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization, said he was unaware of any other state that has set aside lodging tax revenue for the purposes of environmental protection or climate change.",
      "The increase will add to what is already a relatively large duty on short-term stays. The state's existing 10.25% tax on daily room rates would climb to 11%. In addition, Hawaii's counties each add their own 3% surcharge and the state and counties impose a combined 4.712% general excise tax on goods and services including hotel rooms. Together, that will make for a tax rate of nearly 19%.",
      "The only large U.S. cities that have higher cumulative state and local lodging tax rates are Omaha, Nebraska, at 20.5%, and Cincinnati, at 19.3%, according to a 2024 report by HVS, a global hospitality consulting firm.",
      "The governor has long said the 10 million visitors who come to Hawaii each year should help the state's 1.4 million residents protect the environment.",
      "Green believes travelers will be willing to pay the increased tax because doing so will enable Hawaii to \u201ckeep the beaches perfect\u201d and preserve favorite spots like Maui's road to Hana and the coastline along Oahu's North Shore. After the Maui wildfire, Green said he heard from thousands of people across the country asking how they could help. This is a significant way they can, he said.",
      "Jerry Gibson, president of the Hawaii Hotel Alliance, which represents the state's hotel operators, said the industry was pleased lawmakers didn't adopt a higher increase that was initially proposed.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that there\u2019s anybody in the tourism industry that says, \u2018Well, let\u2019s go out and tax more.\u2019 No one wants to see that,\" Gibson said. \"But our state, at the same time, needs money.\u201d",
      "The silver lining, Gibson said, is that the money is supposed to beautify Hawaii\u2019s environment. It will be worth it if that\u2019s the case, he said.",
      "Hawaii has long struggled to pay for the vast environmental and conservation needs of the islands, ranging from protecting coral reefs to weeding invasive plants to making sure tourists don't harass wildlife, such as Hawaiian monk seals. The state must also maintain a large network of trails, many of which have heavier foot traffic as more travelers choose to hike on vacation.",
      "Two years ago, lawmakers considered requiring tourists to pay for a yearlong license or pass to visit state parks and trails. Green wanted to have all visitors pay a $50 fee to enter the state, an idea lawmakers said would violate U.S. constitutional protections for free travel.",
      "Boosting the lodging tax is their compromise solution, one made more urgent by the Maui wildfires.",
      "An advocacy group, Care for Aina Now, calculated a $561 million gap between Hawaii's conservation funding needs and money spent each year.",
      "Green acknowledged the revenue from the tax increase falls short of this, but said the state would issue bonds to leverage the money it raises. Most of the $100 million would go toward measures that can be handled in a one-to-two year time frame, while $10 to $15 million of it would pay for bonds supporting long-term infrastructure projects.",
      "K\u0101wika Riley, a member of the governor's Climate Advisory Team, pointed to the Hawaiian saying, \u201cA stranger only for a day,\u201d to explain the new tax. The adage means that a visitor should help with the work after the first day of being a guest.",
      "\u201cNobody is saying that literally our visitors have to come here and start working for us. But what we are saying is that it\u2019s important to be part of of the solution,\u201d Riley said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be part of caring for the things you love.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration is ending a duty-free exemption on low-value imports from China Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- Consumers can expect higher prices and delivery delays when the Trump administration ends a duty-free exemption on low-value imports from China Friday.",
      "The expiration of the so-called de minimis rule that has allowed as many as 4 million low-value parcels to come into the U.S. every day \u2014 mostly from China \u2014 is also forcing businesses that have built their models on sourcing production in China to rethink their practices in order to keep their costs down.",
      "But some might actually benefit from the termination of the duty exemption. For instance, companies that make their goods in the U.S. may feel relief from the competition of cheap Chinese imports, and likely experience a brighter sales outlook.",
      "The move, which applies to goods originating from mainland China and Hong Kong, comes on top of President Donald Trump's new tariffs totaling 145% on China. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on the U.S., fueling a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Sellers are already seeing cautious consumers.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump called the de minimis exemption \u201ca big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe put an end to it,\u201d he said.",
      "Introduced in 1938, the de minimis exception was intended to facilitate the flow of small packages valued at no more than $5, the equivalent of about $109 today. The threshold rose to $800 in 2016. But the rapid rise of cross-border e-commerce, driven by China, has challenged the intent of the decades-old customs exception rule.",
      "Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to a February report by the Congressional Research Service. And the U.S. market has been a major destination.",
      "Former President Joe Biden proposed a rule last year that said foreign companies can\u2019t avoid tariffs simply by shipping goods that they claim to be worth $800 or less. Trump tried in February to end the exception but his initial order was called off within days when it appeared the U.S. was not prepared to process and collect tariffs on the deluge of parcels coming in.",
      "Consumers will face higher prices and delivery delays now that parcels will go through a more complicated customs process to enter the U.S. involving declaration and duty payment.",
      "Businesses could factor tariffs into the final price, or they can list them separately in the same way as sales taxes. For instance, Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, now lists \u201cimport charges\u201d that have reportedly doubled many items\u2019 prices. (The retailer also has a \u201clocal warehouse\u201d option for some products, which are shipped from within the U.S. and therefore avoids the import charge.)",
      "Meanwhile, Shein, now based in Singapore, has a checkout banner that reads, \u201cTariffs are included in the price you pay. You\u2019ll never have to pay extra at delivery.\u201d",
      "Amazon says it\u2019s not planning to display added tariff costs next to product prices on its site \u2014 despite a report that sparked speculation the e-commerce giant would soon show the new import charges, and the White House has made fiery comments denouncing the purported change.",
      "Parcel carriers will be burdened with collecting duties, and the paperwork to comply with the new rule could result not only in higher prices but also delays and even disruptions to delivery, said Ram Ben Tzion of the vetting platform Publican.",
      "Major commercial carriers such as UPS and FedEx have said they are well-equipped and prepared to collect duties on international parcels in compliance with local laws, including the new U.S. rule.",
      "Commercial carriers will be collecting 145% tariffs on declared values. The U.S. Postal Service, a government agency that offers international mail service, can choose either to charge a 120% tariff on low-value packages or a flat fee of $100 per shipment, which is set to rise to $200 on June 1.",
      "The U.S. Customs and Border Protection says it \"stands ready to fully implement the restrictions on de minimis shipments and collect all revenue owed for these shipments on May 2, 2025.\u201d",
      "However, experts have expressed concerns that the surge in the workload could be a serious challenge.",
      "In January and February, more than 70% of the 216 million packages coming into the U.S. were originating from China, according to CBP.",
      "Those that relied on the de minimis exemption are now having to adjust.",
      "John Curry, owner and chief executive officer of HAPARI International, an Arizona-based swimwear business, had switched from bulk shipping to de minimis shipping about six months ago to improve cash flow, speed up delivery, and eventually eliminate U.S.-based warehousing. His company makes its products in China and sells them directly to U.S. customers via its own online storefront.",
      "Curry said he planned to stay the course and pay the additional 145% duty \u2014 one parcel at a time \u2014 while waiting for the U.S. and China to work out a more sustainable approach.",
      "\u201cThere has to be a solution because both countries cannot survive this way,\u201d Curry said.",
      "Izzy Rosenzweig, founder and CEO of the logistic company Portless, helps businesses like HAPARI to ship goods from its China-based warehouse using the de minimis exemption. He says U.S. businesses are likely to stay in China for now given the competitiveness of the manufacturing base and of the supply chain in China but can be expected to raise prices.",
      "And while businesses with good profit margins probably will continue to ship from China, those that run on razor-thin profit margins are likely to \u201cgo local\u201d, setting up more U.S.-based warehouses to defray tariff costs, he said.",
      "Trade groups representing flag manufacturers and bike dealers said they expect to benefit from the end of the duty exemption.",
      "In written comments on the U.S. Trade Representative portal, for instance, the Flag Manufacturers Association of America said its members have been bombarded by an onslaught of American flag imports mostly made in China that are falsely marketed and significantly discounted. The group cited a drop of 25% to 35% in industrywide sales of American-made U.S. flags last year.",
      "Larry Severini, CEO of Embroidery Solutions Manufacturing LLC, which makes the star fields for U.S. flag manufacturers, had to shutter one of his two plants in South Carolina earlier this year because of stiff competition from cheap imports. He noted sales have fallen 20% since 2021 in part because of the de minimis exemption.",
      "\u201cWe need duties to level the playing field to make it fair,\u201d Severini said.",
      "The National Bike Dealers' Association's Heather Mason said shoppers often check out $2,000 bike from a trusted brand like Trek and then they find a lookalike online for $1,200 \u2014 often with lower quality parts, no warranty, no service, and safety risks.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Countries across the Middle East and North Africa face significant challenges to economic growth as the region faces economic uncertainty due to tariff measures, lower-than-recent oil prices and cuts to financial aid, the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday.",
      "The IMF's regional outlook report for the MENA region said Brent crude oil prices \u2014 which are down from highs above $120 a barrel in 2022 \u2014 are likely to be $65 to $69 per barrel in 2025 and 2026, making energy-exporting economies vulnerable to market fluctuations.",
      "Tariff plans by the U.S. and other countries and geopolitical tensions also have created mounting economic uncertainty globally that is weighing down on the region's economies, which could negatively impact their growth by anywhere from 2% to 4.5%, said Jihad Azour, director for Middle East and Central Asia at the IMF.",
      "\"Therefore countries need to react and need to devise policies in order to protect their economies,\u201d Azour said in an interview in Dubai.",

      "\u201cThe drop in international assistance, especially for countries in fragility, is something that is creating new risks for the region,\u201d Azour said.",
      "Growth in the MENA region is expected to be 2.6% this year, as compared to 1.8% last year, Azour said, but he added that global uncertainty could impact the outlook.",
      "Economies in the Persian Gulf continue to attract substantial foreign direct investment, rising by nearly 2% of GDP since the pandemic, while other MENA nations struggle with slower inflows.",
      "The IMF says it is willing to work with some of the struggling nations and the new government in Syria. He also said that IMF staff and Lebanese officials were in discussions in Lebanon.",
      "\u201cThe Syria recovery will be a long process that would require mobilization of regional and international support and also a comprehensive program of building institutions, reforming their economy, and also addressing a certain number of key issues like infrastructure, refugees and rebuilding a new social contact,\u201d Azour said.",
      "Despite the global economic uncertainty, MENA nations can drive growth through structural reforms and diversifying economic ties, the report said.",

    "story": [
      "Romanians are preparing to cast their ballots in a critical presidential vote redo after last year\u2019s election was annulled",
      "SASCHIZ, Romania -- In a picturesque village in central Romania, 83-year-old Zoica Roth bemoans the lack of opportunities for young people and says she's not convinced that an upcoming presidential election can help stem the desertion of the countryside.",
      "\u201cI have two girls and two boys. I only see them once in the summer and once at Christmas because they\u2019re all abroad,\u201d she told The Associated Press in the courtyard of her farmstead in Saschiz, in Mures county. \u201cThe only solution is to leave ... I miss them.\u201d",
      "Anger toward Romania\u2019s political establishment in recent years has fueled a surge in support for far-right figures in the European Union and NATO member country, reflecting a broader pattern seen across Europe.",
      "In last year\u2019s election, the far-right front-runner Calin Georgescu \u2014 who is now under investigation and is barred from the rerun \u2014 won strong support among rural communities as well as 43% of the vote in Romania\u2019s large diaspora, with his calls to patriotism and emphasis on faith resonating.",
      "Georgescu\u2019s policy proposals included supporting local farmers, reducing import dependence, and ramping up domestic energy and food production. \u201cHe was a good one,\u201d Roth said, adding that a top court\u2019s decision to cancel the election on Dec. 6 was \u201cpretty messed up.\u201d",
      "She also feels let down by the choice of the 11 candidates in Sunday's election rerun. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to choose from, they\u2019re all the same,\" she added.",
      "A communist country until 1989, development across rural Romania has lagged behind that of cities. In a country of about 19 million people, some 45% of Romanians live in the countryside, which often lacks jobs and basic infrastructure.",
      "After joining the EU in 2007, millions of Romanians \u2014 including Roth's family \u2014 moved abroad in search of better opportunities, tearing apart countless families. Like many older generation Romanians, Roth now fondly remembers life during communism.",
      "\u201cIt was good back then, we had places to work, we had jobs,\u201d Roth said. \u201cNow I have my pension, but the young ones coming up have no jobs, nowhere to work. They leave with their bags on their backs \u2026 to foreign countries.\u201d",
      "Monica Rosalea, 41, works the land at home in Saschiz to make ends meet and periodically works in Germany.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard because there\u2019s no work \u2026 we all go abroad,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have children, how are we supposed to raise them? We\u2019re forced to leave them at home. The little money you bring from abroad, you spend it all here \u2026 everything is so expensive.\u201d",
      "Rosalea voted for Georgescu last year. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose him alone \u2026 everyone voted for him. But then look what happened,\u201d she said. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know who I\u2019d vote for now. There are no real options.\u201d",
      "In 2023, employment in Romania's rural areas was the lowest in the EU, with just 61% of working-age people in work, according to the EU\u2019s statistics agency Eurostat. Over the past decade, youth unemployment has fallen across most of the EU, but it has also risen in Romania\u2019s rural areas.",
      "For 23-year-old Alexandra Todea, who works as a logistics administrator at a local preserves factory in Saschiz, Georgescu\u2019s messages resonated because he saw the \u201cpotential of rural areas,\u201d which offered people hope that things could improve.",
      "\u201cIf the Romanian state supported us young people more \u2026 then there would be no need to leave and go to another country to make something of ourselves,\" she said. \"We do have potential, it\u2019s just that no one invests.\u201d",
      "Like many Romanians for whom Georgescu\u2019s messages struck a chord, Todea questions the legitimacy of cancelling the election and feels robbed of her previous vote. \u201cUnfortunately, that right was taken from me,\u201d she added.",
      "Her colleague, Aliz Alamorean, 23, bucked the trend by moving back to Romania this year after living in Spain since she was five. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like a stranger, but I didn\u2019t feel at home either,\u201d she said, adding she would vote for Georgescu if he were allowed to run again.",
      "\u201cThe same people always have to win, and when they saw the \u2018wrong\u2019 one was winning \u2014 they canceled it,\u201d she said, listing the economy as her main concern. \u201cIf I see it\u2019s not working out, I\u2019ll pack my bags and go back,\u201d she added.",
      "Life in rural Romania is often shaped by traditions, faith, and community ties \u2014 but the challenges are stark. A lack of opportunities, underdeveloped schools, and poor access to healthcare can deepen a sense of abandonment by the political class.",
      "A week after the Nov. 24 presidential first round, Alamorean voted for the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, in a parliamentary election. AUR proclaims to stand for \u201cfamily, nation, faith, and freedom,\" and doubled its support.",
      "The party's leader, George Simion, came fourth in last year\u2019s race and later backed Georgescu, and is widely viewed as his successor in the upcoming ballot. A median of polls suggests he will enter a runoff on May 18.",
      "Across the countryside, many Romanians still work the land tending to their crops and animals. But in rural communities \u2014 where 90% of households rely on firewood to heat their homes \u2014 not everyone will exercise their right to vote.",
      "\u201cI only have three years of school,\u201d said shepherd Attila Agostun, 46, who has never voted, as he watched over his flock grazing the verdant pastures near the village of Cund. \u201cAll my life has been with animals \u2026 that\u2019s where I grew up.\u201d",
      "The risk of poverty or social exclusion in Romania\u2019s rural communities is 45%, 26 percentage points higher than in cities, according to Eurostat.",
      "However, the Orthodox Church plays a central role in rural communities and offers hope.",
      "In the remote village of Floresti on a bright spring day, birdsong fills the courtyard of Liliana Cosurean, 54, as she lays out a spread of local cheese and homemade jam. She says she is happy living among forests and rolling hills, which she calls \u201ca little corner of paradise,\u201d where slow tourism has brought some positive change.",
      "But she acknowledges that the recent political turmoil has divided people. \u201cThere seems to be a certain tension in the air, and I hope it settles down for the sake of the young people,\u201d she said. \u201cI sincerely hope things will remain peaceful and won\u2019t fall apart.\u201d",
      "She did not want to say who she voted for in the previous race, and isn\u2019t sure if she\u2019ll vote on Sunday. She described Georgescu as \u201ca man with a kind heart and a fear of God,\u201d and believes he inspired trust because he spoke openly about faith.",
      "\u201cThat might be the thing that could unite us,\u201d she said. \u201cFaith can move mountains \u2026 a person who has faith can do anything.\u201d",

      "The unbeaten filly rallied on the outside through the slop to overtake Tenma by the final furlong and win the 151st Kentucky Oaks by 2 1/4 lengths on Friday at Churchill Downs.",
      "Louisville-born trainer Brad Cox watched the heavy 6-5 favorite cover 1 1/8 miles in 1:50.15 on a wet but sealed surface with Luis Saez aboard. Good Cheer paid $4.78, $3.62 and $3.02 for her seventh dominant victory.",
      "The bay daughter of Megdalia d'Oro and Wedding Toast by Street entered the Oaks with a combined victory margin of more than 42 lengths, and on Friday, she added more distance to her resume with a stunning surge.",
      "It's the biggest in a string of graded stakes wins dating back to last fall, and it came with a garland of pink lilies.",
      "\u201cWe know she is a very special filly,\u201d said Saez, who rode to his sixth consecutive win aboard Good Cheer. \u201cOf course, we were a little nervous, but I know she has a lot of talent. I rode her pretty confident because we know ... she's going to make a big move.\u201d",
      "Cox, who grew up blocks from Churchill Downs, earned his third Oaks win in seven years, Saez his second in three. Good Cheer ownership group Godolphin LLC won its second Oaks in three years and seeks its first Kentucky Derby win on Saturday with Sovereignty and East Avenue.",
      "The trainer's Oaks win follows a stakes win by filly Immersive, who won last year's Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies race on the way to clinching the Eclipse Award as the top 2-year-old. Cox took satisfaction in how Good Cheer ran with no room for error as the overwhelming favorite of 13 horses.",
      "\u201cShe travels around the turn and then you're like, \u2018Well, she\u2019s coming,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden, in the blink of an eye, she's three (lengths) in front of them. So she definitely passed the eye test.\u201d",
      "Drexel Hill paid $21.02 and $11.76 for second while Bless the Broken was third and returned $4.78.",
      "A thunderstorm that roared through about two hours before the scheduled post left the track soggy and sent many of the 100,910 fans seeking shelter at the track's urging. The $1.5 million showcase for 3-year-old fillies was delayed by 10 minutes, and the conditions proved to be a minor nuisance for Good Cheer.",
      "She was off the pace after starting from the No. 11 post but well within range of the leaders before charging forward through the final turns. Good Cheer was fourth entering the stretch and closed inside and into the lead, pulling away for her fourth win at Churchill Downs and second in the mud.",
      "\u201cOnce you get her out and open, she\u2019s going to dig in and run hard as well,\u201d Michael Banahan of Godolphin LLC said. \"I was happy enough where she was down the backside and I know there was a little bit of speed in the race as well. Luis had her in a good spot and she looked like she was running comfortably.\"",

    "summary": "Gregg Popovich understood the world",
    "story": [
      "Gregg Popovich understood the world",
      "Gregg Popovich understood the world.",
      "That goes back long before the basketball world knew who he was. It probably can be traced to at least Popovich's time at the U.S. Air Force Academy, where he majored in Soviet studies and was on his way to becoming a spy.",
      "He became an icon instead.",
      "Popovich's time as coach of the San Antonio Spurs ended Friday, six months after a stroke essentially ended his tenure \u2014 in that capacity, anyway \u2014 without him knowing it. He stepped down, Mitch Johnson was promoted from acting coach to head coach, and just like that, the Spurs started a new chapter.",
      "Popovich isn't going anywhere. He's still the team president. He'll be around. He'll have influence. His role going forward is probably largely up to him, a right that he's earned over the last 30 or so years. His view of the world shaped many of the things that the Spurs are today. Same goes for the rest of the league as well, and as proof, look at any roster these days.",
      "Some of the best players in the game \u2014 Nikola Jokic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Spurs' own franchise player in Victor Wembanyama among them \u2014 were born outside the United States. Would they have been in the league without Popovich? Almost certainly, yes. But did Popovich and the Spurs help create the path that saw more international players get into the league? Most definitely.",
      "\u201cThey were a pioneer around the international game,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said of the Spurs \u2014 specifically Popovich and his longtime right-hand man, team CEO R.C. Buford \u2014 earlier this year. \u201cThey were scouting internationally in a deep way long before many other teams.\u201d",
      "Basketball is played all over the world, and Popovich \u2014 forever the student \u2014 wanted to learn about all of it. He was finding players in Europe in the late 1980s, long before it became common. As the stories go, Popovich still can't walk around places like Belgrade without being recognized. That's probably not much of an exaggeration, either.",
      "Just look at the roster of all-time Spurs greats: France\u2019s Tony Parker and Argentina\u2019s Manu Ginobili formed one of the league\u2019s all-time Big Threes with Tim Duncan \u2014 another player whose view of the world was perhaps a bit different, having grown up in the U.S. Virgin Islands.",
      "Boris Diaw, Tiago Splitter, Marco Belinelli, Beno Udrih, Jakob Poeltl, Fabricio Oberto, Pau Gasol and many more were part of the Spurs program as well. Popovich had international coaches \u2014 Italy's Ettore Messina made big headlines in Europe when he joined the Spurs, for example. And Popovich picked the brains of others when he was coaching the U.S. national team, including former French national team coach (and Wembanyama's coach) Vincent Collet, someone he went head-to-head with for Olympic gold at the Tokyo Games in 2021.",
      "\u201cThere are smart people everywhere,\u201d Popovich once said, around the time he was taking over as the U.S. coach. \u201cNone of us has it all figured out. Everybody brings something to the table that you might not have thought about.\u201d",
      "If anyone came close to having it all figured out, it was Popovich.",
      "He's a Basketball Hall of Famer. The NBA's all-time win leader. A five-time champion with the Spurs. Coached the U.S. to Olympic gold. And that's just the stuff everybody knows about. Ask the people who operate the San Antonio Food Bank what Popovich has quietly done for them and the answers will take a while. Same goes for the Innocence Project and St. Jude's Children's Hospital, two other causes he supports.",
      "Popovich was more than a coach. He was a guy from Indiana who could shoot the ball well and was smart, parlayed that into an Air Force education, should have made the 1972 U.S. Olympic team as a player, took some of the disappointment from that and began learning how to coach instead, took over a Division III team in California that had lost 88 consecutive conference games and turned it into a champion, kept climbing the ladder and here we are.",
      "The Air Force Academy \u2014 a place he would return to many times after his graduation \u2014 taught him countless lessons, including to embrace different views and to never stop evolving.",
      "\u201cWhat you learn there is to get over yourself,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about you.\u201d",
      "He never stopped learning, either. He changed the Spurs. Changed the NBA, too. Forget the championships and records and one-liners and everything else. Popovich helped change the NBA.",
      "That's his legacy.",

      "Sperbeck, 62, died on Wednesday, after his injury at a Southern California golfing community. Witness Ali Simon told KESQ-TV of Palm Springs that Elway was at the scene of the crash.",
      "\u201cThis appears to be a horrific accident,\u201d Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco told the Denver Post. \u201cAnd unfortunately for all of those involved, one of the people \u2013 well, a couple of them \u2013 happen to be very high-profile celebrities. And that makes this more of an issue than it probably should be.\u201d",
      "Elway, who played his whole career on the Denver Broncos, issued a statement saying he was devastated by the loss of his close friend.",
      "Here is what we know about the incident.",

      "TMZ has reported that Elway was driving the golf cart, citing unidentified sources. KUSA-TV in Denver also cited an unnamed source saying Elway was driving.",

      "Medical personnel at the scene didn\u2019t find evidence suggesting Elway was drunk, Bianco told the Denver Post. He did not elaborate about how personnel reached that conclusion.",
      "Bianco said first responders didn't immediately call the sheriff's office to the scene, and typically would notify law enforcement if there were a concern. He said his agency got involved following media interest in the case and is reviewing surveillance footage and witness testimony. The investigation will be short, he said.",
      "Ed Obayashi, Modoc County deputy sheriff and special prosecutor, said law enforcement might not initially be called to investigate an injury involving a single person, for example, who falls down the stairs or from a bicycle.",
      "But if a death occurs, Obayashi said law enforcement officials are typically asked to investigate so the coroner can complete a thorough report.",
      "\u201cIt could be a matter of routine, or there may be some information they received that requires them to investigate it,\u201d said Obayashi, who trains law enforcement officials on legal issues.",
      "Elway\u2019s attorney, Harvey Steinberg, told Colorado\u2019s 9NEWS it was an accident.",

      "Sperbeck, who is from the Orange County seaside community of San Clemente, began managing Elway in 1990, when Elway was quarterback for the Denver Broncos. He represented more than 100 NFL players during a three-decade career as an agent and business adviser.",

      "Fans died after steep falls at ballparks in Arlington, Texas, in 2011 and Atlanta in 2015.",
      "Here's a look at some safety measures instituted by MLB and its teams:",
      "Railing heights at ballparks are team decisions based on local laws and codes. The railing that runs along the Clemente Wall is three feet (36 inches) in height, which exceeds the building code requirements of 26 inches, according to Pirates vice president of communications Brian Warecki.",
      "Those rail heights have come under scrutiny at other ballparks after fans died. The Rangers raised the height of the front row rails at their former ballpark by as much as 12 inches to 42 inches in July 2011 after a fan named Shannon Stone fell about 20 feet.",
      "The Atlanta Braves settled a lawsuit in 2018 with the family of Gregory Murrey, who died after falling from Turner Field's upper deck three years earlier. Murrey fell over a rail that was 30 inches high \u2014 industry code standards mandated 26 inches or taller.",
      "Until 2015, many ballparks had netting separating fans and the field only directly behind home plate. Following several incidents that season in which fans were hospitalized after being hit by foul balls, MLB encouraged teams to extend netting or screens to run dugout-to-dugout behind home plate in December 2015. Three years later, all 30 ballparks had netting reaching to the far ends of each dugout.",
      "In 2019, a 2-year-old girl fractured her skull when struck by a foul ball at the Houston Astros' stadium. The club later reached a settlement with the girl's family. The following offseason, MLB announced seven major league teams would expand protective netting to the foul poles and 15 others would expand their netting generally to the area in the outfield where the stands begin to angle away from the field. The remaining eight clubs already had installed netting that extended substantially beyond the far end of the dugouts.",
      "MLB does not mandate alcohol sales cutoffs, but most clubs have stopped selling alcohol around the end of the seventh inning for years. After new rules aimed at increasing the pace of play led to shorter game times in 2023, several clubs extended alcohol sales until the end of the eighth inning. Many of those teams have reverted back to the seventh-inning cutoff.",

      "Two major scientific societies say they will fill the void from the Trump administration\u2019s dismissal of scientists writing a cornerstone federal report on what climate change is doing to the United States",
      "WASHINGTON -- Two major scientific societies on Friday said they will fill the void from the Trump administration's dismissal of scientists writing a cornerstone federal report on what climate change is doing to the United States.",
      "The American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union said they will work together to produce peer-reviewed research documents assessing the current and future national impacts of climate change because a science-based report required by law is suddenly in question and being reassessed by President Donald Trump's White House.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump's Republican administration told about 400 scientists working on the National Climate Assessment that they were no longer needed and that the report was being reevaluated. That report, coming once every four to five years, is required by a 1990 federal law and was due out around 2027. Preliminary budget documents show slashing funding or eliminating offices involved in coordinating that report, scientists and activists said.",
      "\u201cWe are filling in a gap in the scientific process,\u201d AGU President Brandon Jones said. \u201cIt's more about ensuring that science continues.\u201d",
      "Meteorological society past president Anjuli Bamzi, a retired federal atmospheric scientist who has worked on previous National Climate Assessments, said one of the most important parts of the federal report is that it projects 25 and 100 years into the future.",
      "With the assessment \u201cwe're better equipped to deal with the future,\u201d Bamzi said. \u201cWe can't be an ostrich and put our head in the sand and let it go.\u201d",
      "Texas Tech University climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, also chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy, said the two organizations joining to do this report \u201cis a testament to how important it is that the latest science be summarized and available.\u201d",
      "Hayhoe, who was a lead author of reports in 2009, 2018 and 2023, said \u201cpeople are not aware of how climate change is impacting the decisions that they are making today, whether it\u2019s the size of the storm sewer pipes they\u2019re installing, whether it is the expansion of the flood zone where people are building, whether it is the increases in extreme heat.\"",
      "They need that knowledge to figure out how to adapt to harms in the future and even the present, Hayhoe said.",
      "The national assessment, unlike global United Nations documents, highlights what\u2019s happening to weather not just in the nation but at regional and local levels.",
      "Jones said he hopes the societies' version of the assessment can be done in just one year.",
      "The last climate assessment report, released in 2023, said that climate change is \u201dharming physical, mental, spiritual, and community health and well-being through the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events, increasing cases of infectious and vector-borne diseases, and declines in food and water quality and security.\"",
      "In 2018, during Trump's first term, the assessment was just as blunt, saying: \"Climate change creates new risks and exacerbates existing vulnerabilities in communities across the United States, presenting growing challenges to human health and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic growth.\"",
      "But University of Illinois climate scientist Donald Wuebbles, who led one of 2018's two national reports, said he worries about what kind of document this new administration will try to issue, if any.",
      "\u201cI think they'll put out something that will, like, it'll be be scientifically based, but it will be pretty crappy,\u201d Wuebbles told The Associated Press.",
      "Watering down or killing the national assessment will not keep the message about the importance of climate change from getting out, Wuebbles said. The scientific societies' efforts to fill the void will have some value because it will be a statement of the scientific community, and, in the end, he said, science is about data and observations.",
      "\u201cWe know this is an extremely important problem. We know it is human activities driving it. So the question is: What do you do about it?\u201d Wuebbles said.",
      "Storms and wildfires don't care if it's a red state or a blue state, Hayhoe said.",
      "\u201cClimate change affects us all,\u201d Hayhoe said. \u201cIt doesn't matter how we vote.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A Wisconsin man has been bitten by snakes hundreds of times, and scientists are studying his blood to treat snakebite",
      "NEW YORK -- Tim Friede has been bitten by snakes hundreds of times \u2014 often on purpose. Now scientists are studying his blood in hopes of creating a better treatment for snake bites.",
      "Friede has long had a fascination with reptiles and other venomous creatures. He used to milk scorpions' and spiders' venom as a hobby and kept dozens of snakes at his Wisconsin home.",
      "Hoping to protect himself from snake bites \u2014 and out of what he calls \u201csimple curiosity\u201d \u2014 he began injecting himself with small doses of snake venom and then slowly increased the amount to try to build up tolerance. He would then let snakes bite him.",
      "\u201cAt first, it was very scary,\" Friede said. \u201cBut the more you do it, the better you get at it, the more calm you become with it.\u201d",
      "While no doctor or emergency medical technician \u2014 or anyone, really \u2014 would ever suggest this is a remotely good idea, experts say his method tracks how the body works. When the immune system is exposed to the toxins in snake venom, it develops antibodies that can neutralize the poison. If it's a small amount of venom the body can react before it's overwhelmed. And if it's venom the body has seen before, it can react more quickly and handle larger exposures.",
      "Friede has withstood snakebites and injections for nearly two decades and still has a refrigerator full of venom. In videos posted to his YouTube channel, he shows off swollen fang marks on his arms from black mamba, taipan and water cobra bites.",
      "\u201cI wanted to push the limits as close to death as possible to where I\u2019m just basically teetering right there and then back off of it,\" he said.",
      "But Friede also wanted to help. He emailed every scientist he could find, asking them to study the tolerance he'd built up.",
      "And there is a need: Around 110,000 people die from snakebite every year, according to the World Health Organization. And making antivenom is expensive and difficult. It is often created by injecting large mammals like horses with venom and collecting the antibodies they produce. These antivenoms are usually only effective against specific snake species, and can sometimes produce bad reactions due to their nonhuman origins.",
      "When Columbia University's Peter Kwong heard of Friede, he said, \u201cOh, wow, this is very unusual. We had a very special individual with amazing antibodies that he created over 18 years.\u201d",
      "In a study published Friday in the journal Cell, Kwong and collaborators shared what they were able to do with Friede's unique blood: They identified two antibodies that neutralize venom from many different snake species with the aim of someday producing a treatment that could offer broad protection.",
      "It's very early research \u2014 the antivenom was only tested in mice, and researchers are still years away from human trials. And while their experimental treatment shows promise against the group of snakes that include mambas and cobras, it's not effective against vipers, which include snakes like rattlers.",
      "\u201cDespite the promise, there is much work to do,\u201d said Nicholas Casewell, a snakebite researcher at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in an email. Casewell was not involved with the new study.",
      "Friede's journey has not been without its missteps. Among them: He said after one bad snake bite he had to cut off part of his finger. And some particularly nasty cobra bites sent him to the hospital.",
      "Friede is now employed by Centivax, which is trying to develop the treatment, and he's excited that his 18-year odyssey could one day save lives from snakebite. But his message to those inspired to follow in his footsteps is quite simple: \u201cDon't do it,\" he said.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus in the 1970s is expected to soon plunge uncontrolled back to Earth, possibly within the first two weeks of May.",
      "It\u2019s too early to know where the half-ton mass of metal might come down or how much of it will survive reentry, according to space debris-tracking experts.",
      "Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek predicts the failed spacecraft will reenter around May 10. He estimates it will come crashing in at 150 mph (242 kph), if it remains intact.",
      "\u201cWhile not without risk, we should not be too worried,\u201d Langbroek said in an email.",
      "The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn't break apart, \"the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. \"But it cannot be completely excluded.\u201d",
      "The Soviet Union launched the spacecraft known as Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth orbit because of a rocket malfunction.",
      "Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself \u2014 a spherical object about 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter \u2014 has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude.",
      "It's quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus (nearly 500-kilogram) spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.",
      "Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.",
      "It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics' Jonathan McDowell said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, \u201cit'll reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.\u201d",
      "The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America's Cape Horn. But since most of the planet is water, \u201cchances are good it will indeed end up in some ocean,\u201d Langbroek said.",

      "\u201cShe just nails that one,\u201d swaying her head in time to the tempo changes, said Peter Cook, a behavioral neuroscientist at New College of Florida who has spent a decade studying Ronan\u2019s rhythmic abilities.",

      "A former rescue sea lion, she burst to fame around a decade ago after scientists reported her musical skills. From age 3, she has been a resident at the University of California, Santa Cruz\u2019s Long Marine Laboratory, where researchers including Cook have tested and honed her ability to recognize rhythms.",

      "But in the years since since Ronan came into the spotlight, questions emerged about whether she still had it. Was her past dancing a fluke? Was Ronan better than people at keeping a beat?",

      "The result: Ronan still has it. She\u2019s back and she\u2019s better than ever.",
      "This time the researchers focused not on studio music but on percussion beats in a laboratory. They filmed Ronan bobbing her head as the drummer played three different tempos \u2014 112, 120, and 128 beats per minute. Two of those beats Ronan had never been exposed to, allowing scientists to test her flexibility in recognizing new rhythms.",
      "And the researchers asked 10 college students to do the same, waving their forearm to changing beats.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Conservative activist Robby Starbuck has filed a defamation lawsuit against Meta alleging that the social media giant's artificial intelligence chatbot spread false statements about him, including that he participated in the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Starbuck, known for targeting corporate DEI programs, said he discovered the claims made by Meta's AI in August 2024, when he was going after \u201cwoke DEI\u201d policies at motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson.",
      "\u201cOne dealership was unhappy with me and they posted a screenshot from Meta\u2019s AI in an effort to attack me,\u201d he said in a post on X. \u201cThis screenshot was filled with lies. I couldn\u2019t believe it was real so I checked myself. It was even worse when I checked.\u201d",
      "Since then, he said he has \u201cfaced a steady stream of false accusations that are deeply damaging to my character and the safety of my family.\u201d",
      "The political commentator said he was in Tennessee during the Jan. 6 riot. The suit, filed in Delaware Superior Court on Tuesday, seeks more than $5 million in damages.",
      "In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Meta said that \u201cas part of our continuous effort to improve our models, we have already released updates and will continue to do so.\u201d",
      "Starbuck's lawsuit joins the ranks of several other similar cases in which people have sued AI platforms over information provided by chatbots. In 2023, a conservative radio host in Georgia filed a defamation suit against OpenAI alleging ChatGPT provided false information by saying he defrauded and embezzled funds from the Second Amendment Foundation, a gun-rights group.",
      "When Starbuck discovered the claims made by Meta's AI, he tried to alert the company about the error and enlist its help to address the problem. The complaint said Starbuck contacted Meta\u2019s managing executives and legal counsel, and even asked its AI about what should be done to address the allegedly false outputs.",
      "According to the lawsuit, he then asked Meta to \"retract the false information, investigate the cause of the error, implement safeguards and quality control processes to prevent similar harm in the future, and communicate transparently with all Meta AI users about what would be done.\u201d",
      "The filing alleges that Meta was unwilling to make those changes or \u201ctake meaningful responsibility for its conduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead, it allowed its AI to spread false information about Mr. Starbuck for months after being put on notice of the falsity, at which time it \u2018fixed\u2019 the problem by wiping Mr. Starbuck\u2019s name from its written responses altogether,\u201d the suit said.",
      "Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, responded to a video Starbuck posted to X outlining the lawsuit and called the situation \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is clearly not how our AI should operate,\" Kaplan said on X. \"We\u2019re sorry for the results it shared about you and that the fix we put in place didn\u2019t address the underlying problem.\u201d",
      "Kaplan said he is working with Meta's product team to \u201cunderstand how this happened and explore potential solutions.\u201d",
      "Starbuck said that in addition to falsely saying he participated in the the riot at the U.S. Capitol, Meta AI also falsely claimed he engaged in Holocaust denial, and said he pleaded guilty to a crime despite never having been \u201carrested or charged with a single crime in his life.\u201d",
      "Meta later \u201cblacklisted\u201d Starbuck's name, he said, adding that the move did not solve the problem because Meta includes his name in news stories, which allows users to then ask for more information about him.",
      "\u201cWhile I\u2019m the target today, a candidate you like could be the next target, and lies from Meta\u2019s AI could flip votes that decide the election,\u201d Starbuck said on X. \u201cYou could be the next target too.\u201d",

      "The members of Picuris Pueblo, a sovereign nation in New Mexico, have oral histories and cultural traditions that link them to the region of Chaco Canyon.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been telling our stories as long as time immemorial,\u201d said Picuris Lt. Gov. Craig Quanchello. But he said those traditions were often \"overlooked and erased.\"",
      "As members of the Picuris Pueblo seek a greater voice in shaping decisions about the future of Chaco Canyon, where debates about oil and gas drilling loom, leaders including Quanchello decided that using DNA sequencing to complement or corroborate their oral histories could be a useful tool. The group began a collaboration with an international team of geneticists.",
      "\"The DNA could help us protect\" our heritage, he said. \"Now we can say, \u2018This is ours, we need to protect it.\u2019\"",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, show close links between the genomes of 13 current members of Picuris and ancient DNA recovered from 16 Picuris individuals who lived between 1300 A.D. and 1500 A.D. in or near Chaco Canyon.",
      "Today the members of Picuris Pueblo live about 170 miles west of Chaco Canyon, between Santa Fe and Taos.",
      "\u201cThe results show a strong relationship between ancient and present-day Picuris,\u201d said co-author Thomaz Pinotti, a geneticist at the University of Copenhagen.",
      "The genetic analysis was led by the Picuris. The researchers said this model of collaboration contrasts with a long history of archaeologists and geneticists seizing and studying artifacts and remains without the consent of Indigenous groups.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy decision\u201d to begin the collaboration with scientists, said co-author and Picuris Gov. Wayne Yazza. \u201cThis is life-changing data.\u201d",
      "There are 19 Pueblo tribes in New Mexico. The new study does not refute the historic connections of other tribes to Chaco Canyon.",
      "Chaco Culture National Historical Park is a UNESCO World Heritage site managed by the U.S. National Park Service. It is famous for sweeping desert vistas and for monumental sandstone structures \u2014 including multistory homes and ceremonial structures \u2014 built by ancestral Pueblos.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s super important that we don\u2019t talk about Chaco in the category of \u2018lost civilizations,\u2019 like the Egyptian pyramids or Stonehenge,\u201d said Paul Reed, a preservation archaeologist at Archaeology Southwest, who was not involved in the study. That notion \"is particularly damaging in this instance because it disenfranchises the Pueblo people who live all around the canyon to this day.\u201d",
      "Brian Vallo, a member of the Acoma Pueblo who leads the Chaco Heritage Tribal Association, said a current concern revolves around drilling and mining permits on federal land adjacent to the park, which also impact the environment within the canyon.",
      "\u201cWe have these close connections because our ancestors migrated and built these places \u2013- they remain central to the preservation of our own Indigenous culture,\u201d said Vallo, who was not part of the research.",

      "LONDON -- Microsoft pledged Wednesday to fight any U.S. government order to halt data center operations in Europe as it sought to soothe concerns among European customers that trans-Atlantic tensions would lead to service disruptions.",

      "The U.S. and Ukraine have signed an agreement that will give the U.S. access to Ukraine's vast critical mineral resources",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and Ukraine on Wednesday signed an agreement granting American access to Ukraine\u2019s vast mineral resources, finalizing a deal months in the making that could enable continued military aid to Kyiv amid concerns that President Donald Trump might scale back support in ongoing peace negotiations with Russia.",
      "The two sides offered only barebone details about the structure of the deal, which they called the United States-Ukraine Reinvestment Fund. But it is expected to give the U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s valuable rare earth minerals while providing Kyiv a measure of assurance about continued American support in its grinding war with Russia.",
      "\u201cThis agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides\u2019 commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes at a critical moment in the three-year war as Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with both sides. The signing comes two months after a different but similar agreement was nearly signed before being derailed in a tense Oval Office meeting involving President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Trump has long criticized Zelenskyy, saying he didn\u2019t \u201chave the cards\u201d to win the war and blaming him for prolonging the killing by not giving up Crimea, but in recent days has rebuked Russian President Vladimir Putin as well, saying he was complicating negotiations with \u201cvery bad timing\u201d in launching deadly strikes on Kyiv.",
      "Trump said Wednesday night on NewsNation that the deal, \u201cin theory,\u201d means that the U.S. will get more from Ukraine than it contributed. \u201cI wanted to be protected,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t want to be looking \u201cfoolish\u201d by not getting money back for the investment.",
      "For Ukraine, the agreement is seen as key to ensuring its access to future U.S. military aid.",
      "\u201cTruly, this is a strategic deal for the creation of an investment partner fund,\u201d said Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. \u201cThis is truly an equal and good international deal on joint investment in the development and restoration of Ukraine between the governments of the United States and Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Ukraine\u2019s economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, flew to Washington on Wednesday to help finalize the deal.",
      "\u201cTogether with the United States, we are creating the Fund that will attract global investment to our country,\u201d she said in a post on X after the signing.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Bessent said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House \u2014 hours after Ukrainian officials indicated a deal was nearly finalized \u2014 that there was still work to do.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainians decided last night to make some last-minute changes,\" Bessent said when asked about reports that Ukraine was ready to agree to the pact. \"We\u2019re sure that they will reconsider that. And we are ready to sign this afternoon if they are.\u201d",
      "He didn't elaborate as to the late changes he said Ukraine made.",
      "The U.S. has been seeking access to more than 20 raw materials deemed strategically critical to its interests, including some non-minerals such as oil and natural gas. Among them are Ukraine's deposits of titanium, which is used for making aircraft wings and other aerospace manufacturing, and uranium, which is used for nuclear power, medical equipment and weapons. Ukraine also has lithium, graphite and manganese, which are used in electric vehicle batteries.",
      "After Kyiv felt the initial U.S. draft of the deal disproportionately favored American interests, it introduced new provisions aimed at addressing those concerns.",
      "According to Shmyhal, the latest version would establish an equal partnership between the two countries and last for 10 years. Financial contributions to a joint fund would be made in cash, and only new U.S. military aid would count toward the American share. Assistance provided before the agreement was signed would not be counted. Unlike an earlier draft, the deal would not conflict with Ukraine\u2019s path toward European Union membership \u2014 a key provision for Kyiv.",
      "The Ukrainian Cabinet approved the agreement Wednesday, empowering Svyrydenko to sign it in Washington. The deal still needs to be ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament before it can take effect.",
      "The negotiations come amid rocky progress in Washington's push to stop the war.",
      "Putin backs calls for a ceasefire before peace negotiations, \u201cbut before it\u2019s done, it\u2019s necessary to answer a few questions and sort out a few nuances,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Putin is also ready for direct talks with Ukraine without preconditions to seek a peace deal, he added.",
      "\u201cWe realize that Washington wants to achieve quick progress, but we hope for understanding that the Ukrainian crisis settlement is far too complex to be done quickly,\u201d Peskov said during his daily conference call with reporters.",
      "Trump has expressed frustration over the slow pace of progress in negotiations aimed at stopping the war. Western European leaders have accused Putin of stalling while his forces seek to grab more Ukrainian land. Russia has captured nearly a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory since Moscow's forces launched a full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Trump has long dismissed the war as a waste of lives and American taxpayer money \u2014 a complaint he repeated Wednesday during his Cabinet meeting. That could spell an end to crucial military help for Ukraine and heavier economic sanctions on Russia.",
      "The U.S. State Department on Tuesday tried again to push both sides to move more quickly and warned that the U.S. could pull out of the negotiations if there's no progress.",
      "\u201cWe are now at a time where concrete proposals need to be delivered by the two parties on how to end this conflict,\" department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce quoted Secretary of State Marco Rubio as telling her.",
      "Russia has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day ceasefire, making it conditional on a halt to Ukraine\u2019s mobilization effort and Western arms supplies to Kyiv.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed Wednesday that Ukraine had accepted an unconditional truce only because it was being pushed back on the battlefield, where the bigger Russian forces have the upper hand.",
      "Meanwhile, Ukrainian civilians have been killed or wounded in attacks every day this year, according to a U.N. report presented Tuesday in New York.",
      "The U.N. Human Rights Office said in the report that in the first three months of this year, it had verified 2,641 civilian casualties in Ukraine. That was almost 900 more than during the same period last year.",
      "Also, between April 1-24, civilian casualties in Ukraine were up 46% from the same weeks in 2024, it said.",
      "The daily grind of the war shows no sign of letting up. A nighttime Russian drone attack on Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, Kharkiv, wounded at least 45 civilians, Ukrainian officials said.",
      "Also Wednesday, the Ukrainian Security Service claimed its drones struck the Murom Instrument Engineering Plant in Russia\u2019s Vladimir region overnight, causing five explosions and a fire at the military facility. The claim could not be independently verified.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government has issued a new policy for terminating international students' legal status",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government has begun shedding new light on a crackdown on international students, spelling out how it targeted thousands of people and laying out the grounds for terminating their legal status.",
      "The new details emerged in lawsuits filed by some of the students who suddenly had their status canceled in recent weeks with little explanation.",
      "In the past month, foreign students around the U.S. have been rattled to learn their records had been removed from a student database maintained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Some went into hiding for fear of deportation or abandoned their studies to return home.",
      "On Friday, after mounting court challenges, federal officials said the government was restoring international students' legal status while it developed a framework to guide future terminations. In a court filing Monday, it shared the new policy: a document issued over the weekend with guidance on a range of reasons students' status can be canceled, including the revocation of the visas they used to enter the U.S.",
      "Brad Banias, an immigration attorney representing a student whose status was terminated, said the new guidelines vastly expand ICE's authority beyond previous policy, which did not count visa revocation as grounds for losing legal status. In the past, if a student had their visa revoked, they could stay in the U.S. to finish their studies \u2014 they simply would not be able to reenter if they left the country.",
      "\u201cThis just gave them carte blanche to have the State Department revoke a visa and then deport those students even if they\u2019ve done nothing wrong,\u201d Banias said.",
      "Many of the students who had visas revoked or lost their legal status said they had only minor infractions on their record, including traffic violations. Some did not know why they were targeted at all.",
      "Lawyers for the government provided some explanation at a hearing Tuesday in the case of Banias' client Akshar Patel, an international student studying information systems in Texas. Patel's status was terminated \u2014 and then reinstated \u2014 this month, and he is seeking a preliminary court ruling to keep him from being deported.",
      "In court filings and in the hearing, Department of Homeland Security officials said they ran the names of student visa holders through the National Crime Information Center, an FBI-run database that contains reams of information related to crimes. It includes the names of suspects, missing persons and people who have been arrested, even if they have never been charged with a crime or had charges dropped.",
      "In total, about 6,400 students were identified in the database search, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes said in the hearing Tuesday. One of the students was Patel, who had been pulled over and charged with reckless driving in 2018. The charge was ultimately dropped \u2014 information that is also in NCIC.",
      "Patel appears in a spreadsheet with 734 students whose names had come up in NCIC. That spreadsheet was forwarded to a Homeland Security official, who, within 24 hours of receiving it, replied: \u201cPlease terminate all in SEVIS.\u201d That's a different database listing foreigners who have legal status as students in the U.S.",
      "Reyes said the short time frame suggested that no one had reviewed the records individually to find out why the students' names came up in NCIC.",
      "\u201cAll of this could have been avoided if someone had taken a beat,\u201d said Reyes, who was appointed by President Joe Biden. She said the government had demonstrated \u201can utter lack of concern for individuals who have come into this country.\u201d",
      "When colleges discovered the students no longer had legal status, it prompted chaos and confusion. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school.",
      "In some cases this spring, colleges told students to stop working or taking classes immediately and warned them they could be deported.",
      "Still, government attorneys said the change in the database did not mean the students actually lost legal status, even though some of the students were labeled \u201cfailure to maintain status.\u201d Instead, lawyers said, it was intended to be an \u201cinvestigative red flag.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Patel is lawfully present in the U.S.,\u201d Andre Watson of the Department of Homeland Security said. \u201cHe is not subject to immediate detention or removal.\u201d",
      "Reyes declined to issue a preliminary injunction and urged lawyers from both sides to come to a settlement to ensure Patel could stay in the U.S.",

      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- After retreating from their workplace diversity, equity and inclusion programs, tech companies could now face a second reckoning over their DEI work in AI products.",
      "In the White House and the Republican-led Congress, \"woke AI\u201d has replaced harmful algorithmic discrimination as a problem that needs fixing. Past efforts to \u201cadvance equity\u201d in AI development and curb the production of \u201charmful and biased outputs\u201d are a target of investigation, according to subpoenas sent to Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and 10 other tech companies last month by the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "And the standard-setting branch of the U.S. Commerce Department has deleted mentions of AI fairness, safety and \u201cresponsible AI\u201d in its appeal for collaboration with outside researchers. It is instead instructing scientists to focus on \u201creducing ideological bias\u201d in a way that will \u201cenable human flourishing and economic competitiveness,\u201d according to a copy of the document obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "In some ways, tech workers are used to a whiplash of Washington-driven priorities affecting their work.",
      "But the latest shift has raised concerns among experts in the field, including Harvard University sociologist Ellis Monk, who several years ago was approached by Google to help make its AI products more inclusive.",
      "Back then, the tech industry already knew it had a problem with the branch of AI that trains machines to \u201csee\u201d and understand images. Computer vision held great commercial promise but echoed the historical biases found in earlier camera technologies that portrayed Black and brown people in an unflattering light.",
      "\u201cBlack people or darker skinned people would come in the picture and we\u2019d look ridiculous sometimes,\u201d said Monk, a scholar of colorism, a form of discrimination based on people\u2019s skin tones and other features.",
      "Google adopted a color scale invented by Monk that improved how its AI image tools portray the diversity of human skin tones, replacing a decades-old standard originally designed for doctors treating white dermatology patients.",
      "\u201cConsumers definitely had a huge positive response to the changes,\u201d he said.",
      "Now Monk wonders whether such efforts will continue in the future. While he doesn't believe that his Monk Skin Tone Scale is threatened because it's already baked into dozens of products at Google and elsewhere \u2014 including camera phones, video games, AI image generators \u2014 he and other researchers worry that the new mood is chilling future initiatives and funding to make technology work better for everyone.",
      "\u201cGoogle wants their products to work for everybody, in India, China, Africa, et cetera. That part is kind of DEI-immune,\" Monk said. \u201cBut could future funding for those kinds of projects be lowered? Absolutely, when the political mood shifts and when there\u2019s a lot of pressure to get to market very quickly.\u201d",
      "Trump has cut hundreds of science, technology and health funding grants touching on DEI themes, but its influence on commercial development of chatbots and other AI products is more indirect. In investigating AI companies, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, chair of the judiciary committee, said he wants to find out whether former President Joe Biden's administration \u201ccoerced or colluded with\" them to censor lawful speech.",
      "Michael Kratsios, director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy, said at a Texas event this month that Biden's AI policies were \u201cpromoting social divisions and redistribution in the name of equity.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration declined to make Kratsios available for an interview but quoted several examples of what he meant. One was a line from a Biden-era AI research strategy that said: \u201cWithout proper controls, AI systems can amplify, perpetuate, or exacerbate inequitable or undesirable outcomes for individuals and communities.\u201d",
      "Even before Biden took office, a growing body of research and personal anecdotes was attracting attention to the harms of AI bias.",
      "One study showed self-driving car technology has a hard time detecting darker-skinned pedestrians, putting them in greater danger of getting run over. Another study asking popular AI text-to-image generators to make a picture of a surgeon found they produced a white man about 98% percent of the time, far higher than the real proportions even in a heavily male-dominated field.",
      "Face-matching software for unlocking phones misidentified Asian faces. Police in U.S. cities wrongfully arrested Black men based on false face recognition matches. And a decade ago, Google\u2019s own photos app sorted a picture of two Black people into a category labeled as \u201cgorillas.\u201d",
      "Even government scientists in the first Trump administration concluded in 2019 that facial recognition technology was performing unevenly based on race, gender or age.",
      "Biden's election propelled some tech companies to accelerate their focus on AI fairness. The 2022 arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT added new priorities, sparking a commercial boom in new AI applications for composing documents and generating images, pressuring companies like Google to ease its caution and catch up.",
      "Then came Google's Gemini AI chatbot \u2014 and a flawed product rollout last year that would make it the symbol of \u201cwoke AI\u201d that conservatives hoped to unravel. Left to their own devices, AI tools that generate images from a written prompt are prone to perpetuating the stereotypes accumulated from all the visual data they were trained on.",
      "Google's was no different, and when asked to depict people in various professions, it was more likely to favor lighter-skinned faces and men, and, when women were chosen, younger women, according to the company's own public research.",
      "Google tried to place technical guardrails to reduce those disparities before rolling out Gemini's AI image generator just over a year ago. It ended up overcompensating for the bias, placing people of color and women in inaccurate historical settings, such as answering a request for American founding fathers with images of men in 18th century attire who appeared to be Black, Asian and Native American. Google quickly apologized and temporarily pulled the plug on the feature, but the outrage became a rallying cry taken up by the political right.",
      "With Google CEO Sundar Pichai sitting nearby, Vice President JD Vance used an AI summit in Paris in February to decry the advancement of \u201cdownright ahistorical social agendas through AI,\u201d naming the moment when Google\u2019s AI image generator was \u201ctrying to tell us that George Washington was Black, or that America\u2019s doughboys in World War I were, in fact, women.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have to remember the lessons from that ridiculous moment,\u201d Vance declared at the gathering. \"And what we take from it is that the Trump administration will ensure that AI systems developed in America are free from ideological bias and never restrict our citizens\u2019 right to free speech.\u201d",
      "A former Biden science adviser who attended that speech, Alondra Nelson, said the Trump administration's new focus on AI's \u201cideological bias\u201d is in some ways a recognition of years of work to address algorithmic bias that can affect housing, mortgages, health care and other aspects of people's lives.",
      "\u201cFundamentally, to say that AI systems are ideologically biased is to say that you identify, recognize and are concerned about the problem of algorithmic bias, which is the problem that many of us have been worried about for a long time,\u201d said Nelson, the former acting director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy who co-authored a set of principles to protect civil rights and civil liberties in AI applications.",
      "But Nelson doesn't see much room for collaboration amid the denigration of equitable AI initiatives.",
      "\u201cI think in this political space, unfortunately, that is quite unlikely,\u201d she said. \u201cProblems that have been differently named \u2014 algorithmic discrimination or algorithmic bias on the one hand, and ideological bias on the other \u2014- will be regrettably seen us as two different problems.\u201d",

      "In her extensive testimony this week, McCabe recounted that she had attended a social gathering at a bar the night before O'Keefe was found unresponsive in the snow with him, Read and others. McCabe was also at the get-together following the gathering at the bar at a home belonging to her sister and brother-in-law, a Boston police officer.",
      "McCabe and another friend of O'Keefe's -- Kerry Roberts -- another key trial witness who testified last week -- drove with Read through a blizzard to search for O'Keefe after he never came home the night before, ultimately finding him outside McCabe's sister's home unresponsive.",
      "McCabe testified Wednesday that while talking to a first responder at the scene, she heard Read say, \"I hit him, I hit him, I hit him.\"",
      "Defense attorney Alan Jackson grilled McCabe on her recollection of the events of that day and in the days, weeks, months and years after, highlighting inconsistencies in her various testimonies and against police reports.",
      "In one instance, Jackson noted that, after receiving a call from O'Keefe's niece and Read that O'Keefe was missing, McCabe had called her sister, though she did not mention that call while testifying to the grand jury that indicted Read on the manslaughter and murder charges.",
      "\"There's nothing nefarious,\" McCabe said about the call, testifying that her sister did not answer and she didn't remember calling her.",
      "Asked by Jackson on her use of the word \"nefarious,\" McCabe said, \"There's nothing about me calling my sister that is nefarious, and I feel like you're insinuating it might be and it's not.\"",
      "Jackson also questioned McCabe about a broken taillight on Read's SUV. McCabe testified that Read first mentioned the broken taillight in the early morning call with O'Keefe's niece, though Jackson said that wasn't included in a police report. McCabe stood by her account.",
      "When pressed on forgetting certain details from that time, McCabe said, \"There are certain things I'll never forget.\"",
      "Jackson's cross-examination also focused on McCabe's Google search for how long it takes to die in the cold. She testified this week that Read asked her to Google that after finding O'Keefe in the snow, with the search made after 6 a.m. Though Jackson said there is evidence it was made at 2:27 a.m. that morning, hours before O'Keefe was found. McCabe denied she made the search at 2:27 a.m. and said she searched it later that morning, upon Read's request.",
      "Jackson also alleged that a group chat including McCabe and several family members showed they were colluding in the days following the death to coordinate their statements, which McCabe denied.",
      "As he wrapped up his cross-examination, Jackson grilled McCabe on the moments after they found O'Keefe in the snow outside her sister's home, and why she didn't run in to check on her sister and brother-in-law.",
      "\"The reason you didn't go inside the house is because you knew better,\" he charged.",
      "McCabe said she wasn't worried because \"something happened on the front lawn that had nothing to do with anything inside that house.\"",
      "\"You weren't worried about them at all because you knew what really happened, didn't you?\" he countered.",
      "\"At that moment, I didn't know that he was hit by a vehicle and there was taillight found next to him,\" she responded.",
      "On re-direct, special prosecutor Hank Brennan questioned McCabe on her state of mind upon finding O'Keefe.",
      "\"I was shocked, confused, nervous, scared, anxious -- my friend was lying there on the ground, I didn't know what happened,\" she said.",
      "On the Google search, McCabe affirmed that Read asked her to search how long to die in the cold, and that she had never attempted that search before then.",
      "Brennan brought up McCabe's texts with Roberts later that day, including one in which Roberts texted, \"I can't stop seeing him in the snow, Jen, this is awful.\"",
      "\"Is your state of mind collusion?\" Brennan asked McCabe, to which she responded, \"No.\"",
      "McCabe has been dismissed as a witness. The trial adjourned for the day, with a forensic scientist from the Massachusetts State Police Crime Lab on the stand.",
      "Following McCabe's testimony on Wednesday, Read alleged McCabe was lying on the stand, saying she never told the witness to make a Google search that morning.",
      "\"Every statement's different. Under oath. Not under oath,\" she said. \"This is very similar to what we saw a year ago.\"",

    "story": [
      "The policy is described by HHS official as \"radical,\" but it is short on details",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will require new vaccines to undergo placebo testing, marking what a department spokesperson called \"a radical departure from past practices.\"",
      "The policy change would force vaccines, in order to be approved for human use, to undergo studies in which half of individuals in a study receive a placebo \u2013 typically a saline shot \u2013 to compare results against the vaccine.",
      "Placebo-controlled trials are already used to test new drugs or vaccines for safety and efficacy, but some experts consider it unethical to conduct such trials when a vaccine or treatment is already considered safe and efficacious. For example, they say, giving half of the kids in a trial a placebo for the measles vaccine when an already proven vaccine exists would put those participants unnecessarily at risk for the virus.",
      "It remains unclear what HHS considers a \"new\" vaccine and whether that includes the flu and COVID vaccines, which are updated on an annual basis to better protect against currently circulating strains.",
      "\"FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has indicated that significant updates to existing vaccines\u2014such as those addressing seasonal strain changes or antigenic drift\u2014may be considered 'new products' requiring additional clinical evaluation,\" the department spokesperson told ABC News.",
      "But the spokesperson indicated the yearly flu vaccine might not be affected by the policy, calling it \"tried and tested for more than 80 years.\"",
      "It appears, instead, that the policy could impact the rollout of future COVID vaccines, which are updated annually.",
      "When asked to elaborate on what the department considers a \"new\" vaccine, the spokesperson said that federal health agencies would follow the \"Gold Standard of Science\".",
      "Kennedy has long questioned the safety of vaccines and argued that placebo-based trials are needed to ensure vaccines aren't doing more harm than good.",
      "Even as thousands were dying during the COVID-19 public health emergency, COVID vaccines still underwent placebo-controlled studies with more than 100,000 volunteers from diverse populations. Experts say the practice is necessary to determine if a vaccine is not only effective, but also safe.",
      "Many childhood vaccines were originally tested with placebo trials. Others have been available for decades, providing data from millions of people showing those vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and effective.",
      "Once a vaccine for a disease is approved safe and effective, future versions of the shot are tested in clinical trials against the already approved shot. Clinical trials test whether the updated vaccines generate an immune response that's comparable to or better than previous versions of the vaccine.",
      "Even after vaccines are made available to the public, scientists continue to monitor them for safety. They also review any reports of side effects or reactions and share these facts with the public.",

      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting pointed out that Congress controls its funding, not the president.",
      "\"CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the President's authority,\" Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of the CPB, said in a statement Friday. \"Congress directly authorized and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government.\"",
      "She continued, \"In creating CPB, Congress expressly forbade 'any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over educational television or radio broadcasting, or over [CPB] or any of its grantees or contractors.'\"",
      "Trump signed the executive order instructing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to \"cease direct funding to NPR and PBS\" on his way to Florida aboard Air Force One on Thursday",
      "The order blocks federal funding to NPR and PBS to the maximum extent allowed by law, according to a fact sheet from the White House. It also prevents indirect funding to PBS and NPR by prohibiting local public radio and television stations, and any other recipients of CPB funds, from using taxpayer dollars to support the organizations.",
      "The order mandates that the CPB revise its 2025 General Provisions to explicitly prohibit direct or indirect funding to NPR and PBS. It directs all federal agencies to terminate any direct or indirect funding to NPR and PBS and to review existing grants and contracts for compliance. Additionally, it instructs the Federal Communications Commission and relevant agencies to investigate whether NPR and PBS have engaged in unlawful discrimination.",
      "In the fact sheet, the White House claims the two news organizations \"have fueled partisanship and left-wing propaganda with taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "In an interview with ABC News on Friday, PBS president and CEO Paula Kerger said a loss in federal funding would hit audiences in rural communities hard. Kerger said that their access to stations has been historically dependent on government funding and that content from children's programming to backup emergency alerts could be negatively impacted by cuts.",
      "\"They formed PBS as a way that we could bring the dollars together from around the country from all of our stations,\" Kerger said. \"That would help us create the kids content that people have loved for many decades and that have really raised generations of children.\"",
      "For some stations, the situation could be dire, she said.",

    "summary": "Experts are pushing back after the HHS released a report, calling for the use of psychotherapy among children and teens with gender dysphoria over gender-affirming care.",
    "story": [
      "Experts say gender-affirming care is safe and improves youth mental health.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released what it called a \"comprehensive review\" of transgender care for children and teens on Thursday, calling for broader use of psychotherapy for young people with gender dysphoria rather than gender-affirming care.",
      "The more than 400-page document details alleged harms from medical interventions for youth, including the use of puberty blockers, and alleged risks, such as infertility.",
      "The \"review of evidence and best practices report\" is a response to a January executive order issued by President Donald Trump, saying the federal government would not \"fund, sponsor, promote, assist or support\" transition care for those under age 19.",
      "\"Our duty is to protect our nation's children -- not expose them to unproven and irreversible medical interventions,\" Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in a statement on Thursday. \"We must follow the gold standard of science, not activist agendas.\"",
      "Gender-affirming care is supported by multiple major medical organizations. It can range from allowing a child to pick their pronouns to treatments typically prescribed for older teens. Studies show treatments are generally safe and that care has a positive impact on mental health, which psychotherapy alone cannot provide, experts said.",
      "\"Requiring that somebody [go] through a prescribed course of therapy can be misused by governments to try to essentially block access to care,\" Dr. Dan Karasic, professor emeritus of psychiatry at the University of California San Francisco Weill Institute for Neurosciences, told ABC News. \"There just isn't evidence that psychotherapy resolves gender dysphoria.\"",
      "Safety of puberty blockers, hormone therapies",
      "One of the most common treatments in gender-affirming care is the use of puberty blockers, which are used to delay the onset of puberty among transgender and gender-diverse youth.",
      "The report claimed its review of studies found low evidence that puberty blockers are safe or that they improved mental health among children with gender dysphoria, and \"high certainty evidence\" that they often cause infertility.",
      "The reported also stated, \"Low certainty evidence suggests that puberty blockers may compromise bone health.\"",
      "However, studies have shown that adults who used puberty blockers in the past experienced menstrual cycles, childbirth and miscarriages at similar rates to those of the general population.",
      "Dr. Morissa Ladinsky, a clinical professor in pediatrics at Stanford University in California, said puberty blockers have been used as a treatment for more than 30 years, primarily for a condition called CPP, or central precocious puberty, which is when puberty begins too early.",
      "\"These medications are immensely well-studied,\" she told ABC News. \"The long-term effects of puberty-pausing medications, when used in children, for temporary periods of time, do function as a completely reversible pause button.\"",
      "She said side effects related to sexual function or bone density are usually seen among adults, who may take the medications for prostate cancer in order to reduce testosterone, or endometriosis.",
      "The HHS report also discussed cross-sex hormones, more commonly known as hormone therapies, claiming there is \"high certainty evidence\" that hormone therapies have \"physiological effects\" and that many studies were \"not specifically designed to capture the full range of long-term outcomes.\"",
      "Although hormones can carry side effects, like any medicine, they can greatly improve the mental health of those with gender dysphoria, studies show.",
      "Ladinsky said hormone therapies are often used with older adolescents who have had sustained gender dysphoria over a long period of time.",
      "Hormone therapies \"are all used and have been used in pediatric and adolescent medicine, for a long, long, long time,\" she said. \"Any person who's ever used combination birth control pills has taken oral estrogen. So, it's not that these medicines are unique, experimental, pulled off a shelf. They're standard pharmacology in the practice of medicine.\"",
      "Controversy around surgeries",
      "The review said it found three studies on surgeries for children or adolescents with gender dysphoria \"with most considering mastectomy only.\"",
      "Gender-affirming mastectomy, known colloquially as \"top surgery,\" is a surgical procedure that removes breast tissue to create a more masculine-looking chest.",
      "The report said authors found low certainty of evidence on the effects of gender-affirming surgeries on adolescents including suicidality, depression, asexual function, quality of life and regret.",
      "Ladinsky said there are no gender-affirming genital surgeries that occur on minors and no other gender-affirming surgeries being performed on young children.",
      "\"There is a very small group of trans-masculine older teens, meaning 17-ish, 18, who -- in our evidence-based, guideline-driven standard of care -- does allow for a tiny group of these older trans-masculine teens with overwhelming and sustained gender dysphoria to have masculinizing chest surgery,\" she said.",
      "Ladinsky continued, \"That is very, very rare and that procedure can only be done with long periods of oversight around gender dysphoria with doctors, immense parental consent and professional endorsement by those caring for the young person.\"",
      "HHS advocates for psychotherapy",
      "The HHS report advocates for the use of psychotherapy as a treatment for children and adolescents with gender dysphoria.",
      "\"Psychotherapy is a noninvasive alternative to endocrine and surgical interventions for the treatment of pediatric gender dysphoria,\" the report stated. \"Systematic reviews of evidence have found no evidence of adverse effects of psychotherapy in this context.\"",
      "Karasic said certain kinds of psychotherapy can be used to treat symptoms of anxiety and depression among both cisgender and transgender individuals, but psychotherapy should not be considered a substitute for gender-affirming care.",
      "\"There's absolutely no evidence that psychotherapy is a substitute for those people who need medical care,\" he told ABC News. \"There's substantial evidence for the benefits of [gender-affirming] care for minors, and that's why all mainstream medical and mental health groups support this versus no evidence of psychotherapy being a substitute.\"",
      "Karasic said psychotherapy is not bad, but rather that it has its place and, very often, children and teenagers receive psychotherapy along with medical intervention.",
      "\"If people are proposing the availability of therapy for people who need it, I think everyone would agree with that,\" he said. \"But when people are saying that medical intervention should not be provided because therapy can be used instead, that's wrong. There's just no evidence to support that.\"",
      "Response from the medical community",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics released a statement on Thursday saying it is \"deeply alarmed\" by the HHS report.",
      "\"For such an analysis to carry credibility, it must consider the totality of available data and the full spectrum of clinical outcomes rather than relying on select perspectives and a narrow set of data,\" the statement read in part. \"This report misrepresents the current medical consensus and fails to reflect the realities of pediatric care.\"",
      "AAP also released a statement with several groups, including the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Physicians, the American Osteopathic Association and the American Psychiatric Association, opposing an infringement on medical care.",
      "\"Our organizations have consistently opposed any legislation, regulation or executive action that interferes in the confidential relationship between a patient and their physician or undermines the provision of evidence-based standards of patient care and physician training and education,\" the statement, released on Thursday, read. \"Patients must must be able to discuss health issues with their trusted physician to determine together what care is best for them.\"",
      "More than 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced throughout the 2024 legislative session, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "Ladinsky said these bills are harmful and they don't resolve gender dysphoria for anyone.",
      "\"If government-sanctioned, blatant misinformation is utilized to make policy decisions that affect millions of Americans, we are opening a Pandora's box to greatly diminish the health of all people, rather than elevating it,\" she said. \"The other thing important is that we know from 25 states that have rendered illegal elements of this care, it hasn't made any children of trans identity no longer trans.\"",

    "summary": "Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX already has a footprint in South Texas but now wants to create an official municipality for the launch site called Starbase.",
    "story": [
      "Some locals are worried about SpaceX's efforts to make a Starbase municipality.",
      "SpaceX is shooting for Mars, with Elon Musk's rocket company racing to bring humanity closer to being a multi-planetary species. Back here on Earth, the leader of President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is hoping his company gets a chance to start a government of its own in Texas.",
      "Starbase is where SpaceX researches, launches and tests rockets and it could soon become the newest town in America.",
      "However, this wouldn't be your typical town; it would be a company community now filled with mostly SpaceX employees.",
      "It's less than two square miles in size and it butts right up to a Texas state nature preserve and Boca Chica Beach along the Gulf Shore.",
      "Last year, a petition was submitted to the state of Texas by SpaceX to create a new town; the new municipality would function as its own city with the ability to create its own fire department and emergency services, even a school district.",
      "A few hundred current registered residents, including Musk himself who is registered to vote at an address within the proposed town, are now voting on making it official -- what was once a small, sleepy beach community on the outskirts of Brownsville, Texas, could be officially known as Starbase City.",
      "Brownsville resident Rene Medrano's home sits 20 miles from the coast. Having gone to Boca Chica Beach as a kid and bringing his own family once he got older, Medrano told ABC News it's in his blood.",
      "\"It was called a poor man's beach because you didn't have to pay anything to go to the beach other than just get in your car, get in your truck, round up the neighbors, round up the cousins, round up the aunts and uncles and let's go have fun,\" he said. \"And to see now the way it is\u2026it's just, disheartening is what it is.\"",
      "SpaceX had its first Starship launch in April 2023; successfully coming off and clearing the launch pad, then losing control of its super heavy booster engines. The company said it triggered Starship's flight termination system after the boosters failed to separate and it veered off its planned trajectory.",
      "However, the company was laying the groundwork for something much bigger more than a decade ago. Medrano recalled a SpaceX representative going to his wife's school to pitch a \"small test site\" in 2014, but said the person told locals the beach would remain accessible to them.",
      "\"Who would ever think they wanted to go to Mars 10 years later?\" he said. \"I mean, that was never in the formula. You know?\"",
      "Since 2014, SpaceX has had eight launches from Boca Chica with staggered success. Now, the company is asking the FAA to grant permits that would allow SpaceX to launch up to 25 times a year.",
      "\"You have a lot of visitors that go to the island to see the rocket launches. But then those people leave,\" Medrano said. \"We see the spaceship blowups. We see the environments, you know, with all the rocket launches being torn up around that area. We see Boca Chica Beach the way we knew it -- we don't know that place anymore.\"",
      "Bekah Hinojosa, who leads a local environmental group, told ABC News that SpaceX has disrupted everyday life in the area.",
      "\"The rocket launches are dangerous. They cause our homes to shake. SpaceX has been caught illegally dumping polluted water onto Boca Chica Beach, into our ecosystems,\" she said. \"The rent is going up. And it's all associated with, you know, SpaceX coming into this area and colonizing the region.\"",
      "If this area becomes its own municipality, SpaceX wants control of the nearby beach and road that leads to the spaceport. Bills proposed in the Texas legislature would give Starbase the power to close beaches and roads on weekdays.",
      "Texas State Rep. Janie Lopez, who authored a bill related to Starbase, testified during an April 14 committee hearing that it won't take Boca Chica Beach away from the public.",
      "\"All it's doing is, if the people decide on May 3 that they want to make their own municipality, then they will decide who will be their governing board and they will make the decisions on closures based on what the FAA is requiring.\"",
      "There is real concern at the cost of SpaceX's ambitions for those who call the area home -- Medrano pointed to the state's Open Beaches Act, which guarantees free public access to its sandy shores.",
      "\"Give us the beach \u2026 I mean, what's so hard about that?\" he said. \"Go to Mars, do your thing, get your rockets and go. But let us do our thing too.\"",

      "White House Communications Director Steven Cheung defended Waltz's use of the app on Thursday afternoon, saying, \"Signal is an approved app that is loaded onto our government phones. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\"",
      "Waltz came under fire in March after he inadvertently invited a journalist, The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, to a Signal group chat with other national security officials, such as Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, where they discussed a U.S. attack on terrorists in Yemen.",

      "Despite the administration\u2019s position that Signal is an approved app, the Pentagon's internal watchdog criticized a former official's use of the Signal app in 2021, calling it a breach of the department's \"records retention policies\" and an unauthorized means of communicating sensitive information.",
      "Last month, DOD acting Inspector General Steven Stebbins announced he was starting an investigation into Hegseth's use of Signal during the Yemen attack. On Thursday a U.S. official confirmed to ABC News that the IG was looking into a second Signal chat in which Hegseth shared timing for the attack with his wife, brother and attorney.",

      "President Donald Trump, celebrating the 100-day mark of his second term with his Cabinet, admitted his tariffs could mean higher prices for Americans, but appeared to dismiss the impact on American families, including on children's toys.",
      "\"You know, somebody said, 'Oh, the shelves are going to be open.' Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\" Trump said on Wednesday.",
      "\"You know, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally,\" the president continued. \"But, we're not talking about something that we have to go out of our way.\"",
      "Trump went on to claim Americans didn't \"need\" many of the products that are imported from China, the world's second largest economy and the United States' third largest trading partner.",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, who joined press secretary Karoline Leavitt at a special briefing Thursday morning, argued Americans would be willing to pay more for American-made dolls.",
      "\"He was making the point that I think almost every American consumer agrees with, which is if they had a choice between a -- and I'm a parent of young children -- a choice between a doll from China that might have, say, lead paint in it, that is not as well constructed as a doll made in America, that has a higher environmental and regulatory standard, and that is made to a higher degree of quality, and those two products are both on Amazon that yes, you probably would be willing to pay more for a better made American product,\" Miller said.",
      "Trump's comments on dolls came a day after he pushed back on economic anxieties in an exclusive interview with ABC News.",
      "\"Hard times are ahead?\" ABC News anchor and Senior National Correspondent Terry Moran asked the president.",
      "\"I don't think so,\" Trump responded. \"I think great times are ahead.\"",
      "Trump's defended his tariff plan -- which includes product-specific levies on steel, aluminum and cars, a baseline 10% tariff on virtually all trade partners and a whopping $145% tariff on China -- as necessary to combat unfair trade deficits with other nations.",
      "He's also argued the taxes will bring a boost in manufacturing as companies will invest to make their products in America instead.",
      "But the administration's bumpy tariff rollout wiped away trillions in wealth as markets tumbled. Businesses continue to warn of possible price hikes and potential product shortages due to the levies. Trump said on Wednesday night, during a town hall with NewsNation, that he was in no rush to negotiate trade deals.",
      "Trump's message for Americans who may have concerns at the prospect of higher prices and other economic impacts was they voted for it -- despite his repeated promises on the campaign trail to bring down prices on Day 1 of his administration.",
      "\"With the economy, the number one issue for so many people, for just about everybody. It -- it's one of the main reasons that you're back in this office. And now we have this trade war with China that -- that Moody's and other analysts say is gonna cost American families thousands of more dollars per year. And there is a lot of concern out there. People are worried, even some people who voted for you, sayin', 'I didn't sign up for this.' So how do you answer those concerns?\" ABC's Moran asked Trump.",
      "\"Well, they did sign up for it, actually. And this is what I campaigned on,\" Trump responded. \"I said that we've been abused by other countries at levels that nobody's ever seen before \u2026 I could've left it that way, and at some point, there would've been an implosion like nobody's ever seen. But I said, 'No, we have to fix it.' I've -- I've wanted to do this for many years.\"",
      "The president's also repeatedly insisted that China will be hit harder in the trade war.",
      "\"You don't know whether or not China's gonna eat it,\" Trump told ABC on Tuesday.",
      "On Wednesday morning, the Commerce Department reported the U.S. economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.3% during the first quarter of 2025.",
      "Trump sought to deflect blame by pinning the contraction on his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"This is Biden's Stock Market, not Trump's,\" he posted on his conservative social media site. (In January 2024, when Biden was still president, Trump took credit for positive stock markets and cited poll numbers that showed him ahead of Biden).",
      "Trump even preemptively blamed Biden for second quarter data as well.",
      "\"This is Biden,\" he said. \"And you could even say the next quarter is sort of Biden because it doesn't just happen on a daily or an hourly basis,\" he said during his Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.",

      "The former presidential candidate spoke as she considers re-entering politics.",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who has stayed largely out of the political limelight since leaving office, sharply criticized President Donald Trump \u2013 her opponent in the 2024 presidential election \u2013 over tariffs, government cuts, and the direction his administration is taking the country, during remarks on Wednesday in San Francisco.",
      "Her remarks, delivered at the 20th anniversary celebration for Emerge, an organization that supports Democratic women running for office, came as the Trump administration celebrates its accomplishments in its first 100 days \u2013 a date Harris acknowledged.",
      "\"Now I know tonight's event happens to coincide with 100 days after the inauguration, and I'll leave it to others to give a full accounting of what's happened so far,\" Harris told the audience.",
      "\"But I will say this, instead of an administration working to advance America's highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals,\" she said.",
      "Harris has had few public appearances since departing the White House and has limited her political activity, but on Wednesday night, she called out Trump by name.",
      "\"We all know President Trump, his administration and their allies are counting on the notion that fear can be contagious. They are counting on the notion that, if they can make some people afraid, it will have a chilling effect on others,\" Harris said.",
      "\"But what they're overlooking, what they've overlooked, is that fear isn't the only thing that's contagious. Courage is contagious,\" Harris said to raucous cheers.",
      "Harris had brought up similar themes \u2013 including the \"courage is contagious\" line \u2013 during remarks at a women of color leaders summit in early April.",
      "That courage, Harris added on Wednesday, extends to Americans protesting against what she called \"the greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history.\"",
      "\"Americans across the political spectrum who are declaring that the president's reckless tariffs hurt workers and families by raising the cost of everyday essentials; devastate the retirement accounts that people spent a lifetime paying into; and paralyze American businesses, large and small forcing them to lay off people, stop hiring, or pause investment decisions,\" she said.",
      "Trump and the White House have argued that tariffs will help Americans be better off economically in the long run and will level the playing field between the U.S. and its trading partners.",
      "Later in her remarks, speaking more broadly about the White House's actions, Harris said she would describe the current moment in America as a \"high-velocity event\" to implement an agenda she claimed was \"decades in the making\" to shrink and privatize government while giving tax breaks to the wealthy.",
      "\"It's an agenda, a narrow self-serving vision of America, where they punish truth tellers, favor loyalists, cash in on their power and leave everyone to fend for themselves, all while abandoning allies and retreating from the world,\" Harris said. \"And folks, what we are experiencing right now is exactly what they envision for America.\"",
      "Americans should be ready, if the \"checks and balances\" such as Congress \"ultimately collapse,\" Harris said, to work together and raise their voices.",
      "\"I am not here tonight to offer all the answers, but I am here to say this, you are not alone, and we are all in this together -- and straight talk, things are probably going to get worse before they get better, but we are ready for it. We are not going to scatter. We are going to stand together, everyone a leader,\" Harris said.",
      "At the end of her remarks, Harris struck a populist note: \"Always remember this country is ours. It doesn't belong to whoever is in the White House. It belongs to you. It belongs to us. It belongs to We The People.\"",
      "The former Democratic nominee for president has had few public appearances since departing the White House, and has limited her political activity.",
      "Harris' speech came as she is set to possibly re-enter politics in the coming months. Harris has been mulling a run in California's gubernatorial race and will make a decision by the end of summer, two sources familiar with her plans told ABC News in March.",
      "Some Democrats have also floated her as a potential 2028 presidential candidate, although some of her longtime supporters have told ABC News they are torn over that prospect.",
      "Whether she runs for either office or not, Harris' public remarks thus far have sometimes included veiled and explicit swipes at the Trump administration and the president himself.",
      "In remarks at a women of color leaders summit in early April, she weighed in on the second Trump administration, saying \"there is a sense of fear that has been taking hold in our country\" but that \"courage is also contagious.\"",
      "And in remarks at the NAACP Image Awards in February, Harris framed the \"chapter\" America is in as one that \"will be written not simply by whoever occupies the oval office nor by the wealthiest among us. The American story will be written by you. Written by us. By we the people.\"",
      "Harris and her spouse, Doug Emhoff, have been the target of recent actions by Trump.",
      "Trump issued a memo in March that revoked the security clearances and access to classified information of his previous presidential opponents -- Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris -- as well as more than a dozen former administration officials. On Tuesday, Emhoff said he had been dismissed from the board of trustees of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum as the White House confirmed it had removed board members.",

      "Promise comes amid review into equal opportunity programs, cuts to personnel.",
      "The U.S. military's standards for investigating sex assault reports and sexual harassment complaints will remain unchanged, a senior official told reporters on Thursday, as the Pentagon launches a separate department-wide review into how discrimination claims are handled in general.",
      "The promise also comes as the Defense Department faces a potential loss of personnel available to process sexual assault cases due to efforts by the Trump administration to trim staff across government.",
      "\"At the end of the day, the standard of proof remains the same with regard to any sexual harassment complaint,\" said Dr. Nathan Galbreath, director of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.",
      "\"To that end, all complaints are reviewed, the evidence is analyzed, and a legal officer often opines on whether or not action can be taken,\" Galbreath told reporters in a briefing call on tracking sexual assault cases in the military.",
      "Last week, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth called on service secretaries to review equal opportunity programs to ensure discrimination complaints weren't being \"weaponized\" by disgruntled employees.",
      "The military tracks sexual harassment complaints through its equal opportunity personnel.",
      "In his April 23 directive, Hegseth specifically called on secretaries to ensure discrimination \"complaints that are unsubstantiated by actionable, credible evidence are timely dismissed.\" He called it the \"no more walking on eggshells policy.\"",
      "\"Too often, at the Defense Department, there are complaints made that for certain reasons that can't be verified that end people's careers,\" Hegseth said in a video posted on X.",
      "\"Some individuals use these programs in bad faith to retaliate against superiors or peers. I hear that all the time,\" he said of employee discrimination complaints.",
      "Galbreath and other officials said Hegseth's directive won't impact how sexual assault reports or sexual harassment complaints are handled.",
      "Still, Hegseth\u2019s directive rattled advocates who say they are worried the secretary's orders would discourage people when thinking about coming forward with any misconduct, whether its sexual harassment or racial discrimination.",
      "\u201cThis new policy sends a stark and chilling message: report misconduct at your own risk,\u201d wrote Josh Connolly, senior vice president of Protect Our Defenders, an advocacy group aimed at ending sex assault in the military.",
      "When asked if Hegseth's latest mandate will raise the standard of proof for sexual assault victims, Galbreath said \"no.\"",
      "When it comes to sexual assault, unfounded reports are extraordinarily rare. According to the military, 1% of cases involve evidence that either exonerates the person accused or shows the crime did not occur.",
      "President Donald Trump also asked the Pentagon to review regulations that are potentially burdensome and streamline operations, an effort that resulted in offers to employees for early retirement as well as hiring freezes across the department.",
      "Galbreath and other officials told reporters Thursday that they aren't sure exactly how the military's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response program will be affected just yet when it comes to staff levels.",
      "When a recent hiring freeze went into effect, there were about 300 sexual assault prevention jobs put on hold, said Dr. Andra Tharp, director of the Defense Department's office of command climate and well-being integration.",
      "\"We're really trying to get our arms around total impacts of that,\" she said.",
      "Galbreath said he is encouraging the services to seek hiring exemptions for sexual assault response coordinators and victim advocates.",
      "He said that 100% of victim services remain available now and that sexual assault response coordinators and victim advocates are stationed at every military installation around the world.",
      "The number of sexual assaults reported across the military fell by nearly 4% last year, according to data released by the department.",
      "The report is the first full-year account since the Pentagon put in place new prosecution procedures that empower independent lawyers, rather than military commanders. The changes were called for by lawmakers who said not enough was being done to encourage personnel to report assault.",
      "\"Even though we'd like to see the number of reports increase, I'm still very satisfied that our military members know that they can come forward,\" and \"get the help that they need to recover,\" said Galbreath.",
      "Editor's note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly attributed a quote. The updated version correctly attributes to Dr. Nathan Galbreath the quote on encouraging the services to seek hiring exemptions for sexual assault response coordinators and victim advocates.",

      "The parade will involve some 6,600 soldiers, tanks and infantry vehicles, helicopter flyovers and parachute jumps, according to several people familiar with the planning effort, and will also occur on President Donald Trump's 79th birthday.",
      "\"The Army is celebrating its 250th Birthday with multiple events leading up to June 14,\" the Army said in a statement Friday evening. \"The national level celebration will include a spectacular fireworks display, a parade, and a day-long festival on the National Mall in Washington, DC. The festival will feature displays of Army equipment, military demonstrations, musical performances, and a fitness competition.",
      "\"Given the significant milestone of 250 years, the Army is exploring options to make the celebration even bigger, with more capability demonstrations, additional displays of equipment, and more engagement with the community,\" it added. \"Parade planning is actively underway, and we anticipate approximately 150 vehicles, 50 aircraft, and 6,600 Soldiers to highlight the Army\u2019s 250 years of service to the nation.\"",
      "Officials said earlier Friday that the parade had been a possible add-on but had cautioned that no final decisions had been made. The Associated Press first reported details involving the latest plans.",

      "The cost for this year's June 14 parade is unclear, officials said, but it will likely be steep. The event will require involvement from several federal agencies, including those requiring security. The Army plans to have soldiers from each of the its 10 divisions represented in the parade, according to a U.S. official.",
      "Earlier this year, city officials expressed concern that heavy vehicles such as tanks would tear up the roads and noted the city would require significant reimbursement to fix any damaged infrastructure.",

      "But not this year.",
      "DeSantis' second-to-last legislative session in Tallahassee has been defined by interparty squabbles that spilled out into the open, as the Legislature's GOP leaders sparred with each other and openly defied the term-limited governor.",
      "Over the 60-day regular session, members of DeSantis' own party launched an investigation into the signature initiative of his wife, first lady Casey DeSantis, accused a key ally of the governor of criminal conspiracy and advanced measures aimed at reining in his administration.",
      "Despite enjoying a GOP supermajority in both chambers, legislative leaders failed to pass the one bill Florida law requires, the state budget, ahead of the scheduled end of the regular session on Friday.

      "Republicans have a political trifecta in Tallahassee, with the sheer might to ram bills through over the protests of their Democratic colleagues. But this year, GOP leaders simply could not reconcile their different philosophies on tax policy in time to reach an agreement on the state budget.",
      "The House began negotiations with a $113 billion spending plan, compared to the Senate's $117.4 billion proposal and the governor's projected $115.6 billion budget. The main sticking point was how to cut taxes, with House Speaker Daniel Perez calling for a permanent .75% reduction in the state's sales tax, a proposal Senate President Ben Albritton had balked at.",
      "But after hours of prolonged negotiations Friday, legislative leaders announced a joint framework for a budget deal they say will come in lower than the governor's proposal and include $2.8 billion in tax relief.",
      "DeSantis meanwhile has pushed legislators to eliminate the state's property taxes, a change that would ultimately have to go before the voters.",
      "Overall, both chambers passed 205 bill and resolutions this session, out of more than 1,900 filed.",
      "Among the bills lawmakers approved are a measure creating new hurdles for citizen-driven ballot initiatives, reforms easing the financial burden on condominium owners grappling with new safety regulations following the Surfside condo collapse in 2021, a measure banning fluoride in public drinking water systems and a bill allowing additional execution methods to carry out the state\u2019s death penalty.",
      "Meanwhile, a number of the governor's priorities died this session, including bills that would have lowered the minimum age to buy a firearm and allowed gunowners to carry on college campuses. Other DeSantis-backed bills that failed include measures to roll back some of the state's child labor protections and require all employers in the state to use E-Verify, a federal government system to verify work eligibility.",
      "Lawmakers also advanced measures aimed at curbing the power of the governor, which he can sign, veto or allow to become law without his signature.",
      "Legislators could revive bills axed by the governor, if two-thirds of both chambers vote to override his veto. They took that step in January to overturn some of DeSantis' line-item vetoes of last year's budget, a move seen as a bold act of defiance.",
      "Among the bills that could spark DeSantis' ire is a measure that would restrict development in state parks, following bipartisan backlash over a DeSantis administration proposal to build golf courses, pickleball courts and hotels in state parks.",
      "Lawmakers also passed a measure that would outlaw the use of public funds for political ads on proposed constitutional amendments after DeSantis led an aggressive campaign against two ballot initiatives in November. Another measure would prohibit state employees from fundraising for political campaigns or candidates while on the job.",
      "Also this session, lawmakers in DeSantis\u2019 own party scrutinized the welfare program that is his wife's signature initiative.",

      "The sale, announced early Saturday, likely will be one of several heralded by Trump on his visit to the kingdom.

Project 2025, the conservative blueprint drawn up by the Heritage Foundation and co-authored by President Donald Trump\u2019s current budget chief, also called for cutting Head Start.",

The Trump administration is closing several regional offices and laying off the staff who support the program, which has led to funding delays that threatened to close individual preschools. A document accidentally emailed to grant recipients this week called for eliminating funding for research on Head Start and other child care programs. And before Trump took office, staffing shortages and rising costs had forced some programs to cut the number of students they served, or shutter altogether.",

It lists her home address, date of birth and an officer\u2019s two-sentence account of the arrest.",
      "Its distribution to federal authorities offers a glimpse into behind-the-scenes cooperation between the NYPD and the Trump administration, and raises questions about the city's compliance with sanctuary laws that prohibit police from assisting with immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "Kordia, 32, was among the earliest people jailed in President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on noncitizens who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.",
      "She was detained during a voluntary check-in with immigration officials in Newark, New Jersey, on March 13, then flown to an immigration jail in Texas. Her arrest was announced by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security the next day in a statement that cited an expired visa and her role in \u201cpro-Hamas protests.\u201d",
      "It remains unclear how immigration authorities were able to learn about Kordia's presence at the protest near Columbia last April. At the demonstration, police cited Kordia with disorderly conduct. But the charge was dismissed weeks later and the case sealed.",
      "City law generally prohibits police from sharing information about arrests with federal immigration officials, although there are exceptions for criminal investigations.",
      "On March 14, an NYPD officer generated a four-page report on Kordia and shared it with Homeland Security Investigations, a division of U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.",
      "In an emailed statement, an NYPD spokesperson said the department \u201creceived a request from a federal agency related to a criminal investigation and shared relevant information in accordance with our sanctuary city policies.\u201d",

      "Legal experts and civil liberties advocates said the document reflected a worrisome level of information-sharing between the city and the federal government, which has conflated criticism of Israel with support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group.",
      "\u201cThe intention of the sanctuary laws is to protect against this kind of collusion and pretextual information sharing,\u201d said Meghna Philip, the director of special litigation at the Legal Aid Society.",
      "\u201cIt seems to be a clear violation of the law,\u201d Philip added, \u201cand raises questions about what guardrails, if any, the NYPD has around sharing information with a federal government that is seeking to criminalize speech.\u201d",
      "Kordia grew up in Jerusalem and the West Bank, and moved to New Jersey in 2016 with her mother, an American citizen. She studied English at a local exchange program, but let her student visa expire because she believed her application for permanent residency was sufficient to remain in the country legally, according to her attorneys.",
      "Kordia\u2019s case stood out among those ensnared by Trump\u2019s crackdown. She was not an outspoken activist and had not publicly criticized Israel, either in social media posts or newspaper op-eds. She maintained no social media presence and did not appear on any of the public lists maintained by pro-Israel groups that seek to identify people who participate in pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Her name was not mentioned in news reports about the demonstrations.",
      "While the Trump administration identified her as a Columbia student, she has never been affiliated with the university and was not enrolled in any college when she joined a protest in 2024 outside Columbia. Her attorneys said she was peacefully voicing her dissent against Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza, which they said has killed over 100 of her relatives.",
      "A spokesperson for the NYPD declined to say when they were first approached by federal authorities or whether the March 14 report was the first time they had shared information about Kordia's arrest record.",
      "Beginning in early March, attorneys for Kordia say federal agents began interrogating members of her family and her neighbors. They also subpoenaed records from her MoneyGram account and \u201cestablished a trace on her WhatsApp messaging account,\u201d her attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "\u201cThe investigation revealed nothing except that Ms. Kordia sent a single payment to a Palestinian family member in 2022, which itself is protected First Amendment\" rights, the filing states.",
      "At an April 3rd hearing, the federal government pointed to Kordia\u2019s prior arrest for protesting as a reason she should not be released. An immigration judge found no evidence she had acted violently at the protest and agreed to grant Kordia a $20,000 bond, which her family paid.",
      "The government has appealed that decision, keeping her detained for now.",
      "In a petition seeking her release, attorneys for Kordia, a devout Muslim, said she had been denied halal meals since arriving at the jail. As a result, she has lost 49 pounds (22 kilograms) and fainted in the shower, according to facility records shared with her attorneys.",
      "\u201cThe government\u2019s entire argument that Ms. Kordia is a danger to the United States rests on a single summons for her participation in a demonstration,\u201d Arthur Ago, her attorney, said. \u201cThe only reason she\u2019s confined right now is because of her political viewpoint.\u201d",

      "Hawaii lawmakers have passed first-of-its-kind legislation that increases the state\u2019s lodging tax",
      "HONOLULU -- Hawaii lawmakers passed on Friday first-of-its-kind legislation that will increase the state\u2019s lodging tax to raise money for environmental protection and strengthening defenses against climate change -fueled natural disasters.",
      "Gov. Josh Green supports the bill, indicating he will sign it. The bill adds a 0.75% levy to the state\u2019s existing tax on hotel rooms, timeshares, vacation rentals and other short-term accommodations. It also imposes a new 11% tax on cruise ship bills, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports.",
      "Officials estimate the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually. They say the money will be used for projects like replenishing sand on eroding Waikiki beaches, promoting the use of hurricane clips to secure roofs during powerful storms and clearing flammable invasive grasses like those that fed the deadly wildfire that destroyed downtown Lahaina in 2023.",
      "The House and Senate, both controlled by large majorities of Democrats, both passed the measure by wide margins.",
      "Experts say this is the nation's first state lodging tax that raises money for the environment and coping with climate change.",
      "Hawaii already levies a 10.25% tax on short-term rentals. As of Jan. 1, the tax will rise to 11%. Hawaii's counties separately charge a 3% lodging tax, and travelers also have to pay the 4.712% general excise tax that applies to all virtually all goods and services. The cumulative tax bill at checkout will climb to 18.712%, among the highest in the nation.",
      "Green said people have told him the increase is small enough people won\u2019t notice. He observed many people come to Hawaii to enjoy the environment and predicted they will welcome committing dollars to protect shorelines and communities.",
      "\u201cThe more you cultivate good environmental policy, and the more you invest in perfecting our lived space, the more likely it is we\u2019re going to have actually lifelong, committed travelers to Hawaii,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "Only funds raised by the 0.75% addition and the new tax on cruise ship stays will go exclusively toward natural resources and climate change. Revenue from existing state lodging taxes would continue to flow into state's general fund and to help pay for the construction of Honolulu's rail line.",
      "Zane Edleman, a visitor from Chicago, said he could envision the extra cost prompting some travelers to head elsewhere else like Florida. But he said it would depend on how the state shares information about what it does with the money.",
      "\u201cIf you really focus on the point \u2014 this is to save the climate and actually have proof that this is where the funds are going, and that there\u2019s an actual result that\u2019s happening from that, I think people could buy into it,\u201d Edleman said.",
      "The first draft of the legislation called for a larger increase, but lawmakers pared it back.",
      "\u201cWe heard the concerns about how do we make sure that we are able to sustain our industry as well as find new resources to address the needs for environmental sustainability,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Linda Ichiyama, vice speaker of the House. \u201cSo it was a balance.\u201d",
      "John Pele, the executive director of the Maui Hotel and Lodging Association, said there\u2019s broad agreement that the money raised will go to a good cause. But he wonders if Hawaii will become too expensive for visitors.",
      "\u201cWill we be taxing on tourists out of wanting to come here?\u201d he said. \u201cThat remains to be seen.\u201d",

      "The Army has confirmed there will be a military parade on President Donald Trump\u2019s birthday in June, as part of the celebration around the service\u2019s 250th birthday",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Army on Friday confirmed there will be a military parade on President Donald Trump\u2019s birthday in June, as part of the celebrations around the service\u2019s 250th birthday.",
      "Plans for the parade, as first detailed by The Associated Press on Thursday, call for about 6,600 soldiers, 150 vehicles and 50 helicopters to follow a route from Arlington, Virginia, to the National Mall. Until recently, the Army\u2019s birthday festival plans did not include a massive parade, which officials say will cost tens of millions of dollars.",
      "But Trump has long wanted a military parade, and discussions with the Pentagon about having one in conjunction with the birthday festival began less than two months ago.",
      "The Army 250th birthday happens to coincide with Trump\u2019s 79th birthday on June 14. In a statement Friday, Army spokesman Steve Warren said the Army\u2019s birthday celebration will include \u201ca spectacular fireworks display, a parade, and a daylong festival on the National Mall.\u201d",
      "The pricey parade comes as Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency, run by Elon Musk, have slashed federal government departments, personnel and programs, with thousands of workers losing their jobs, including civilians in the Defense Department.",
      "In comments to Fox News Digital, White House officials confirmed a commemorative parade would take place and said it would be one of the first events to kick off a yearlong celebration of the nation\u2019s 250th anniversary.",
      "When asked about the parade Thursday, the White House did not respond, and Army officials said no decision had been made. While officials said there has now been a formal decision to proceed with the parade, there is still no specific cost estimate.",
      "Warren said that given the significance of the Army birthday, they are looking at options \u201cto make the celebration even bigger, with more capability demonstrations, additional displays of equipment, and more engagement with the community.\u201d",
      "Army planning documents, obtained this week by the AP and dated April 29 and 30, said the parade will include soldiers from at least 11 corps and divisions nationwide. They said it would involve a Stryker battalion with two companies of Stryker vehicles, a tank battalion and two companies of tanks, an infantry battalion with Bradley vehicles, Paladin artillery vehicles, Howitzers and infantry vehicles.",
      "The plans note that while the parade will begin near the Pentagon, the heavy, tracked vehicles \u2014 which would include the Strykers \u2014 would be stationed near the Lincoln Memorial and join the procession there, so they will not go over the bridge from Virginia",
      "City officials, including D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, acknowledged in April that the administration reached out to the city about holding a parade on June 14. At the time, she said that tanks rolling through the city\u2019s streets \u201cwould not be good.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf military tanks were used, they should be accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads,\u201d she said.",
      "The Army birthday festival has been planned for more than a year and is slated to include displays of Army equipment, military demonstrations, musical performances and a fitness competition on the National Mall.",
      "The late afternoon parade would be followed by a parachute jump by the Golden Knights, a concert and the fireworks. The planning documents also suggest that civilian participants would include historical vehicles and aircraft and two bands, along with people from veterans groups, military colleges and reenactor organizations.",
      "According to the plans, the parade would be classified as a national special security event, and that request has been submitted by the National Park Service and is under review.",
      "During his first term, Trump proposed having a parade after seeing one in France on Bastille Day in 2017. Trump said that after watching the two-hour procession along the famed Champs-Elysees he wanted an even grander one on Pennsylvania Avenue.",
      "That plan was ultimately dumped due to the huge costs \u2014 with one estimate of a $92 million price tag \u2014 and other logistical issues. Among those were objections from city officials who said including tanks and other heavy armored vehicles would tear up the roads.",
      "Trump said in a social media post in 2018 that he was canceling the event over the costs and accused local politicians of price gouging.",

      "A Nashville high school student who fatally shot a classmate before killing himself in January was on probation after threatening a student with a box cutter three months earlier",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A Nashville high school student who fatally shot a classmate before killing himself in January was on probation after threatening a student with a box cutter months earlier, according to juvenile court files obtained through an open records request.",
      "Solomon Henderson, who was 17 at the time, was charged with carrying a weapon on school property with intent and reckless endangerment with a weapon after a confrontation on Oct. 24, 2024.",
      "The victim said she was walking to lunch with a group when she said \u201chey\u201d to Solomon. When he did not respond, she said \u201chey\u201d again. Solomon, who is Black, then turned around and told her to get away, using an expletive, and called her the N-word, the victim told police. He pulled a box cutter out of his pocket and exposed the blade before walking to a table in the cafeteria and sitting down.",
      "When an administrator confronted Solomon, \u201che became upset saying stuff like I'll cut anyone that walks up on him,\u201d according to the court filings. He also said he believed that the victim and her friends were going to jump him. As part of his probation, he was not allowed to possess guns.",
      "Solomon's juvenile record also includes charges from November 2023, when he was 16 years old, for downloading and distributing sexual images of minors. The record does not give any indication of the ages of the minors in the images. In that case, he was released to his parents with strict conditions including no use of social media, a cellphone, the internet, or a computer, with the exception of school work.",
      "Juvenile court records have been unavailable to the public in Tennessee until recently. Citing the Antioch High School shooting and a desire to know more about the shooter's history, Tennessee lawmakers this year passed a bill that allows someone\u2019s juvenile court records to be made public if the person committed a homicide on school grounds and has died.",
      "The records released to The Associated Press on Friday show that Solomon was given judicial diversion after his arrest for brandishing the box cutter. Court documents from the day after the incident indicated he was to have no contact with the victim and that his mother was planning to homeschool him.",
      "It is unclear exactly when he returned to Antioch High School, but on Jan. 22, Solomon shot and killed Josselin Corea Escalante, who was 16 and Hispanic, in the school\u2019s cafeteria before turning the gun on himself. Another student who was grazed by a bullet was treated and released from the hospital the same day.",
      "Police said Henderson fired 10 shots from a 9 mm pistol within 17 seconds of entering the cafeteria. The pistol was loaded with nine rounds when recovered by police. The gun was bought by someone in Arizona in 2022, and it was not reported stolen, police said. The gun\u2019s origins are still under investigation.",
      "Although the name of the victim in the box-cutter incident is redacted from the juvenile records, police have previously said they could not establish a connection between Solomon and the victims in the shooting. They have said the gunfire may have been random.",
      "Not long after the shooting, anti-hate analysts quickly identified dozens of pages believed to have come from Henderson, filled with calls for violence and racist comments, including neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideologies, expressions of shame that he was Black and praise for specific people who carried out well-known shootings. The writings also include plans for the school shooting, but they do not name Escalante as a target.",
      "Police and the FBI have been investigating two documents totaling more than 300 pages combined that they believe Henderson created.",
      "\u201cIt is clear that Henderson was significantly influenced by web-based material,\u201d especially on \u201cnon-traditional sites that most would find harmful and objectionable,\" police said.",

      "A federal judge has blocked a White House executive order targeting an elite law firm, dealing a setback to President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign of retribution against the legal profession",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Friday permanently blocked a White House executive order targeting an elite law firm, dealing a setback to President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign of retribution against the legal profession.",
      "U.S. District Beryl Howell said the executive order against the firm of Perkins Coie amounted to \u201cunconstitutional retaliation\u201d as she ordered that it be nullified and that the Trump administration halt any enforcement of it.",
      "\u201cNo American President,\" Howell wrote in her 102-page order, \"has ever before issued executive orders like the one at issue in this lawsuit targeting a prominent law firm with adverse actions to be executed by all Executive branch agencies but, in purpose and effect, this action draws from a playbook as old as Shakespeare, who penned the phrase: \u2018The first thing we do, let\u2019s kill all the lawyers.\u2019\u201d",
      "The ruling was most definitive rejection to date of Trump's spate of similarly worded executive orders against some of the country's most elite law firms, part of a broader effort by the president to reshape American civil society by targeting perceived adversaries in hopes of extracting concessions from them and bending them to his will. Several of the firms singled out for sanction have either done legal work that Trump has opposed, or currently have or previously had associations with prosecutors who at one point investigated the president.",
      "The edicts have ordered that the security clearances of attorneys at the targeted firms be suspended, that federal contracts be terminated and that their employees be barred from federal buildings. The punished law firms have called the executive orders an affront to the legal system and at odds with the foundational principle that lawyers should be free to represent whomever they'd like without fear of government reprisal.",
      "In the case of Perkins Coie, the White House cited its representation of Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign during the 2016 presidential race. Trump has also railed against one of the firm's former lawyers, Marc Elias, who engaged the services of an opposition research firm that in turn hired a former British spy who produced files of research examining potential ties between Trump and Russia. Elias left the firm 2021.",
      "In her opinion, Howell wrote that Perkins Coie was targeted because the firm \u201cexpressed support for employment policies the President does not like, represented clients the President does not like, represented clients seeking litigation results the President does not like, and represented clients challenging some of the President\u2019s actions, which he also does not like.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat,\u201d she wrote, \u201cis unconstitutional retaliation and viewpoint discrimination, plain and simple.\u201d",
      "The decision was not surprising given that Howell had earlier temporarily blocked multiple provisions of the order and had expressed deep misgivings about the edict at a more recent hearing, when she grilled a Justice Department lawyer who was tasked with justifying it. Her ruling Friday permanently bars enforcement of the executive order. She also directed Attorney General Pam Bondi and Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, to provide copies of her opinion to all government departments and agencies that had previously received the executive order.",
      "The other law firms that have challenged orders against them \u2014WilmerHale, Jenner & Block and Susman Godfrey \u2014 have succeeded in at least temporarily blocking the orders. '",
      "But other major firms have sought to avert orders by preemptively reaching settlements that require them, among other things, to collectively dedicate hundreds of millions of dollars in free legal services in support of causes the Trump administration says it supports.",

      "The company said the idling of two Pennsylvania plants, one in Steelton and one in Conshohocken, and one in Riverdale, Illinois, is due to \u201cinsufficient demand and pricing\u201d and nothing to do with President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "\u201cThese temporary, indefinite idles are a necessary response to insufficient demand and pricing for the products the affected facilities produce, including rail, specialty plate, and high-carbon sheet; all of which fall outside of Cliffs\u2019 core business focus,\u201d the company said.",
      "The idlings will be indefinite, and start around June 30, at the end of a 60-day notice period required by federal law. About 950 workers will be out of work during the shutdowns, Cleveland Cliffs said.",
      "It said its flat-rolled steel production levels will not be affected.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday announced a broad reorganization as part of the Trump administration's drive to cut costs that some activists worry will harm the agency's independent scientific research.",
      "Administrator Lee Zeldin announced changes that included creating a new unit within his office \u201cto align research and put science at the forefront of the agency's rulemakings.\u201d He said the overall reorganization would boost efficiency and save at least $300 million annually, though he didn't detail how the money would be saved.",
      "Though Zeldin didn't mention it by name, some scientists and activists saw it as an attack on EPA's Office of Research and Development, which has long provided the scientific underpinnings for EPA\u2019s mission to protect the environment and human health. The agency said it would shift \u201cits scientific expertise and research efforts to program offices\u201d that focus on major issues like air and water.",
      "Separately on Friday, President Donald Trump unveiled a proposed budget to cut that office's funding by $235 million.",
      "Trump's budget said the cut would put \"an end to unrestrained research grants, radical environmental justice work, woke climate research, and skewed, overly-precautionary modeling that influences regulations \u2014 none of which are authorized by law.\u201d",
      "Agency researchers have improved air pollution monitoring, found high levels of PFAS in drinking water sources, provided flood prevention resources and made more information available on chemical safety.",
      "EPA's possible plans to lay off as many as 1,155 staffers in the office \u2014 as much as three-fourths of its workers \u2014 became public in March. Those cuts are part of a broader push by Zeldin to cut EPA's budget by about two-thirds.",
      "The Office of Research and Development has 10 facilities across the country. It was designed to be insulated from politics so it can produce essential science.",
      "Camden Weber, climate and energy policy specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity, said, \u201cis a textbook move from the authoritarian playbook.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy gutting key institutions and driving away experts, this attack will endanger public health, clean air, and environmental progress, while undermining independent scientific research in America,\u201d Weber said.",
      "\u201cThis is a reorganization, not a reduction in force,\u201d EPA spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said.",
      "Zeldin's announcement also included the creation of the Office of State Air Partnerships to work \u201cwith, not against\u201d states and other agencies to handle plans for pollution reduction by states. The EPA has long had authority to impose its own plan if states were seen as not doing enough to cut pollution.",
      "The EPA said that change would make sure states get consistent treatment no matter their geography.",
      "\u201cThe problem is that some areas of the country have much worse air pollution, and it cannot be treated as a one-size-fits-all,\u201d said Kyla Bennett, director of science policy at the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a union for public employees focused on environmental ethics.",
      "The new office for scientific review will be called the Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions. EPA said it would \u201cgain more than 130\u201d experts in science and other fields to to complete long-delayed reviews of hundreds of chemicals and thousands of pesticides.",

      "A former Massachusetts state police sergeant has been found guilty of taking part in a scheme to take bribes in exchange for giving passing scores on commercial driving tests",
      "BOSTON -- A former Massachusetts state police sergeant was found guilty Friday of taking part in a scheme to take bribes, including a new snowblower and a driveway, in exchange for giving passing scores on commercial driving tests.",
      "Gary Cederquist, 59, of Stoughton, was convicted of nearly 50 charges, including two counts of conspiracy to commit extortion, one count of extortion and six counts of honest services mail fraud.",
      "Cederquist was one of three troopers along with two civilians accused of falsifying records and giving preferential treatment to at least 17 drivers from May 2019 to January 2023, who were taking their commercial driver's license test",
      "Even when the drivers failed a skills test, the troopers passed them and communicated they had done so with a text and the code word golden. Some troopers even joked in the text messages how badly a driver had performed on the test, according to the indictment.",
      "Four of the five have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing.",
      "\u201cIt is never a good day when a member of law enforcement is convicted of a crime, especially when it is a crime that compromises public safety,\" U.S. Attorney Leah Foley said.",
      "\u201cGary Cederquist chose bribery and extortion over his oath to protect the community which he was sworn to serve,\u201d she said. \u201cHis greed put the public at risk when he devised a scheme to issue commercial driver\u2019s licenses to applicants who had never taken a real test to operate heavy commercial vehicles on the roads and highways of Massachusetts.\u201d",
      "Elise Chawaga, principal assistant inspector general for investigations with the Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General, said the verdict \u201csends a strong message to those who may be motivated by greed to abuse their positions \u2014 they will be met with the full force of the criminal justice system.\u201d",
      "A lawyer for Cederquist did not return a call seeking comment.",
      "The bribery scandal is the latest trouble to hit the Massachusetts State Police.",
      "Forty-six current and retired troopers who worked for the now disbanded Troop E, which patrolled the Massachusetts Turnpike, were implicated in a scheme in which they collected overtime pay for shifts they either did not work or did not complete from 2015 until 2017, authorities said. Often, they said, the troopers issued falsified traffic tickets to make it appear as if they had been on duty.",
      "The bribery scandal also raised concerns about the integrity of a licensing system set up to certify commercial drivers because a majority of those taking the test in Massachusetts fail. The latest data from 2022, federal officials said, showed a pass rate of 41%.",
      "In 2019, the system came under fire after Volodymyr Zhukovskyy, a commercial truck driver, crashed into a group of motorcyclists in northern New Hampshire, causing the death of seven motorcyclists.",
      "Zhukovskyy\u2019s commercial driving license should have been revoked in Massachusetts at the time of the crash because of a drunken driving arrest in Connecticut about two months earlier. Connecticut officials alerted the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles, but Zhukovskyy\u2019s license wasn\u2019t suspended because of a backlog of out-of-state notifications about driving offenses.",
      "In recent years, state police have made a number of reforms to the commercial driver's license unit, including requiring body cameras be worn during exams, increasing the frequency of unannounced visits to the unit by supervisors, having examiners at training sites, as well as developing new training procedures and a curriculum.",

    "story": [
      "Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin is trimming Virginia\u2019s budget by $900 million through line-item vetoes based on tax-revenue projections for next year that spur economic uncertainty in the state",
      "RICHMOND, Va. -- Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin said on Friday that he would trim Virginia's budget by $900 million in light of next year's tax revenue projections, which could decrease as the White House's reshaping of federal spending spurs economic uncertainty in the state.",
      "At a news conference, Youngkin announced he had signed the bipartisan budget bill adopted in February by the Virginia General Assembly but vetoed 37 line items, winnowing state spending to create a rainy day cushion.",
      "Youngkin said that while he still supported President Donald Trump\u2019s culling of federal spending and dramatic reshaping of global trade through tariffs, he also acknowledged that the changes could hurt Virginia in the short term.",
      "\u201cThe President\u2019s actions to reset fiscal spending and reset unbalanced trade relationships are expected to have some impact in the near term on not only the Virginia workforce, but also the revenues that we collect,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, this ($900 million trim) is prudent, sound budgeting, putting the Commonwealth in a strong, dynamic position.\u201d",
      "The cuts mainly sever funds allotted for 10 capital projects for higher education institutions, Youngkin said, adding that he also cut funding for long-term investment projects that could be funded under existing appropriations.",
      "The budget vetoes also scrap funds for a public-private partnership for child care, Youngkin said. The governor described the amendment as an innovative idea but \u201cnot ready for prime time yet.\u201d He said he hoped the legislature would take up the amendment again next year.",
      "Youngkin's announcement comes after he proposed in late March more than 200 amendments to the Virginia House budget bill that would have cut the proposed state spending provisions by $300 million.",
      "Youngkin\u2019s edits, however, were largely ignored by Democrats who have majorities in both chambers. After they returned to Richmond for a one-day session, lawmakers accepted about 30 of Youngkin\u2019s proposed budget revisions and scrapped the remaining amendments.",
      "According to Virginia law, Youngkin can outright veto the budget or line-item veto parts of the legislation after lawmakers reconvene, though his ability to scrupulously edit the text becomes limited. In light of this constraint, Youngkin opted to veto capital projects and ultimately sliced the state's spending plan by triple the amount he had initially proposed.",
      "\u201cThe line-item veto authority for a governor, unfortunately, is a blunt instrument,\u201d Youngkin said, adding: \u201cOftentimes, when you use a line-item veto in the context of a budget, it takes away lots of other things, and it has unintended consequences.\u201d",
      "House of Delegates Minority Leader Todd Gilbert said in a statement that he wished Democrats had cooperated with Youngkin's $300 million worth of cuts, but he was ultimately pleased with the governor's actions Friday.",
      "\u201cThanks to the Governor\u2019s conservative leadership, Virginia is better positioned to weather what comes next,\u201d Gilbert said in a statement. \u201cI encourage my Democratic colleagues to join us in putting the Commonwealth\u2019s fiscal health ahead of political games.\u201d",
      "Democrat Luke Torian, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said: \u201cWhile today\u2019s budget signed by Governor Youngkin does not include every priority we fought for, it reflects the determined efforts of House and Senate Democrats to deliver meaningful progress for Virginians.\u201d",
      "The budget bill is one of 91 remaining bills that Youngkin said he has until the end of the day Friday to either sign, veto or allow to become law without his action. Those bills landed on his desk after lawmakers rejected his amendments to the legislation in April.",
      "\u201cThere are bills that I have vetoed before that we\u2019re vetoing again,\u201d Youngkin said on the remaining legislation he is taking up. \"There are a lot of bills that I think are very interesting, that I hadn\u2019t seen before, and that we tried to make a little better. Didn\u2019t get the amendments passed, but I\u2019m still going to sign them.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has reached a preliminary agreement to settle a wrongful death lawsuit brought by the family of Ashli Babbitt over her shooting by an officer during the U.S. Capitol riot, attorneys said on Friday.",
      "Lawyers for Babbitt's estate and the Justice Department told a judge in Washington's federal court that they have reached a settlement in principle, but the details are still being worked out and the final agreement has not yet been signed. The terms of the settlement have not been disclosed.",
      "Babbitt's estate filed the $30 million lawsuit last year over her fatal shooting when she attempted to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker\u2019s Lobby inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "The Capitol Police officer who shot her was cleared of wrongdoing, by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia, which concluded that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The Capitol Police also cleared the officer.",
      "Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran from San Diego, was unarmed when she was shot by the police lieutenant when she tried to climb through the door as others in the mob pressed to get into the lobby outside the House chamber.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that the officer, who was not in uniform, failed to de-escalate the situation and did not give her any warnings or commands before opening fire. It also alleges negligence on the part of Capitol Police. The lawsuit says the department \u201cshould have known\u201d that the officer was \u201cprone to behave in a dangerous or otherwise incompetent manner.\u201d",
      "\u201cAshli posed no threat to the safety of anyone,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "The Capitol Police officer said in a televised interview that he fired as a \u201clast resort.\u201d When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.",
      "Capitol Police officials and an attorney for Babbitt's estate didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment on Friday.",
      "President Donald Trump in January pardoned, commuted the prison sentences or ordered the dismissal of all of the cases of the 1,500-plus people charged with crimes in the riot.",

      "Reginald, a 7-year-old Great Dane from Idaho, and Pearl, a chihuahua from Florida, are both certified winners in their respective height titles by Guinness World Records. The fact that Reginald is the size of a small horse and Pearl is as small as an apple didn\u2019t stop them from getting along famously.",
      "Pearl, a 4-year-old who stands at 3.59 inches (9.14 centimeters), comes from a long line of short dogs. Her aunt Millie, a previous record-holder in the same category, until she died in 2020, also was under 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) tall.",

      "Pearl\u2019s tiny size was also strange for the big boy.",

      "Reggie\u2019s super size was evident early on, especially on a dog park visit when he towered over other Great Danes despite being only 9 months old.",
      "\u201cThey would be shorter than him, and they were like full-grown,\" Reiss said.",
      "There might have been a little jealousy shown over toys and beds, but Reggie and Pearl found common ground during their two days roaming the Idaho farm together.",
      "\u201cI think she found a good friend,\u201d Semler said.",

      "As the federal government rolls back fishing restrictions in the Pacific Remote Islands, California is reviewing its network of marine protected areas",
      "CHANNEL ISLANDS, Calif. -- Strands of kelp glow in the dim morning light off California\u2019s Channel Islands as fish and sea lions weave through the golden fronds. It\u2019s a scene of remarkable abundance \u2014 the result of more than two decades of protection in one of the state\u2019s oldest marine reserves.",
      "But farther out in the Pacific, life in the vast Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument faces a very different future. The Trump administration has moved to reopen 500,000 square miles (about 1.3 million square kilometers) of previously protected waters there to commercial fishing, in a dramatic rollback of federal ocean protections.",
      "California, meanwhile, may be headed in the opposite direction. As it undertakes its first 10-year review of its marine protected area network, state officials, scientists, tribal leaders and environmental advocates are pushing not just to maintain protections but to expand them.",
      "\u201cThese areas are like our underwater Yellowstone,\u201d said Douglas McCauley, director of the Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory at the University of California, Santa Barbara, speaking aboard a dive boat heading to the Channel Islands. \u201cIt\u2019s important to protect that biological heritage, but it also creates an extremely lucrative tourism industry. People want to go see all that nature and wildlife in action.\u201d",
      "The state's marine protected areas have become magnets for scuba divers and snorkelers drawn by their rich life. Over time, these reserves allow fish populations to rebound and spill over into nearby waters \u2013 a long-term investment with large returns for fishermen, as McCauley sees it.",
      "Launched in 2003, the network now spans 124 distinct sections along the coast. Some areas are \u201cno-take\u201d zones where all fishing is prohibited, while others allow limited use. The network covers roughly 16% of state waters, with proposed expansions that would add 2%. The goal, under the 1999 Marine Life Protection Act, was to create a science-based system to rebuild ecosystems after decades of overfishing and habitat loss.",
      "The Channel Islands were among the first sites established. About 20% of the waters surrounding the eight-island chain are now fully protected.",
      "But expansion proposals have sparked debate among fishermen.",
      "Blake Hermann, a fourth-generation commercial fisherman from Ventura County, grew up fishing around the Channel Islands, where he harpoons swordfish by hand. He supports keeping much of the marine protected network intact, but he argues that some closures go too far and has petitioned the state to allow limited fishing in three no-take zones around the islands.",
      "Protected areas can help nearshore species like sea bass and lobster recover, Hermann said, but offer little benefit to wide-ranging ocean-goers like swordfish and tuna that may pass only briefly through a protected zone during migration.",
      "He questions whether it makes sense to restrict selective, low-impact fishing methods in places where these migratory species are only temporary visitors and will likely be caught when they move into unrestricted waters.",
      "\u201cThese islands are the best thing on the planet,\u201d Hermann said. \u201cWe can still protect what makes sense to protect in the right areas, but you can also still give some access back too.\u201d",
      "Others warn that reopening any part of the protected network could set a troubling precedent, especially as climate change disrupts ocean ecosystems.",
      "\u201cWhen we protect the oceans, we\u2019re really protecting ourselves,\u201d said Sandy Aylesworth, director of the Pacific Initiative for the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cIf the additional 2% is added, it will better prepare California\u2019s ocean for future stressors like climate change and new industrial uses of the ocean. So I see it as being a real benefit to all of the ocean users in California \u2014 including recreational and commercial fishermen.\u201d",
      "Final decisions from the review are expected early next year.",
      "\u201cMarine protected areas are probably the most controversial thing that we work on, because you\u2019re essentially telling a group of individuals that they can\u2019t do what they\u2019ve historically done in an area,\u201d said Craig Shuman, marine region manager at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "Shuman said the fishing community has become particularly vocal in response to petitions to expand the MPA network. Many aren\u2019t asking for more access, he said, just for existing opportunities not to be taken away.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re asking, \u2018If you take all the places we can fish, where do we go?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the challenge: how to find the right balance between protection and access, especially in a state like California where we already have very strong fisheries management laws.\u201d",
      "Overall, he said, the data shows the network is working. \u201cIt\u2019s not consistent \u2014 each MPA is a little bit different \u2014 but more often than not, we\u2019re seeing the MPAs are working to achieve the goals of the Act.\u201d",
      "The president's executive order lifted fishing restrictions in waters between 50 and 200 nautical miles around a remote Pacific island chain \u2014 areas first protected by President George W. Bush in 2009 and expanded by President Barack Obama in 2014. Supporters said doing so would boost commercial fishing interests in Hawaii and American Samoa. Conservationists fear the impacts from fishing in an area that's home to coral reefs, sea turtles, whales and thousands of other species.",
      "\u201cIt makes it even more critical here at the state level that there is this expansion of protections to really balance out some of those rollbacks,\u201d said Molly Morse, senior manager at the Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory.",
      "Back on the boat, still within the protected waters off Anacapa Island, a shimmering school of sardines and anchovies draws a frenzy of seabirds and dolphins. Humpback whales surge from the depths, mouths agape, swallowing fish by the gallon. Along the border of the protected area, a sport fishing boat drops its lines as a container ship rumbles past in the distance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got the largest port in the United States. We\u2019ve got offshore oil and gas. We\u2019ve got fishing boats coming and going,\u201d McCauley said. \u201cBut still, in the middle of all that, we still have this wildness \u2014 a place where all the stakeholders who want value out of the ocean can find it.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Temu has said it will stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform.",
      "The online marketplace said sales would now be handled by \"locally based sellers\", with orders fulfilled from within the country.",
      "The move comes as a duty-free rule for low-value packages is closed.",
      "Temu, and rival Chinese retail giant Shein, had previously relied on the so-called \"de minimis\" exemption to sell and ship low-value items directly to the US without having to pay duties or import taxes.",
      "Temu said it had been actively recruiting US firms to join the platform.",
      "\"All sales in the US are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country.",

      "But both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, said it damaged American businesses and was used to smuggle illegal goods, including drugs.",
      "What was the de minimis exemption?",
      "De minimis is a Latin term, which loosely translates to English as \"of the smallest\".",
      "In this context it refers to a US trade rule enacted by Congress in 1938 to avoid the expense of collecting only small amounts of import levies.",
      "In the 21st Century, after a series of rises to the threshold, it allowed retailers to ship packages worth less than $800 to US customers without having to pay duties or taxes.",
      "Shipments under the exemption accounted for more than 90% of all the cargo entering the US, according to the country's Customs and Border Patrol (CBP).",
      "Chinese online retailers like Shein and Temu had benefited greatly from the loophole.",
      "Both platforms attracted millions of US customers with marketing blitzes that showcased their ultra-low prices",
      "And it was the de minimis exemption that helped them offer those deals so cheaply.",
      "Shein did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment.",
      "Last month, in almost identical statements, Shein and Temu said they had seen operating expenses rise \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\", adding they would make \"price adjustments\" from 25 April.",
      "Why has Trump closed the loophole?",
      "In February, Trump briefly closed the loophole.",
      "The suspension was quickly paused as customs inspectors, delivery firms and online retailers struggled to adapt to such a major change at short notice.",
      "During the initial suspension of the exemption the US Postal Service temporarily stopped accepting parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong.",
      "The executive order announcing the latest move said it was aimed at tackling the illegal importation of synthetic opioids like fentanyl.",
      "It said many Chinese shippers use deceptive practices to hide illicit substances in low-value packages \"to exploit the de minimis exemption\".",

      "\"The growing volume of de minimis shipments makes it increasingly difficult to target and block illegal or unsafe shipments,\" it said.",
      "The move is in line with Trump's policies of cracking down on goods from China.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on Chinese imports. His administration said in April that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.",
      "US authorities have also blamed the success of firms like Temu and Shein for putting strains on border authorities, as the number of packages entering the US under the loophole surged from about 140 million a decade ago to more than one billion last year.",
      "What does it mean for online shoppers?",
      "Packages sent to the US from mainland China and Hong Kong with a value of up to $800 now face a 120% tax rate or are subject to a flat fee. The fee started at $100 and is due to rise to $200 at the beginning of June.",
      "Even before these packages were subject to import taxes, US consumers were warned of potential price rises.",
      "The American Action Forum, a right-leaning policy group, estimated last year that getting rid of the exemption would result in \"$8bn to $30bn in additional annual costs that would eventually be passed on to consumers\".",
      "Chinese online retailers have also benefited from similar rules in the UK and the European Union.",
      "In a move mirroring the US action, the UK has announced a review of low-value imports coming into the country.",
      "In the UK, the current rule allows international retailers to send packages to the UK worth less than \u00a3135 without incurring import taxes.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the cheap goods are \"undercutting the British High Street and British retailers\".",
      "The European Union has also proposed plans to scrap duty-free exemptions for parcels worth less than \u20ac150 (\u00a3127.50; $169.35).",
      "Which means consumers in the UK and EU could soon also see prices rising.",
      "Will US border checks change?",
      "Packages that arrived in the US under the exemption were inspected in the same way as other goods, including being checked for illegal substances. And most synthetic opioids are brought into the country through the border with Mexico, according to officials.",
      "Some experts think ending the exemption will do little to curb illegal drugs and not address the challenges faced by US manufacturers.",
      "There are also concerns the move will create more work for US border officials, who are already stretched as they try to stop drug smuggling.",
      "According to pro-open trading association the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC), removing the de minimis exemption would \"shift the CBP's focus away from the border, where a vast majority of illegal substances and products are entering the country.\"",

      "Few know that Mr Brown is the brains behind Wally's Weather - a Facebook page with 107,000 followers and 24 million monthly views, focusing on weather across the tropical state of Queensland.",
      "During the record-breaking flooding, when 400 people were forced to evacuate their homes, Mr Brown published round the clock posts, even waking in the night to share updates, out of a sense of duty and responsibility to his audience.",
      "He even left work early when he spotted on his weather radar that five hours of non-stop rain would be approaching, advising not just his Facebook followers, but his bosses, colleagues, wife and adult children to do the same.",
      "\"When there's a big weather event, you try and give people as much notice as possible.\"",
      "He is based in Townsville, the regional centre of an area known for a rain-drenched, hot, humid wet season from January to March.",
      "\"People want to know what's going on, because even if they lose power, they've probably still got an internet connection. These systems are notorious for happening at night time when you can't see what's going on, so you do feel like their eyes and ears,\" says Mr Brown.",
      "Mr Brown's active, highly engaged Facebook audience is indicative of how more members of the public are turning to social media for news and weather updates - in the US, it's how 20% of adults get this information, according to Pew Research Centre.",
      "People pay as much attention to influencers on Facebook as they do journalists and the mainstream media, and actually pay more attention to them than their mainstream counterparts on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, according to a study by the Reuters Institute and University of Oxford.",
      "Prof Daniel Angus is director of the Digital Media Research Centre at Queensland University of Technology.",
      "When Brisbane-based Prof Angus found himself caught up in the heavy rain and flooding brought on by Tropical Cyclone Alfred also in February, he preferred to follow official advice from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, as he believes they still provide the most accurate forecasts and warnings.",
      "Prof Angus recognises the rising popularity of weather influencers like Mr Brown's Wally's Weather as stemming from not just a broader trend of public mistrust towards mainstream media and government sources, but about filling gaps in coverage and relatability.",
      "\"Weather influencers have gained popularity, particularly in rural and regional areas, because they provide highly localised, real-time updates that mainstream media can often overlook,\" says Prof Angus.",
      "\"They engage directly with their audience, offering personalised analysis and responding to community concerns in a way that traditional news outlets typically don't.",
      "\"Their credibility has grown because they are seen as passionate, knowledgeable, and often deeply embedded in the communities they report on.\"",
      "Yet the issue with weather influencers, Prof Angus notes, is their tendency to scaremonger, as social media weather forecaster Higgins Storm Chasing, also based in Townsville, has been criticised for.",
      "In 2018, it was criticised for predicting historic levels of rainfall and flooding to its one million Facebook followers, which didn't materialise.",

      "\"What we have to understand is that they are part of an attention economy. The more eyes they have, the more engagement they see on their metrics. The bureau and governments are very reserved in putting out alerts and evacuation orders, because it only takes a few non-events for people to lose their trust in them,\" says Professor Angus.",
      "\"They have to answer for that, whereas for Higgins or any of the others, there's ultimately zero accountability if they completely mess it up. \"",
      "It's a view shared by Alan Sealls, a former TV weatherman who now teaches meteorology at the University of South Alabama, and consults as a forensic meteorologist, providing weather analysis for legal cases.",
      "Prof Sealls is also now the president elect of the American Meteorological Society (AMS), which welcomes both professionally-trained meteorologists and weather influencers as members, so doesn't have an official position on the topic.",
      "But Prof Sealls' personal view is that trained meteorologists with an online platform add value, while those without formal training stand to discredit the profession.",
      "\"There are those who are not formally-trained and take more risks in showing and promoting long-range weather outlooks, as though they are as accurate as short-range forecasts, particularly when the outlook hints at extreme weather. That's considered hype that makes people click and share, increasing the popularity of the influencer,\" he says.",
      "\"Trained meteorologists avoid that because it causes confusion in implying something distant is likely, when in reality it is uncertain and unknown.",
      "\"On the other hand, there are weather influencers who have the equipment and expertise to track and forecast local weather when it is extreme, in times of crisis, often giving more focus to communities that don't get full coverage from traditional TV stations. \"",

      "His investment in forecasting equipment has been so big that he introduced paid subscriptions three years ago, but they mainly just cover his costs.",

      "Four of these six tend to retain the name and branding of an independently-owned practice when they buy it, which the CMA said may create an \"illusion of competition\" for consumers if they are trying to shop around to find alternative practices.",

      "When the BBC rang suppliers to see if shipments to the US had resumed, what emerged was a messy picture. One supplier said he had half-a-million pieces of clothing waiting to ship to Walmart, and a few others echoed his uncertainty. But two exporters we spoke to said some shipments from US retailers had indeed restarted.",
      "The range and complexity of the trade between the two economies, which includes cargo cranes, umbrellas and everything in between, means that it's often down to different businesses and supply chains as to how they deal with the tariffs.",
      "Whatever the business, there is no doubt the American consumer will feel the absence, or potentially higher prices, of Chinese goods.",
      "Opportunities beyond America",
      "The US still relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing to meet its own domestic demand \u2013 think phones, computers, semiconductors, furniture, clothes and, of course, toys. Electronics and machinery alone account for more than 50% of US imports.",

      "Most homes have standard meters and will not be affected whether they have a smart meter or not. But campaigners estimate more than 300,000 homes have the old RTS meters and could lose heating - or have it stuck on constantly.",
      "The government said the industry had to \"work urgently to continue to increase the pace of replacements\".",

      "Ned Hammond, Energy UK's deputy director for customers, told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours the rate of replacement was rising, but added: \"Obviously we'd need to increase from there significantly still to replace all the meters by the end of June.\"",
      "Asked whether it was impossible to get every RTS meter switched over by 30 June, he said: \"I wouldn't want to say impossible - but clearly very, very difficult to get to that point.\"",
      "Simon Francis, from campaign group the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said the Energy UK figures suggested more than 300,000 households could be left with a meter that doesn't work from 1 July.",

      "The RTS network was originally planned to be switched off in March 2024, but this was extended to give energy companies more time to get through everyone.",

    "story": [
      "The US economy shrank in the first three months of the year as government spending fell and imports surged due to firms racing to get goods into the country ahead of tariffs.",
      "The economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%, a sharp downturn after growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter, the Commerce Department said.",
      "The figures marked the first quarterly decline in three years, and came as the introduction of import taxes by President Donald Trump has scrambled global trade and created major uncertainty.",
      "But analysts said it would take more time to understand the impact of the tariff changes.",
      "While imports count against growth in calculations of gross domestic product (GDP), the surge is expected to be reversed in the months ahead. Those swings do not necessarily indicate an economy performing poorly.",
      "The report also showed consumer spending - the primary driver of the US economy - expanded 1.8%, though at a slower pace than in 2024.",
      "At a television appearance with cabinet members, Trump blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for the economic weakening, maintaining that his policies would drive investment in the US and an economic boom.",
      "\"This is Biden,\" he said, while appearing to dismiss bubbling fears of price increases, supply shocks and shortages of items such as toys, as trade between the US and China falls sharply.",

      "In a statement, the White House said the GDP figures were a \"backward-looking indicator\".",
      "\"The underlying numbers tell the real story of the strong momentum President Trump is delivering,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "Since re-entering the White House in January, Trump has taken the business world by storm, announcing a series of new trade tariffs that he says will raise money for the government and help boost US manufacturing.",
      "While he has watered down some of the policies in face of domestic outcry, analysts say the measures still leave the US with the highest overall effective average tariff rate in more than 100 years.",
      "This report tracked activity through the end of March, a period before Trump announced his most far-reaching \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on China and other countries around the world, which sparked a dramatic sell-off in the stock market and turmoil in currency and debt markets.",
      "It showed imports skyrocketed by more than 40% in the first three months of the year, while consumer spending grew 1.8%, down from 4% at the end of 2024.",
      "Analysts cautioned that those figures could be distorted by people pulling forward their purchases in anticipation of tariffs.",
      "The report also showed an unexpected jump in business investment, while final sales to private domestic purchasers - a closely watched indicator of overall demand - grew a solid 3%, little changed from the previous quarter.",
      "\"Overall, not as bad as feared,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "Tariffs are a tax on imports, which economists have warned will lead to higher prices.",

      "\"We all have our life over there, went to school over there, were brought up on American culture, have family over there. We're from here but we're from over there too.\"",
      "In their booths, the agents work through long lists of US phone numbers, some making promotional calls or sales, others calling about debt collection and refinancing.",
      "All the agents speak fluent English, and the clients at the other end of the line are none the wiser that they're talking to people in Mexico rather than the US.",
      "Daniel says that agents like Alberto \u2013 who fell into gangs and crime at a vulnerable age in the US, but are willing to turn over a new leaf in Mexico \u2013 are among his most trusted employees.",
      "\"They almost never have another mark on their criminal record, and they possess the right discipline to hold down their jobs,\" he explains.",
      "Daniel Ruiz's own experiences after deportation have informed his business decisions.",
      "As well as the telesales company, he also co-founded a humanitarian organisation \u2013 called the Borderline Crisis Center \u2013 which provides deportees with food, shelter and support on their arrival back in Mexico.",
      "After his inauguration, President Trump said he would carry out what he calls \"the largest deportation in American history\".",
      "He has spoken of the removal of millions of undocumented people from US soil, and in the early days of his presidency Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents made workplace raids from Chicago to California.",
      "Mexican humanitarian organisations, including the Borderline Crisis Center, braced themselves for a huge influx of returnees.",
      "So far, though, one hasn't materialised. There are no major bottlenecks of migrants at the border, and the migrant shelters in Tijuana are not currently overflowing.",
      "The latest figures from the Mexican government actually show that the number of deportations from the US to Mexico were lower during the first three months of Trump's second administration than they were for the same period last year.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that Mexico received almost 39,000 deportees in February to April, of which 33,000 were Mexican. This compares with 52,000 for the same three months in 2024.",
      "However, the fall was in part due to a reduction in the number of people trying to get into the US in the first place. Migrant \"encounters\" on the US southern border by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents has dropped to their lowest level in years.",
      "The threat of mass deportation combined with other factors \u2013 from military deployments at the border, to the high-profile deportations of migrants to El Salvador \u2013 may have acted as an effective deterrent.",
      "The Trump Administration is also pushing the idea of self-deportation hard to undocumented immigrants through blunt warnings.",
      "Still, there are people being sent back to Tijuana on a near daily basis. Many face hostility as they try to resettle in the dusty and dangerous border city.",
      "The few companies which offer deportees gainful employment have become even more important to avoid a slide into criminality.",
      "Beyond a smaller venture like EZ Call Center, a larger company called the American Survey Company or ASC also relies on a deportee workforce.",
      "With its sister company, Voxcentrix, ASC has some 550 call centre stations in Tijuana, where agents make calls on everything from election polling to customer satisfaction surveys.",
      "\"What happened in the US stays in the US,\" laughs Nora Diaz, ASC's chief happiness officer. \"We don't really do background checks on that.\"",
      "Nora says her job is focussed on the employees' wellbeing, to help them reintegrate.",
      "\"We understand everyone has a past, and we don't judge based on that. We don't ask about it during our interview process. We just need people who speak good English and good Spanish and are willing to commit to a job,\" she explains.",

      "While in prison in California, he enrolled for every educational programme available and worked hard on his rehabilitation. On release, he was also sent back to Mexico in January, just as Trump was gearing up for his inaugural speech.",
      "Now 50-years-old and covered in gang-related tattoos, Luis knew he wouldn't get many more second chances in life.",
      "\"I got no family over here. My family is ASC, the people I met in my employment, they're my family and my friends.\"",
      "For Luis, the outwardly dull telephony work has provided the anchor he needs to stay out of crime, something he says ex-gang members he knows in the US struggle with.",
      "\"From the first day I didn't feel any judgement at all. I felt they just opened their arms and took me in. I think I'd be in the streets right now if it wasn't for ASC,\" he adds.",
      "While the Trump Administration's mass deportation programme isn't yet at a level many in Mexico expected, some believe it could pick up pace over the coming months.",

      "\"I want to do a job that will bring more success to Vietnam,\" said Linh in fluent English. She is studying economics and marketing. \"And yes, success for me too,\" she admits, with a smile, when prodded.",
      "It's a dream that suits her bustling city \u2013 now a sprawling metropolis of 10 million people, Ho Chi Minh City has the same choking traffic, glass-clad skyscrapers, five-star hotels, restaurants and seedy massage parlours as any Asian mega city.",
      "You would be hard put to find traces of the socialist ideology that led to the city's capture in 1975, when it was the capital of South Vietnam. The victors renamed it city Ho Chi Minh, after the revolutionary father of North Vietnam. But to locals, it is still Saigon.",
      "And when it fell on this day 50 years ago, South Vietnam ceased to exist as North Vietnamese tanks smashed through the tall iron gates of the presidential compound and raised the red flag with a yellow star over the presidential palace.",
      "America's ally, the southern regime, was vanquished. Its last president had fled the previous day. More than two decades of bitter conflict was over.",
      "The victory had come at an enormous cost. An estimated three million dead and millions more injured. Between 1968 and 1975, a greater tonnage of bombs was dropped on this slender piece of land than in all theatres in World War Two.",
      "But few here want to talk about the war even as they celebrate the anniversary of their \"reunification\".",
      "Linh and her friends screamed in delight as a truck carrying soldiers drove past. The shy idols waved back \u2013 they were on their way to the barracks after rehearsals for the anniversary parade.",
      "\"I am excited because this is the day when we reunited, when we became one country again,\" Linh said.",
      "Her answer sounded a little rehearsed, not least because of the government-appointed minder who accompanied the BBC throughout. But her enthusiasm for her future \u2013 and her country's - is not uncommon.",

      "The ambition is huge. So far only one country in South East Asia, Singapore, has managed to escape the \"middle-income trap\", where economic growth slows before countries become rich. Vietnam, whose economy is growing at a steady 5%, intends to be the second. It has flung its doors wide open to investment \u2013 and is welcoming back those it once drove from its shores.",
      "After the 1975 victory around two million southern Vietnamese fled the country. Many were ethnic Chinese. They packed on to flimsy boats and set out across the South China Sea. They became known as \"the boat people\". Today their descendants make up a diaspora of nearly six million stretching from the United States and Canada to France, Germany, Japan and Taiwan.",

      "Two young businesswomen from southern China, who did not want to share their names, tell us they have spent the last two years setting up a shoe factory here: \"Now it's ready to go.\"",
      "They plan to export to the US. They are concerned about the possibility of higher tariffs for Vietnam - it currently faces a 10% levy, like most of the world \u2013 but \"it's a lot better here than China\", they say with a laugh. Chinese imports to the US face a range of tariffs that go up to 245% for some goods.",
      "Still, Vietnam is feeling the impact, Ms Wu said. \"I had several factories preparing to begin operations here this May. But because of the policy change, all have stopped and everyone is waiting.\"",
      "Vietnam is again being asked to choose \u2013 America or China. But it's not a choice it can or will make because it needs both.",
      "Less than two weeks ago, they rolled out the red carpet to welcome Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the capital Hanoi. Warm words were spoken of fraternal friendship and support. But relations with their big neighbour are trickier than they may appear. For years, Vietnam has walked a tightrope between Washington and Beijing \u2013 the latter's expansive ambitions can be a threat to neighbours, especially growing economies that are keen to woo US businesses.",
      "As Vietnam insists on \"looking forward\", it appears to have almost forgotten the men and women who fought in the jungles and through the hell of American bombs.",

    "summary": "Bug hunters make money by funding flaws in software, but AI is changing the way they work.",
    "story": [
      "Few technology careers offer the chance to demonstrate your skills in exclusive venues worldwide, from luxury hotels to Las Vegas e-sports arenas, peers cheering you on as your name moves up the leaderboard and your earnings rack up.",
      "But that's what Brandyn Murtagh experienced within his first year as a bug bounty hunter.",
      "Mr Murtagh got into gaming and building computers at 10 or 11-years-old and always knew \"I wanted to be a hacker or work in security\".",
      "He began working in a security operations centre at 16, and moved into penetration testing at 20, a job that also involved testing the security of clients' physical and computer security: \"I had to forge false identities and break into places and then hack. Quite fun.\"",
      "But in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back.",
      "Internet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash \"bounty\" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s.",
      "Eventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities.",
      "As Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a \"morally agnostic skill set\", bug hunters do have to operate within the law.",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the \"scope\" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate \"hammering\" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money.",
      "The payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. \"We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes.\"",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd mean \"you can use hackers as a force for good,\" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered \u2013 and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one \"we deem very severe\". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.",
      "So, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.",
      "But while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.",
      "Mr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"",
      "Yet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.",
      "Mr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.",
      "\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".",
      "Dr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.",
      "And it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.",
      "But modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.",
      "He says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".",
      "Mr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"",
      "But these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"",
      "But the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.",
      "\"If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws.\"",
      "Dr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but \"I think it's just a matter of time\".",
      "In the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. \"The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe.\"",
      "That is unlikely to put off the bug hunters in the meantime. As Mr De Ceukelaire says: \"Once a hacker, always a hacker.\"",

    "summary": "The slowdown in the market was expected due to the lowering of thresholds at which buyers need to start paying stamp duty.",
    "story": [
      "House prices fell in April as buyers faced paying thousands of pounds more in stamp duty, according to new figures from Nationwide.",
      "Prices were down 0.6% month-on-month, the building society said.",
      "The slowdown in the market was expected due to changes to stamp duty thresholds kicking in on 1 April.",
      "Annual house price growth also slowed, but homes remain 3.4% more expensive  than they were a year ago, with the average price now at \u00a3270,752.",
      "Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said there was a \"significant jump\" in transactions in March, with buyers bringing forward purchases to avoid the additional tax charges.",
      "\"The market is likely to remain a little soft in the coming months,\" he said.",
      "But Mr Gardner added buying was likely to pick up as over summer due to earnings rising and the expectation of further cuts to interest rates.",
      "Mortgages under 4% are back but dangers lurk for borrowers",
      "What is stamp duty and how is it changing?",
      "In her October Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that the government had decided to lower stamp duty thresholds in England and Northern Ireland.",
      "The changes, which came into effect in April, means house buyers now pay the tax on properties over \u00a3125,000, instead of over \u00a3250,000, as was the case previously.",
      "First-time buyers will also now have to pay stamp duty on homes costing more than \u00a3300,000, whereas before the April change, they did not have to pay the charge unless the property was above \u00a3425,000.",
      "Nationwide's house price data is based on its own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales.",
      "April's drop in house prices was the biggest monthly fall since August 2023, according to UK economist Ashley Webb from Capital Economics.",
      "He said that the easing of mortgage rates would help boost housing demand in the coming months, offsetting any tightening in spending as a result of higher prices potentially caused by US president Donald Trump's trade tariffs.",
      "Mr Webb added that house prices are predicted to rise by 3.5% this year, and 4.5% in 2026.",
      "A mini price war has broken out between mortgage providers, although many of the lowest-rate deals still require borrowers to provide a hefty deposit.",
      "All major UK lenders are now offering fixed mortgage deals with an interest rate of less than 4%, but brokers say further cuts are not guaranteed.",
      "Recent figures suggested that more low-deposit mortgages at 5% or 10% are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008.",
      "The extra choice is a boost for first-time buyers, although house prices and mortgage rates are higher than they were for much of the last 17 years.",
      "Expectations are growing that the Bank of England could cut interest rates three more times this year because of the global fallout from US trade tariffs. That, in turn, could lower mortgage costs.",
      "\"With the anticipation of further rate cuts and mortgage provider competition, we expect to see the market accelerate through the gears over the remainder of the year,\" said Jean Jameson, from estate agent Foxtons."

    "summary": "The real battleground of the current trade war might be China's domestic economy",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Laura read this article",
      "If you say the name Donald Trump in the halls of wholesale markets and trade fairs in China, you'll hear a faint chuckle.",
      "The US president and his 145% tariffs have not instilled fear in many Chinese traders.",
      "Instead, they have inspired an army of online Chinese nationalists to create mocking memes in a series of viral videos and reels \u2013 some of which include an AI-generated President Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and tech mogul Elon Musk toiling on footwear and iPhone assembly lines.",
      "China is not behaving like a nation facing the prospect of economic pain and President Xi Jinping has made it clear that Beijing will not back down.",
      "\"For more than 70 years, China has always relied on self-reliance and hard work for development\u2026 it has never relied on anyone's gifts and is unafraid of any unreasonable suppression,\" he said this month.",
      "His confidence may come in part because China is far less dependent than it was 10 years ago on exports to the US. But the truth is Trump's brinkmanship and tariff hikes are pushing on pressure points that already exist within China's own struggling economy. With a housing crisis, increasing job insecurity and an ageing population, Chinese people are simply not spending as much as their government would like.",
      "Xi came to power in 2012 with a dream of a rejuvenated China. That is now being severely tested \u2013 and not just by US tariffs. Now, the question is whether or not Trump's tariffs will dampen Xi's economic dreams, or can he turn the obstacles that exist into opportunities?",
      "Xi's domestic challenges",
      "With a population of 1.4 billion, China has, in theory, a huge domestic market. But there's a problem. They don't appear willing to spend money while the country's economic outlook is uncertain.",
      "This has not been prompted by the trade war \u2013 but by the collapse of the housing market. Many Chinese families invested their life savings in their homes, only to watch prices plummet in the last five years.",
      "Housing developers continued to build even as the property market crumbled. It's thought that China's entire population would not fill all the empty apartments across the country.",
      "The former deputy head of China's statistics bureau, He Keng, admitted two years ago that the most \"extreme estimate\" is that there are now enough vacant homes for 3 billion people.",
      "Travel round Chinese provinces and you see they are littered with empty projects \u2013 lines of towering concrete shells that have been labelled \"ghost cities\". Others have been fitted out, the gardens have been landscaped, curtains frame the windows, and they appear filled with the promise of a new home. But only at night, when you see no lights, can you tell that the apartments are empty. There just aren't enough buyers to match this level of construction.",
      "The government acted five years ago to restrict the amount of money developers could borrow. But the damage to house prices and, in turn, consumer confidence in China, has been done and analysts have projected a 2.5% decline in home prices this year, according to a Reuters poll in February.",
      "And it's not just house prices that worry middle-class Chinese families.",
      "They are concerned about whether the government can offer them a pension \u2013 over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. According to a 2019 estimate by the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government pension fund could run out of money by 2035.",
      "There are also fears about whether their sons, daughters and grandchildren can get a job as millions of college graduates are struggling to find work. More than one in five people between the ages of 16 and 24 in urban areas are jobless in China, according to official data published in August 2023. The government has not released youth unemployment figures since then.",
      "The problem is that China cannot simply flip a switch and move from selling goods to the US to selling them to local buyers.",
      "\"Given the downward pressure on the economy, it is unlikely domestic spending can be significantly expanded in the short term,\" says Prof Nie Huihua at Renmin University.",
      "\"Replacing exports with internal demand will take time.\"",
      "According to Prof Zhao Minghao, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, \"China does not have high expectations for talks with the Trump administration\u2026 The real battleground is in the adjustment of China's domestic policies, such as boosting domestic demand.\"",
      "To revive a slowing economy, the government has announced billions in childcare subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave. It has also introduced a $41bn programme offering discounts on items such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) to encourage more people to spend. But Prof Zhang Jun, the Dean of Economics at Fudan University, believes this is not \"sustainable\".",
      "\"We need a long-term mechanism,\" he says. \"We need to start increasing residents' disposable income.\"",
      "This is urgent for Xi. The dream of prosperity he sold when he took power 13 years ago has not become reality.",
      "A political test for Xi",
      "Xi is also aware that China has a disheartened younger generation worried about their future. That could spell bigger trouble for the Communist Party: protests or unrest.",
      "A report by Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor claims that protests driven by financial grievances saw a steep increase in the last few months.",
      "All protests are quickly subdued and censored on social media, so it is unlikely to pose a real threat to Xi for now.",
      "\"Only when the country does well and the nation does well can every person do well,\" Xi said in 2012.",
      "This promise was made when China's economic rise looked unstoppable. It now looks uncertain.",
      "Where the country has made huge strides over the past decade is in areas such as consumer electronics, batteries, EVs and artificial intelligence as part of a pivot to advanced manufacturing.",
      "It has rivalled US tech dominance with the chatbot DeepSeek and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest EV maker.",
      "Yet Trump's tariffs threaten to throw a spanner in the works.",
      "The restrictions on the sale of key chips to China, including the most recent move tightening exports from US chip giant Nvidia, for instance, are aimed at curbing Xi's ambitions for tech supremacy.",
      "Despite that, Xi knows that Chinese manufacturers are at a decades-long advantage, so that US manufacturers are struggling to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.",
      "Turning a challenge into an opportunity",
      "President Xi is also trying to use this crisis as a catalyst for further change and to find more new markets for China.",
      "\"In the short term, some Chinese exporters will be greatly impacted,\" says Prof Zhang. \"But Chinese companies will take the initiative to adjust the destination of exports to overcome difficulties. Exporters are waiting and looking for new customers.\"",
      "Donald Trump's first term in office was China's cue to look elsewhere for buyers. It has expanded its ties across South East Asia, Latin America and Africa \u2013 and a Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative shored up ties with the so-called Global South.",
      "China is reaping the rewards from that diversification. More than 145 countries do more trade with China than they do with the US, according to the Lowy Institute.",
      "In 2001, only 30 countries chose Beijing as their lead trade partner over Washington.",
      "Geopolitical gains",
      "As Trump targets both friend and foe, some believe Xi can further upend the current US-led world order and portray his country as a stable, alternative global trade partner and leader.",
      "The Chinese leader chose South East Asia for his first trip abroad after the tariff announcement, sensing his neighbours would be getting jittery about Trump's tariffs.",
      "Around a quarter of Chinese exports are now manufactured or shipped through a second country including Vietnam and Cambodia.",
      "Recent US actions may also present a chance for Xi to positively shape China's role in the world.",
      "\"Trump's coercive tariff policy is an opportunity for Chinese diplomacy,\" says Prof Zhang.",
      "China will have to tread carefully. Some countries will be nervous that products being manufactured for the US could end up flooding into their markets.",
      "Trump's tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers.",
      "According to Prof Huihua, \"about 20% of China's exports go to the US - if these exports were to flood any regional market or country, it could lead to dumping and vicious competition, thereby triggering new trade frictions\".",
      "There are barriers to Xi presenting himself as the arbiter of free trade in the world.",
      "China has subjected other nations to trade restrictions in recent years.",
      "In 2020, after the Australian government called for a global inquiry into the origins and early handling of the Covid pandemic, which Beijing argued was a political manoeuvre against them, China placed tariffs on Australian wine and barley and imposed biosecurity measures on some beef and timber and bans on coal, cotton and lobster. Some Australian exports of certain goods to China fell to nearly zero.",
      "Australia's Defence Minister Richard Marles said earlier this month that his nation will not be \"holding China's hand\" as Washington escalated its trade war with Beijing.",
      "China's past actions may impede Xi's current global outreach and many countries may be unwilling to choose between Beijing and Washington.",
      "Even with all the various difficulties, Xi is betting that Beijing will be able to withstand any economic pain longer than Washington in this great power competition.",
      "And it does appear that Trump has blinked first, last week hinting at a potential U-turn on tariffs, saying that the taxes he has so far imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese social media is back in action.",
      "\"Trump has chickened out,\" was one of the top trending search topics on the Chinese social media platform Weibo after the US president softened his approach to tariffs.",
      "Even if or when talks do happen, China is playing a longer game.",
      "The last trade war forced it to diversify its export market away from the US towards other markets \u2013 especially in the Global South.",
      "This trade war has China looking in the mirror to see its own flaws \u2013 and whether it can fix them will be up to policies made in Beijing, not Washington.",

    "summary": "Is Blue Ivy another example of a celebrity child given an unearned spotlight or could she be a genuine star?",
    "story": [
      "While most 13-year-olds were spending their Monday evening stressing over homework, awkward school crushes and what to post on TikTok, Blue Ivy Carter was performing in front of a crowd of 70,000 people alongside her mother Beyonc\u00e9 on the opening night of her Cowboy Carter tour.",
      "Her numerous cameos throughout the show \u2013 particularly her solo dance during D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu \u2013 were highly praised.",
      "\"She must be one of the most self-disciplined 13-year-olds in America,\" Variety's Chris Willman wrote. On social media, fans said the child prodigy was the \"greatest nepo baby of all time\" as they marvelled at her flawless dance routines.",
      "Being a nepo baby - shorthand for the children of celebrities who often find themselves fast-tracked into industries such as film, fashion, and music - may have been scorned at in the past, but Blue Ivy's performance may have complicated the narrative.",
      "The teen had access to a stage that most could only dream of, but she also delivered a performance that fans and critics agreed was very impressive, which raises the question: Is this just another example of a celebrity child given an unearned spotlight, or could Blue Ivy be a genuine star in her own right?",
      "'An easier ride'",
      "This is also not the first time Blue Ivy has performed in public \u2013 she joined her mother on stage two years ago on the Renaissance tour and last year voiced the character of Kiara in The Lion King prequel Mufasa: The Lion King.",
      "But music journalist Caroline Sullivan says Blue Ivy's trajectory to stardom \"has very little to do with her and everything to do with the parent\".",
      "\"It's about how much we like or dislike the parent \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 is well liked so fans will praise Blue Ivy,\" she explains. \"Of course, it helps that she's good at what she does but even if she wasn't, she'd be given an easier ride.\"",
      "Sullivan also says that the authenticity of Blue Ivy wanting to perform instead of being forced to do it by her mother adds to how we perceive her.",
      "Speaking to the BBC last month, Beyonc\u00e9's mother, Tina Knowles, said Blue Ivy and her siblings were being nurtured to do \"anything that they want for themselves... but definitely not pushed into show business\".",
      "She added that her granddaughter had had to \"work for\" her role in The Lion King prequel and she \"worries about the fame\" impacting her grandchildren.",
      "Blue Ivy is hardly the first child to have performed on stage with a famous parent. Madonna's 17-year-old daughter played the piano on her mother's Celebration tour in 2023, Dave Grohl's 19-year-old daughter has often sung with him on stage and Phil Collins' son was the drummer on his 2019 tour.",
      "\"It's not because he's the boss's son that he's playing the drums, it's because he's good enough,\" the former Genesis drummer said in 2019 as he defended his decision to take his 17-year-old son on his world tour.",
      "Sullivan says it can often be \"naff and cringy\" if a musician brings their child on stage \"just for the sake of it\", but if done right, it can be \"incredibly sweet and show a lot of love\".",
      "Many critics, including Tomas Mier from the Rolling Stones, said Beyonc\u00e9's youngest daughter Rumi joining her on stage for Protector was \"one of the most heartwarming moments of the evening\".",
      "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's 11-year-old daughter, North West, has also forged the beginnings of a music career, recently delivering a rap verse in Japanese on FKA Twigs' single Childlike Things.",
      "Twigs said she chose to collaborate with North West because her \"energy is so inspiring\" and she was \"so confident\".",
      "\"I wasn't that confident when I was a kid. I was so shy, I was scared of the dark, I was very different to the other kids at my school. It suddenly occurred to me that I would have loved to have a friend like North, who could speak up for themselves.\"",
      "North West also appeared as Young Simba in the Hollywood Bowl's The Lion King 30th anniversary concert last year but her singing was criticised on social media.",
      "\"Given how controversial her parents are, I think North West will struggle to break away from the nepo baby claims because unless she is unbelievably talented, she will be slated,\" Sullivan says.",
      "In December 2022, New York magazine's cover story on nepo babies caused a stir in the showbusiness industry.",
      "The cover featured the faces of famous actors including Dakota Johnson, Jack Quaid, Zo\u00eb Kravitz and Lily Rose-Depp edited onto the bodies of babies, with the headline: \"She has her mother's eyes. And agent.\"",
      "The story claimed that \"a nepo baby is physical proof that meritocracy is a lie\" and that \"today, they're not only abundant - they're thriving\".",
      "It was met with backlash by many stars who claimed the label was unfair and diminished their hard work.",
      "Gwyneth Paltrow, a nepo baby herself as the daughter of actress Blythe Danner and film director Bruce Paltrow, said the term was an \"ugly moniker\" and that children of famous people should not be judged negatively because \"there's nothing wrong with doing or wanting to do what your parents do\".",
      "Similarly, Zoe Kravitz told GQ that it was \"completely normal for people to be in the family business\", while Stranger Things actress Maya Hawke said a famous family name \"definitely gives you massive advantages in this life but the chances will not be infinite; so you have to keep working and do a good job. If you do a bad job, the chances will stop\".",
      "Almost Famous star Kate Hudson, daughter of actors Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson, said in a 2022 interview with the Independent that \"people call it whatever they want\", but the idea that children will follow in the footsteps of their parents is \"not going to change\".",
      "Hudson was right that, in the three years since New York magazine's cover story caused so much controversy, nepo babies haven't slunk off into the background. In fact, they continue to thrive, particularly those with real talent.",
      "Pam Lyddon, a PR executive in the entertainment industry says that there's \"no denying that being well-connected can absolutely help you succeed in the industry\" but \"while connections might get you noticed, you do still need genuine talent, hard work, and resilience to stay in the game - results speak for themselves and reputations are everything.\"",
      "She explains that for the new wave of nepo babies, talent is even more important as the \"scrutiny is more intense and people are more media savvy\" so you can't get away with mediocrity.",
      "As fans and critics continue to praise Blue Ivy, it seems that the credibility of nepo babies hasn't been damaged by the nepo baby backlash, and if you have the star factor, your parents being Beyonce and Jay-Z is only going to help you fly.",

      "In its statement, Rockstar said the \"interest and excitement\" in the game had been \"truly humbling for our entire team\".",
      "The company is known for its long development cycles and the 12-year gap since GTA 5's release has sparked a wave of jokes and memes online.",
      "It also has a track record of delaying major releases, such as 2018's Red Dead Redemption 2 - the studio's last big new game.",
      "But Rockstar is also known for its perfectionist approach and Straus Zelnick, CEO of parent company Take Two Interactive, previously said each new game from the developer \"needs to be something you've never seen before\".",
      "'I'm getting impatient at this point'",
      "News of the delay has landed hard with fans such as Dienne Kawende, 27.",

    "story": [
      "The thriller about slain Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, Words of War, opens in US cinemas today. The filmmakers took into account some of the inaccuracy concerns about the script raised by her family, Politkovskaya's sister Elena Kudimova told the BBC.",
      "The film is coming out just in time for the World Press Freedom Day. Words of War was produced by Sean Penn. Anna Politkovskaya is played by Maxine Peake, and one of the leading male roles is performed by Jason Isaacs.",
      "Words of War tells the story of legendary Russian journalist and human rights activist Anna Politkovskaya.",
      "In Russia, her name is synonymous with courage and an indomitable spirit. She rose to prominence for her investigations into human rights abuses in Chechnya - a region in southern Russia that fought two wars for independence in the 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "Her older sister, Elena Kudimova, describes her as \"someone who, despite all the threats and the danger to her life, kept doing her work until the very end.\"",
      "Politkovskaya openly criticised the Russian authorities and President Putin himself. Despite receiving numerous threats over the years, she refused to back down.",
      "Her sister recalls that while Politkovskaya considered emigration, she always changed her mind at the last moment. She would say: \"I can't leave because nobody else will help the people here.\"",
      "Reporting the war in Chechnya",
      "From 1999, Politkovskaya traveled to Chechnya almost every month for several years. Kudimova recalls that for many wronged and desperate people, Politkovskaya became \"the last resort\" - the one who could make things right.",
      "She took part in the negotiations for Nord-Ost, the 2002 hostage crisis at a Moscow theatre, after the Chechen rebels specifically requested her.",
      "In 2004, she hoped to help resolve the crisis in Beslan, where heavily armed militants held hostages in a school for three days.",
      "However, she never made it there - she was poisoned on the plane while en route to Beslan.",
      "In 2006, Politkovskaya was shot dead in the elevator of her apartment building in Moscow. Six men were convicted over the murder, but the person who ordered it has never been identified.",
      "Her sister Elena doubts that the mastermind will ever be brought to justice. \"If they had wanted to find him, they probably would have done so by now,\" Kudimova adds.",
      "Avoiding clich\u00e9s",
      "Before the film's release, Politkovskaya's family raised concerns about the Words of War script, believing the film took too many liberties with the truth.",
      "While the filmmakers insist that the drama is based on real events, they emphasise that it is not a biography.",
      "However, Politkovskaya's sister notes that the filmmakers did take the family's feedback into account, and certain scenes that raised the most questions were removed from the final cut.",
      "\"[Anna's son] Ilya was portrayed in the original script as a sort of womanizer, [and in the film] Anna doesn't have a romance with [Dmitry] Muratov,\" she said.",
      "Dmitry Muratov, a Nobel Prize-winning journalist, was Anna Politkovskaya's former colleague at the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta.",
      "According to Kudimova, Maxine Peake portrays her sister accurately, though she believes Anna's personality was \"much greater and more complex\" than what is depicted on screen.",
      "\"Her real life had far more dramatic episodes than those shown in the film,\" she says.",
      "Kudimova criticised the film's setting for leaning too heavily into cold-weather clich\u00e9s.",
      "\"I was struck by the fact that it's constantly snowing, as if Russia has only one season. In reality, we have all four.\" However, Kudimova is grateful that the film helps preserve the memory of her sister.",
      "Anna's legacy",
      "Kudimova said that Anna never thought about her own legacy. She recalled how, at some point, someone had suggested Anna write an autobiography - she was in her 40s at the time.",
      "Anna had laughed at the idea, saying it felt more like something you do when you're a hundred. But then she came up with the idea of writing six short stories.",
      "At the end of each, she said, she was supposed to die - but didn't, for different reasons. And they were going to be funny stories.",
      "When asked about how Anna would want to be remembered, Elena says that her sister did dot think about her legacy: \"She simply wanted to live.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 23:43:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The Bafta award-winning film gives viewers a window into a \"highly secret and a deeply private process\".",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 film Conclave - a box office hit and Oscar winner - tells the story of a papal election in which there are no obvious favourites. For many people, it was a glimpse into the rarefied world of the Vatican, and the highly secretive process of choosing a leader for the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "On Wednesday 7 May, life follows fiction when 134 cardinals begin the process of electing a successor to Pope Francis. As viewers of the film will know, the papal conclave will take place entirely behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel, beneath its world-famous Michelangelo frescoes.",
      "Nobody outside the confines of the Vatican will know the outcome until a plume of white smoke curls from its chimney, signifying that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.",
      "But what does the film tell us about how the conclave could unfold, and why do people find the process so fascinating?",
      "'Intense responsibility'",
      "Adapted from the bestselling novel by Robert Harris, Conclave shows the cardinal-electors isolating themselves within the confines of the Vatican during the process of the election.",
      "They are not allowed communication with anyone outside the conclave -  although given the practicalities, they are not entirely cut off.",
      "\"They all need feeding, they're not totally hermetically sealed off from the world,\" says Stephen Bullivant, professor of theology and the sociology of religion at St Mary's University, Twickenham.",
      "This self-imposed isolation is a tradition which stretches back hundreds of years.",
      "In part, it is aimed at preventing the electors from being influenced by external factors, although the idea of a process that happens behind closed doors may seem at odds with the modern world's \"focus on transparency, visibility and scrutiny\", according to Anna Rowlands, professor of Catholic social thought and practice at the University of Durham.",
      "The film invokes an \"incredible, introspective atmosphere\" and sense of withdrawal from the world, she says. \"I struggle to think of a more intense responsibility and feeling than being locked away in conclave.\"",
      "Conclave to elect new pope to begin on 7 May, Vatican says",
      "Who will be the next pope? Key candidates in an unpredictable process",
      "'Lots of politicking'",
      "On the screen, claustrophobic and intense deliberations, strategic huddles and tactical moves abound. One cardinal undermines a frontrunner to improve their own chances. Others with unlikely prospects urge their supporters to change their vote.",
      "This conflict of interests and competing ideologies provides much of the film's drama. \"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on,\" Nick Emerson, the film's editor, told the BBC earlier this year.",
      "While some cardinals will think the most important part is following divine guidance, others will have anxiety over making a quick decision, says Tina Beattie, professor emerita of Catholic studies at the University of Roehampton.",
      "Given that Pope Francis's health had been poor for a while, it is likely that, even before the conclave, \"there will have been lots of politicking and jostling for position already behind the scenes\", she adds.",
      "\"There will be all those tussles going on and [the cardinals] won't all be of one mind.\"",
      "Although in the film, some of the tensest scenes are focused on the act of voting, in reality, much of the drama may come in meetings in the days before conclave officially begins.",
      "During this time, the participants will be \"getting to know each other, working out what the priorities are and learning how to work together as a body so they can come up with a unified decision\", says Prof Rowlands, who is nearing the end of a two-year secondment to the Vatican.",
      "A complete unknown?",
      "In the film, an unknown cardinal - secretly appointed by the late pope - is catapulted into the fray.",
      "In real life, this would not be possible. Although any baptised Roman Catholic male is theoretically eligible to be made pope, all cardinals voting in the conclave would need to have been appointed publicly by a previous pope.",
      "Having said this, the imminent election may be one of the most unpredictable there has ever been. About 80% of the cardinals eligible to vote have been appointed in the past 12 years by Pope Francis. He consciously chose people from across the globe and with diverse political backgrounds.",
      "Many of Francis's appointees are from the developing world - \"places and contexts which are not normally given a red hat\", says Prof Rowlands.",
      "This adds a level of uncertainty as to their priorities and the ultimate decision.",
      "'A very human thing'",
      "The film presents the cardinals as fallible human beings jostling for power.",

      "It featured in the US presidential election campaign and the Collins Dictionary, which crowned it word of the year.",
      "Lorde performed the remix during Charli's Coachella set in California last month, with Charli even suggesting \"Lorde summer 2025\" could follow 2024's Brat summer.",

    "summary": "The Irish band have a reputation for provocation, but a new row has led to rising scrutiny and anger.",
    "story": [
      "To their fans, west Belfast rave-rap group Kneecap are a rowdy, subversive force of nature. But to many others, their inflammatory political messages make them dangerous and amoral.",
      "Following in the footsteps of anti-establishment rap groups like NWA and Run The Jewels, the trio present themselves as dissident underdogs, giving a voice to the oppressed.",
      "Their lyrics, delivered in a rapid-fire mix of English and Irish, cover everything from drug-fuelled parties to their desire to free Northern Ireland from British rule.",
      "On stage and on film, they've created a riotous experience that's thrilled Glastonbury, won a Bafta award, and inspired what's been called an \"Irish language revolution\".",
      "But their rising profile has resulted in increased scrutiny and anger about their political statements.",
      "During an incendiary performance at the Coachella music festival in California earlier this month, they described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide. As a result, they've been called anti-Semitic and branded \"terrorist sympathisers\".",
      "Now, footage from two previous gigs is being assessed by counter-terrorism police in the UK.",
      "In one, the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.",
      "Kneecap have responded with a statement, saying they \"do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah\".",
      "They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.",
      "But Cox's widower Brendan was unimpressed, calling their statement \"only half an apology\". Downing Street agreed, describing their words as \"half-hearted\" and \"completely unacceptable\".",
      "The row was discussed in the House of Commons on Tuesday, with Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp calling their comments \"evil\".",
      "It isn't the band's first brush with controversy. If anything, controversy is in their DNA. But this time, the fallout threatens to engulf their career, with venues and festivals under pressure to cancel the band's gigs.",
      "To understand how we got here, here's Kneecap's origin story.",
      "Kneecap were formed in 2017 by rappers Mo Chara (Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh) and M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap (Naoise \u00d3 Caireall\u00e1in), alongside beatmaker DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed (JJ \u00d3 Dochartaigh).",
      "Their career was sparked by an incident in which M\u00f3gla\u00ed and a friend were out spray-painting the day before a march in support of an Irish Language Act.",
      "M\u00f3gla\u00ed had written \"cearta\" (rights) on a bus stop when police arrived. He fled but his friend was arrested, and spent a night in the cells after refusing to speak English to the police.",
      "They documented the incident in the song C.E.A.R.T.A, which they released \"just for the craic. No plans for after,\" Mo Chara told the Irish Times.",
      "To their surprise, the song was playlisted by Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9, only to be removed after listeners complained about drug references in the lyrics.",
      "After that, their output was sporadic. The mixtape 3CAG (slang for the drug MDMA) arrived in 2018, followed by the singles H.O.O.D and MAM - dedicated to M\u00f3gla\u00ed's mother, who had died by suicide.",
      "Those early records showcased an ability to move between sharp satire, tender vulnerability and the experiences of Northern Ireland's \"ceasefire babies\" - the generation born around the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.",
      "Talking to the BBC in 2023, the band said they were inspired by US bands like Dead Prez, NWA and Wu Tang Clan.",
      "\"Rebel music in Ireland has all the same sort of ideas as hip-hop in America. A community that's oppressed, using songs to revolt in some way,\" said Mo Chara.",
      "They perform most of their lyrics in Irish, drawing inspiration from a burgeoning underground scene of \"as Gaeilge\" rap acts like Iml\u00e9 and Seamus Barra (the latter was even name-checked in their debut single).",
      "\"The only way that Irish history and mythology was passed down was orally. I think that's why it's important for us to have that intertwined with our music,\" M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap told Crack magazine last year.",
      "Kneecap's lyrics frequently contain Republican slang and slogans. Even their name is a reference to the IRA's chosen method of punishment for alleged drug dealers during the Troubles.",
      "The messaging has landed them in hot water before. DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed lost his job as a teacher in 2020 after his school was alerted to a video of a concert where he'd painted \"Brits out\" on his buttocks.",
      "Two years later, the band made headlines in Belfast after commissioning a mural of a burning police vehicle with a slogan criticising Northern Ireland's pre-Good Friday police force, the RUC.",
      "Designed to promote a festival appearance, it was criticised by politicians across the  spectrum.",
      "\"Loathe to give the band more publicity,\" said Alliance leader Naomi Long, \"but as a community we need to start asking ourselves what messages we're sending out about the kind of future we want.\"",
      "The band have claimed their take on Republicanism is partially tongue-in-cheek - satirising the self-important sloganeering they grew up with.",
      "\"Republicanism is so vast, and on a spectrum,\" M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap told the New York Times. \"We like to toy with it. We like to take the irony on.\"",
      "Certainly, the band's gleeful celebration of drug culture puts them at odds with the old guard of the movement - but the band are serious about their desire for a unified Ireland.",
      "\"The British government has failed us for 100 years,\" Mo Charra told Vulture last year. \"It's not like this is a trial run. You've had enough time and it's failed.\"",
      "Awards success",
      "Kneecap's reputation grew in 2024 with the release of a film, also called Kneecap, which presented a semi-fictional, and often hilarious, account of their rise to fame.",
      "Starring the band as themselves, with Michael Fassbender as M\u00f3gla\u00ed's father, the movie won the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival, with critics praising its \"punky defiance\" and \"unruly energy\", and was nominated for six Baftas.",
      "It was followed by their debut album, Fine Art, a concept record that threw fans into a hedonistic night out with the band at a fictional Belfast pub called The Rutz.",
      "With songs that skewered the music industry and addressed Northern Ireland's mental health crisis, it showcased a band with more to say than their reputation suggested.",
      "Still, in an era of sanitised, apolitical music, Kneecap's instincts for provocation and protest were inevitably going to draw attention.",
      "Pro-Palestinian chants have featured in their gigs since the start of the latest Israel-Gaza war. But when they brought those messages to Coachella, they faced a new level of scrutiny and criticism.",
      "Kneecap weren't the only people who uttered pro-Palestinian messages at the festival, but accusations of genocide and video screens that declared \"F*** Israel\" were seen by some as crossing a line into hate speech.",
      "The organisers of Israel's Nova Music Festival, where more than 360 people were killed by Hamas in 2023, said Kneecap's message \"deeply hurt\" their community, and invited the band to visit an exhibition about the victims and survivors \u2013 \"not to shame or silence but to connect\".",
      "Others took a more strident tone. A music industry group called The Creative Community For Peace, along with Sharon Osbourne, called on the US government to revoke the band's visas.",
      "The band's manager defended their actions. Citing Hamas-run health ministry figures that more than 50,000 Palestinians had been killed since the start of the war, Daniel Lambert characterised criticism of the Coachella performance as \"moral hysteria\".",
      "\"If somebody's hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by,\" he told RT\u00c91. \"But it's really important to speak truth and thankfully, the lads are not afraid to do that.",
      "\"They have the bravery and the conviction, given where they've come from in a post-conflict society, to stand up for what's right, and [they] are willing to do that despite the fact that it may harm their career.\"",
      "Right now, their career is under intense pressure.",
      "Since Coachella, Kneecap have received death threats and have been dropped by their booking agents in the US, which could jeopardise their visas ahead of a forthcoming sold-out tour.",
      "The discovery of the concert video in which the band shouted \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" and advised the audience to \"kill your local MP\" shocked the political establishment, with counter-terrorism police reviewing the footage.",
      "In Scotland, First Minister John Swinney has called for the band to be dropped from Glasgow's TRNSMT festival, saying their comments had \"crossed a line\".",
      "The Eden Project in Cornwall has cancelled their gig in July, and others, including Glastonbury, are under pressure to call off appearances.",
      "Home Office minister Dan Jarvis said on Tuesday: \"There is an ongoing live police investigation, so the government would urge the organisers at the Glastonbury Festival to think very carefully about who is invited to perform there later this year.\"",
      "At the same time, the criticism has only increased the profile of an act who were essentially an underground act a month ago.",

    "story": [
      "Samir Shah's anger was obvious, the BBC chairman's voice shaking with fury as he delivered his message of change. \"If you think you're too big to live by the values of this organisation, you are wrong and we will find you out,\" he promised.",
      "He left little doubt about his personal determination to stamp out bad behaviour at the BBC.",
      "But will he succeed?",
      "The Respect at Work 2025 report was commissioned following Huw Edwards' guilty pleas last year. The corporation was reeling from the revelations surrounding one of its biggest names.",
      "But 12 years ago, a report was published after a scandal involving another former BBC star.",
      "That 2013 Respect at Work review looked into BBC culture in light of Jimmy Savile's depravity. It found bullying was an issue inside the corporation, with some people viewed as \"untouchable\" because of their status and colleagues too scared to speak up, for fear of reprisals.",
      "The then director general, Tony Hall, said he wanted \"zero tolerance of bullying\". The BBC brought in a series of measures, including updating its policies and setting up a confidential helpline.",
      "'We have your backs'",
      "On Monday, the current director general, Tim Davie, said he was \"totally committed to make long-lasting change.\"",
      "He said staff must feel confident to speak up and they will be supported (unless their complaints are malicious) without any negative impact on their careers.",
      "\"We have your backs,\" he said. He announced a series of measures including a new code of conduct, a more robust disciplinary policy and leadership training.",
      "All organisations have bad apples, but the power dynamics in a media company are multi-layered. Well-known presenters, for example, can wield extraordinary influence, as well as behind-the-scenes editors and managers.",
      "Then there is the issue of an industry that often relies on freelancers, who have even less power. 30% of freelancers told the report they had seen inappropriate behaviour at the BBC. Less than half said they would feel safe speaking up. That is sobering.",
      "Equally, in BBC news and current affairs, only 48% of staff who answered a recent survey said they thought the corporation dealt with bullying and harassment concerns appropriately.",
      "This is all about power imbalances. Will BBC employees ever feel confident that the organisation really will have their backs if they decide to complain?",
      "My sense is that the biggest consideration when deciding whether to make a formal complaint is the fact that the person you are complaining about will be told you have done so. If that person is your boss, or a close colleague, how can you be sure that it won't have an impact on your career?",
      "But equally, if you don't take formal action, then there is a perception that offenders consistently get away with bad behaviour. There are rumours and stories about particular individuals inside the BBC, just as there are in all organisations.",
      "The proof, perhaps, of whether these new policies are working will be whether the small number of people whose names are often raised internally, accused informally of bad behaviour, will now face more scrutiny; whether colleagues will feel confident to raise a formal complaint.",
      "The report makes clear the majority of people enjoy working at the BBC and that there isn't a toxic culture. But it also talks of some names repeated several times as people who are \"not being held to account for poor behaviour\".",
      "Who are those people and is any action being taken in light of this review?",
      "The report doesn't name names, either complainants or those accused.",
      "A BBC source told me the corporation will always act if necessary on any information it becomes aware of.",
      "But in pockets of the BBC there is real anger that bullying by individuals is an open secret - and there's a belief that complainants aren't protected. Shah and Davie are promising that will change.",
      "It takes time to change cultures. While some behaviour is always unacceptable - sexual harassment or physical assault for example - the report also talks about grey areas, including colleagues being tetchy or rude, ridiculing ideas or using aggressive language. The plan is to nip these in the bud.",
      "Sometimes this kind of behaviour has been blamed on working in a high pressure environment, for example a newsroom, where short-term emotions can run high. It's not an excuse, Davie said.",
      "The report was commissioned because of the BBC's newsroom's most high-profile star, Huw Edwards. But his name was never mentioned over its 60 pages.",
      "Perhaps the evidence of real culture change will be if this is the last report the BBC ever does about workplace culture."

      "When he woke up, his wife was glued to the TV. The headline news of the day was that American reality TV star Kim Kardashian, then 35, had been tied up and robbed at gunpoint in a luxury Paris apartment.",
      "All her jewellery - worth about $10m (\u00a37.5m), and including the engagement ring her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m (\u00a33m) - had been taken.",
      "Yunice Abbas' wife glared at him. \"This has you written all over it,\" she grumbled.",
      "She was right. The 62-year-old had dabbled in crime his whole life, from petty offences to bank heists.",
      "The Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement.",
      "But a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017 - three months after the robbery - Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested.",
      "Ten of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks.",
      "Out of those, five are accused of taking part in the heist, and six are accused of being accessories to the crime.",
      "Most of them were born in the 1950s, leading French media to dub them the \"grandpa robbers\".",
      "Abbas and a 68-year-old man, Aomar Ait Khedache, have confessed; the others have not.",
      "One has since passed away, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he is suffering from advanced dementia.",
      "By the time the trial starts, almost nine years will have gone by since the heist.",
      "Gun wielding robbers fled on bikes and on foot",
      "On the night between 2 and 3 October 2016, Abbas and four accomplices allegedly staked out Kardashian's discreet suite in Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s, in the glitzy Madeleine neighbourhood in Paris, not far from the Op\u00e9ra and Place Vendome.",
      "At around 03:00 local time, they burst into the hotel's entrance hall, dressed as policemen and wielding a gun.",
      "They threatened and handcuffed Abderrahmane Ouatiki, an Algerian PhD student who regularly took up shifts as night receptionist, and marched him up to Kardashian's room.",
      "She was resting on her bed, tired from days of attending Paris Fashion Week events, when she heard stomping up the stairs.",
      "She called out for her sister Kourtney and her stylist Stephanie, but when they didn't answer she panicked.",
      "\"I knew someone was there to get me,\" she recalled in an interview with US interviewer David Letterman years later. \"You just feel it.\"",
      "Kim dialled 911 but the number, of course, didn't work outside of the US. As she was calling her then-security guard Pascal Duvier - who had accompanied her sister to a club - the men burst in, pushed her on the bed and started shouting.",
      "\"They kept on saying: the ring, the ring! And I was so startled that it didn't compute for a minute,\" she told Letterman.",
      "The language barrier meant Ouatiki had to act as an interpreter.",
      "They found the ring and stuffed it in a bag along with several other jewels, as well as \u20ac1000 in cash. One of the men grabbed her and pulled her towards him.",
      "Because she was wearing a robe with nothing underneath, she thought he was going to assault her, Kim later told Letterman, wiping tears away.",
      "But instead \u2013 using the technique of saucissonnage, or the practice of tying victims up like a saucisson, a salami - the man bound her with zip ties and duct tape, and left her in the bathroom.",
      "Then, he and the rest of the burglars fled on bikes and on foot. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up.",
      "Traumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn.",
      "It wasn't until later that day, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was.",
      "\"There were breaking news alerts saying Kim Kardashian had been robbed at gunpoint \u2013 that's how important it was,\" says LA-based entertainment journalist KJ Matthews.",
      "Blunders meant heist was doomed from the start",
      "\"We were so fascinated with her and her family and their rise to fame... When the heist happened we were so surprised. How could burglars have gotten so close to her?\" Matthews says.",
      "But while mistakes were made in terms of Kardashian's security, serious errors were made on the burglars' side, too.",
      "\"They didn't take into account the progress made by police techniques, which can now find micro traces of DNA anywhere,\" said Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and the author of \"Kim and the Grandpa Robbers\" - a thorough account of the heist and of the lives of its perpetrators.",
      "\"When they dressed up as police they thought 'that's it, nobody will be able to recognise us',\" she adds.",
      "But in 2016 Paris was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of the previous year, and there were a huge number of CCTV cameras all round the city, meaning police were able to spot the thieves and see them make off with the jewels.",
      "Other details of this story suggest that the thieves' planning was rather haphazard. When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels.",
      "The next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from.",
      "Police arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as \"Omar the Old\".",
      "French media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian caf\u00e9 that winter, just before their arrest.",
      "The question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian's schedule.",
      "Court documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements.",
      "But how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard?",
      "The documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael's firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim's whereabouts.",
      "Mr Madar was arrested in January 2017. His lawyer Arthur Vercken vehemently pushed back against the accusations, telling the BBC that \"since the start the case was built on assumptions, theses, theories - but no proof [of Madar's involvement] was ever found\".",
      "He added that although the Madar brothers exchanged texts about the Kardashians during Fashion Week it was just because they were \"bored\" and that when the heist took place Gary was asleep.",
      "Gary's brother, Michael, is not a defendant.",
      "\"Five men did this. You don't think one of them was keeping an eye on who was coming and going from her hotel?\" he said, suggesting that Mr Madar had only been arrested \"to prove that the French justice system works\".",
      "The trial will also attempt to determine where the jewels ended up.",
      "Police tracking of the gang's phones showed that soon after the heist Omar the Old travelled from Paris to Antwerp in Belgium, where 50% of the world's polished diamonds and 80% of rough diamonds are sold, according to the Diamond Investment Office.",
      "Many jewels were reportedly melted or broken up and sold. Abbas got \u20ac75,000 (\u00a364,000); others far less.",
      "As for Kim's engagement ring, Omar the Old said the gang was too scared to sell it on as it would be too easily traceable. It has never been found.",
      "Kim was undoubtedly spooked by the event, which marked the start of her social media hiatus.",
      "In an episode of the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she tearfully recalled the night of the heist and said had been scared for her life; later she also said the robbery had made her a \"less materialistic person\".",
      "Soon after the incident her sister Khloe told The Ellen DeGeneres Show that, for safety reasons, the Kardashian family were making some changes to how freely they posted on social media.",

    "summary": "Estimate included in official review of costs and impact of passing assisted dying law in England and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "The number of assisted deaths could be more than 4,000 in the 10th year after the law comes into force in England and Wales if MPs vote for it, a review of the policy says.",
      "The estimate forms part of the official impact assessment, carried out by civil servants to inform MPs as they debate whether to allow assisted dying.",
      "It said initially the numbers coming forward would be low, but are expected to grow over time.",
      "The impact assessment says that the total number of assisted deaths is estimated to range from between 164 and 787 in the first (half) year of the service to between 1,042 and 4,559 in year 10, and assuming a start date to the policy of October 2029.",
      "The upper estimate  of just over 4,500 assisted deaths would still only represent less than 1% of all deaths, the document said.",
      "The impact assessment also provides a financial analysis of the costs and savings involved \u2013 it is not a document that gets into the ethical or philosophical arguments for and against the policy.",
      "It comes as the bill returns to the House of Commons later this month, with a crucial vote that will determine whether the bill becomes law expected to happen in mid June.",
      "Costs and savings",
      "In the first six months, savings for the NHS could range from around \u00a3919,000 to \u00a310.3m.",
      "This figure includes hospital care, primary and community care, hospice, medicines and other care costs that someone choosing an assisted death would not need.",
      "By the time the system has been running for ten years, savings could range from \u00a35.84m to \u00a359.6m.",
      "But there will be costs too. Staffing an assisted dying service could cost in excess of \u00a310m a year within a decade. And training costs in the first six months alone could be over \u00a311m.",
      "One assisted death would likely involve six health and care professionals working 32 hours.",
      "It said this could take staff away from existing services, but the overall impact of this was uncertain.",
      "And each panel that would review cases, comprising of a lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker, could cost \u00a32,000 a day.",
      "Overall, it said it was not possible to calculate whether the costs outweighed the savings or vice versa as there were too many uncertainties.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said the government was neutral on the issue. It said the document had been produce to help ensure any legislation that passes through parliament is \"workable, effective and enforceable\".",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, said she was grateful for the work that had been done on the impact assessment.",
      "She said she was still \"firmly of the view that the overall impact of this long overdue reform will be to make end of life care in England and Wales more compassionate and significantly safer\".",
      "But Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, a former Paralympian and member of the House of Lords, who opposes assisted dying, said: \"This assessment highlights how assisted dying would put disabled and other vulnerable people at grave risk by providing financial incentives to an already overburdened and under-resourced NHS to offer assisted dying as a 'treatment option'.\""

    "published": "Sat, 03 May 2025 01:19:44 GMT",
    "summary": "Why is the number of autism diagnoses changing? And what does it mean for autistic people?",
    "story": [
      "You might have seen the social media videos: the \"five signs you're autistic\". You may have heard about long waiting lists for autism diagnosis. You might know, or sense, that the numbers of people deemed autistic are going up, fast.",
      "There's a lot at stake. These numbers mean fiercely different things to different people. To some, autism is a fear (what if this happens to my child?); to others it's an identity, maybe even a superpower.",
      "So what's the truth about the number of autistic people - and what does it mean?",
      "To count something, you first need to say what it is you're counting.",
      "For someone to be diagnosed with autism, they need to have \"persistent difficulties in social life and in social communication,\" says Ginny Russell, an associate professor in psychiatry at University College London (UCL) and the author of The Rise of Autism. She's using the criteria for autism from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, known as the DSM.",
      "She says examples of this behaviour can range from a lack of turn-taking in conversation to being completely non-verbal.",
      "Restricted interests and repetitive behaviours are part of a second group of traits required to meet the criteria, she says. So things like \"hand flapping or rocking or skin picking, but also sticking to repeated routines, like eating the same food every day.\"",
      "The data",
      "But what evidence is there that the number of people meeting those criteria has risen?",
      "Ms Russell led a study that looked at changes in rates of autism diagnosis in the UK over 20 years. It drew on a big sample of data from about nine million patients who were registered at GP surgeries.",
      "They found eight times as many new autism diagnoses in 2018 as in 1998. \"It was an enormous increase,\" she says, \"best described as exponential.\"",
      "And it's not just happening in the UK. Though data is lacking in much of the world, Ms Russell says that \"in the Anglophone and European countries where we do have data, there is compelling evidence to suggest that other countries have seen a similar sort of rise in diagnosis as in the UK\".",
      "But - and this is a crucial point - a rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism is not the same thing as a rise in the number of people who are autistic.",
      "Ms Russell's study and others like it show there has been a huge rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism, so in that sense there is more autism around than there used to be. But could that rise in diagnosis be explained by changes to who we count as autistic rather than an increase in the number of autistic people?",
      "Why are diagnoses rising?",
      "The definition of autism has not been static. The first studies to describe autism appeared in the 1930s and 1940s, says Francesca Happ\u00e9, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at King's College London, who's been researching autism since 1988.",
      "\"The original descriptions of autism are of children who have pretty high support needs, typically are very late to talk,\" she says. \"Some don't talk at all. And the focus really was on children, of course, and largely on males.\"",
      "But the definition was broadened, Professor Happ\u00e9 says, when in the 1990s Asperger's syndrome was added to diagnostic manuals. People with Asperger's were seen as on the autistic spectrum because of social difficulties and repetitive behaviour, but had fluent language and good intelligence, she says.",
      "The eightfold increase in new diagnoses that Ginny Russell found included Asperger's syndrome, which was seen as a particular type of autism.",
      "Another subset of autism added to the manuals was a \"safety net diagnosis\" called \"pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified\" (PDD-NOS) and that increased the numbers too.",
      "Today, diagnostic manuals refer simply to autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, which includes people previously diagnosed with Asperger's or PDD-NOS.",
      "The autism net has been cast wider.",
      "Autism in women and girls",
      "One group of people now falling under this net more often is women and girls.",
      "Studies looking at the huge rise in autism diagnoses show that the rise has been considerably faster for females than for males.",
      "It's something Sarah Hendrickx has seen in her job as part of a team that diagnoses autism.",
      "\"I've been doing this maybe 15, 20 years or so,\" she says. \"In the early days, they were virtually all males that were coming forward for diagnosis. And now they're nearly all females who I see.\"",
      "Ms Hendrickx was herself diagnosed with autism as an adult and is also the author of a book called Women and Girls on the Autism Spectrum.",
      "She says the big growth in the number of people diagnosed with autism is because we're\u202f\"playing catch-up for decades and decades of people like myself\".",
      "Because autism was originally seen as something that affected mainly boys, she says autistic girls would instead be diagnosed with mental health conditions like social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD).",
      "Now we have a better understanding of how autism can present in girls and women, thanks to an increase in research and books like Ms Hendrickx's, which was first published in 2014.",
      "She says that one important gender difference is that girls may be better at masking, which means hiding their autistic traits so that they fit in socially, perhaps by copying others' behaviour.",
      "More adults diagnosed",
      "The rise in diagnosis has also been much faster among adults than children. Ms Hendrickx says this shows another way the autism net has been cast wider: it now includes more people with lower support needs.",
      "\"We are talking, I think, more about individuals with no intellectual disability,\" she says. \"I think people with delays in their development, in their speech, are much more likely to have been diagnosed much, much earlier because the signs were much clearer at a very young age.\"",
      "There's data to back this up. One study shows that between 2000 and 2018, new autism diagnoses of those with intellectual disability rose about 20%, while autism diagnoses in those without intellectual disability rose 700%. Autism's centre of gravity has shifted.",
      "For Ellie Middleton, an autistic and ADHD content creator and author, that's a good thing.",
      "The 27-year-old says that sceptics questioning the increase in diagnoses should instead be asking: \"how did all of these people spend so much of their life undiagnosed, unsupported and let down?\"",
      "She says she became very mentally unwell before being diagnosed with autism. \"I was on the maximum dose of antidepressants that any fully grown adult could be on at the age of 17,\" she says. \"I couldn't be left alone, I couldn't go out.\"",
      "Her autism diagnosis three years ago helped her to change the way she lives her life and to keep her mental health in a better place.",
      "But others worry that the version of autism people now see in the media and in their social media feeds is distorting public perceptions.",
      "A focus on celebrities can \"glamorise\" autism, says Venessa Swaby, who is also autistic and runs support groups for autistic children and their parents through her organisation A2ndvoice. Meanwhile, she says, families with non-speaking autistic children feel they are \"written off\".",
      "As the number of people diagnosed with autism has risen, so then has the diversity of autistic people, which, in turn, has brought tensions over who owns the word - and what it means.",
      "Environmental causes",
      "There's also been a looping effect: as more people are diagnosed with autism, more people become aware of it and that fuels the rise in numbers further.",
      "The internet and social media have played a big part in that - as well as speculation about the reasons behind the rapid rise in diagnoses.",
      "Disproven theories linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination to autism linger. Others say there must be something in what we eat, drink, or breathe that's causing more autism.",
      "But, as we've seen, the data suggest the rise in diagnoses can be explained by a broadening autism definition rather than an increase in the amount of underlying autism. And there's solid research showing that autism is largely a product of the genes you inherit from your parents.",
      "Is there any evidence that environmental causes could be playing some part in the rise, even if a small one?",
      "Ginny Russell looked at research into different potential environmental factors and found only a few that were plausible to explain some of the rise.",
      "\"There is definitely a quite well established link between autism and the age of the parent,\" she says. \"If the parent is older you're more likely to have an autistic child, but it's not a huge effect.\"",
      "She also says that there's some evidence around \"preterm birth and infection during pregnancy and also some birth complications\".",
      "But Ms Russell says it's important to put those possible factors into perspective.",
      "\"I honestly believe that the vast majority of the increase is due to what I would call a diagnostic culture,\" she says. \"Our conception of the condition has changed, and that's meant that there's been an increase.\"",

      "Following the publication of an interim report, in March 2021, NHS England said it would increase spending on maternity care by \u00a395m a year.",
      "At the time, it said the money would be used to hire as many as 1,000 midwives and around 80 consultant obstetricians.",

      "The treatment and inflammation led to Ellie developing a cataract that had to be surgically removed, just after she graduated from medical school.",
      "Ellie says she eventually reached \"breaking point\", and even began considering having her affected eye removed.",
      "\"Whilst losing sight in one eye is terrifying,\" she says, \"my biggest fear was that it might spread to my left eye.\"",
      "It was one of Ellie's doctors at Southmead Hospital in Bristol who suggested metagenomics - a last resort test not generally available to patients and only used where standard diagnostic tools have failed to identify or rule out infection.",
      "Metagenomics technology uses cutting-edge genomic sequencing, which can identify all bacteria, fungi or parasites present in a sample by comparing them against a database of millions of pathogens.",
      "A team at Moorfields Eye Hospital arranged for a sample of fluid to be taken from inside Ellie's eye and sent to the metagenomics labs at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) - the only lab in the UK officially recognised to carry out these diagnostic tests for patients, and one of only a few in the world.",
      "Currently, the standard method for detecting bacterial infections is by trying to grow a sample of it in a Petri dish.",
      "For viruses, the most common diagnostic tool is a PCR test. These will be familiar to many from the pandemic, when millions sent off swabs in the post to confirm whether they had Covid.",
      "However, Dr Julianne Brown, principal clinical scientist at the GOSH metagenomics service, says PCR has some drawbacks.",
      "\"The trouble with PCR is that you have to think of the viruses that might be causing an infection and do a separate test for each and every one,\" she says. \"So if you've got an infection with something that's unexpected, rare or not previously known, you won't find it.\"",
      "Dr Brown says metagenomics is \"an enormous step up - it's a complete game-changer\".",
      "In Ellie's case, metagenomics diagnosed a rare strain of the bacterial infection leptospirosis found in South America.",
      "It is now presumed Ellie picked up the bug swimming in the Amazon river in 2018, while on a trip to Ecuador and Colombia.",
      "Ellie says it was an emotional moment when she was given the results of the test.",
      "\"I broke down - I just had to cry. I never imagined that it would come back positive and be for something that was treatable,\" she says.",
      "\"I was given three weeks of antibiotics and within days my vision was clearer and the inflammation subsided.\"",
      "A single metagenomics test costs around \u00a31,300, which is far more than standard diagnostics. However, as the technology is developed that price is likely to fall rapidly.",
      "Virologist Professor Judy Breuer, who has been developing metagenomics at GOSH and University College London (UCL) for more than a decade, says her team currently receives three or four samples a week from hospitals around the UK for metagenomic testing in addition to those it carries out on its own patients.",
      "These are often samples from parts of the body that are normally sterile sites, where bacteria are not usually found such as the brain, central nervous system, liver and eye.",
      "\"In the future, we think metagenomics will become a first line test and be able to diagnose infection in any sample, probably within the same day,\" she says.",
      "It's also likely to become faster, cheaper and easier to do, explains Dr Brown, meaning it will become available to more patients rather than just a small number who are severely unwell.",
      "Resolving her eye problems has allowed Ellie to concentrate on her training as a GP and arrange her wedding.",
      "Ellie was married in Newcastle on 29 March, the same day the city celebrated   Newcastle United's win in the Carabao Cup.",
      "She says: \"We got a shout-out from Ant and Dec and went up on a scissor lift above the Newcastle United fans, which was incredible.\"",
      "Prof Breuer says she is thrilled with how the treatment is changing lives.",

    "story": [
      "A proposed trial to install a waste needle bin in Belfast city centre is not a \"silver bullet\" but one step to dealing with drugs issues in the city, a councillor has said.",
      "Brian Smyth was speaking ahead of a Belfast City Council vote on Thursday in favour of installing the bin in the council-owned car park on Little Donegall Street.",
      "Councillors chose the car park over a site on Corporation Square at the People and Communities Committee last month.",
      "Green Party representative Smyth said the council was lifting between 600 and 700 needles a month in the city centre, with other organisations also involved in the collection of needles.",
      "A council report stated there had been an increase in needle finds in recent months and it had been \"highlighted as being in the top six locations\" for discarded needles.",
      "The proposed metal needle bin will be concreted to the ground and will provide a secure way of disposing of sharps.",
      "Smyth had previously tabled motions for similar bins to be placed in Writer's Square, however this is not council land.",
      "He said the Department for Communities (DfC) had turned down this call.",
      "\"They are worried about image but I would say if needles continue to be found in the area of high significance, then that's going to provide an image problem,\" he said.",
      "A DfC spokesperson said it recognised that drug abuse and associated anti-social behaviour in the city centre was a major issue and was working closely with other organisations, including the council, to tackle the problems.",
      "Needles found in rubbish",
      "Smyth said members of the council's cleansing team had found needles disposed in regular rubbish bins.",
      "\"This poses a risk not only to them but also to members of the public,\" he said.",
      "\"Whilst this is a very small response, I think we need to get our heads around the bigger issue of rising drug use in and around Belfast city centre and how we tackle it.\"",
      "In March 2023, Belfast City councillors passed a motion in favour of setting up a safe injecting facility to help prevent overdoses among drug users.",
      "The council has no legal power to open a facility and a change in legislation would be required for this to happen.",
      "The aim would be to reduce overdoses and drug-related harm as well as making drug use less visible to the community.",
      "Smyth said such a facility could make the area safe for \"people who live, work and socialise in the city centre\".",
      "Damian McNairney, a volunteer and trustee from The People's Kitchen in Belfast, said the bin would help but described Belfast city centre as being in a drug crisis.",
      "The kitchen offers support to vulnerable and homeless people.",
      "\"We need to be more adventurous, we need to be more compassionate in our approach to the issue,\" said Mr McNairney.",
      "\"Addicts are being demonised, we need to look and see if we can help.",
      "\"If we solve the problem at source, i.e. the addiction, then we are going to be able to deal with the drug paraphernalia and the other issues allied to that.\"",
      "Mr McNairney said there were other areas with \"more prominent use\" but getting needles off the street was always a positive.",
      "\"There are needles around the town anyway. By not putting the bins up they're not going to go away,\" he said.",
      "Mr McNairney said he had visited a safe injection site which opened in Dublin in 2024 and he was in favour of a similar facility in Belfast.",
      "\"It seems to be very encouraging in terms of people using it, there's drug paraphernalia that has been taken off the streets, it's being safely disposed of and people with addictions are being signposted to other services,\" he said.",
      "In March, Justice Minister Naomi Long told BBC News NI that the \"war on drugs had not been won\" and there needed to be a rethink of how illegal drugs were dealt with in Northern Ireland.",
      "Martina Connolly, CEO of Belfast One Business Improvement District (BID), said she believed it was a \"step in the right direction\".",
      "\"The presence of discarded needles is a serious concern for businesses, residents, and visitors alike, and we recognise the urgent need for practical measures,\" she said.",
      "\"We acknowledge that this is a complex challenge, rooted in broader issues of mental health and addiction, which require a compassionate and multi-agency response.\"",
      "Ms Connolly added: \"We remain committed to doing everything we can, in collaboration with our partners, to make Belfast city centre a safe, clean, and vibrant place for everyone.\"",
      "What are needle bins?",
      "A sharps disposal \u2013 or needle \u2013 bin is a type of container that is specially designed for the safe disposal of sharp medical waste, such as needles and syringes.",
      "After a needle has been used, it can carry bodily fluids, such as blood, which could pass an infection on to other people.",
      "Proper disposal is important for public safety, disease prevention, and environmental protection, according to the NHS.",
      "In a report Belfast City Council said: \"Monitoring and disposing of any discarded sharps will be managed within the existing budgets of operational teams involved in needle disposal.\"",
      "\"Outreach teams working in the city centre will also be asked to support the pilot in a monitoring and reporting role.\"",

      "Her father Glen Sebastian described her as a \"typical little princess\" and said they would enjoy visiting places like the West End and art galleries.",
      "\"She would blow me away with her paintings and she certainly had a gift,\" he said.",

      "She had physical health issues including bowel problems and a curvature of the spine.",
      "The teen was also diagnosed with epilepsy which affected her confidence socially.",
      "The coroner was told she first struggled with anxiety aged 12 and had several admissions to mental health units when she was 15 after being bullied.",
      "She managed to abscond from the unit on previous occasions.",
      "Both Mr and Mrs Sebastian, who are now separated, said they had suffered with post traumatic stress disorder since her death.",

      "\"It's good that the minister has accepted the findings of the public health report into women's health.",
      "\"I will be watching and prompting the minister to develop his understanding of women's health issues, and to develop his policies and legislation in this area and to continue to give this area the focus and support that it deserves.",

      "'Budget oversubscribed'",
      "Speaking after the meeting, Binet defended the decision to get rid of the women's health strategy \u2013 a strongly criticised move.",
      "He said: \"We are oversubscribed last year on our budget and we were oversubscribed this year, and it's not because of a lack of discipline, there is a lot of savings going on, the cost of health requirements are going up exponentially, way above the cost of living.\"",
      "The minister told the scrutiny panel that he would need in \"excess of \u00a3100m in five years to improve preventative care including women's health, and I want that as additional money. I don't care where that money comes from, even if it's the strategic reserve.\"",
      "Doublet said she was concerned by those remarks.",
      "She said: \"It is concerning that the strategic reserve fund might be used for health funding, and that's something the panel will be discussing and we will be questioning the minister further on that.\"",

      "The patchwork of different election results across England has been truly fascinating, throwing up all sorts of lessons.",
      "Here are seven things we have learnt from the contests:",
      "These are really bad results for the Labour Party",
      "Sometimes in politics what is most obvious is most important. These are a bad set of results for the Labour Party at their first electoral test since being swept to office ten months ago in a landslide of epic proportions.",
      "\"We did it!\" the prime minister told his jubilant supporters back then as seat after seat fell to Labour, adding: \"It feels good, I have to be honest.\"",
      "That's not so much the vibe these days.",
      "Leaving the eight-hour count after the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, Labour campaigners were utterly dejected, not least at having lost by only six votes, the closest result in any by-election ever.",
      "Yet even if they had won by six votes, the trend would have been the same -  a governing party which has burnt through goodwill at an unimaginable pace.",
      "It's possible to overstate how dramatic the contrast with the 2024 general election is, though.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer's victory was broad but shallow, his 411 seats procured on just over a third of the vote. Perhaps it's not surprising that the so-called loveless landslide has been followed by a rude awakening.",
      "Labour's debate on what to do next is just beginning",
      "\"On every door it was the same story - winter fuel and Pip.\"",
      "That's what a Labour campaigner in Runcorn told me, referring to the early decision this government made to means-test the winter fuel allowance and the more recent announcement that eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment will be tightened.",
      "Speaking to Labour MPs from different wings of the party over the course of the day, it's been surprising how many have pretty much stuck to that same theme. For almost all of them, the original sin of this government was the decision on winter fuel.",
      "There are nuances within that position. Some believe the cut could have been communicated better, making the case that some pensioners were receiving the benefit who simply didn't need it. Others think it was never worth the political risk for the amount of money it would raise.",
      "To stress, it is not just the left of the Labour Party, comprised of a handful of MPs willing to criticise Starmer publicly, who are saying this. I had a conversation with an MP on the right of the party who believes the situation is so dire, the damage so fundamental, that Rachel Reeves should simply reverse the cut.",
      "That is extremely unlikely. But it is where the debate may be headed when MPs return to the Commons and compare notes next week.",
      "And of course a crucial part of that debate is the parlous economic situation inherited by the government which, those around the prime minister insist, necessitated unpleasant decisions which were always bound to be unpopular. If it had not been winter fuel, it would have been something else \u2013 the argument goes.",
      "The consolation of sorts for Labour is that fixing their political predicament is in their hands. They are the government and the levers of power are at their command. The next general election is up to four years away. All in Labour agree that people need to be made to feel better off - and they hope that if that can be achieved, the political challenges melt away.",
      "For the Conservatives, things are somehow getting worse",
      "Turns out the only way wasn't up. The Conservatives were reduced to their fewest MPs ever last July. That annihilation is now being visited on their local politicians.",
      "Kemi Badenoch took charge of a crushed Conservative Party and has only had six months to begin trying to turn things round. Still, I am yet to meet a Conservative who will sincerely argue that she has made a good start.",
      "I have, though, lost count of Conservative MPs and advisers who say to me that, in a funny way, they need Labour to be doing better. The Conservatives are still tarnished in many voters' eyes by their governing record, meaning that the receptacle for voters' immediate frustration with Labour, in Runcorn and elsewhere, is Reform UK.",
      "But it's more than just a story about the government's woes, as longstanding Conservative strongholds such as Staffordshire and Lincolnshire falling to Reform show. Some of the results simply need to be stated to see how startling they are.",
      "Conservatives had run Staffordshire County Council since 2009. They had 56 of the 62 councillors on Thursday morning. Now they have only 10.",
      "The Lib Dems have taken dozens of seats from the Tories. They have pushed the party into third place in this set of elections. Leader Sir Ed Davey is claiming to have seized the title of the party of \"Middle England\".",
      "There does not seem to be any appetite at all in the Conservative Party to even begin a conversation about changing leader yet again. Robert Jenrick throwing his support behind the woman who beat him to the leadership was a significant moment.",

      "Yes, under Farage's leadership Ukip won the European elections in 2014 and the Brexit Party did the same in 2019.",
      "Their success in five constituencies at the general election - including Farage himself finally making it into parliament at the eighth attempt - suggested Reform UK was something different to his previous incarnations. That is surely now proven beyond all reasonable doubt.",
      "Reform has now won control of ten councils, and with victory comes responsibility.",
      "When Ukip ran up victories in the European elections, its mandate was to scrutinise the Brussels institutions its voters loathed.",
      "Now its mandate is to make its own voters' lives better. That is a different task. The traditional main parties will be hoping that following responsibility comes accountability, and that if Reform councils and mayors fail, the party's brand will suffer.",

It may be time to get used to elections in this country - parliamentary, mayoral, council - being won on low shares of the vote by very fine margins. Under our First Past The Post system (where the winner is simply the person with the most votes), if you have lots of parties with relatively even support, things can get really unpredictable.",
      "Yet if there's another lesson of British politics in recent years it's that politics is volatile. The death of the two-party system has been pronounced before. At the 2010 general election, Labour and the Conservatives only got 65% of the vote combined. By 2017 that figure was back up to 82%. In 2024 it was back to 57%. Things can change fast in politics - they have done, again and again.",
      "As politics begins to move at social media speed, who's to say Reform cannot fall away as fast as they rose?",

      "It said initially the numbers coming forward would be low, but are expected to grow over time.",
      "The impact assessment says that the total number of assisted deaths is estimated to range from between 164 and 787 in the first (half) year of the service to between 1,042 and 4,559 in year 10, and assuming a start date to the policy of October 2029.",
      "The upper estimate  of just over 4,500 assisted deaths would still only represent less than 1% of all deaths, the document said.",
      "The impact assessment also provides a financial analysis of the costs and savings involved \u2013 it is not a document that gets into the ethical or philosophical arguments for and against the policy.",
      "It comes as the bill returns to the House of Commons later this month, with a crucial vote that will determine whether the bill becomes law expected to happen in mid June.",
      "Costs and savings",
      "In the first six months, savings for the NHS could range from around \u00a3919,000 to \u00a310.3m.",
      "This figure includes hospital care, primary and community care, hospice, medicines and other care costs that someone choosing an assisted death would not need.",
      "By the time the system has been running for ten years, savings could range from \u00a35.84m to \u00a359.6m.",
      "But there will be costs too. Staffing an assisted dying service could cost in excess of \u00a310m a year within a decade. And training costs in the first six months alone could be over \u00a311m.",
      "One assisted death would likely involve six health and care professionals working 32 hours.",
      "It said this could take staff away from existing services, but the overall impact of this was uncertain.",
      "And each panel that would review cases, comprising of a lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker, could cost \u00a32,000 a day.",
      "Overall, it said it was not possible to calculate whether the costs outweighed the savings or vice versa as there were too many uncertainties.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said the government was neutral on the issue. It said the document had been produce to help ensure any legislation that passes through parliament is \"workable, effective and enforceable\".",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, said she was grateful for the work that had been done on the impact assessment.",
      "She said she was still \"firmly of the view that the overall impact of this long overdue reform will be to make end of life care in England and Wales more compassionate and significantly safer\".",
      "But Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, a former Paralympian and member of the House of Lords, who opposes assisted dying, said: \"This assessment highlights how assisted dying would put disabled and other vulnerable people at grave risk by providing financial incentives to an already overburdened and under-resourced NHS to offer assisted dying as a 'treatment option'.\""

      "Campaigners claiming the result was \"on a knife-edge\" were proven correct when the first count put Nigel Farage's party ahead by just four votes and Labour requested a recount just before 0400 BST.",
      "The final result, from a46.2% turnout, beats the previous post-war record for the closest by-election, which the Liberals won by 57 votes in Berwick-upon-Tweed in 1973.",
      "Farage, who appeared at the count shortly before the result was declared, said his party takes on the responsibility that comes with winning elections \"with glee\".",
      "\"We can see that support for the Labour Party has collapsed within 10 months of them winning the general election,\" the Reform leader said.",
      "\"I think we've supplanted the Conservative Party now as the main opposition party in government.\"",
      "He added: \"The message that we're getting in places where we didn't win, was that if you vote Conservative you actually get Labour.\"",

      "Labour has committed itself to an extra deadline: reaching clean power by 2030.",
      "The Greens and Liberal Democrats want to hit net zero faster, the Conservatives are slamming the brakes on their policy and, for the first time, there is now a mainstream party, Reform UK, openly questioning the need to reach net zero at all.",

      "Thousands of people had joined Extinction Rebellion marches and the then-teenage activist Greta Thunberg was so influential she was invited to address MPs in Parliament.",
      "Luke Tryl, pollster for More in Common, says he has not found a significant drop in concern about climate change or support for net zero, even if we're not seeing people on the streets.",
      "What has changed, he says, is the conversation around it which, after the rising cost of living and the war in Ukraine, has switched to \"how does this reflect on people's pockets and does it make people think the country is safer as a result?\"",
      "He also says the debate has become \"more polarised between left and right\" with Labour and Lib Dem voters seeing it as a \"top three\" issue, while Reform voters are more opposed to net zero but less motivated by it: only one in 10 people vote Nigel Farage's party because of net zero, Tryl's research suggests.",
      "He also says that politicians are more divided than everyone else.",
      "\"The fracturing of the consensus has been far more profound at what we'd call 'elite level' rather than at public level,\" he says.",
      "Undoubtedly, part of the rise in the conversation about climate targets has been driven by the rise of Reform, which has made what it calls \"net stupid zero\" one of its major campaign issues.",
      "Deputy leader Richard Tice says his party - which has just won a by-election and made major gains in local elections - has forced the issue onto the political agenda.",
      "\"On the doors, people are talking about immigration but the next thing they talk about is the price of everything, the bills, the cost of living. When you drill into it, the message is getting across that the increase in the cost of living is significantly due to the increase in energy costs.",

      "\"Of course it has to be done in a way that brings people with us and there is a risk that there's too much onus put on individuals so when it comes to things like public transport, for instance....the greener option needs to be the cheaper option.\"",
      "There are also those that think the UK is starting to import the more partisan politics on the issue from the US.",
      "Pippa Heylings, the Liberal Democrats' net zero spokesperson, says she thinks part of the pushback is being driven by \"big oil and gas\" who, she says, have been \"emboldened by Donald Trump\".",

      "Her party's policy is currently to reach net zero by 2045 although she says they are looking at it to make sure it is still \"do-able\" after the previous Conservative administration shifted the government's timeline.",
      "The most marked political shift has come from the Conservatives, who have moved from setting the 2050 target, enthusiastically embracing green goals set by Boris Johnson, to a slowing of some targets under Rishi Sunak and, finally, abandoning 2050 under Kemi Badenoch.",
      "She has described the 2050 plans as \"impossible\" and said that what Keir Starmer needed to do was to \"scrap what [Energy Secretary] Ed Miliband is planning which is actually going to bankrupt the country\".",
      "\"It's not workable. Conservatives are working on new plans so that we can tackle climate change and look after our environment, without bankrupting the UK.\"",
      "Green-minded Tories have said they thought the decision to ditch the target was premature but they hope their party will recommit to decarbonisation.",
      "Sam Hall, the director of the Conservative Environment Network, said: \"On the centre-right there have been growing concerns around the cost of the transition and the shift to a more statist, interventionist approach to decarbonising.\"",
      "He says he wants to see a more \"market-led\" solution.",
      "While much of the Labour Party does seem to be on board with the leadership's position, there are some in the broader Labour movement who have issued warning shots that suggest their support for net zero is conditional.",
      "Some trade unions have become increasingly vocal about the need to ensure that there is a plan to protect jobs in any transition to green energy.",
      "As the union Unite put it: \"If they fail to do this, then Labour cannot expect workers to support their net zero plan.\"",
      "While the net zero by 2050 target is currently set in law, Labour's \"clean power by 2030\" push is self-imposed, leading to regular rumours that it could be watered down.",
      "Government sources are adamant the party is committed to it, and they point to investments that have already been made.",

      "A bill has long been promised to improve protections for women and girls, but ministers now say there is not enough time to draw up a law which reflects the recent Supreme Court judgement on the definition of a woman.",
      "They are instead going to amend existing hate crime legislation to provide protections on the basis of sex.",
      "The government has also confirmed it will not be bringing forward legislation to end conversion therapy this term, and is hoping for a UK-wide solution.",
      "A new misogyny law was promised after an expert group in 2022 backed separate legislation rather than incorporating abuse and violence against women into Scotland's hate crime law.",
      "The group, led by Baroness Helena Kennedy KC, said this was a better option because women are not a minority, and a \"more fundamental set of responses\" were required to address the \"deeply rooted\" problem.",
      "The Scottish government proposed creating five new offences in its Misogyny Bill including stirring up hatred against women and misogynistic harassment.",
      "Misogyny would also be treated as an aggravating factor in crimes, which could lead to tougher sentencing.",
      "QC shocked by level of misogyny in Scotland",
      "Why are women not protected by new hate crime law?",
      "The Scottish government said it remained committed to ensuring people are protected from misogynistic abuse but it was a \"complex area of policy and law\" which required more time to work out where it would apply.",
      "This would include assessing the implications of the recent Supreme Court judgement that a woman is defined by biological sex for the purposes of equality legislation, it said.",
      "It said there was insufficient time to proceed with the bill in this parliamentary session, but in September it would add the protected characteristic of sex to Scotland's hate crime act.",
      "First Minister John Swinney said: \"We have to navigate a way through all of the issues that come out of the Supreme Court judgement.",
      "\"What action we can take is action we can take during this parliamentary term to tackle misogyny and that's what the government will do\".",
      "Conversion therapy",
      "The Scottish government said it was also dropping plans for a new law banning conversion therapy for sexual orientation or gender identity.",
      "Both pieces of legislation were part of the Bute House Agreement with the Scottish Greens which ended in April last year.",
      "Ministers previously said Scotland wanted to lead the way in outlawing such practices - but it has now urged the Labour government at Westminster to legislate on the issue.",
      "Equalities Minister Kaukab Stewart said if an approach covering Scotland, England and Wales could not be agreed, the Scottish government would introduce its own law within a year if it remained in power after next year's Holyrood election.",
      "A joint statement from Scottish LGBTQIA+ organisations said they were \"incredibly disappointed\" to see an end to conversion practices would not proceed - and that the community had felt rights were being \"rolled back and reduced\" for a long time.",
      "The statement said: \"Simply put, the longer it takes to legislate to end conversion practices the more harm will be done, including to those most vulnerable.",
      "\"The failure to progress this bill is yet another blow to our community's faith in government and the institutions that are meant to represent and protect us.\"",
      "Publishing this news in a written question on a Friday morning after elections down south is a classic attempt from the Scottish government to bury some bad news.",
      "In fairness, it is true to say that drawing up complicated legislation before the ink is even dry on a relevant Supreme Court's ruling would be a challenge in the remaining year of the Holyrood term.",
      "But a bill can pass in a matter of days if the political will is there.",
      "And women's groups are already deeply suspicious of the government, given it has spent the last few years engaged in court battle with campaigners about fundamental definitions.",
      "Ministers will point to the move to beef up hate crime law as evidence they are taking action on behalf of women and girls - despite the fact they were originally omitted from that bill with the promise of bespoke legislation.",
      "The point of this move is to get some awkward issues out of the way before John Swinney makes his programme for government speech next week about what he is  planning on doing for the rest of the Holyrood term.",
      "But for all he is keen to get away from spiky debates around gender politics - and you can read the shelving of the conversion therapy ban as part of that too - he is still going to face plenty of questions about this.",
      "Scottish Conservative deputy leader Rachael Hamilton MSP said the misogyny bill was the latest in a \"litany of paused, ditched or botched\" policies from Nicola Sturgeon's time as first minister.",
      "She said: \"Misogyny remains a serious problem and it's crucial that women and girls are protected from all forms of threatening and abusive behaviour in a way that safeguards their rights.\"",
      "Scottish Liberal Democrat equalities spokesperson Christine Jardine MP said: \"This is the wrong thing to do.",
      "\"The proposed legislation was a chance to substantially improve protections, help change culture and behaviours and move us closer to eradicating misogyny.\"",
      "'Screeching U-turn'",
      "Scottish Labour justice spokesperson Pauline McNeill said \"This is a shameful broken promise to Scottish women at a time when misogynistic hatred is on the rise.",
      "\"The SNP has spent years kicking this issue into the long grass by insisting this approach wouldn't work, only to perform a screeching U-turn.",
      "The Scottish Greens said dropping the two bills was a \"shameful backward step\".",
      "The party's equalities spokesperson Maggie Chapman said: \"The misogyny bill was a vital step in ensuring that reports of harassment and assault are taken seriously.",
      "\"LGBTQIA+ people are put at serious risk by cruel, harmful conversion practices that are currently flying under the radar. So-called conversion 'therapies' are deeply immoral and leave lasting damage for survivors.\""

      "At the time, it said the money would be used to hire as many as 1,000 midwives and around 80 consultant obstetricians.",
      "Some of the money was also to be spent on allowing consultants and midwives to train together - a key recommendation of the initial report, by senior midwife Donna Ockenden - as well as allocating money for the NHS to recruit from overseas.",

      "If the ICBs decide to spend the money they've been allocated on maternity care, there won't be a funding cut.",

      "His comments have been seized on by opposition parties as an attack on Sir Keir Starmer's plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2050.",
      "Asked about the comments at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said: \"If you look at the detail of what Tony Blair said he's absolutely aligned with what we're doing here.\"",

They argued, for example, it is impossible for services - from police officers performing a strip search through to restaurants - to truly specify someone's biology, pointing to intersex cases as an example of where biological sex is not binary.",
      "The Supreme Court ruling was the culmination of a long-running legal battle brought by campaign group For Women Scotland, which had argued that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female. The group had argued that women felt unsafe with trans women using female facilities.",

      "She said the judges have \"done their job and I think they've sought to do it in a way that recognises that we're talking about a balance of rights but sought to give confidence to a minority community that they still have protections from discrimination\".",
      "In her evidence, to the Human Rights Joint Committee, the justice secretary also addressed the government's policy on transgender prisoners.",
      "Mahmood said it \"strikes the right balance\" but \"we will obviously now go back and with the clarity from the Supreme Court just make sure that that policy still stands to scrutiny or whether we need to make any changes\".",
      "The justice secretary said the vast majority of trans women inmates are within the male estate, and she had not moved any trans prisoners into women's jails since taking office last July.",
      "Prison service data for 2023-24 shows there were 295 transgender prisoners in England and Wales, with 51 in female prisons and 244 in male prisons.",
      "But she said: \"No trans women convicted of a rape or serious violence offence who retains birth genitalia would ever be considered for being placed in the women's estate.\"",

      "Kemi Badenoch has accused the government of breaking its promise to set up five local inquiries into grooming gangs despite pledging to do so.",
      "The Conservative leader said Sir Keir Starmer had promised \u00a35m to fund five locally-led investigations into grooming gangs but delivered just one, in Oldham.",
      "During Prime Ministers Questions, Badenoch suggested Sir Keir was \"dragging his heels\" on inquiries to shield Labour-run councils from scandal.",
      "Sir Keir said Labour were \"investing more in delivering truth and justice\" for victims of grooming gangs than the Conservatives had during \"14 long years\" in power.",
      "Ministers have been facing growing demands to reveal which areas are running grooming gang inquires alongside the review in Oldham, and a three-month audit of national evidence being led by government troubleshooter Baroness Louise Casey.",
      "Earlier this month Tom Crowther, the barrister helping to develop the schemes, suggested local inquiries into grooming gangs had stalled since they were announced in January.",
      "Crowther, who chaired the inquiry into child sex abuse in Telford, Shropshire, gave evidence to the Commons Home Affairs Committee at the start of April and told MPs he had asked a government official \"do you still want me?\"",
      "The issue was again raised in the Commons on Monday, when Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips told MPs she expected there to be more than five local inquires.",
      "Labour was focusing on ensuring \"there is a local process of accountability that actually changes things on the ground\", Phillips told MPs.",
      "More local grooming inquiries expected - minister",
      "Local grooming gang reviews will go ahead, says Cooper",
      "During a heated PMQs exchange, Badenoch sought to tie grooming gang inquiries to the local elections, a series of councils and mayoral votes across England on Thursday.",
      "The Tory leader said voters faced a choice of \"chaos and cover-ups under Labour councils or better services under the Conservatives\".",
      "Badenoch repeatedly asked Sir Keir for an update on the local inquires. When he did not respond, she said he \"cannot name a single place because nothing is happening\".",
      "She questioned whether the prime minister was \"dragging his heels\" on local inquiries into grooming gangs because he \"doesn't want Labour cover-ups exposed\", adding that the inquiries hadn't started because \"local authorities don't want to investigate themselves\".",
      "A national inquiry was needed as local probes \"cannot force witnesses to appear\" and \"cannot force people to give evidence under oath\", Badenoch said.",
      "Sir Keir accused Badenoch of \"staying silent\" on the issue in government while he \"oversaw the first grooming gang prosecution\" as Director of Public Prosecutions.",
      "He told the Commons: \"I was the prosecutor who brought the first case.",
      "\"On the back of that I then changed the entire approach to prosecutions, which was then lauded by the government that we were doing the right thing, and brought those prosecutions.\"",
      "In contrast to the Conservatives, Labour were \"implementing existing recommendations\" of the 2022 national inquiry into child sexual abuse and \"providing for local inquiries\", he said.",
      "For more than a decade there has been a series of high-profile cases where groups of men, predominantly of Pakistani descent, were convicted of sexually abusing and raping mainly white girls in the UK.",
      "In 2022, Prof Alexis Jay published the conclusions of a seven-year national inquiry into child sexual abuse, which investigated abuse in churches and schools, as well as by grooming gangs.",
      "The Conservative have been calling for a second national inquiry into grooming gangs since the issue was thrust back into the spotlight by tech billionaire Elon Musk at the start of the year.",
      "The proposal was backed by opposition MPs, as well as some Labour figures including Rotherham MP Sarah Champion alongside Labour mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham.",
      "Speaking in the House of Lords, Labour's Baroness Hazarika offered an apology on behalf of the Muslim community for the \"sickening, despicable, wicked acts\" of child grooming gangs.",
      "She said that many people in Muslim community were as appalled as anyone else, telling peers: \"This is not who we are\", and added that many of the men were abusing Muslim women as well as white women.",
      "The Liberal Democrats have called for the the government to focus on implementing all 20 of the recommendations made by the Jay inquiry.",
      "On Monday, party spokesperson Lisa Smart said MPs \"owe it to\" victims to not just \"offer words of support, but to deliver justice and bring offenders to account\".",
      "Reform UK have backed calls for a national inquiry and have previously offered to fund their own.",
      "Party leader Nigel Farage has previously accused both Labour and Tories of \"failing to bring justice to the thousands of victims across multiple decades of these horrific crimes\".",
      "Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer said Badenoch \"appears determined to use this issue as an excuse to push her own agenda and try to make political capital\".",
      "\"A leader of a major political party who is serious about tackling sexual abuse and exploitation of girls would put the victims and their needs front and centre and offer support for action to tackle misogyny,\" she added.",

      "It applies to manufacturers and was introduced by the Conservative government in April 2018 as a means to tackle obesity.",

      "\"We are making sure we are taking practical, sensible measures to improve the health of our children,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.",
      "The original exemption for milk-based drinks was included because of concerns about calcium consumption, particularly among children.",

      "Opponents of the levy in recent years include the soft drinks industry, pubs and off licences. Some argue the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families and does little to tackle obesity.",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage told the BBC on Tuesday he was \"sick to death of a government telling us how we should live\" and said the focus should be on educating people who can then make decisions about their health.",

      "Industry body the Food and Drink Federation said it welcomed the chance to share its views in the consultation.",

      "An independent report has concluded burying electricity cables underground or out at sea is far more expensive than using overhead lines.",
      "The study by the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) comes as National Grid prepares to submit a planning application for more than 100 miles (160km) of new pylons between Norwich and Tilbury in Essex.",
      "Energy minster Michael Shanks said the report proved that \"pylons are the best option for taxpayers\".",

      "The IET concluded underground cables were, on average, around four-and-a-half times more expensive than overhead lines while cabling out at sea could be up to 11 times more expensive.",
      "It estimated a typical nine-mile (15km) long 5,000 MW overhead line would cost nearly \u00a340m to build  with the equivalent underground cable costing around \u00a3330m and as much as \u00a3820m if a new tunnel was needed.",
      "'Visual impact'",
      "However, the report also stressed the importance of considering both cost and \"non-cost factors\", such as visual and environmental impacts, pointing out that underground cables had lower visual impact than overhead lines.",

      "Rosie Pearson, from the Essex Suffolk Norfolk Pylons action group, said the report was \"half-baked\".",

      "Baroness Louise Casey's audit, which had been due to finish in mid-April, will be released \"later in May\", Phillips said.",
      "She added that she did not yet know \"what Baroness Casey will say about which particular area\" but would act on the facts.",

      "Robbie Moore, a Conservative MP for Keighley and Ilkley, accused Bradford Councils of avoiding commissioning a new inquiry for \"fear of unearthing a very significant problem\".",

      "She added that Tom Crowther KC, who led an inquiry in Telford, would help the government develop a new framework for the five local investigations that could be used as a model in other areas.",
      "However, last month Crowther expressed uncertainty about his role and told a committee of MPs that he had asked the Home Office \"do you still want me?\"",
      "On Monday, Phillips said the government was \"moving ahead\" with its commitment for the five inquiries and would focus on \"delivering meaningful, tangible change\".",
      "Karen Bradley, Conservative MP and chairwoman of the Home Affairs Committee, asked when the government would announce the locations for the local inquiries and how the minister would \"ensure that councils that are reluctant to be part of this are compelled to do so\".",
      "Phillips replied: \"Whilst we have committed to five, I expect to actually go further.\"",
      "She said the framework for inquiries would be released later in May, when Baroness Casey's review would also be published.",
      "The minister added: \"I'm going to go on the basis of facts, and I'm going to follow them wherever they tell me. Wherever they tell me there are victims that need help, that is where I will go.\""

      "The pay review body for teachers in England has recommended a pay rise of about 4% this year, while its NHS equivalent has recommended about 3%, according to figures first reported by The Times.",

      "But it is more likely that ministers say the higher pay will have to be funded by existing budgets and efficiency savings.",

      "The British Medical Association (BMA) has previously said the government's approach \"indicates a poor grasp of the unresolved issues from two years of industrial action\".",
      "Health Minster Stephen Kinnock told Sky News: \"We are all about putting more money into the pockets of working people, but we do also have to ensure that we are balancing the books, and we have got to work in terms of public sector pay within fiscal constraints.",
      "\"We will give these recommendations careful consideration.",
      "\"But I would, of course, also urge our colleagues in the trade union movement to engage constructively with us and recognise the reality of the financial position.\"",
      "Director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies Paul Johnson said the government will face \"tough\" trade-offs when considering how to award pay.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set \"very, very tight budgets\" so any pay increase risks the government being \"forced into tax rises or other spending cuts\", Johnson said.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Johnson said: \"If you're increasing pay then you can't do other things.",
      "\"You can't employ more teachers or open breakfast clubs or have more doctors and nurses.\"",
      "Public anger over pay, squeezed public services and potential strikes could play a major role in local elections this week - the government's first major test since last year's landslide general election victory.",
      "Sir Keir is spending Monday touring hospitals promoting reforms to the NHS app - which he said will haul the health service out of the \"dark ages\", saving it money and cutting waiting lists.",

      "That could be a quote from a Conservative, as the previous party of government struggles to rebuild trust with the electorate.",
      "But it isn't.",
      "It's a despairing message from a new Labour MP, elected in last year's general election landslide.",
      "Labour had a terrible night when many of the county council seats up for grabs in Thursday's English local elections were last contested in 2021.",
      "So far, today's results are even worse.",
      "Labour should have been within shouting distance of regaining control of Durham -but their vote tumbled.",
      "Before the result was announced, a former Labour MP texted to say - in colourful language \u2013 just how grim the political landscape was in the North East.",
      "And where voters were determined to oust the Conservatives in Staffordshire, they turned to Reform UK not Labour to do so.",
      "This has prompted calls for Sir Keir Starmer to change direction.",
      "The Labour Mayor of Doncaster Ros Jones - who had her majority slashed - blamed the withdrawal of winter fuel allowance from most pensioners, and urged a rethink on the forthcoming cuts to personal independence payments (Pips) fordisabled people.",
      "Labour MP Richard Burgon \u2013 a shadow minister under Sir Keir's left wing predecessor Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 agreed.",
      "He said the current party leadership needed to \"change course\" and suggested that these policies were \"driving away our own voters, and letting Reform squeeze through.\"",
      "The Labour leadership won't be quaking in its boots when attacked by the Left.",
      "But what is noteworthy is that - off the record  - some MPs from across the party are making not dissimilar points, and have been contacting the BBC (and not vice versa) to make them.",
      "One of the new intake of Labour MPs told me \"this is not a verdict on our failure to deliver.",
      "\"It is a verdict on what we have delivered. People on the doorsteps are using the word 'betrayal.'",
      "\"It's winter fuel. It's fear of Pips, it's a bit of immigration.\"",
      "\"People voted for change \u2013 voted for Labour \u2013 but the government isn't looking Labour enough, and people are asking 'what's the point?'\".",
      "Another new MP - very much not on the left of the party - described the withdrawal of winter fuel payments as \"Labour's poll tax\".",
      "And a longer-standing Labour politician said to me it was \"more to do with uninspiring leadership\".",
      "\"And it turns out that cutting disability and winter fuel payments comes at a cost \u2013 these are not Labour things to do,\" they added.",
      "Another said that fellow backbenchers tend to panic close to general election time if their party is behind in the polls but \"we are panicking in less than a year\".",
      "A defeated Labour councillor from Lancashire, Matthew Tomlinson, described himself as \"an extremely loyal Labour Party supporter\".",
      "But he told the BBC when certain policies were taken together \u2013 and he included national insurance increases for employers and the lack of compensation for some women pensioners to the welfare cuts -  \"it feels like a Labour Party that just isn't Labour enough.\"",
      "I have also had reports of difficulties in motivating activists and a dearth of Labour door-knockers in some areas.",

      "It doesn't look like the government will back down on that issue.",
      "But I have been told some potential rebels are being assured that they won't lose the party whip if they abstain \u2013 or make themselves scarce \u2013 when the vote comes.",
      "Some are calling for a bigger rethink, with more focus on social issues and less on adjusting policies to meet economic forecasts.",
      "And there are calls for Chancellor Rachel Reeves' \"fiscal rules\"-  which restrict debt levels but also constrain investment \u2013 to be loosened.",
      "The Treasury has already rejected this \u2013 arguing that it would lead to higher interest rates and therefore mortgages.",
      "The 40 MPs in Labour's Red Wall group want to see a tougher line on immigration but also more investment in \"left behind\" areas in the Midlands and North of England.",
      "That has prompted demands for the shredding of the \"Green Book\" \u2013 the Treasury bible used to assess the costs and benefits of new projects.",
      "The belief is that this document tends to emphasise the cost and downplay the benefits.",
      "Jo White from Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire, who represents a group of backbenchers from 'Red Wall' areas in England, said the voices of \"people from the outside\" hadn't been listened to.",
      "She also called for schools and hospitals to be \"lifted from the shackles of debt\" so the party could deliver on its priorities.",
      "One Red Wall MP has suggested that if the chancellor won't contemplate a \"reset\" then she should be reshuffled, \"otherwise she'll bring Starmer down with her\".",
      "The prime minister said today that he \"gets\" the message of the election results \u2013 to go forward faster with his plan for change.",
      "I haven't got any sense that this involves a further change of direction.",
      "The party has already cut overseas aid to fund an increase in defence spending.",
      "This might have been expected to appeal to Reform-minded voters,  but the election results don't tend to suggest that it has worked.",
      "An array of announcements and initiatives are on the way \u2013 an immigration white paper in a matter of weeks; a long-awaited industrial strategy; the outcome a defence review; more on workers' rights; one or more trade deals.",
      "Labour will seek to get on the front foot.",
      "But much is either outside the government's control or is difficult to control, such as a stubbornly stagnant economy and an international trade war.",
      "Ministers point to progress on a number of fronts, from rising wages to falling NHS waiting lists.",
      "Yet the election results were an expression of voters' \"first impressions\" of Labour back in power.",
      "Some of its MPs worry that it will be difficult to change the negative prism through which the government is viewed."

      "Feelings behind the scenes that UK Labour does not get the fight that the party in Wales will face at the ballot box are starting to spill over.",
      "Whether they spill over into 'clear red water' - a phrase coined at the start of the century to describe how the Welsh party differentiated itself from its Westminster colleagues - remains to be seen.",
      "The First Minister, Eluned Morgan, told the Senedd on Tuesday that she will be making a speech next week to outline her position \"more clearly\" on the UK Labour government's welfare reforms \u2013 a controversial issue in Wales, where claimant levels are high.",
      "We do not know how far she will go, or whether she will dip her toe into other areas.",
      "She has plenty to choose from, with decisions made at Westminster affecting steel, welfare, rail funding, crown estate and National Insurance all proving controversial and very current issues.",
      "If she was minded to a year to go until an election, which takes place on 7 May 2026, seems as good a time as any for the first minister to deal with Westminster decisions which she worries might cost Welsh voters and cost her votes.",
      "On Wednesday afternoon BBC Wales saw a copy of a letter the FM has sent to the business secretary in Westminster outlining her concerns about the steel industry.",
      "Eluned Morgan is calling on Jonathan Reynolds to \"ringfence\" a significant amount of a \u00a32.5bn UK government steel fund for Wales.",

      "Tata -the owners of Port Talbot \u2013 are investing in a joint venture with the UK government to build a new electric arc furnace there.",
      "The letter can be seen two ways \u2013 it makes the case for Wales' share of that funding, but also plays into what might be a narrative of the FM trying to differentiate herself from her colleagues in London, or stand up to them.",

      "The first minister herself has made a veiled objection to comments from her Labour colleague, the Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens, that she had welcomed the reforms.",
      "When Eluned Morgan took over as FM last year a couple of her colleagues suggested to me that she might need a \"row\" \u2013 concocted or otherwise - with UK Labour, to bolster her position.",
      "When she makes her speech next week, will that time have come?",
      "If Morgan does sharpen up her language and criticism of UK Labour's approach, there would still be a risk for her.",

      "Runcorn and Helsby is a new constituency that was only created in time for the general election in July 2024.",
      "More than half of it (51.2%) came from the former constituency of Weaver Vale, with 37.1% from Halton and the remainder from three other former constituencies - Ellesmere Port and Neston, Eddisbury, and City of Chester.",
      "At the 2024 general election, Amesbury won Runcorn and Helsby for Labour with 52.9% of the vote, a majority of 14,696.",

      "As the door of its crate opens, the lynx sniffs the air, checks the coast is clear and cautiously takes its first steps toward freedom in Germany's Black Forest.",
      "A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild.",
      "Animals born and raised in zoos are rarely considered for release because they either don't have the survival skills or have become too used to human interaction.",
      "But a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme led to the unusual request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo.",
      "It has been moved to Germany where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge.",
      "This week the BBC watched on as, with the help of some judicious prodding with a broom, the Newquay lynx was loaded onto a truck headed for southwestern Germany.",
      "Two days later we were in Germany as it was cajoled into a 1,200-sq-metre enclosure. John Meek from Newquay Zoo was also on hand to see the lynx gingerly stroll out into its new home.",
      "\"I'm a big boy but I had a few tears in my eyes,\" he said. \" Nowadays, zoos are not here to keep animals in cages. They're there for conservation. And this is it, conservation in action.\"",
      "Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe.",
      "Though not officially classed as a \"big cat\" Eurasian lynx can weigh up to 30 kilos and hunt deer for food.",
      "Once native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction.",
      "\"Basically I'm Tinder for the zoo-born lynx,\" says Dina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park with a smile when I speak to her on Zoom.",
      "It was her who sent out the SOS for the Newquay lynx.",
      "The lynx-breeding coordinator for the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), she matches females and males from across the continent as well as finding new homes for their offspring.",
      "\"Our nature is very fragmented, due to railways and streets and cities. And this means we created a lot of barriers for the lynx, which leads to inbreeding,\" Dina says.",
      "To combat that Dina finds captive young lynx that can be introduced into the wild to increase numbers and improve the genetic mix. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind.",
      "But last year, much to Dina's frustration, there was a particularly high number of male lynxes born. And a successful rewilding programme needs females much more  than males.",
      "So Dina reached out to Newquay Zoo to ask them if their one year old female might be available.",
      "\"Of course we said yes straight away, that's something that we'd love to do,\" says John Meek, the curator of plants and animals at Newquay Zoo.",
      "Over the next few months the lynx will be monitored to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. Catching and killing prey is not expected to be a problem.",
      "\"If you know your cats, you know that even a cat that has lived in a room its whole life, once it gets out is able to kill a bird or a mouse,\" Eva Klebelsberg who runs the lynx reintroduction programme for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg told us.",
      "We're standing over the carcass of a Roe Deer in the Black Forest just outside Karlsruhe. There is a small population of lynxes already living in the forest and this is one of their kills.",
      "There are puncture marks on its throat \u2013 a sure sign.",
      "\"Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,\" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas.",
      "The key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans. Having spent its entire life looking through bars at visitors and being fed by keepers it will need to show that it is not going to seek out more human interaction.",
      "\"Central Europe is very crowded and we don't have many places where there is enough space for larger animals.\" says Dr Marco Roller from Karlsruhe zoo, who manages the enclosure.",
      "\"We don't want human animal conflicts. So for us it's important we don't have aggressive animals or curious animals which may walk through cities or close to human settlements.\"",

    "summary": "The extent of Scotland's mosquito population is being understood thanks to a successful citizen science project.",
    "story": [
      "A Scottish summer is synonymous with the humble yet pesky midge.",
      "But Glasgow University scientists have confirmed the continued rise of its distant cousin - the mosquito.",
      "The country is now home to more than 20 different species of the biting insect, and some have been identified in Shetland - the most northern location to date.",
      "More commonly associated with tropical climes, mosquitoes are a natural part of the Scottish ecosystem.",
      "The extent of the mosquito population is being understood thanks to a successful citizen science project.",
      "Midge bite or a mosquito?",
      "University researchers had received numerous reports from the public of nuisance biting and originally suspected midges or clegs to be responsible.",
      "Further analysis showed the areas in question were swarming with mosquitoes, actively trying to bite people.",
      "Over the last 12 months more than 700 potential sightings and photos were submitted to the ongoing Mosquito Scotland project.",
      "After analysis, more than half were confirmed to be mosquitoes with 21 different species now calling Scotland home.",
      "While sightings from the public were at their peak during the summer, reports were submitted to the team in every month of last year.",
      "The insects are most often spotted in woodland areas, particularly pine forests in the east, though they are often found inland in our biggest cities. In Glasgow larvae was found floating in stagnant water such as garden plant pots and ponds.",
      "Heather Ferguson, professor of medical entomology at the University of Glasgow, described the initial response to their three-year long project as \"tremendous\".",
      "She said: 'We found them to a much greater extent than we've known before.",
      "\"In almost all parts of the country we got reports of different species. And a very exciting first for us, we found the most northernmost record for the UK when we had a member of the public in Shetland report a mosquito which we were able to confirm.\"",
      "In addition to the public sightings, the team hung traps at 24 locations across the country, luring the insects by the smell of carbon dioxide which mimics human breath.",
      "Dr Georgia Kirby leads the citizen science project and said public reporting has guided where they hang the traps, which can sometimes catch more than 1,000 mosquitoes in just two days.",
      "She said: \"There were several areas of Scotland where we received lots of reports of bites but very few photos of the culprits \u2013 understandably, as most people don't want to hold still for a photo while they're being bitten by insects.",
      "\"We had suspected that midges or clegs could be responsible, but in our follow-up investigations we invariably found that these locations were swarming with mosquitoes \u2013 proving that people in Scotland are good at recognising them and distinguishing them from more familiar insects.",
      "\"Most of these sites were areas of dense woodland, which is a key habitat for several aggressive human-biting mosquito species.\"",
      "Is malaria a risk?",
      "Mosquitoes don't currently pose a health risk to humans in Scotland. The parasite needed to spread infectious disease like malaria is not present here.",
      "However, it was a different story 200 years ago when malaria was common in the UK.",
      "It was present in the east of Scotland in particular and spread by native mosquitoes.",
      "Today, climate change is likely to mean we could see more mosquitoes in Scotland, as our climate becomes warmer and wetter - perfect conditions to allow them to thrive.",
      "Culex pipiens, the common house mosquito, has been found to carry and transmit the Usutu virus, originally discovered in the 1950s in Africa and present in Europe for the past three decades.",
      "The virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito and has affected blackbird populations.",
      "The Mosquito Scotland project will continue to help track their population and scientists say it will help provide a crucial early warning system for potential risk, as the species respond to environmental change.",
      "Professor Ferguson and Dr Kirby want to hear more from the public in 2025, to help increase their knowledge and build a picture of the biodiversity benefits of mosquitoes and any potential risks.",

      "Sandeels comprise a number of species of small fish and are caught commercially for use in animal feed and in oil production.",
      "Danish fishing organisations had argued that the North Sea ban was \"unnecessary\" and claimed sandeel stocks were plentiful, disputing the scientific evidence.",

    "story": [
      "One of the world's most endangered amphibians - the strange, perpetually smiling Mexican axolotl - has thrived after being released in artificial wetlands, scientists have discovered.",
      "In a study that provides hope for the long-term future of a creature that was pushed to the brink of extinction, scientists released 18 captive-bred axolotls in restored and artificial wetland close to Mexico City.",
      "The researchers fitted the animals with radio trackers and found that they \"survived and foraged successfully at both sites\" - even gaining weight.",
      "Lead researcher Dr Alejandra Ramos from the Autonomous University of Baja California said this was an \"amazing result\".",
      "The findings are published in the journal PLoS One and they suggest, the researchers say, that the axoltol can be brought back to its native habitat.",
      "The waters of Xochimilco - shaped by traditional farming practices and flushed with spring water from the mountains - used to teem with these amphibians.",
      "But as Mexico City grew, urbanisation, pollution and other pressures pushed  axolotls to the brink of extinction, with some estimates suggesting that there were as few as 50 left in the wild.",
      "\"If we lose this species, we lose part of our Mexican identity,\" said co-lead researcher Dr Luis Zambrano from the National University of Mexico.",
      "It is no exaggeration to call the axoltol an icon. Aztec legend has it that the creature is a god in salamander form - the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl, disguised as a salamander.",
      "\"If we can restore this [wetland] habitat and restore the axolotl's population in a city of more than 20 million people,\" Dr Zambrano continued, \"I feel that we have hope for humanity.\"",
      "To lay the foundations for releasing the animals, the researchers worked with local farmers and a team of volunteers to create wetland \"refuges\" for the axolotls. They installed natural filtering systems to clean the water,",
      "The scientists released their captive-bred animals at two sites - one in Xochimilco and one at a disused quarry that, over decades, has turned into what they called an \"artificial wetland\".",
      "Every animal was tagged with a radio tracking device.",
      "\"The amazing news is that they all survived,\" Dr Ramos told BBC News. \"And not only that, but the ones that we recaptured had gained weight - so they're hunting.\"",
      "The monitoring also revealed intriguing insights into axolotl behaviour. \"We found that some spend most of their time with one other individual -  like they make these little friendships,\" Dr Ramos explained.",
      "Somewhat ironically, these charismatic salamanders are found in the world's laboratories and pet aquariums in their hundreds of thousands. The species is biologically fascinating - it has the remarkable ability to regrow any part of its body that is damaged or lost. So there is research underway to understand whether that ability could be harnessed medically.",
      "But in the murky wetlands of Mexico City, there is still a great deal of work to do to clean up and restore the habitat, and to give the wild axolotl a chance to recover.",
      "\"Many animals are losing their habitat around the world,\" said Dr Ramos. \"And restoration projects are not easy, but they can be done -  they just need a lot of people.",
      "\"You don't need to be a scientist to get involved - everybody in the world can help out.\""

      "When the UK became the first major economy in the world to commit to reducing its carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, there was so little disagreement among MPs it was simply 'nodded through' without a vote.",
      "Six years on, the political climate is very different, the consensus at Westminster has shattered and reaching net zero is fast becoming a political dividing line.",
      "Labour has committed itself to an extra deadline: reaching clean power by 2030.",
      "The Greens and Liberal Democrats want to hit net zero faster, the Conservatives are slamming the brakes on their policy and, for the first time, there is now a mainstream party, Reform UK, openly questioning the need to reach net zero at all.",
      "Even a former Labour prime minister, Sir Tony Blair, has said that existing global approaches to tackling climate change aren't working (although it was later clarified that his institute supports the government's targets).",
      "So what's happened?",
      "Labour defends net-zero policies after Blair criticism",
      "Blair says current net zero policies 'doomed to fail'",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "In 2019, when the target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 was set, public concern about climate change was very visible.",
      "Thousands of people had joined Extinction Rebellion marches and the then-teenage activist Greta Thunberg was so influential she was invited to address MPs in Parliament.",
      "Luke Tryl, pollster for More in Common, says he has not found a significant drop in concern about climate change or support for net zero, even if we're not seeing people on the streets.",
      "What has changed, he says, is the conversation around it which, after the rising cost of living and the war in Ukraine, has switched to \"how does this reflect on people's pockets and does it make people think the country is safer as a result?\"",
      "He also says the debate has become \"more polarised between left and right\" with Labour and Lib Dem voters seeing it as a \"top three\" issue, while Reform voters are more opposed to net zero but less motivated by it: only one in 10 people vote Nigel Farage's party because of net zero, Tryl's research suggests.",
      "He also says that politicians are more divided than everyone else.",
      "\"The fracturing of the consensus has been far more profound at what we'd call 'elite level' rather than at public level,\" he says.",
      "Undoubtedly, part of the rise in the conversation about climate targets has been driven by the rise of Reform, which has made what it calls \"net stupid zero\" one of its major campaign issues.",
      "Deputy leader Richard Tice says his party - which has just won a by-election and made major gains in local elections - has forced the issue onto the political agenda.",
      "\"On the doors, people are talking about immigration but the next thing they talk about is the price of everything, the bills, the cost of living. When you drill into it, the message is getting across that the increase in the cost of living is significantly due to the increase in energy costs.",
      "\"The awareness of the stupidity of this has transformed in the last six months, because of the destruction of jobs and bills. People are waking up all over the place.\"",
      "For the Green Party of England and Wales Co-Leader, Adrian Ramsay, the fracturing of consensus is \"distressing\" and he blames party politics.",
      "\"There are parts of the political spectrum that are determined to turn this into a political football but I think reasonable people within all parties need to resist.\"",
      "He says people do need to feel they are included in climate measures and believes there is a \"sensible climate majority\" within Parliament, whose job it is to make the right policies to bring people along with them.",
      "\"Of course it has to be done in a way that brings people with us and there is a risk that there's too much onus put on individuals so when it comes to things like public transport, for instance....the greener option needs to be the cheaper option.\"",
      "There are also those that think the UK is starting to import the more partisan politics on the issue from the US.",
      "Pippa Heylings, the Liberal Democrats' net zero spokesperson, says she thinks part of the pushback is being driven by \"big oil and gas\" who, she says, have been \"emboldened by Donald Trump\".",
      "Another is that the easy things have already been done and \"we're now getting to the things that will touch on people's lives\".",
      "Her party's policy is currently to reach net zero by 2045 although she says they are looking at it to make sure it is still \"do-able\" after the previous Conservative administration shifted the government's timeline.",
      "The most marked political shift has come from the Conservatives, who have moved from setting the 2050 target, enthusiastically embracing green goals set by Boris Johnson, to a slowing of some targets under Rishi Sunak and, finally, abandoning 2050 under Kemi Badenoch.",
      "She has described the 2050 plans as \"impossible\" and said that what Keir Starmer needed to do was to \"scrap what [Energy Secretary] Ed Miliband is planning which is actually going to bankrupt the country\".",
      "\"It's not workable. Conservatives are working on new plans so that we can tackle climate change and look after our environment, without bankrupting the UK.\"",
      "Green-minded Tories have said they thought the decision to ditch the target was premature but they hope their party will recommit to decarbonisation.",
      "Sam Hall, the director of the Conservative Environment Network, said: \"On the centre-right there have been growing concerns around the cost of the transition and the shift to a more statist, interventionist approach to decarbonising.\"",
      "He says he wants to see a more \"market-led\" solution.",
      "While much of the Labour Party does seem to be on board with the leadership's position, there are some in the broader Labour movement who have issued warning shots that suggest their support for net zero is conditional.",
      "Some trade unions have become increasingly vocal about the need to ensure that there is a plan to protect jobs in any transition to green energy.",
      "As the union Unite put it: \"If they fail to do this, then Labour cannot expect workers to support their net zero plan.\"",
      "While the net zero by 2050 target is currently set in law, Labour's \"clean power by 2030\" push is self-imposed, leading to regular rumours that it could be watered down.",
      "Government sources are adamant the party is committed to it, and they point to investments that have already been made.",
      "Other Labour sources, who back the targets, say they believe the prime minister is invested in it and that it is intrinsically linked to the government's growth agenda.",
      "They also warn that any watering down of targets would shake confidence in foreign investment.",
      "Former Labour advisor John McTernan believes that keeping the clean power commitment is also key to the government's political survival beyond the next election.",
      "\"Labour has to be solid on it because it's a manifesto commitment and because it is a point of distinction with the parties on the right.",

      "He says the party won a big majority by promising \"big, difficult things\".",
      "\"It would be a dereliction of duty for the Labour party to win a landslide on difficult things and then go, 'do you know what, it's too difficult'.\"",
      "With so much political capital and economic hope riding on Labour's green agenda, pulling back from green targets could be fraught with danger.",

    "story": [
      "The world's rainforests are often referred to as the \"lungs of the earth\".",
      "They store billions of tonnes of carbon and in doing so help to reduce the impacts of climate change.",
      "But with more than one and half trillion trees, measuring exactly how much carbon they store has been virtually impossible, until now.",
      "On Tuesday, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched a first-of-a-kind satellite which uses a special radar system to reveal what lies beneath the canopy.",
      "It is hoped it will help scientists better understand the importance of rainforests in storing carbon and the impact of deforestation.",
      "World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030",
      "Deforestation surges in 2022 despite pledges",
      "The rocket took off from ESA's Kourou station in French Guiana and flying over the Amazon, one of the rainforests it will study.",
      "The satellite on board has been affectionately named \"space brolly\" for its giant 12m diameter antenna which will send out signals.",
      "\"We really want to interrogate these forests. We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.",
      "He said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".",
      "The antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.",
      "\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.",
      "\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.",
      "The 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.",
      "It is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.",
      "Currently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.",
      "\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics.",
      "\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\"",
      "On the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back.",
      "The satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Despite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch.",
      "\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.",
      "Airbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.",
      "L3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.",
      "The team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.",
      "These annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.",
      "\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney.",
      "Another advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.",
      "It is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\"",

    "summary": "Weather influencers can provide useful local information but are also accused of exaggerating conditions.",
    "story": [
      "As the skies unleashed six months of rain in February over North Queensland, Australia, many locals endured sleepless nights, unsure what level of flooding and damage they would wake up to.",
      "Perhaps none more so than Andrew Brown - a cybersecurity lecturer by day, with a side hustle as a self-made amateur weather forecaster.",
      "Few know that Mr Brown is the brains behind Wally's Weather - a Facebook page with 107,000 followers and 24 million monthly views, focusing on weather across the tropical state of Queensland.",
      "During the record-breaking flooding, when 400 people were forced to evacuate their homes, Mr Brown published round the clock posts, even waking in the night to share updates, out of a sense of duty and responsibility to his audience.",
      "He even left work early when he spotted on his weather radar that five hours of non-stop rain would be approaching, advising not just his Facebook followers, but his bosses, colleagues, wife and adult children to do the same.",
      "\"When there's a big weather event, you try and give people as much notice as possible.\"",
      "He is based in Townsville, the regional centre of an area known for a rain-drenched, hot, humid wet season from January to March.",
      "\"People want to know what's going on, because even if they lose power, they've probably still got an internet connection. These systems are notorious for happening at night time when you can't see what's going on, so you do feel like their eyes and ears,\" says Mr Brown.",
      "Mr Brown's active, highly engaged Facebook audience is indicative of how more members of the public are turning to social media for news and weather updates - in the US, it's how 20% of adults get this information, according to Pew Research Centre.",
      "People pay as much attention to influencers on Facebook as they do journalists and the mainstream media, and actually pay more attention to them than their mainstream counterparts on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, according to a study by the Reuters Institute and University of Oxford.",
      "Prof Daniel Angus is director of the Digital Media Research Centre at Queensland University of Technology.",
      "When Brisbane-based Prof Angus found himself caught up in the heavy rain and flooding brought on by Tropical Cyclone Alfred also in February, he preferred to follow official advice from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, as he believes they still provide the most accurate forecasts and warnings.",
      "Prof Angus recognises the rising popularity of weather influencers like Mr Brown's Wally's Weather as stemming from not just a broader trend of public mistrust towards mainstream media and government sources, but about filling gaps in coverage and relatability.",
      "\"Weather influencers have gained popularity, particularly in rural and regional areas, because they provide highly localised, real-time updates that mainstream media can often overlook,\" says Prof Angus.",
      "\"They engage directly with their audience, offering personalised analysis and responding to community concerns in a way that traditional news outlets typically don't.",
      "\"Their credibility has grown because they are seen as passionate, knowledgeable, and often deeply embedded in the communities they report on.\"",
      "Yet the issue with weather influencers, Prof Angus notes, is their tendency to scaremonger, as social media weather forecaster Higgins Storm Chasing, also based in Townsville, has been criticised for.",
      "In 2018, it was criticised for predicting historic levels of rainfall and flooding to its one million Facebook followers, which didn't materialise.",
      "Higgins Storm Chasing, which has hired professional meteorologist and amateur tornado chaser Thomas Hinterdorfer, didn't respond to the BBC's request for an interview.",
      "\"Weather influencers are often prone to hyperbolic and exaggerated claims, as they are not held to the same standards or consequences as their mainstream and official government counterparts, which has led to claims of scaremongering, and propagation of misinformation,\" explains Prof Angus.",
      "\"What we have to understand is that they are part of an attention economy. The more eyes they have, the more engagement they see on their metrics. The bureau and governments are very reserved in putting out alerts and evacuation orders, because it only takes a few non-events for people to lose their trust in them,\" says Professor Angus.",
      "\"They have to answer for that, whereas for Higgins or any of the others, there's ultimately zero accountability if they completely mess it up. \"",
      "It's a view shared by Alan Sealls, a former TV weatherman who now teaches meteorology at the University of South Alabama, and consults as a forensic meteorologist, providing weather analysis for legal cases.",
      "Prof Sealls is also now the president elect of the American Meteorological Society (AMS), which welcomes both professionally-trained meteorologists and weather influencers as members, so doesn't have an official position on the topic.",
      "But Prof Sealls' personal view is that trained meteorologists with an online platform add value, while those without formal training stand to discredit the profession.",
      "\"There are those who are not formally-trained and take more risks in showing and promoting long-range weather outlooks, as though they are as accurate as short-range forecasts, particularly when the outlook hints at extreme weather. That's considered hype that makes people click and share, increasing the popularity of the influencer,\" he says.",
      "\"Trained meteorologists avoid that because it causes confusion in implying something distant is likely, when in reality it is uncertain and unknown.",
      "\"On the other hand, there are weather influencers who have the equipment and expertise to track and forecast local weather when it is extreme, in times of crisis, often giving more focus to communities that don't get full coverage from traditional TV stations. \"",
      "While Andrew Brown of Wally's Weather is self taught in meteorology, he has a masters in IT and numerous other technology qualifications.",
      "His investment in forecasting equipment has been so big that he introduced paid subscriptions three years ago, but they mainly just cover his costs.",
      "The advancement of AI, he says, gives him more time to accurately analyse data and communicate it to his followers. It will also allow him to expand to an Australia-wide operation.",
      "Yet there is money to be made in the world of weather influencing. Colorado-based Andrew Markowitz has a meteorology degree and works full-time for an energy company, but also has 135,000 followers on a TikTok weather page.",
      "Through a combination of live stream donations, sponsorships, brand deals, and TikTok's Creativity Program which helps creators monetise their content, Mr Markowitz says he can earn up to thousands of dollars a month.",
      "\"It's definitely not enough to quit my job, nor would I want to. I just treat it as fun money on the side, which I usually spend on travels,\" says Mr Markowitz.",
      "Back in Australia, Mr Brown says he would like to retire from teaching, and have more time to focus on Wally's Weather, and to spend with his grandchildren, but acknowledges that this is a while away. But what he doesn't want is to be the face of the page - something he's so far avoided.",
      "\"I don't go out of my way to reveal who I am, because I like to be able to walk down the street and not be harassed. I've been interviewed on the radio before, and then walked past the person, and they had no idea it was me,\" says Mr Brown.",

      "Few technology careers offer the chance to demonstrate your skills in exclusive venues worldwide, from luxury hotels to Las Vegas e-sports arenas, peers cheering you on as your name moves up the leaderboard and your earnings rack up.",
      "But that's what Brandyn Murtagh experienced within his first year as a bug bounty hunter.",
      "Mr Murtagh got into gaming and building computers at 10 or 11-years-old and always knew \"I wanted to be a hacker or work in security\".",
      "He began working in a security operations centre at 16, and moved into penetration testing at 20, a job that also involved testing the security of clients' physical and computer security: \"I had to forge false identities and break into places and then hack. Quite fun.\"",
      "But in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back.",
      "Internet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash \"bounty\" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s.",
      "Eventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities.",
      "As Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a \"morally agnostic skill set\", bug hunters do have to operate within the law.",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the \"scope\" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate \"hammering\" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money.",
      "The payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. \"We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes.\"",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd mean \"you can use hackers as a force for good,\" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered \u2013 and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one \"we deem very severe\". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.",
      "So, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.",
      "But while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.",
      "Mr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"",
      "Yet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.",
      "Mr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.",
      "\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".",
      "Dr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.",
      "And it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.",
      "But modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.",
      "He says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".",
      "Mr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"",
      "But these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"",
      "But the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.",
      "\"If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws.\"",
      "Dr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but \"I think it's just a matter of time\".",
      "In the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. \"The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe.\"",
      "That is unlikely to put off the bug hunters in the meantime. As Mr De Ceukelaire says: \"Once a hacker, always a hacker.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkg403x1gxo",
    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 23:43:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The Bafta award-winning film gives viewers a window into a \"highly secret and a deeply private process\".",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 film Conclave - a box office hit and Oscar winner - tells the story of a papal election in which there are no obvious favourites. For many people, it was a glimpse into the rarefied world of the Vatican, and the highly secretive process of choosing a leader for the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "On Wednesday 7 May, life follows fiction when 134 cardinals begin the process of electing a successor to Pope Francis. As viewers of the film will know, the papal conclave will take place entirely behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel, beneath its world-famous Michelangelo frescoes.",
      "Nobody outside the confines of the Vatican will know the outcome until a plume of white smoke curls from its chimney, signifying that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.",
      "But what does the film tell us about how the conclave could unfold, and why do people find the process so fascinating?",
      "'Intense responsibility'",
      "Adapted from the bestselling novel by Robert Harris, Conclave shows the cardinal-electors isolating themselves within the confines of the Vatican during the process of the election.",
      "They are not allowed communication with anyone outside the conclave -  although given the practicalities, they are not entirely cut off.",
      "\"They all need feeding, they're not totally hermetically sealed off from the world,\" says Stephen Bullivant, professor of theology and the sociology of religion at St Mary's University, Twickenham.",
      "This self-imposed isolation is a tradition which stretches back hundreds of years.",
      "In part, it is aimed at preventing the electors from being influenced by external factors, although the idea of a process that happens behind closed doors may seem at odds with the modern world's \"focus on transparency, visibility and scrutiny\", according to Anna Rowlands, professor of Catholic social thought and practice at the University of Durham.",
      "The film invokes an \"incredible, introspective atmosphere\" and sense of withdrawal from the world, she says. \"I struggle to think of a more intense responsibility and feeling than being locked away in conclave.\"",
      "Conclave to elect new pope to begin on 7 May, Vatican says",
      "Who will be the next pope? Key candidates in an unpredictable process",
      "'Lots of politicking'",
      "On the screen, claustrophobic and intense deliberations, strategic huddles and tactical moves abound. One cardinal undermines a frontrunner to improve their own chances. Others with unlikely prospects urge their supporters to change their vote.",
      "This conflict of interests and competing ideologies provides much of the film's drama. \"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on,\" Nick Emerson, the film's editor, told the BBC earlier this year.",
      "While some cardinals will think the most important part is following divine guidance, others will have anxiety over making a quick decision, says Tina Beattie, professor emerita of Catholic studies at the University of Roehampton.",
      "Given that Pope Francis's health had been poor for a while, it is likely that, even before the conclave, \"there will have been lots of politicking and jostling for position already behind the scenes\", she adds.",
      "\"There will be all those tussles going on and [the cardinals] won't all be of one mind.\"",
      "Although in the film, some of the tensest scenes are focused on the act of voting, in reality, much of the drama may come in meetings in the days before conclave officially begins.",
      "During this time, the participants will be \"getting to know each other, working out what the priorities are and learning how to work together as a body so they can come up with a unified decision\", says Prof Rowlands, who is nearing the end of a two-year secondment to the Vatican.",
      "A complete unknown?",
      "In the film, an unknown cardinal - secretly appointed by the late pope - is catapulted into the fray.",
      "In real life, this would not be possible. Although any baptised Roman Catholic male is theoretically eligible to be made pope, all cardinals voting in the conclave would need to have been appointed publicly by a previous pope.",
      "Having said this, the imminent election may be one of the most unpredictable there has ever been. About 80% of the cardinals eligible to vote have been appointed in the past 12 years by Pope Francis. He consciously chose people from across the globe and with diverse political backgrounds.",
      "Many of Francis's appointees are from the developing world - \"places and contexts which are not normally given a red hat\", says Prof Rowlands.",
      "This adds a level of uncertainty as to their priorities and the ultimate decision.",
      "'A very human thing'",
      "The film presents the cardinals as fallible human beings jostling for power.",
      "Director Edward Berger told the BBC last year that while the conclave was thought of as \"an ancient spiritual ritual\", he wanted to bring the participants \"into modernity\".",
      "\"We put them on this pedestal, and when you look closer, they're going to have cell phones, they're going to smoke, they have the same problems and vices and secrets as we do.\"",
      "Prof Rowlands says the film provides a peek behind a process, with all elements of human nature and human life in it: \"Loss. grief, ambition, fear, temptation, courage.\"",
      "She adds: \"It's a very, very human thing, a conclave... It's got a divine purpose to it, but it's a very human thing.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5d0l7el36o",
    "published": "Fri, 02 May 2025 23:48:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Scientists hope to make a universal antivenom from the extraordinary blood of a man exposed to snake venom for decades.",
    "story": [
      "The blood of a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades has led to an \"unparalleled\" antivenom, say scientists.",
      "Antibodies found in Tim Friede's blood have been shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of species in animal tests.",
      "Current therapies have to match the specific species of venomous snake anyone has been bitten by.",
      "But Mr Friede's 18-year mission could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites - which kill up to 14,000 people a year and leave three times as many needing amputations or facing permanent disability.",
      "In total, Mr Friede has endured more than 200 bites and more than 700 injections of venom he prepared from some of the world's deadliest snakes, including multiple species of mambas, cobras, taipans and kraits.",
      "He initially wanted to build up his immunity to protect himself when handling snakes, documenting his exploits on YouTube.",
      "But the former truck mechanic said that he had \"completely screwed up\" early on when two cobra bites in quick succession left him in a coma.",
      "\"I didn't want to die. I didn't want to lose a finger. I didn't want to miss work,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Mr Friede's motivation was to develop better therapies for the rest of the world, explaining: \"It just became a lifestyle and I just kept pushing and pushing and pushing as hard as I could push - for the people who are 8,000 miles away from me who die from snakebite\".",
      "'I'd love to get my hands on some of your blood'",
      "Antivenom is currently made by injecting small doses of snake venom into animals, such as horses. Their immune system fights the venom by producing antibodies and these are harvested to be used as a therapy.",
      "But venom and antivenom have to be closely matched because the toxins in a venomous bite vary from one species to another.",
      "There is even wide variety within the same species \u2013 antivenom made from snakes in India is less effective against the same species in Sri Lanka.",
      "A team of researchers began searching for a type of immune defence called broadly neutralising antibodies. Instead of targeting the part of a toxin that makes it unique, they target the parts that are common to entire classes of toxin.",
      "That's when Dr Jacob Glanville, chief executive of biotech company Centivax, came across Tim Friede.",
      "\"Immediately I was like 'if anybody in the world has developed these broadly neutralising antibodies, it's going to be him' and so I reached out,\" he said.",
      "\"The first call, I was like 'this might be awkward, but I'd love to get my hands on some of your blood'.\"",
      "Mr Friede agreed and the work was given ethical approval because the study would only take blood, rather than giving him more venom.",
      "The research focused on elapids \u2013 one of the two families of venomous snakes \u2013 such as coral snakes, mambas, cobras, taipans and kraits.",
      "Elapids primarily use neurotoxins in their venom, which paralyses their victim and is fatal when it stops the muscles needed to breathe.",
      "Researchers picked 19 elapids identified by the World Health Organization as being among the deadliest snakes on the planet. They then began scouring Mr Friede's blood for protective defences.",
      "Their work, detailed in the journal Cell, identified two broadly neutralising antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxin. They added in a drug that targets a third to make their antivenom cocktail.",
      "In experiments on mice, the cocktail meant the animals survived fatal doses from 13 of the 19 species of venomous snake. They had partial protection against the remaining six.",
      "This is \"unparalleled\" breadth of protection, according to Dr Glanville, who said it \"likely covers a whole bunch of elapids for which there is no current antivenom\".",
      "The team is trying to refine the antibodies further and see if adding a fourth component could lead to total protection against elapid snake venom.",
      "The other class of snake \u2013 the vipers \u2013 rely more on haemotoxins, which attack the blood, rather than neurotoxins. In total there are around a dozen broad classes of toxin in snake venom, which also includes cytotoxins that directly kill cells.",
      "\"I think in the next 10 or 15 years we'll have something effective against each one of those toxin classes,\" said Prof Peter Kwong, one of the researchers at Columbia University.",
      "And the hunt continues inside Mr Friede's blood samples.",
      "\"Tim's antibodies are really quite extraordinary - he taught his immune system to get this very, very broad recognition,\" said Prof Kwong.",
      "The ultimate hope is to have either a single antivenom that can do everything, or one injection for elapids and one for vipers.",
      "Prof Nick Casewell, who is the head of the centre for snakebite research and interventions at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said the breadth of protection reported was \"certainly novel\" and provided \"a strong piece of evidence\" that this was a feasible approach.",
      "\"There is no doubt that this work moves the field forwards in an exciting direction.\"",
      "But he cautioned there was \"much work to do\" and that the antivenom still needed extensive testing before it could be used in people.",
      "But for Mr Friede, reaching this stage \"makes me feel good\".",
      "\"I'm doing something good for humanity and that was very important to me. I'm proud of it. It's pretty cool.\""

    "story": [
      "At a military training ground near the city of Wroclaw, ordinary Poles are lining up, waiting to be handed guns and taught how to shoot. \"Once the round is loaded, the weapon is ready to fire,\" barks the instructor, a Polish soldier, his face smeared with camouflage paint.",
      "Young and old, men and women, parents and children, they've all come here for one reason: to learn how to survive an armed attack.",
      "As well as a turn on the shooting range, this Saturday morning programme, called \"Train with the Army\", also teaches civilians hand-to-hand combat, first aid and how to put on a gas mask.",
      "\"The times are dangerous now, we need to be ready,\" says the co-ordinator of the project, Captain Adam Sielicki. \"We have a military threat from Russia, and we are preparing for this.\"",
      "Capt Sielicki says the programme is oversubscribed, and the Polish government now has plans to expand it so that every adult male in the country receives training. Poland, which shares borders with both Russia and Ukraine, says it will spend almost 5% of GDP on defence this year, the highest in Nato.",
      "Last week, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Poland aims to build \"the strongest army in the region\". Warsaw has been on a spending spree, buying planes, ships, artillery systems and missiles from the US, Sweden and South Korea, among others.",
      "Dariusz is one of those attending the Saturday course in Wroclaw, and says he would be the \"very first\" to volunteer if Poland were attacked. \"History has taught us that we must be prepared to defend ourselves on our own. We cannot rely on anyone else. Today alliances exist, and tomorrow they are broken.\"",
      "As he removes his gas mask, Bartek says he thinks most Poles \"will take up arms\" if attacked, \"and be ready to defend the country.\"",
      "Agata is attending with a friend. She says the election of Donald Trump has made people more worried. \"He wants to pull out [of Europe]. That's why we feel even less safe. If we're not prepared and Russia attacks us, we'll simply become their prisoners.\"",
      "Statements by Donald Trump and members of his administration have caused deep concern among officials in Warsaw. During a visit to the Polish capital in February, the US defence secretary Pete Hegseth said Europe mustn't assume that the US troop presence on the continent \"will last forever\".",
      "The US currently has 10,000 troops stationed in Poland, but Washington announced last month it was pulling out of a key military base in the city of Rzeszow in the east of Poland. Officials say the troops will be redeployed within Poland, but the move has caused yet more unease in the country.",
      "Donald Trump's apparent hostility towards Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and warm words for Russia's Vladimir Putin, have only added to the worry.",
      "Poland is due to sign a defence agreement with France in the coming days, and another pact with the UK is in the pipeline \u2013 further moves by Warsaw to pivot away from its historically strong military ties with Washington. There is also talk of Poland being brought under the French military's \"nuclear umbrella\".",
      "\"I think [Trump] has certainly pressed us to think more creatively about our security,\" says Tomasz Szatkowski, the permanent representative of Poland to Nato and presidential advisor on defence. \"I think the US can't afford to lose Poland, because that would be a sign\u2026 that you can't rely on the US. However, we do have to think of other options and develop our own capabilities.\"",
      "\"If the Russians continue their aggressive intentions towards Europe, we're going to be the first one \u2013 the gatekeeper,\" Mr Szatkowski says. He ascribes Poland's rapid military build-up to \"first of all, the geopolitical situation, but also, the experience of history.\"",
      "The painful legacy of Russian occupation can be felt everywhere here.",
      "At a state-run care home in Warsaw, 98-year-old Wanda Traczyk-Stawska recalls the last time Russian forces invaded \u2013 in 1939, when a pact between Stalin and Hitler resulted in Poland being carved up between the USSR and Nazi Germany.",
      "\"In 1939 I was twelve years old. I remember my father was very concerned about [the Russians],\" Wanda recalls, \"We knew that Russia had attacked us, they took advantage of the fact that the Germans had exposed us.\"",
      "On a shelf is a photograph of Wanda as a fighter, brandishing a machine gun during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, when the Polish underground fought the German Army amidst the ruins of the city. After pushing back the Germans in the dying days of World War Two, the Soviet Union installed a pro-Moscow regime in Poland, which ruled the country until 1989.",
      "Currently, around 216,000 servicemen and women make up the Polish armed forces. The government says they intend to increase that to half a million, including reservists \u2013 which would give it the second-largest military in Nato after the United States.",
      "I ask Wanda whether she thinks it's a good thing that Poland is building up its military. \"Of course, yes. Russia has this aggression written into its history. I'm not talking about people, but the authorities are always like that,\" she sighs. \"It is better to be a well-armed country than to wait for something to happen. Because I am a soldier who remembers that weapons are the most important thing.\"",
      "Eighty years since the end of World War Two, Poles are once again eyeing their neighbours nervously. In a warehouse in southern Poland, by popular demand, one company has constructed a mock-up of a bomb shelter.",
      "\"These shelters are designed primarily to protect against a nuclear bomb, but also against armed attacks,\" says Janusz Janczy, the boss of ShelterPro, who shows me around the steel bunker, complete with bunk beds and a ventilation system. \"People are building these shelters simply because they don't know what to expect tomorrow.\"",
      "Janusz says demand for his shelters has soared since Donald Trump took office. \"It used to be just a few phone calls a month. Now there are dozens a week,\" he says, \"My clients are most afraid of Russia. And they're concerned that Nato wouldn't come to defend Poland.\"",
      "But are Poles ready to defend the country if those fears become a reality? A recent poll found that only 10.7% of adults said they would join the army as volunteers in the event of war, and a third said they would flee.",
      "On a sunny afternoon in Wroclaw, I ask Polish students whether they'd be ready to defend their country if attacked. Most say they wouldn't. \"The war is very close but feels quite far,\" says medical student Marcel, \"but if Russia attacked, I think I'd run.\"",
      "\"I would probably be the first one trying to escape the country,\" says another student, Szymon. \"I just don't really see anything worth dying for here.\"",

      "\"My family all left but I told them I had to stay, if Israeli forces come to raid our house I want to be there to stop it being damaged.\"",
      "What followed was three days of fear, with the constant sound of gunfire, explosions and drones flying through the neighbourhood, and issuing of orders that Jumaa couldn't make out amid the noise. Then water and electricity was cut off, his phone ran out of battery and Jumaa felt he could no longer stay.",
      "Now, three months later, Jumaa is standing on a hill in Jenin city, looking out over the ghost town of the refugee camp to which he and the other residents are still prevented from returning by the Israeli military.",
      "He's trying to see if his home is one of the many destroyed by the Israeli forces during their operations against Palestinian armed groups that were present in the camp. The sound of ongoing explosions can be heard below.",
      "\"Some people have told me they think our building was demolished, but we don't know for certain,\" says Jumaa, struggling to express himself through his emotion.",
      "The father of nine, who used to work in construction, stayed for three months in a school-turned-shelter for the camp's displaced residents. He has now moved into accommodation for university students that he shares with his brother.",
      "Before the outbreak of the war in Gaza in October 2023, Israel was already engaged in a military campaign against armed groups in the West Bank.",
      "A number of groups emerged in the densely-populated urban refugee camps created for Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the war that followed the creation of the state of Israel in 1948.",
      "The main groups in Jenin camp are affiliated to Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas. Their fighters have mostly attacked Israeli military forces, alongside sporadic attacks on Israeli settlers in the West Bank.",
      "The number of fighters is unknown but local journalists estimate that there were around 150 fighters in Jenin camp prior to the recent operations by both Israel and the Palestinian Authority.",
      "The Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank, launched its own crackdown in Jenin camp in December 2024 and its forces only withdrew when the Israeli military began its major operation there in January.",
      "Israel's defence minister has called the camps \"nests of terror\" and in January stepped up its campaign against the armed groups operating inside them \u2013 entering and blockading a number of refugee camps in the northern West Bank that are home to tens of thousands of Palestinians.",
      "It ordered residents to leave and began a wave of building demolitions, while giving some residents brief opportunities to gather belongings.",
      "But with Israel almost entirely blocking access to the camps and not publicly announcing which buildings they've destroyed, many Palestinians are distraught about whether they have a home to return to.",
      "The UN's Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa says its best estimate is that Israel has razed at least 260 buildings containing around 800 apartments during \"Operation Iron Wall\", focusing on three refugee camps in the north of the West Bank: Jenin, Tulkarem and Nur Shams. Unrwa estimates that 42,000 Palestinians have been displaced from the camps since January.",
      "In February, the Israeli military announced it had killed 60 fighters in its operations and arrested 280 others. Meanwhile Palestinian health officials say 100 people have been killed in the West Bank since the start of Israel's January operation until today.",
      "Defence Minister Israel Katz said the army was destroying weapons and infrastructure \"on an extensive scale\" and said he had instructed the military to remain in the refugee camps for a year and prevent residents returning there.",
      "The Israeli military told the BBC that the militias \"exploit the civilian population as human shields and endanger them by planting explosive devices and hiding weapons\".",
      "On 1 May, Israel gave Palestinian officials in the West Bank a new map of 106 buildings it said it would demolish in Tulkarem and Nur Shams refugee camps in the next 24 hours for \"military purposes\". It said residents could apply for a brief window to return home to retrieve essential belongings.",
      "Aid agencies say that Israel's campaign has caused the largest forced displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank in decades.",
      "\"What's happening is unprecedented,\" says Roland Friedrich, Unrwa's West Bank director.",
      "\"In terms of the number of displaced people and the level of destruction, we've never seen anything like it since 1967,\" he added, referring to the year Israel began its military occupation of the West Bank.",
      "While filming an interview with the mayor of Jenin, the BBC witnessed Israeli forces detain several Palestinians, including municipality workers who were attempting to enter the camp in order to clear a route to a nearby hospital. They were kept for three hours before being released.",
      "\"There are big challenges, in terms of providing services to citizens. As everyone knows, the infrastructure in Jenin camp has been totally demolished,\" says Mayor Mohammad Jarrar.",
      "\"Israel's goal is to try to make Jenin camp totally unfit to live in, and I'm telling you it has now become completely unliveable.\"",
      "Israel's blockade of West Bank refugee camps has made establishing information about what is happening inside nearly impossible, says Unrwa's Roland Friedrich, including the exact extent of demolitions.",
      "Jumaa is among some of the displaced Palestinians who were granted a brief visit home by Israeli forces in order to retrieve belongings. He was able just to grab his UN ID card and the family dog. Then two months later, in March, Israel issued a map of over 90 buildings it identified for demolition in Jenin. Jumaa's residence looked to be among them.",

    "story": [
      "Conservatives in Canada are trading blame for Monday night's election loss, showing that Pierre Poilievre will need to heal divisions within the movement as he fights to stay on as leader.",
      "As a clear Liberal win was emerging on election night, Conservative candidates and their supporters had one question: What the heck just happened?",
      "The party had lost a remarkable 27-point lead in opinion polls and failed to win an election for the fourth time in a row.",
      "And while it gained seats and earned almost 42% of the popular vote - its highest share since the party was founded in 2003 - its leader Poilievre was voted out of the seat he had held for the past 20 years.",
      "\"Nobody's happy about that,\" Shakir Chambers, a Conservative strategist and vice-president of Ontario-based consultancy firm the Oyster Group, told the BBC.",
      "The party is now trying to work out how it will move forward.",
      "At the top of the agenda will be finding a way for the Conservatives to perform their duties as the Official Opposition - the second-place party in Canada's parliament whose job is to hold the sitting government to account - without their leader in the House.",
      "Ahead of a caucus meeting next Tuesday to discuss this, Poilievre announced on Friday his plan to run in an Alberta constituency special election to win back a seat.",
      "That special election will be triggered by the resignation of Conservative MP-elect Damien Kurek, who said he will voluntarily step down to let Poilievre back in after what he called \"a remarkable national campaign\".",
      "\"An unstoppable movement has grown under his leadership, and I know we need Pierre fighting in the House of Commons,\" Kurek said in a statement.",
      "Unlike the US, federal politicians in Canada do not have to live in the city or province they run in. Poilievre grew up in Alberta, however, and will likely win handily as the constituency he is running in is a Conservative stronghold.",
      "A big question is whether Poilievre still has the backing of his own party to stay on as leader.  Mr Chambers said the answer, so far, is a resounding yes.",
      "\"Pierre has a lot of support in the caucus,\" he said. \"I don't think there's anybody that wants him removed, or that has super high ambitions that wants to replace him as leader.\"",
      "A number of high-profile Conservatives have already rallied behind him. One of them is Andrew Scheer, a current MP and former leader of the party, who said Poilievre should stay on to \"ensure we finish the job next time\".",
      "Others are casting blame on where they went wrong.",
      "Jamil Jivani, who won his own constituency in a suburb of Toronto handily, felt that Ontario leader Doug Ford had betrayed the conservative movement and cost the party the election.",
      "The federal and provincial Conservative parties are legally different entities, though they belong to the same ideological tent, and Ford is leader of Ontario's Progressive Conservative Party.",
      "He frequently made headlines during the election campaign for his get-tough attitude with Donald Trump and the US president's trade war.",
      "\"He couldn't stay out of our business,\" Jivani told a CBC reporter.",
      "Jivani, who in a past life attended Yale University with US Vice-President JD Vance, where the two became good friends, accused Ford of distracting from the federal Conservatives' campaign and of \"positioning himself as some political genius that we need to be taking cues from\".",
      "But Mr Chambers, the Conservative strategist, said that Poilievre will also need to confront where the party fell short.",
      "Poilievre, who is known for his combative political style, has struggled with being unlikeable among the general Canadian public.",
      "He has also failed to shore up the support of popular Conservative leaders in some provinces, like Ontario's Ford, who did not campaign for Poilievre despite his recent landslide victory in a provincial election earlier this year. Ford did, however, post a photo of him and Liberal leader Mark Carney having a coffee.",
      "\"Last time I checked, Pierre Poilievre never came out in our election,\" Ford told reporters earlier this week. \"Matter of fact, he or one of his lieutenants told every one of his members, 'don't you dare go out and help'\".",
      "\"Isn't that ironic?\"",
      "Another Conservative premier, Tim Houston of Nova Scotia - who also did not campaign for Poilievre - said the federal party needs to do some \"soul-searching\" after its loss.",
      "\"I think the Conservative Party of Canada was very good at pushing people away, not so good at pulling people in,\" Houston said.",
      "Not every premier stood on the sidelines. Poilievre was endorsed by Alberta's Danielle Smith and Saskatchewan's Scott Moe, both western Conservatives.",
      "Kory Teneycke, Ford's campaign manager, who publicly criticised Poilievre's campaign during the election, angering federal Conservatives, rejected the notion that Ford's failure to endorse Poilievre had cost him the election.",
      "He told the BBC that, to him, the bigger problem was Poilievre's failure to unite Conservative voters in Canada.",
      "\"What constitutes a Conservative in different parts of the country can look quite different,\" he said, adding that Poilievre's populist rhetoric and aggressive style appealed to Conservatives in the west, but alienated those in the east.",
      "\"There was a lot of Trump mimicry in terms of how they presented the campaign,\" Mr Teneycke said.",
      "\"Donald Trump is public enemy number one to most in Canada, and I don't think it was coming across very well.\"",
      "He added he believes some of the \"soul-searching\" by Poilievre's Conservatives will need to include a plan of how to build a coalition of the right in a country \"as big and diverse as Canada\".",

    "summary": "The way events unfolded after the Pulwama bombing and Pahalgam killings is strikingly similar, says a former diplomat.",
    "story": [
      "Last week's deadly militant attack in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, which claimed 26 civilian lives, has reignited a grim sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for India's security forces and diplomats.",
      "This is familiar ground. In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control \u2013 the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.",
      "In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.",
      "And before that, the horrific 2008 Mumbai attacks - a 60-hour siege on hotels, a railway station, and a Jewish centre - claimed 166 lives.",
      "Each time, India has held Pakistan-based militant groups responsible for the attacks, accusing Islamabad of tacitly supporting them - a charge Pakistan has consistently denied.",
      "Since 2016, and especially after the 2019 airstrikes, the threshold for escalation has shifted dramatically. Cross-border and aerial strikes by India have become the new norm, provoking retaliation from Pakistan. This has further intensified an already volatile situation.",
      "Once again, experts say, India finds itself walking the tightrope between escalation and restraint - a fragile balance of response and deterrence. One person who understands this recurring cycle is Ajay Bisaria, India's former high commissioner to Pakistan during the Pulwama attack, who captured its aftermath in his memoir, Anger Management: The Troubled Diplomatic Relationship between India and Pakistan.",
      "\"There are striking parallels between the aftermath of the Pulwama bombing and the killings in Pahalgam,\" Mr Bisaria told me on Thursday, 10 days after the latest attack.",
      "Yet, he notes, Pahalgam marks a shift. Unlike Pulwama and Uri, which targeted security forces, this attack struck civilians - tourists from across India - evoking memories of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. \"This attack carries elements of Pulwama, but much more of Mumbai,\" he explains.",
      "\"We're once again in a conflict situation, and the story is unfolding in much the same way,\" Mr Bisaria says.",
      "A week after the latest attack, Delhi moved quickly with retaliatory measures: closing the main border crossing, suspending a key water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats, and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals - who were given days to leave. Troops on both sides have exchanged intermittent small-arms fire across the border in recent days.",
      "Delhi also barred all Pakistani aircraft - commercial and military - from its airspace, mirroring Islamabad's earlier move. Pakistan retaliated with its own visa suspensions and suspended a 1972 peace treaty with India. (Kashmir, claimed in full by both India and Pakistan but administered in parts by each, has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear-armed nations since their partition in 1947.)",
      "In his memoir, Mr Bisaria recounts India's response after the Pulwama attack on 14 February 2019.",
      "He was summoned to Delhi the morning after, as the government moved quickly to halt trade - revoking Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, granted in 1996. In the following days, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) imposed a 200% customs duty on Pakistani goods, effectively ending imports, and suspended trade at the land border at  Wagah.",
      "Mr Bisaria notes that a broader set of measures was also proposed to scale down engagement with Pakistan, most of which were subsequently implemented.",
      "They included suspending a cross-border train known as the Samjhauta Express, and a bus service linking Delhi and Lahore; deferring talks between border guards on both sides and negotiations over the historic Kartarpur corridor to one of Sikhism's holiest shrines, halting visa issuance, ceasing cross border, banning Indian travel to Pakistan, and suspending flights between the two countries.",
      "\"How hard it was to build trust, I thought. And how easy was it to break it,\" Mr Bisaria writes.",
      "\"All the confidence-building measures planned, negotiated, and implemented over years in this difficult relationship, could be slashed off on a yellow notepad in minutes.\"",
      "The strength of the Indian high commission in Islamabad was reduced from 110 to 55 only in June 2020 after a separate diplomatic incident. (It now stands at 30 after the Pahalgam attack.) India also launched a diplomatic offensive.",
      "A day after the attack, then foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale briefed envoys from 25 countries - including the US, UK, China, Russia, and France - on the role of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), the Pakistan-based militant group behind the bombing, and accused Pakistan of using terrorism as state policy. JeM, designated a terrorist organisation by India, the UN, the UK, and the US, had claimed responsibility for the bombing.",
      "India's diplomatic offensive continued on 25 February, 10 days after the attack, pushing for JeM chief Masood Azhar's designation as a terrorist by the UN sanctions committee and inclusion on the EU's \"autonomous terror list\".",
      "While there was pressure to abrogate the Indus Waters Treaty - a key river water sharing agreement - India opted instead to withhold any data beyond treaty obligations, Mr Bisaria writes. A total of 48 bilateral agreements were reviewed for possible suspension. An all-party meeting was convened in Delhi, resulting in a unanimous resolution.",
      "At the same time, communication channels remained open - including the hotline between the two countries' Directors General of Military Operations (DGMO), a key link for military-to-military contact, as well as both high commissions. In 2019, as now, Pakistan said the attack was a \"false-flag operation\".",
      "Much like this time a crackdown in Kashmir saw the arrest of over 80 \"overground workers\" - local supporters who may have provided logistical help, shelter, and intelligence to militants from the Pakistan-based group. Rajnath Singh, then Indian home minister, visited Jammu and Kashmir, and dossiers on the attack and suspected perpetrators were prepared.",
      "In a meeting with the external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, Mr Bisaria told her that \"that India's diplomatic options in dealing with a terrorist attack of this nature was limited\".",
      "\"She gave me the impression that some tough action was round the corner, after which, I should expect the role of diplomacy to expand,\" Mr Bisaria writes.",
      "On 26 February, Indian airstrikes - its first across the international border since 1971 - targeted JeM's training camp in Balakot.",
      "Six hours later, the Indian foreign secretary announced the strikes had killed \"a very large number\" of militants and commanders. Pakistan swiftly denied the claim. More high-level meetings followed in Delhi.",
      "The crisis escalated dramatically the next morning, 27 February, when Pakistan launched retaliatory air raids.",
      "In the ensuing dogfight, an Indian fighter jet was shot down, and its pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, ejected and landed in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Captured by Pakistani forces, his detention in enemy territory triggered a wave of national concern and further heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.",
      "Mr Bisaria writes India activated multiple diplomatic channels, with US and UK envoys pressing Islamabad. The Indian message was \"any attempt by Pakistan to escalate situation further or to cause harm to the pilot would lead to escalation by India.\"",
      "Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan announced the pilot's release on 28 February, with the handover occurring on 1 March under prisoner of war protocol. Pakistan presented the move as a \"goodwill gesture\" aimed at de-escalating tensions.",
      "By 5 March, with the dust settling from Pulwama, Balakot, and the pilot's return, India's political temperature had cooled. The Cabinet Committee on Security decided to send India's high commissioner back to Pakistan, signalling a shift towards diplomacy.",
      "\"I arrived in Islamabad on 10 March, 22 days after leaving in the wake of Pulwama. The most serious military exchange since Kargil had run its course in less than a month,\" Mr Bisaria writes,",
      "\"India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance.... This, with India having achieved a strategic and military objective and Pakistan having claimed a notion of victory for its domestic audience.\"",
      "Mr Bisaria described it as a \"testing and fascinating time\" to be a diplomat. This time, he notes, the key difference is that the targets were Indian civilians, and the attack occurred \"ironically, when the situation in Kashmir had dramatically improved\".",
      "He views escalation as inevitable, but notes there's also a \"de-escalation instinct alongside the escalation instinct\". When the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meets during such conflicts, he says, their decisions weigh the conflict's economic impact and seek measures that hurt Pakistan without triggering a backlash against India.",
      "\"The body language and optics are similar [this time],\" he says, but highlights what he sees as the most significant move: India's threat to annul the Indus Waters Treaty. \"If India acts on this, it would have long-term, serious consequences for Pakistan.\"",
      "\"Remember, we're still in the middle of a crisis,\" says Mr Bisaria. \"We haven't yet seen any kinetic [military] action.\"",

      "But it's the third man in particular who dominates the conversation. He's Fadi Gujjar, a people smuggler.",
      "The video - posted to Gujjar's TikTok account - is one of more than 450 clips analysed by BBC Verify that reveal clues about his activities and his close relationship to the other men.",
      "Within a month of this video being posted online, Ali and Shahzad were dead - beaten to death on the boat journey sold to them by Gujjar, who promised a safe route into Europe.",
      "Meanwhile, Gujjar found himself on the run, wanted by Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for his role in the tragedy.",
      "When BBC Verify contacted him on a phone number obtained from survivors, Gujjar said repeatedly in a series of voice notes his name had been \"misused\" by survivors in connection with the disaster and that he was leaving it all in the hands of Allah.",

      "Fadi Gujjar is from Jaurah in Pakistan's Punjab region. In his 30s, his real name is Khawar Hassan - though he also goes by Bishi Gujjar.",
      "Pakistani smugglers the BBC has previously reported on have tended to boastfully advertise illegal routes to Europe online.",
      "But Gujjar is careful. His online presence is limited to highly edited videos of his travels and almost all clients BBC Verify identified are local to Jaurah. Advertisements for his services seem to spread by word of mouth.",
      "His current location on Facebook is set to Istanbul, Turkey - an oasis for smugglers looking to make a quick buck. Videos posted to TikTok place him in the city since July 2022, showing the smuggler outside the iconic Hagia Sophia and a Pakistani supermarket.",
      "One other location stands out: Mauritania on West Africa's Atlantic coast - the nerve-centre of his operation and the place from which the migrant boat started its perilous journey.",
      "Since 2023, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) says Mauritania has become a hub for people smuggling - spurred on by a crackdown on other routes.",
      "The route is deadly. IOM data shows that 170 people - including 14 children - have died or gone missing on it this year.",
      "Many Pakistanis seeking economic opportunities in Europe are willing to take the risk. Life there is glorified online by migrants already living on the continent. Smugglers like Gujjar, whose lucrative business is fuelled by people's aspirations, take advantage of this.",
      "These migrants are taking a gamble, using their families' savings or selling up to make the journey. The survivors we spoke to, on average, say they paid Gujjar $13,000 (\u00a310,000).",
      "There are no direct flights from Pakistan to Mauritania, so some of the migrants transited through Ethiopia or the Middle East. From there, almost all of them went on to Senegal, before crossing into Mauritania, either by road or a short boat journey along the Senegal River.",
      "Gujjar's travel history - obtained by BBC Verify through a source - showed the smuggler followed a similar route, entering Dakar airport in Senegal on two occasions in 2024.",
      "Multiple videos also place him in the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott from October 2024 - though the date of upload could differ to when they were filmed.",
      "Further clips, posted to TikTok by Ali and Shahzad place Gujjar in Mauritania as early as August 2024. The trio are seen on the rooftops of Nouakchott's sand-coloured buildings and in restaurants around the city - a luxury other migrants couldn't afford.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump and Xi Jinping are locked in a game of chicken - despite wanting the same outcome.",
    "story": [
      "On Friday morning, a spokesperson for China's ministry of commerce announced that Beijing was assessing the possibility of tariff negotiations with the United States.",
      "It was news the rest of the world had been waiting to hear as astonishingly high  tariffs - up to 245% on some Chinese exports to the US - throttle trade between the world's two biggest economies, raising the spectre of a recession.",
      "\"US officials have repeatedly expressed their willingness to negotiate with China on tariffs,\" the spokesperson told reporters.",
      "\"China's position is consistent. If we fight, we will fight to the end; if we talk, the door is open... If the US wants to talk, it should show its sincerity and be prepared to correct its wrong practices and cancel unilateral tariffs.\"",
      "The statement comes a day after a Weibo account linked to Chinese state media said the US had been seeking to initiate discussions, and a week after Trump claimed discussions were already underway \u2013 a suggestion Beijing denied.",
      "\"China has no need to talk to the United States,\" Yuyuantantian, a Weibo account affiliated with China Central Television (CCTV), said in Thursday's post. \"From the perspective of negotiations, the United States must be the more anxious party at present.\"",
      "Such comments follow a cycle of assertions and denials from both the US and China, as each side refuses to publicly initiate discussions.",
      "The question is not whether those discussions will take place, but rather when, under what circumstances and at whose behest.",
      "Playing chicken",
      "Experts characterise the tussle as a game of chicken between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, as both men attempt to save face while covertly pursuing a mutually beneficial outcome \u2013 namely, a de-escalation of the trade war.",
      "\"I expect some of this back-and-forth, because neither Washington nor Beijing wants to look like they are the side that's giving in,\" says Ja Ian Chong, assistant professor of political science at the National University of Singapore.",
      "\"[But] a de-escalation would be to the overall benefit of both sides, so there is some overarching incentive to do so.\"",
      "Wen-Ti Sung, an academic member of the Australian Centre on China in the World, puts it another way: \"It's like two race cars going at each other: whoever swerves first will be seen as the weaker of the two parties. And at this juncture, neither party wants to look soft.\"",
      "The leader who admits he was the first to initiate tariff talks would be seen as the one compromising his position in negotiations.",
      "\"Whoever seems desperate loses bargaining leverage,\" Mr Sung says. \"Both sides want to portray the other side as the more desperate one.\"",
      "This peculiar stalemate \u2013 where both parties seek the same outcome, but neither wants to be the first to suggest it \u2013 has resulted in a tactic of \"constructive ambiguity\": the deliberate use of language so vague that each party could arguably claim to be in the right.",
      "It is this tactic that Mr Sung points to as an explanation for Yuyuantantian's Weibo post.",
      "\"This is Beijing trying to explore the possibility of using word games to create an off-ramp for both sides, so that they can gradually climb their way down from this escalation spiral,\" he says.",
      "One way to escape this game of chicken is when a third party mediates, offering both sides an off-ramp. The other option, Mr Sung explains, is a \"much looser understanding of what 'the other side has reached out' means\".",
      "That way, the side that does indeed come to the table first is still able to characterise it as a response rather than the first move.",
      "In Trump and Xi's case, it would also mean that tariff negotiations could begin with both leaders claiming to have achieved some kind of victory in the trade war.",
      "A win at home",
      "The optics here are important. As Mr Chong points out, de-escalation is one thing \u2013 but another top priority for Trump and Xi is to \"deliver a win for their domestic audiences\".",
      "\"Trump obviously wants to show that he has made Beijing capitulate. And on the People's Republic of China side, Xi probably wants to show his own people and the world that he's been able to make Trump become more reasonable and moderate and accommodating,\" Mr Chong says.",
      "On the domestic front, both leaders are facing tariff-induced headwinds. Trump this week struggled to quell fears of a recession as fresh data indicated the US economy contracted in its first quarter for the first time since 2022.",
      "Meanwhile, Xi - who before the tariffs was already battling persistently low consumption, a property crisis and unemployment - must reassure China's population that he can weather the trade war and protect an economy which has struggled to rebound post-pandemic.",
      "\"Both [Trump and Xi] recognise that at this point of the trade war, it's not going to be a winner-takes-all outcome for either side anymore,\" Mr Sung says.",
      "\"Trump recognises he's not going to get anywhere near 100% of what he wants, so he's trying to find a concession point where China can let him have just enough winning, especially for domestic purposes.\"",
      "While China is not unwilling, he adds, \"they are very much stuck on what's the right price point\".",
      "For Xi, Mr Sung described the situation as a \"two-level game\".",
      "\"The China side needs to manage US-China bilateral negotiations, while domestically Beijing needs to save enough face so that the Chinese leadership can hold on to this narrative of 'the East is rising and the West is declining',\" he says.",
      "\"A kowtowing of the East towards the West is not a rising East.\"",
      "At the time of writing, the US has not denied China's claims that it has been attempting to initiate talks. But the fact that both sides have now made that assertion indicates there is \"some sort of contact\", according to Mr Chong.",
      "\"The two sides are talking,\" he says. \"And that is a sign that there is some possibility that some accommodation could be reached.\"",
      "But the start of negotiations does not mean that the US-China relationship - which was rocky even before Trump kicked off a trade war - is close to being steadied.",
      "Mr Chong isn't holding his breath. For one, he believes the \"posturing\" suggests the two sides have not reached the point \"where they are both trying to seek a way out\".",
      "\"[Each party] may hope that there are concessions from the other side, so they're going to have this standoff until they see which side blinks first.\"",

    "story": [
      "With days left to the election, Australian opposition candidates have been wooing a crucial group that turned its back on the conservative Liberal-National coalition in the last election: Chinese Australian voters.",
      "And they are trying to reach them on platforms that their party once talked of banning over national security concerns: Chinese social media apps like WeChat and RedNote.",
      "Nearly six in 10 Chinese Australians use WeChat at least once a day, according to a poll by Lowy Institute in 2022.",
      "Grange Chung, who is contesting the New South Wales' seat of Reid, held by the left-leaning Labor party with a 3.2% margin, said in a video on WeChat that he chose to start his career in the navy \"to give back to the country that embraced my family when we arrived with very little\".",
      "\"Australia gave us a home... Let me finish what I started,\" he said in a video montage that included scenes of him putting up campaign posters and interacting with the electorate.",
      "Despite making up just 5.5% of Australia's population, Chinese Australians were said to be a crucial to the Labor party's win in 2022, which broke nearly a decade of rule by the Liberal-National coalition.",
      "Chinese Australians have traditionally leaned conservative, but in several seats with  large Chinese Australian populations, the Liberals saw swings away three times larger than in other seats.",
      "Some analysts say the community turned its back on the Coalition because they felt its government did not handle racist attacks well during the pandemic, while others point to the then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison's anti-China rhetoric.",
      "And now, with their chances of winning narrowing, according to polls, Liberal candidates have been stepping up their battle for votes in marginal seats, many of which have large populations of Chinese Australians.",
      "In order to be in with a chance of winning Reid, Grange Chung knows he needs to win over the suburb of Burwood, an area often billed as Sydney's second Chinatown, with Mandarin and Cantonese dominating conversations and the signboards for shops and restaurants.",
      "A former commercial pilot, Chung started posting on WeChat in February and has in recent months shared his interviews with Asian business owners, Lunar New Year greetings, and his promises to the community, where about one in five voters are ethnically Chinese. One post saw him quoting Sun Tzu's philosophy.",
      "He is far from the only Liberal candidate to target the platform, with University of Melbourne researcher Fan Yang finding more than 220 authorised Liberal ads had been placed on WeChat since January, compared to about 35 for Labor.",
      "Henry Luo, secretary of the Reid Business Community, says he has observed more \"extensive targeting\" of Chinese Australian voters in this campaign, including candidates displaying ad banners on popular WeChat accounts and collaborating with well-known Chinese celebrities or influencers.",
      "\"I think it is an effective platform to reach the Chinese-speaking community. We discuss and debate plenty of political issues on WeChat,\" says Mr Luo, who moved to Australia for work in 2008.",
      "Even non-ethnic Chinese politicians have established a presence on the platforms, sharing videos of themselves enjoying Chinese cuisine and festivals.",
      "Liberal MP Keith Wolohan's channel has clips of him celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival with his kids and enjoying spicy Hunan food with his father. Wolohan is defending his marginal seat in Menzies, Victoria.",
      "But visibility on Chinese apps is not guaranteed to translate to votes, says Qiuping Pan, a lecturer in Chinese Studies at the University of Melbourne.",
      "The Chinese Australian electorate have become more \"politically mature\", she says, adding that many may instead consider voting for independent candidates, whom some believe can better advocate for local communities because they do not tow party lines.",
      "\"Based on the last election, they know that their votes are important and have an impact. When they are portrayed negatively, they know they can fight back,\" she says.",
      "Some are frustrated that the community is being \"seen merely for votes\".",
      "\"When Chinese Australians want to be politically involved at a deeper level, we are sometimes cast as suspicious characters,\" says Sydney resident Erin Chew.",
      "She points to how Liberal senator Jane Hume recently accused Asian volunteers for independent MP Monique Ryan of being \"Chinese spies\".",
      "\"This sort of narrative has been normalised by politicians and the media, which is why Australia's political environment is so problematic,\" she says.",
      "These are precisely the concerns that candidates want to address on their social media channels.",
      "In the New South Wales' seat of Bennelong, where nearly one in three people have Chinese ancestry, Liberal contender Scott Yung has his WeChat posts overlayed with Mandarin subtitles and audio translation.",
      "It is likely to help him reach more voters: English proficiency is low - at about 25% to 26% - among Australians who primarily speak Mandarin or Cantonese at home, according to government data.",
      "In 2022, Labor snatched the Liberal stronghold seat for only the second time in more than 70 years. It now holds Bennelong by a razor-thin margin.",
      "A recent clip shows Yung, who runs an education business, stressing what he calls the \"so, so important\" relationship between China and Australia: \"It's important for Australia, it's important for Australian businesses.\"",
      "How the country manages its ties with China has an everyday impact on the lives of Chinese Australians, says Osmond Chiu, a research fellow at the Victoria-based Per Capita think tank.",
      "\"[The community's] concerns will include increased racism, the effect on those who do business with China and what it means for people with family in China,\" he says.",
      "For some voters, the Liberals' campaign blitz on social media does not sync with its anti-migrant rhetoric. \"[Coalition leader] Peter Dutton has talked about slashing migration and international student numbers. We're feeling quite anxious about it,\" says Alex Wang, who works at a restaurant in Reid.",

    "summary": "Foreign policy is rarely a big factor in Australia's poll - but the US president has changed that.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Katy read this article",
      "In Western Sydney, an audience of Stetson-wearing Australians are sitting in their fold-up camping chairs, swigging beers and eating a spiralled fried potato on a skewer known as a 'chip on a stick'.",
      "People here are enjoying bull rides, barrel racing and bucking broncos. It feels like a slice of Americana in New South Wales perhaps - but that would miss the point that here, rodeo has become very much an outback Australian tradition in its own right.",
      "In recent months, politics here in Australia could be compared to watching a rodeo. Between conflict in Europe, the Middle East and more recently US President Donald Trump and his threat of global trade wars, every day has brought with it a sharp jolt that changes the dynamics of the campaign trail. Politicians, like these cowboys, have been thrown off course despite their best efforts.",
      "\"Tariffs are great,\" exclaims rodeo fan Guy Algozzino, who's dressed in a cowboy hat, a waistcoat and a Western-style bolo tie with an engraved image of a cowboy riding a bull. \"We should have had tariff protection many years ago - it looks bad now [but] America's fantastic \u2026 Trump's the best thing America ever had.''",
      "Other spectators are more nuanced.",
      "\"It's going nuts,\" admits Jared Harris, when asked about world politics. \"I'm just sitting back and watching. It's a bit like a show. It's quite interesting to watch, it's entertaining. It probably affects me more than I realise, but I just choose to ignore it.\"",
      "Australia didn't worry too much about President Trump's second coming when he won power back in November. The country had already witnessed a Trump presidency \u2013 and weathered it. Australia felt far removed from the shores of America.",
      "But Trump's second term is panning out very differently. Tariffs - imposed on ally and adversary alike - have travelled the whole world.",
      "Trump doesn't care about making enemies. But Australia does. People here pride themselves on 'mateship' \u2013 a value that embodies friendship and loyalty \u2013 and that extends to politics too.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said as much when Trump initially announced tariffs without exemptions. This was not \"the act of a friend,\" said Albanese, while he also committed to not responding in kind.",
      "All of this comes as the country heads to a federal election on 3 May. Candidates would rather focus on domestic issues they can control: cost-of-living, housing and healthcare. Instead, they are forced to grapple with a question that goes right to the heart of Australia's role in the world: how to deal with a US president as unpredictable as Trump?",
      "'Nowhere else to turn'",
      "In the final few days of campaigning before up to 18 million Australians go to the polls, the Labor Party's Albanese, who entered power three years ago after promising to invest in social services and tackle climate change, went on a speedy tour of six states. That effort appears to be paying off, with the latest YouGov poll putting Labor on 54 per cent of the two-party vote, versus 47 per cent for the opposition Coalition (an alliance of the Liberals and Nationals). This is a modest turnaround from the beginning of the year, when Labor was consistently lagging the Coalition in polls.",
      "\"It's not the campaign either party thought they would be having,\" says Amy Remeikis, chief political analyst at the Australia Institute think tank. \"The looming figure of Trump is overshadowing the domestic campaign but also forcing Australia's leaders to do something they haven't had to do in a long time - examine Australia's links to the US.\"",
      "The US-Australia relationship has perhaps been taken for granted in these parts. Australia likes the fact the US has long been a dominant military force in the Pacific. Australia relies on its funding and benefits from being part of alliances like Aukus - the far-reaching defence pact between Australia, the UK and the US, designed to counter China \u2013 and the Anglo-intelligence alliance Five Eyes.",
      "The rise of China has made Australia even more conscious about having the US on its side. Beijing has expanded its military presence in the Pacific, launching various military exercises in recent years - including one live-fire drill in February that saw Chinese naval vessels just 340 nautical miles from the New South Wales coast. Australia recently announced efforts to expand its navy and now hosts four US military bases - decisions fuelled in part by the rise of China.",
      "It's all placed extra value on Canberra's alliance with Washington DC - one that Trump may be throwing into doubt.",
      "Back in February, Trump held a meeting with the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. He was asked whether they would be discussing Aukus.",
      "\"What does that mean?\" Trump asked the reporter. After being given an explanation of Aukus, he continued. \"We'll be discussing that \u2026 we've had a very good relationship with Australia.\"",
      "Australia collectively held its breath, then let it out in a big sigh of relief.",
      "A blip maybe - but an indication perhaps of how little Trump thinks about Australia right now. However, Australia, like much of the world, is thinking about the US.",
      "\"We don't have anywhere else to turn,\" says David Andrews, senior policy advisor at the National Security College, which is part of the Australian National University in Canberra. \"We are physically isolated from everyone. As long as we've had European settlement here, we've always been concerned about the distance [and] isolation, which is why we've always maintained such a strong relationship with first Britain and then the US as the dominant maritime power.\"",
      "While only 5% of Australia's exports go to the US (China is by far Australia's biggest trading partner), the US still dominates the conversation here.",
      "\"This isn't a time to end alliances,\" says Justin Bassi, director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank. \"That would be cutting off our nose to spite our face.\"",
      "And, perhaps counter to the majority view here, Bassi thinks that Australia should support Trump's moves.",
      "\"We should continue to make it clear that any measures the US takes against Australia are unjustified but we should welcome and support American measures to counter Beijing's malign actions - or for that matter Russia,\" he says. \"Not to keep Trump happy but because it is in Australia's interests to constrain the adversary that is undermining our strategic interests.\"",
      "A poll published by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper last month found that 60% of Australians felt Trump's victory was bad for Australia. That was up from last November when it was just 40%.",
      "And a Lowy Institute poll published two weeks later showed almost two in three Australians held 'not very much' or no trust 'at all' in the US to act responsibly.",
      "An election upended",
      "Big questions on transnational alliances are not part of normal campaigning. But when Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton faced each other in their first televised debate, the first question asked by the audience was one on Trump.",
      "Dutton has long stressed that he would be the politician best suited to dealing with the US President. He often cites his experience as a cabinet minister during tariff negotiations in Trump's first term. But that strategy doesn't always serve him well.",
      "\"He went into the election telling people he and Trump were similar enough that they would get on better, that he was the sort of personality Trump liked,\" says Remeikis. \"He's not repeating that now because people don't want someone to get on with Trump - they want someone who will stand up to him.\"",
      "Dutton has had to do some back-pedalling on comments he made earlier in the year. Back in February, after Trump said he had plans to eject Palestinians from Gaza, Dutton called the US president \"a deal-maker \u2026 a big thinker.\"",
      "And he has come in for some criticism amid accusations of copying the US president. He's talked about cutting public sector jobs, for example. And his Liberal party appointed Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as shadow minister for government efficiency, not too dissimilar to the Doge. But when Senator Price recently started talking about wanting to 'Make Australia Great Again' on the campaign trail, Dutton avoided questions over the comments.",
      "Albanese of course has to tread a careful line too. In a world that's being turned upside down, he's trying to reassure people he's a safe pair of hands; that those alliances remain.",
      "That may turn out to be in his favour.",
      "Indeed, some analysts say that Trump's conduct may be helping Albanese, with voters rushing to support the incumbent during a time of perceived crisis. Just a few months ago, Labor's re-election was thought unlikely as it consistently polled behind the Coalition. But the final YouGov polling model of the election, published a few days ago, predicted that Labor will win 84 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives - an increased majority.",
      "For Professor Gordon Flake, CEO at Perth USAsia Centre, a think tank, it paints a stark parallel with this week's election result in Canada - in which the Liberal Party won re-election by riding a backlash of anti-Trump sentiment.",
      "\"What we have seen in Canada has been a dramatic shift back towards the incumbent government and that is a rallying around the flag based on attacks on that country,\" he says.",
      "\"The attacks on Australia haven't been as severe so it's not the same degree, but at the same time you're also seeing a rallying around the current Labor government. Six months ago you thought their re-election would be unlikely; today on the cusp of the election here in Australia, it seems more likely than not - and one of the important factors in that has been developments in Washington DC. \"",
      "But whoever wins, they will have a big job on their hands to navigate Australia's future with its allies.",
      "\"We have to make do with the hand we've been dealt,\" says Andrews. \"I expect that we are going to have to be much more ruthlessly self-interested and that's not comfortable because our foreign policy has generally been based around cooperation, collaboration and multilateralism \u2013 so that shared sense of threat that middle powers have of working together to maximise their output.\"",
      "Back at the rodeo, the sun's gone down, the cheerleaders are out and the audience gets ready to watch bucking broncos \u2013 the riders shortly afterwards holding on to their steer for as long as possible before being violently thrown to the ground.",
      "Flying above the arena are the flags of Canada and the US, alongside Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. There may not be much of a team spirit among allies right now - but voters here will be keen to see how their next leader rides out the storm.",
      "Xi's real test is not Trump's trade war",
      "There are signs Trump could be ready to retreat on tariffs",

    "story": [
      "Shabir Ahmad Dar, a resident of Indian-administered Kashmir, has been selling pashmina shawls for more than 20 years.",
      "The intricately embroidered featherweight scarves are a favourite with his customers in Mussoorie, a hill town in the northern state of Uttarakhand, where he works.",
      "For his buyers, the shawls are a sign of luxury. For Dar, they are a metaphor for home; its traditional patterns layered with history and a mark of his Kashmiri identity.",
      "But lately, the same identity feels like a curse.",
      "On Sunday, Dar, along with another salesman, was publicly harassed and assaulted by members of a Hindu right-wing group, who were reportedly incensed by the killing of 26 people at a popular tourist spot in Kashmir last week. India has blamed Pakistan for the attack - a charge Islamabad denies.",
      "A video of the assault shows the men thrashing and hurling abuses at Dar and his friend as they ransack their stall, located on a busy boulevard.",
      "\"They blamed us for the attack, told us to leave town and never show our faces again,\" said Dar.",
      "He says his goods, worth thousands of dollars, are still lying there. \"But we are too scared to go back.\"",
      "As outrage over the assault spread, police on Wednesday arrested the three men but released them a few hours later after charging a fine and asking them to \"apologise\" to Dar and his colleague.",
      "But Dar had already left by then, along with dozens of other Kashmiri shawl sellers, who, after living in Mussoorie for decades, say they no longer feel safe there.",
      "Many survivors of the Pahalgam attack -  the deadliest targeting civilians in recent years - said the militants specifically targeted Hindu men, sparking an outpouring of anger and grief in India, with politicians across party lines demanding strict action.",
      "Since then, there have been more than a dozen reports of Kashmiri vendors and students in Indian cities facing harassment, vilification and threats from right-wing groups - but also from their own classmates, customers and neighbours. Videos showing students being chased out of campus and beaten up on the streets have been cascading online.",
      "On Thursday, one of the survivors, whose naval officer husband was killed in the militant attack, appealed to people to not go after Muslims and Kashmiris. \"We want peace and only peace,\" she said.",
      "But safety concerns have forced many Kashmiris like Dar to return home.",
      "Ummat Shabir, a nursing student at a university in Punjab state, said some women in her neighbourhood accused her of being a \"terrorist who should be thrown out\" last week.",
      "\"The same day, my classmate was forced out of a taxi by her driver after he found out she was a Kashmiri,\" she said. \"It took us three days to travel back to Kashmir but we had no option. We had to go.\"",
      "Ms Shabir is back in her hometown but for many others, even home does not feel safe anymore.",
      "As the search for the perpetrators of last week's attack continues, security forces in Kashmir have detained thousands of people, shut off more than 50 tourist destinations, sent in additional army and paramilitary troops, and blown up several homes belonging to families of suspected militants who they accuse of having \"terrorist affiliations\".",
      "The crackdown has sparked fear and unease among civilians, many of whom have called the actions a form of \"collective punishment\" against them.",
      "Without mentioning the demolitions, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said the guilty must be punished without mercy, \"but don't let innocent people become collateral damage\". Former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti also criticised the demolitions, cautioning the government to distinguish between \"terrorists and civilians\".",
      "\"Whenever tensions escalate, we are the first ones to bear the brunt of it. But we are still treated as suspects and expected to put our lives on hold,\" another student, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC.",
      "Yet the backlash feels a lot worse this time, says Shafi Subhan, a shawl seller from the region's Kupwara district, who also worked in Mussoorie.",
      "In his 20 years of doing business there, Subhan said he had never faced any public threat - not even after the 2019 terror attack in Pulwama district, which killed 40 paramilitary police troopers.",
      "To him, Mussoorie felt like home, a place where he found peace - despite being hundreds of kilometres away. He said he shared an emotional bond with his customers, who came from all parts of the country",
      "\"People were always kind to us, they wore our garments with so much joy,\" Subhan recalled. \"But on that day when our colleagues were attacked, no one came to help. The public just stood and watched. It hurt them physically - but emotionally, a lot more.\"",
      "Back home in Kashmir, peace has long been fragile. Both India and Pakistan claim the territory in full but administer separate parts, and an armed insurgency has simmered in the Indian-administered region for more than three decades, claiming thousands of lives.",
      "Caught in between, are civilians who say they feel stuck in an endless limbo that feels especially suffocating, whenever ties between India and Pakistan come under strain.",
      "Many allege that in the past, military confrontations between the nations have been followed by waves of harassment and violence against Kashmiris, along with a significant security and communication clampdown in the region.",
      "In recent years, violence has declined, and officials point to improved infrastructure, tourism, and investment as signs of greater stability, particularly since 2019, when the region's special constitutional status was revoked under Article 370.",
      "But arrests and security operations continue, and critics argue that calm has come at the cost of civil liberties and political freedoms.",
      "\"The needle of suspicion is always on locals, even as militancy has declined in the last one-and-a-half decades,\" says Anuradha Bhasin, the managing editor of the Kashmir Times newspapers. \"They always have to prove their innocence.\"",
      "As the news of the killings spread last week, Kashmiris poured onto the streets, holding candlelight vigils and protest marches. A complete shutdown was observed a day after the attack and newspapers printed black front pages. Omar Abdullah publicly apologised, saying he had \"failed his guests\".",
      "Ms Bhasin says Kashmiri backlash against such attacks is not new; there has been similar condemnation in the past as well, although at a smaller scale. \"No one there condones civilian killings - they know the pain of losing loved ones too well.\"",
      "But she adds that it's unfair to place the burden of proving innocence on Kashmiris, when they have themselves become targets of hate and violence. \"This would just instil more fear and further alienate people, many of whom already feel isolated from the rest of the country.\"",
      "Mirza Waheed, a Kashmiri novelist, believes Kashmiris are \"particularly vulnerable as they are seen through a different lens\", being part of India's Muslim population.",
      "\"The saddest part is many of them will suffer the indignity and humiliation, lay low for some time, and wait for this to tide over because they have a life to live.\"",
      "No one knows this better Mohammad Shafi Dar, a daily wage worker in Kashmir's Shopian, whose house was blown up by security forces last week.",
      "Five days on, he is still picking the up the pieces.",
      "\"We lost everything,\" said Dar, who is now living under the open sky with his wife, three daughters and son. \"We don't even have utensils to cook food.\"",
      "He says his family has no idea where their other 20-year-old son is, whether he joined militancy, or is even dead or alive. His parents say the college student left home last October and never returned. They haven't spoken since.",
      "\"Yet, we have been punished for his alleged crimes. Why?\""

      "\"In the past we used to cook rice with meat - with protein. Now, because of the closure, there's no type of meat, no fresh vegetables.\"",
      "Two months after Israel cut off all supplies from entering Gaza, Mr Matar is warning that the few dozen remaining food kitchens are set to close in days.",
      "\"The coming days will be critical. We expect we have two weeks' supply, maybe less.\"",
      "On 2 March, Israel shut all crossings to Gaza - preventing all goods, including food, fuel and medicines from entering - and resumed its military offensive two weeks later, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. It said these steps were meant to put pressure on Hamas to release the hostages it still holds.",
      "Recently, the UN's World Food Programme and Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said they had used up all their stocks of food aid.",
      "There is growing international pressure on Israel to lift its blockade, with warnings that mass starvation could be imminent and that intentionally starving civilians is a war crime.",
      "\"Aid, and the civilian lives it saves, should never be a bargaining chip,\" the UN's humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, warned on Thursday.",
      "\"Blocking aid starves civilians. It leaves them without basic medical support. It strips them of dignity and hope. It inflicts a cruel collective punishment. Blocking aid kills.\"",
      "Hundreds of thousands of Gazans depend on a few dozen remaining kitchens for sustenance. The one run by Anera in Khan Younis feeds some 6,000 people a day.",
      "But if Israel does not lift its blockade, by far the longest it has ever imposed on Gaza, the kitchens - a last lifeline for so many - will soon have nothing to distribute. Food stockpiled during the ceasefire at the start of this year, has all but run out.",
      "\"We used to receive more than 100 trucks every week - trucks of food parcels and hygiene kits. Now we don't have anything,\" Mr Matar says as he shows a local BBC journalist around the vast, empty Anera warehouse.",
      "\"We struggle to provide food such as rice, lentils, pasta, cooking oil and salt, for our community kitchens. It's very expensive to buy 1kg of wood and we need over 700kg a day for cooking.\"",
      "Israel has accused Hamas of stealing and storing humanitarian aid to give to its fighters or sell to raise money. The UN and other agencies deny aid has been diverted and say that they have strict monitoring mechanisms.",
      "\"We work hard to avoid any interference from any parties. We have an accurate and strong distribution process,\" says Mr Matar, inspecting lists of aid recipients on his computer.",
      "\"We have a database of hundreds of thousands of people, including their names, ID numbers and addresses - the co-ordinates of the camps. This avoids duplication with the work of other non-governmental organisations and ensures transparency.\"",
      "This week, aid workers have said there were five cases of looting at warehouses and the main Unrwa complex in Gaza.",
      "A UN official said it was a sign of people's growing desperation and \"systemic collapse\".",
      "UN's top court begins hearings on Israel's legal duties towards Palestinians",
      "UN agency runs out of food aid in Gaza after Israeli blockade",
      "'It's really hard to have any hope': Gaza doctor describes daily struggle",
      "Back in the outdoor kitchen, Mr Matar tests the food from the steaming pots to check its quality. Parcels are wrapped up for distribution; each can serve up to four people.",
      "All the workers receive food for their own hungry families.",
      "The rest is soon transferred on the donkey cart through the bustling streets to al-Mawasi, a crowded tent camp for displaced people on the coast, where dozens of field monitors supervise the hand-out.",
      "An elderly man walking with crutches looks relieved as he clutches two parcels of koshari to feed his family of seven. \"Thank God, this will be enough,\" he says.",
      "\"Don't even ask me about the situation,\" he goes on. \"We're only alive because death hasn't taken us yet. I swear I was searching for a loaf of bread since the morning, and I found none.\"",
      "\"The situation is tragic, and it keeps worsening,\" comments a weary looking mother. \"Life is humiliating here. We have men who are unable to work. There is no income, and all the products are so expensive. We're unable to buy anything.\"",
      "\"At this time, this is excellent,\" she says of the warm meal she has just been given. \"Because there is no cooking gas, no food. When we want to have a cup of tea, I collect leaves to start a fire.\"",
      "It has now been more than a year and a half since the war in Gaza began, triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel. That assault killed around 1,200 people and more than 250 people were taken hostage. Some 59 are still held captive, with up to 24 of those believed to be alive.",
      "Israel's military campaign has killed more than 52,400 people in Gaza, mostly women, children and the elderly, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. More than 90% of the 2.1 million population has been displaced - with many forced to flee multiple times.",
      "The UN has warned that the current situation \"is likely the worst it has been\" due to the blockade, the renewed offensive and evacuation orders that have displaced some 500,000 people since 18 March.",
      "There is growing international pressure on Israel to lift its blockade, with warnings that intentionally starving civilians is a potential war crime. The UN says that Israel has a clear obligation under international law as an occupying power to allow and facilitate aid for Gazans.",
      "Last Friday, US President Donald Trump said he had told Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu that \"we've got to be good to Gaza\" and pushed him to allow more food and medicine into the strip.",
      "There was no official response to that, but earlier in the week, the Israeli foreign ministry rejected criticism from the UK, France and Germany, which described the blockade as \"intolerable\" in a joint statement and insisting \"this must end.\"",
      "The ministry said more than 25,000 lorries carrying almost 450,000 tonnes of goods had entered Gaza during the ceasefire. It added: \"Israel is monitoring the situation on the ground, and there is no shortage of aid.\"",
      "Israeli officials have indicated they plan to overhaul the aid distribution system.",
      "For now, supplies are piling up at Gaza's border crossings waiting to be brought in, while inside the territory, aid workers carefully ration what is left of their stock.",
      "In al-Mawasi camp, children gather playfully around Sami Matar and the Anera workers giving out the last of the day's food parcels.",
      "Many are painfully thin, with new warnings of acute malnutrition in Gaza - especially among the young.",
      "\"I don't know what will happen if our supplies end,\" says Mr Matar, weighed down by the responsibility of his work.",
      "\"The feeling of having to stop this vital help to people would be so stressful and depressing to me and my staff.\"",
      "\"We have an urgent appeal,\" he continues. \"Look at us, see our desperation, understand that time is running out. Please we just need to open the crossings again.\""

    "story": [
      "It sounds like it could be the plot of a spy novel, but the 'Shetland Bus' was a real undercover operation carried out to help the resistance in Nazi-occupied Norway during World War Two.",
      "In the depths of winter and under the cover of darkness, convoys of small fishing boats left the safety of Scotland's most northerly islands to deliver valuable cargo and special agents to coves and fishing ports 200 miles away along the coast of Norway.",
      "On the perilous return journeys, refugees fleeing the occupation were hidden in the hold of the fishing boats, as they sought sanctuary in the British Isles.",
      "To commemorate the 80th Anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE) Day, six of the historic ships that formed part of the Shetland Bus convoys will set sail again from Bergen in Norway to replicate the journey back to Shetland.",
      "They plan to arrive in Lerwick on Tuesday in time for the VE Day commemorations.",
      "Norway was invaded by Nazi Germany on 8 April 1940, a few months before the full occupation of France.",
      "The Norwegian government and its Royal Family, including King Haakon VII, were forced into exile in London and thousands of Norwegian people followed in fishing boats and other small vessels, crossing the North Sea to seek refuge in the UK.",
      "In July 1940, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill set up a clandestine organisation called the Special Operations Executive (SOE) with the sole aim of carrying out espionage and sabotage missions across German-occupied Europe.",
      "The Shetland Bus convoys were part of the Norwegian branch of the SOE, supporting the resistance movement in Norway.",
      "Between 1940 and 1945, they made 200 North Sea crossings, transporting hundreds of resistance agents, tonnes of weapons and supplies, and rescuing more than 300 Norwegian refugees fleeing the occupation.",
      "The 200-mile crossings took place in winter to make the most of the hours of darkness and avoid being spotted by German patrols.",
      "But this meant that the sea was often treacherous.",
      "The crews and passengers on board had to endure not only heavy North Sea conditions, but also the constant risk of discovery by German aircraft or patrol boats.",
      "On 27 September 1941, the MK Arnefjord left the small island of Hernar, to the north-west of Bergen, carrying 20 refugees.",
      "Although the weather started off calm, they soon encountered a raging storm. Everyone onboard was seasick and some discussed turning back.",
      "Eventually the Arnefjord made it safely across and delivered crews and passengers to the island of Mousa in Shetland.",
      "But others were not so lucky. Of the six boats that crossed the North Sea with the Arnefjord that weekend, only four made it.",
      "In total, 10 fishing boats were lost during the Shetland Bus convoys and 44 men lost their lives.",
      "The current skipper of the MK Arnefjord, Morten Neset, will be making the return journey back to Shetland as part of the VE Day commemorations.",
      "He told BBC Scotland News that the boats had to make the crossings in the winter or late autumn to avoid being detected by the Germans.",
      "\"If they crossed on a clear summer day, they would be spotted straight away,\" he said.",

    "summary": "What this will and won't change for US assistance to Ukraine, three years into the war.",
    "story": [
      "The US and Ukraine have signed a deal that will give Washington access to some of the war-torn country's natural resources.",
      "Months in the making, it sets up an investment fund that Ukraine hopes will cement US assistance as the country struggles to repel Russia three years after the invasion.",
      "The Ukrainians have now published the deal and there have been public statements from both sides. Here are seven key takeaways.",
      "No Ukrainian payback to US",
      "Trump has previously demanded that Ukraine pay back the $350bn (\u00a3264bn) of aid that he claims has been provided by the US during the war - a condition that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected.",
      "But Washington appears to have made a concession. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said the agreement did not dictate that his country pay back any supposed \"debt\".",
      "Follow reaction to deal as it happensWhat minerals does Ukraine have?",
      "Follow reaction to deal as it happens",
      "What minerals does Ukraine have?",
      "Trump has styled the agreement as a win for his side as well, saying his country will get back \"much more in theory\" than the billions that were provided to Ukraine by his predecessor Joe Biden.",
      "Tougher tone from US towards Putin",
      "The language used by the US in announcing the deal is notably harsher towards Russia than is usually the case from the Trump administration.",
      "The agreement refers to \"Russia's full-scale invasion\" and the US Treasury Department adds that \"no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine\".",
      "This will hearten Kyiv, which has demanded more pressure be placed on Russia in talks between Moscow and Washington discussing a possible ceasefire.",
      "Oil and gas included alongside minerals",
      "Despite the fact that much of the talk around the deal relates to Ukraine's mineral wealth, the agreement also includes provisions for oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbons.",
      "In all cases, the resources stay in Ukrainian ownership, even though the US will get joint access.",
      "The inclusion of oil and gas has been seen as a softening of the Ukrainian position, since they were not in earlier drafts of the deal.",
      "Senior administration officials told reporters they believe that \"more value\" can be derived from these resources if the fighting ends quickly.",
      "No hindrance to Kyiv's EU ambitions",
      "Ukraine has long aspired to join the European Union and accession talks formally began last June.",
      "There were some concerns in Kyiv that the resources deal could hinder Ukraine's ability to join the EU, if it gave preferential treatment to US investors, as Kyiv and Brussels already have a strategic partnership on raw materials.",
      "But the deal's text says that the US acknowledges Ukraine's intention to join the EU and the need for this agreement not to conflict with that.",
      "It also says that if Ukraine needs to revisit the terms of the deal because of \"additional obligations\" as part of joining the EU, then the US agrees to negotiate in good faith.",
      "Additionally, Kyiv says the US will support additional transfers of investment and technology in Ukraine, including from the EU and elsewhere.",
      "A US military commitment back on table...",
      "The US has framed the deal as an essential one to sign if Ukraine is to continue to receive its military assistance.",
      "Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko - who flew to Washington DC to sign the deal - said it envisaged the US contributing new assistance in the future, such as air defence systems.",
      "How much has US given to Ukraine?",
      "How much has US given to Ukraine?",
      "This, too, would mark a change in strategy for Trump - who has sought to wind down military support for Ukraine since returning to the White House.",
      "One outstanding question is what the accord will ultimately mean for the state of the war. The Kremlin has not yet responded to the agreement.",
      "...but US can still walk away any time",
      "It appears there are no concrete security guarantees from the US, which is something Ukraine and Europe have long been pushing the White House to provide.",
      "Trump has long been reluctant to give the same military commitment that Biden had given.",
      "Instead, his interest in staying the course with US support for Ukraine is more implicit, due to the economic commitments set out in this deal.",
      "That means there would still be a fragility about the commitment of Ukraine's most important ally.",
      "Profits to be reinvested in Ukraine?",
      "One intriguing point highlighted by Ukraine's government is that for the first decade of the reconstruction investment fund, profits will be \"fully reinvested in Ukraine's economy\", either in new projects or reconstruction.",
      "This could be potentially significant if there is no financial benefit for the US for 10 years.",
      "However, this provision does not appear to be in the agreement signed in Washington, although it might later be part of an additional \"technical\" deal.  Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on social media that \"these terms will be subject to further discussion\".",
      "After that initial 10-year period, Kyiv says profits may be distributed between the partners.",
      "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News late on Wednesday that the deal was a signal to the American people that \"we have a chance to participate, get some of the funding and the weapons, compensation for those and be partners with the success of the Ukraine people\".",
      "Speaking at the White House on Thursday, Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller described the deal as \"repayment\" to the US for the  \"hundreds of billions of dollars that our taxpayers suspect subsidised the war\"."

    "story": [
      "Israel's war in Gaza grinds on, but opposition is growing.",
      "In recent weeks, thousands of Israeli reservists \u2013 from all branches of the military \u2013 have signed letters demanding that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government stop the fighting and concentrate instead on reaching a deal to bring back the remaining 59 hostages being held by Hamas.",
      "Eighteen months ago, few Israelis doubted the war's logic: to defeat Hamas and return the hostages.",
      "For many, the January ceasefire and subsequent return of more than 30 hostages raised hopes that the war might soon end.",
      "But after Israel broke the ceasefire and returned to war in mid-March, those hopes were dashed.",
      "\"We came to the conclusion that Israel is going to a very bad place,\" Danny Yatom, a former head of the spy agency Mossad told me.",
      "\"We understand that what mainly bothers Netanyahu is his own interests. And in the list of priorities, his interests and the interests of having the government stable are the first ones, and not the hostages.\"",
      "Many of those signing recent letters are, like Yatom, long time critics of the prime minister. Some were involved in the anti-government protests that preceded the outbreak of war on 7 October 2023 following Hamas's attack on Israel.",
      "But Yatom says that's not why he decided to speak out.",
      "\"I signed my name and I am participating in the demonstrations not because of any political reason, but because of a national reason,\" he said.",
      "\"I am highly concerned that my country is going to lose its way.\"",
      "The first open letter to be published, in early April, was signed by 1,000 air force reservists and retirees.",
      "\"The continuation of the war does not contribute to any of its declared goals,\" they wrote, \"and will lead to the death of the hostages\".",
      "The signatories urged Israelis to follow their lead before time ran out on the estimated 24 hostages still thought to be alive in Gaza.",
      "\"Every day that passes is further risking their lives. Every moment of hesitation is a crying shame.\"",
      "In the weeks since, similar letters have appeared from almost every branch of the military, including elite fighting and intelligence units, along with a number of decorated commanders.",
      "More than 12,000 signatures all.",
      "After 7 October, hundreds of thousands of Israeli reservists answered the call, eager to serve.",
      "But now, more and more are refusing, with reports suggesting that reserve attendance has dropped to as little as 50-60%.",
      "Anti-Hamas protests on rise in Gaza as group's iron grip slips",
      "As an Israeli hostage turns 48, his wife waits for blue ticks on her messages",
      "'Part of us is still in Gaza': Freed Israeli hostages fight for a new ceasefire",
      "For a military that depends heavily on reservists to fight its wars, it's a looming crisis on a scale not seen since Israel's first Lebanon war in 1982.",
      "In a leafy Jerusalem park, I met \"Yoav\" (not his real name), an infantry reservist who asked not to be identified.",
      "Yoav served in Gaza last summer but said he wouldn't do it again.",
      "\"I had the feeling that I needed to go to help my brothers and sisters,\" he told me.",
      "\"I believed I was doing something good. Complicated but good. But now, I don't see it in the same way anymore.\"",
      "The government's determination to keep fighting Hamas, while hostages risk death in the tunnels of Gaza, Yoav said, was misplaced.",
      "\"We are very strong and we can beat Hamas, but it's not about beating Hamas,\" he said. \"It's about losing our country.\"",
      "During his time in Gaza, Yoav told me, he tried to be \"the best moral soldier that a man can be\".",
      "But the longer the war goes on, critics say, the harder it is for Israel to claim, as government officials often do, that its military is the most moral army in the world.",
      "In a recent column in the left of centre newspaper Haaretz, the retired general Amiram Levin said it was time for soldiers \u2013 starting with senior commanders - to think about disobeying orders.",

      "Netanyahu has lashed out at the protesters, dismissing their concerns as \"propaganda lies\", spread by \"a small handful of fringe elements \u2013 loud, anarchist and disconnected pensioners, most of whom haven't served in years\".",
      "But polls suggest the protest letters reflect a growing public conviction: that the release of the remaining hostages should come before everything.",
      "In Tel Aviv, where noisy anti-war demonstrations have been held for well over a year, images of the hostages are held aloft, while other protestors sit on the road, cradling pictures of Palestinian children killed during the war.",
      "Amid the row generated by the letters, such emotive displays appear to have rattled the authorities.",
      "On 20 April, the police briefly told protesters that \"pictures of children or babies from Gaza\" would not be permitted, along with posters displaying the words \"genocide\" or \"ethnic cleansing\".",
      "Following expressions of outrage from the organisers, the police quickly backed down.",
      "Meanwhile, the prime minister continues to speak of his determination to defeat Hamas.",
      "Military pressure, Netanyahu continues to insist, is the only way to bring the hostages home."

      "Cut to a snappy montage of them fist-bumping each other and mingling with residents at community events, as the song's chorus delivers their political message: \"I'll be there for you\".",
      "It's one of the many social media videos posted by Singapore's long-ruling People's Action Party (PAP) as the country gears up for the general election on Saturday.",
      "One of the longest-serving political parties in the world, the PAP has governed Singapore since 1959 and is widely associated with stability.",
      "But even as it continues to win elections with comfortable majorities, the PAP has also faced declining popularity over the last two decades.",
      "In recent years the party has embarked on a mission to revamp its straitlaced, no-nonsense image, particularly to attract younger voters who have typically been more sympathetic to the opposition.",
      "This campaign season, PAP ministers better known for stilted pre-written speeches have also been filming skits with social media influencers and sitting down for long conversations on podcasts. The party has even launched a special edition of the viral Labubu doll dressed in their white uniform.",
      "Leading the PAP in his first election since he took office as prime minister, Lawrence Wong boasts a significant online portfolio.",
      "On his social media accounts he has been showing off his guitar skills and discussing the national budget at a cat cafe. His recent visit to Vietnam was recapped on TikTok over a techno rave soundtrack.",
      "Other ministers in his cabinet have also ramped up their efforts: in an online video series with a local actor, culture minister Edwin Tong played barista and served  coffees; meanwhile health minister Ong spent a day as an trainee at a local radio station.",
      "Numerous Singaporean influencers have put out content featuring PAP faces, in what appears to be a concerted party effort to connect with a younger audience. Last June, local influencers and celebrities attended a PAP event that publicised their alignment with the party.",
      "Valerie Tan Su Min, a content creator who makes satirical videos about politics but does not work with political parties, told the BBC that efforts such as collaborations with influencers could seal the deal for some young voters.",
      "\"If they had not done their own research or realised the gravity of their vote, it's very possible that they might see one or two videos and be like, 'OK that's who I vote for,'\" she said.",
      "There's little doubt that the PAP, which has long held an overwhelming parliamentary majority, will continue to govern after this election.",
      "It has enjoyed strong support from Singaporeans, particularly from older generations that have personally seen the country flourish under PAP rule.",
      "But while elections have been free from fraud and irregularities, critics also say the party maintains an unfair advantage through gerrymandering and a tightly controlled media.",
      "Still, in the last three elections, the party has experienced two of its worst-ever showings at the polls - a little over 60% of the popular vote.",
      "With an ageing support base, the key to the PAP's future victories is young people.",
      "\"Candidates from different political parties have taken to social media like never before,\" says Carol Soon, associate professor in communications and new media at the National University of Singapore, adding that the medium is \"increasingly assuming a 'broadcasting' nature\".",

      "Some have turned awkward moments of their campaigns into social media gold. One of the most popular memes this election, \"look left look right\", stems from a song by an opposition candidate lamenting his dismal job prospects. After it went viral, he released a follow-up song about the lack of affordable housing.",
      "Social media has always been particularly important to opposition parties in Singapore, where the PAP government exerts significant control over mainstream media. It's also a medium that has become especially popular after a quarantine election in 2020 limited in-person campaigning.",
      "But the opposition's efforts have been dwarfed by the PAP's, thanks to its deep pockets.",
      "\"Resources still matter when it comes to digital campaigning,\" says Netina Tan, associate professor of political science at McMaster University, who noted that the \"resource-rich\" PAP can afford to \"amp up their digital campaign...and put out fancy Insta videos\".",
      "Rae Fung, a 28-year-old speaking coach, said she was paying extra attention to local podcasts featuring politicians as guests.",
      "\"It's very hard to lie about your expertise on a podcast. Because it goes really deep and usually it's not too edited,\" she said. \"It helps me understand their thought process and who they are as a person.\"",
      "\"Most of the candidates I've seen, they're doing enough on social media to reach us,\"  she said. But \"how they show up and who they are as a person is a lot more important than their social media game.\"",

      "There has also been growing uncertainty about job prospects and the economy. Singapore's authorities and economists have warned of the fallout and a possible technical recession from the US-China trade war and US President Donald Trump's global tariffs.",
      "The PAP government has tried to address these worries. Besides providing subsidised housing for first-time buyers, it has increased the supply of public flats and issued subsidies and cash vouchers to help with childcare and daily expenses. Opposition parties argue they can do more.",
      "At a recent PAP election rally, one 37-year-old attendee who declined to be named said that while he was \"not very confident\" that the PAP would be able to lead the country out of the global economic uncertainty, his \"confidence level is even lower\" for the opposition.",

    "summary": "One man's struggle to save Uganda's once-profitable trees that produce shea butter.",
    "story": [
      "A former biology teacher-turned-environmentalist is on a crusade in Uganda to save the once-flourishing trees from which shea butter is made - the cosmetic known as \"women's gold\".",
      "Mustafa Gerima wants local communities to stop chopping down the trees to make charcoal - which they say is more profitable than the oil, also used in cooking, that is extracted from its fruit.",
      "He gave up teaching to dedicate himself to the trees when he returned home six years ago and was shocked to find the Mount Kei Central Forest Reserve, once lush with wild shea trees, had been turned into a near-barren expanse dotted with stumps.",
      "Now nicknamed \"Bwana Shea\" or Mr Shea, he walks from village to village in the north-west of the country rallying people to protect what he sees as a vanishing treasure.",
      "Local people, he said, had lost interest in the trees and began chopping them down as farmers were experiencing failed harvests.",
      "\"Thirty years ago, the shea nut tree had a pattern of its production. It flowered in December then by the time it reached April, it would be ready,\" Mr Gerima told the BBC.",
      "\"But now because of climate change there is this prolonged drought. Hence it affects the production of shea nuts.\"",
      "The growing popularity of charcoal from the shea nut tree has made the situation worse. It is said to burn for longer than other charcoal.",
      "\"Our community is affected by poverty. So they look at the tree as a cheap alternative source of income,\" Mr Gerima said.",
      "Uganda is losing an estimated 100,000 hectares (250,000 acres) of forest cover each year, and a significant portion of that includes shea nut trees, according to the country's environment ministry.",
      "Shea trees grow in the wild from West to East Africa - a vast strip known as the \"shea belt\". But the shea tree population has dramatically  plummeted in recent year, it says.",
      "This loss, combined with the poor harvests, has had a direct impact on people like Mariam Chandiru, a local shea butter producer for many years in the northern town of Koboko.",
      "\"We would get good money to take our children to school and take care of our families. But now my business is collapsing, it is a huge setback,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"I used to sell up to five jerry cans of shea oil a week, right now I can only fill two jerry cans at most.\"",
      "It has traditionally been women who have gathered the nuts of the shea tree to produce Nilotica shea butter, prized globally for its cosmetic and culinary uses.",
      "Professor John Bosco Okullo, a leading agroforestry expert from Uganda's Makerere University who has been studying shea nut trees for more than two decades, also blames years of widespread insecurity for the problems.",
      "\"In the 1990s, communities used to own and protect the shea trees,\" the academic, who is part of a European Union project aiming to conserve and utilise the tree, told the BBC.",
      "This was before much of the north of the country was ravaged by a rebel group called the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), led by Joseph Kony, whose fighters were notorious for abducting children - forcing the boys to become fighters and keeping the girls as sex slaves.",
      "The rebels have largely been wiped out, but nearly 20 years of conflict drove people to leave their villages and find safety in camps.",
      "Other communities were affected by dangerous cattle raids - also leading to the displacement of thousands of people in the early 2000s.",
      "\"After cattle raiding and civil unrest by the Lord's Resistance Army displaced people, the sense of ownership was lost,\" said Prof Okullo",
      "\"When people returned, they adapted to short-term gains like charcoal burning.\"",
      "Prof Okullo agrees with Mr Gerima that climate change has further exacerbated the situation.",
      "\"The productivity has gone down. The trees are not flowering and fruiting the way they used to. Rain fluctuation has disrupted the shea tree's natural cycles,\" he said.",
      "Rapid urban expansion is another threat.",
      "\"Most of these places which used to have shea trees now have new districts, new hospitals, schools,\" Prof Okullo said.",
      "\"You find the shea trees are being cut for development. We need affirmative planting. Otherwise, if we are waiting for natural regeneration, it is going to be difficult.\"",
      "Despite what seems like a gloomy outlook, Prof Okullo takes heart from campaigners such as Mr Gerima.",
      "The former teacher's most widely known initiative involved a 19-day, 644km (400-mile) walk in 2020.",
      "He trekked from Uganda's capital, Kampala, to the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) headquarters in Nairobi, capital of neighbouring Kenya.",
      "\"Right now, there are a lot of NGOs mobilising communities,\" Prof Okullo said.",
      "\"People are planting new trees and protecting those regenerating from stumps.",
      "\"Some are even using grafting techniques to shorten the juvenile phase - it used to take 15 to 20 years before fruiting, now some trees are fruiting much earlier.\"",
      "To meet rising demand and support sustainable supply chains, the professor and his colleagues are embracing technology.",
      "\"We are teaming up with our colleagues in computer science and physics to use Artificial Intelligence so that we can map the mature shea trees and try to project the yield,\" he said.",
      "The Ugandan government has also recognised the vulnerability of the shea nut tree. In 2023, it made the cutting down of trees for charcoal illegal.",
      "But enforcement has been patchy.",
      "\"There was a presidential order to stop cutting shea trees, but it's been difficult to implement,\" Prof Okullo said.",
      "\"The demand for charcoal is highest in urban areas. Those who cut the trees aren't the ones using the charcoal. We need to provide alternative energy sources for cities to reduce the demand.\"",
      "For Mr Gerima, it remains a personal issue.",
      "\"Seeing people cut the tree has always caused me a lot of pain in my heart,\" he said.",
      "He continues his long walks to raise awareness, speaking to local councils, organising planting drives.",
      "\"This must not be one man's issue - it must bring in a concerted effort, a collective responsibility.\"",
      "His next steps include launching a grassroots tree-monitoring initiative and partnering with schools to integrate conservation into the local curriculum.",
      "He says his mission is not just to save a tree but to preserve a way of life.",
      "\"We need to think about our future generations. If they come and only find stumps, what will they think of us?\"",

      "After joining Bessent at a signing ceremony, Svyrydenko listed its provisions on social media.",
      "Posting on X, she said the deal establishes a reconstruction investment fund to help attract Western investment in Ukrainian projects in minerals, oil and gas.",
      "She says the resources will remain the property of Ukraine, and Kyiv will choose where to do the extracting.",

      "This includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "Ukraine also has significant deposits of titanium and lithium. It says it has substantial amounts of the world's rare earth metals - a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world - but these claims are disputed.",
      "Also, some of the country's mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Svyrydenko, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.",
      "There are warnings too that a deal allowing the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth cannot happen unless the country addresses its problem with unexploded mines.",
      "A quarter of Ukraine's land mass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country.",

    "story": [
      "Listen to Laura read this article",
      "If you say the name Donald Trump in the halls of wholesale markets and trade fairs in China, you'll hear a faint chuckle.",
      "The US president and his 145% tariffs have not instilled fear in many Chinese traders.",
      "Instead, they have inspired an army of online Chinese nationalists to create mocking memes in a series of viral videos and reels \u2013 some of which include an AI-generated President Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and tech mogul Elon Musk toiling on footwear and iPhone assembly lines.",
      "China is not behaving like a nation facing the prospect of economic pain and President Xi Jinping has made it clear that Beijing will not back down.",
      "\"For more than 70 years, China has always relied on self-reliance and hard work for development\u2026 it has never relied on anyone's gifts and is unafraid of any unreasonable suppression,\" he said this month.",
      "His confidence may come in part because China is far less dependent than it was 10 years ago on exports to the US. But the truth is Trump's brinkmanship and tariff hikes are pushing on pressure points that already exist within China's own struggling economy. With a housing crisis, increasing job insecurity and an ageing population, Chinese people are simply not spending as much as their government would like.",
      "Xi came to power in 2012 with a dream of a rejuvenated China. That is now being severely tested \u2013 and not just by US tariffs. Now, the question is whether or not Trump's tariffs will dampen Xi's economic dreams, or can he turn the obstacles that exist into opportunities?",
      "Xi's domestic challenges",
      "With a population of 1.4 billion, China has, in theory, a huge domestic market. But there's a problem. They don't appear willing to spend money while the country's economic outlook is uncertain.",
      "This has not been prompted by the trade war \u2013 but by the collapse of the housing market. Many Chinese families invested their life savings in their homes, only to watch prices plummet in the last five years.",
      "Housing developers continued to build even as the property market crumbled. It's thought that China's entire population would not fill all the empty apartments across the country.",
      "The former deputy head of China's statistics bureau, He Keng, admitted two years ago that the most \"extreme estimate\" is that there are now enough vacant homes for 3 billion people.",
      "Travel round Chinese provinces and you see they are littered with empty projects \u2013 lines of towering concrete shells that have been labelled \"ghost cities\". Others have been fitted out, the gardens have been landscaped, curtains frame the windows, and they appear filled with the promise of a new home. But only at night, when you see no lights, can you tell that the apartments are empty. There just aren't enough buyers to match this level of construction.",
      "The government acted five years ago to restrict the amount of money developers could borrow. But the damage to house prices and, in turn, consumer confidence in China, has been done and analysts have projected a 2.5% decline in home prices this year, according to a Reuters poll in February.",
      "And it's not just house prices that worry middle-class Chinese families.",
      "They are concerned about whether the government can offer them a pension \u2013 over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. According to a 2019 estimate by the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government pension fund could run out of money by 2035.",
      "There are also fears about whether their sons, daughters and grandchildren can get a job as millions of college graduates are struggling to find work. More than one in five people between the ages of 16 and 24 in urban areas are jobless in China, according to official data published in August 2023. The government has not released youth unemployment figures since then.",
      "The problem is that China cannot simply flip a switch and move from selling goods to the US to selling them to local buyers.",
      "\"Given the downward pressure on the economy, it is unlikely domestic spending can be significantly expanded in the short term,\" says Prof Nie Huihua at Renmin University.",
      "\"Replacing exports with internal demand will take time.\"",
      "According to Prof Zhao Minghao, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, \"China does not have high expectations for talks with the Trump administration\u2026 The real battleground is in the adjustment of China's domestic policies, such as boosting domestic demand.\"",
      "To revive a slowing economy, the government has announced billions in childcare subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave. It has also introduced a $41bn programme offering discounts on items such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) to encourage more people to spend. But Prof Zhang Jun, the Dean of Economics at Fudan University, believes this is not \"sustainable\".",
      "\"We need a long-term mechanism,\" he says. \"We need to start increasing residents' disposable income.\"",
      "This is urgent for Xi. The dream of prosperity he sold when he took power 13 years ago has not become reality.",
      "A political test for Xi",
      "Xi is also aware that China has a disheartened younger generation worried about their future. That could spell bigger trouble for the Communist Party: protests or unrest.",
      "A report by Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor claims that protests driven by financial grievances saw a steep increase in the last few months.",
      "All protests are quickly subdued and censored on social media, so it is unlikely to pose a real threat to Xi for now.",
      "\"Only when the country does well and the nation does well can every person do well,\" Xi said in 2012.",
      "This promise was made when China's economic rise looked unstoppable. It now looks uncertain.",
      "Where the country has made huge strides over the past decade is in areas such as consumer electronics, batteries, EVs and artificial intelligence as part of a pivot to advanced manufacturing.",
      "It has rivalled US tech dominance with the chatbot DeepSeek and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest EV maker.",
      "Yet Trump's tariffs threaten to throw a spanner in the works.",
      "The restrictions on the sale of key chips to China, including the most recent move tightening exports from US chip giant Nvidia, for instance, are aimed at curbing Xi's ambitions for tech supremacy.",
      "Despite that, Xi knows that Chinese manufacturers are at a decades-long advantage, so that US manufacturers are struggling to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.",
      "Turning a challenge into an opportunity",
      "President Xi is also trying to use this crisis as a catalyst for further change and to find more new markets for China.",
      "\"In the short term, some Chinese exporters will be greatly impacted,\" says Prof Zhang. \"But Chinese companies will take the initiative to adjust the destination of exports to overcome difficulties. Exporters are waiting and looking for new customers.\"",
      "Donald Trump's first term in office was China's cue to look elsewhere for buyers. It has expanded its ties across South East Asia, Latin America and Africa \u2013 and a Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative shored up ties with the so-called Global South.",
      "China is reaping the rewards from that diversification. More than 145 countries do more trade with China than they do with the US, according to the Lowy Institute.",
      "In 2001, only 30 countries chose Beijing as their lead trade partner over Washington.",
      "Geopolitical gains",
      "As Trump targets both friend and foe, some believe Xi can further upend the current US-led world order and portray his country as a stable, alternative global trade partner and leader.",
      "The Chinese leader chose South East Asia for his first trip abroad after the tariff announcement, sensing his neighbours would be getting jittery about Trump's tariffs.",
      "Around a quarter of Chinese exports are now manufactured or shipped through a second country including Vietnam and Cambodia.",
      "Recent US actions may also present a chance for Xi to positively shape China's role in the world.",
      "\"Trump's coercive tariff policy is an opportunity for Chinese diplomacy,\" says Prof Zhang.",
      "China will have to tread carefully. Some countries will be nervous that products being manufactured for the US could end up flooding into their markets.",
      "Trump's tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers.",
      "According to Prof Huihua, \"about 20% of China's exports go to the US - if these exports were to flood any regional market or country, it could lead to dumping and vicious competition, thereby triggering new trade frictions\".",
      "There are barriers to Xi presenting himself as the arbiter of free trade in the world.",
      "China has subjected other nations to trade restrictions in recent years.",
      "In 2020, after the Australian government called for a global inquiry into the origins and early handling of the Covid pandemic, which Beijing argued was a political manoeuvre against them, China placed tariffs on Australian wine and barley and imposed biosecurity measures on some beef and timber and bans on coal, cotton and lobster. Some Australian exports of certain goods to China fell to nearly zero.",
      "Australia's Defence Minister Richard Marles said earlier this month that his nation will not be \"holding China's hand\" as Washington escalated its trade war with Beijing.",
      "China's past actions may impede Xi's current global outreach and many countries may be unwilling to choose between Beijing and Washington.",
      "Even with all the various difficulties, Xi is betting that Beijing will be able to withstand any economic pain longer than Washington in this great power competition.",
      "And it does appear that Trump has blinked first, last week hinting at a potential U-turn on tariffs, saying that the taxes he has so far imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese social media is back in action.",
      "\"Trump has chickened out,\" was one of the top trending search topics on the Chinese social media platform Weibo after the US president softened his approach to tariffs.",
      "Even if or when talks do happen, China is playing a longer game.",
      "The last trade war forced it to diversify its export market away from the US towards other markets \u2013 especially in the Global South.",
      "This trade war has China looking in the mirror to see its own flaws \u2013 and whether it can fix them will be up to policies made in Beijing, not Washington.",
      "Trump's chips strategy: The US will struggle to take on Asia",
      "Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling",

      "Georgescu was relatively unknown in the months before the election, polling at between 3-5%.",
      "He declared a zero campaign budget, had no campaign office and didn't engage in traditional campaigning.",
      "Instead, he focused on TikTok videos including some showing him riding horses in traditional Romanian outfits, and practising judo. He went viral on TikTok weeks before the election and soared in the polls, ultimately winning almost 23% of the vote.",
      "An independent think tank, Expert Forum, published a report saying Georgescu's explosive rise on TikTok was \"created suddenly and artificially - consistent with the way he exploded in the polls\".",
      "Authorities say TikTok's algorithm was exploited in the November vote in three different ways: over 100  influencers for hire who posted paid content indirectly promoting Georgescu, thousands of inauthentic accounts whose comments boosted Georgescu on the platform, and finally a \"King of TikTok\" who supposedly paid thousands of dollars to facilitate the campaign.",

      "Shortly before the election, a campaign using the hashtag \"stability and integrity\" flooded Romanian TikTok. Influencers uploaded videos describing what they were looking for in a future president: \"stability\", \"progress\", \"a patriot\".",
      "They did not name a specific candidate.",
      "They had been paid to upload videos with these messages through a marketing platform called FameUp, which allows brands to hire influencers at scale to promote products. But the influencers say they didn't know who paid for it.",
      "FameUp declined to comment to the BBC.",
      "Cristina, an influencer from the city of Iasi, says that when she took the job she felt \"there was nothing shady about it\". She says \"in the back of [her] mind\" she thought one of the 14 candidates likely paid for it and she \"just thought it was a smart approach. That's not doing any political propaganda. It's just encouraging people to go out and vote\".",
      "Some influencers did not mark the posts as paid content. This goes against TikTok rules, where paid political advertising is banned.",
      "While the adverts didn't mention Georgescu's name, influencers we spoke to described a \"wave of comments\" supporting him that appeared under the videos. Romeo Rusu, a micro-influencer from the city of Constanta with 25,000 followers, said: \"Right after I posted the video, within a few seconds, I started receiving dozens of comments. In the end, I received around 300 comments, all backing the independent candidate Calin Georgescu\u2026 I was absolutely surprised.\"",
      "The comments came into focus after TikTok stated in a report it had removed a network of over 27,000 inauthentic accounts that \"used fictitious personas to post comments related to the Romanian elections\".",
      "It is still not clear who created these bot accounts.",
      "Experts say that flooding unrelated videos with pro-Georgescu comments was a tactic to game TikTok's algorithm and get his name trending, which would in turn push his content into more users' feeds.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC that, during the presidential campaign, the company \"blocked millions of fake engagement attempts, removed hundreds of thousands of spam accounts, prevented impersonation of political candidates, and disrupted three covert influence networks with limited reach\".",
      "\"We continue to work closely with local and EU authorities and partner with local organisations to elevate reliable election information,\" they said.",
      "The uncertainty around the campaign lasted into the new year, until a surprising twist in January.",
      "The Romanian Tax Authority revealed that the #stabilityandintegrity campaign was paid for by the centre-right National Liberal Party (PNL), who were backing their own candidate in the elections.",
      "In response, the PNL told Romanian journalists at news outlet Snoop that their campaign was hijacked to support Georgescu.",
      "Romeo couldn't understand why he'd been named in declassified documents",
      "'TikTok King'",
      "Then, in March, TikTok influencer Bogdan Peschir was arrested for \"corrupting voters through electronic means of communication\". Peschir was known across Romania as the \"King of TikTok\", famous for awarding influencers with TikTok gifts, online tokens worth real money.",
      "The prosecution is reported to have claimed that Peschir paid over $900,000 to over 250 influencers \"to induce them to vote for \"a certain candidate\" in the presidential elections\" via TikTok gifts.",
      "His lawyers are reported to have said \"none of the donations made by Peschir on TikTok were for electoral purposes\".",
      "We spoke to Lucian Elgi, a musician and influencer who admitted being paid thousands of dollars by Peschir via TikTok gifts.",
      "He says he believes these payments were made in support of his work as a musician. Elgi denied that he promoted Georgescu. The BBC could not confirm this, as his videos on TikTok \u2013 along with those by others who were paid by Peschir's TikTok handle \u2013 have been removed.",
      "Elgi says his content wasn't about the election, but about manele music, a genre of pop-folk music with roots in the Roma community.  Several high-profile manele musicians have been accused of taking payments from Peschir to campaign for Georgescu.",
      "Elgi said this content was flooded in pro-Georgescu comments. \"It was madness,\" he says. \"Every single post, comments like: Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President!\"",
      "Much is unknown about the election's annulment. Investigations are ongoing at the European Commission and Romania's highest courts. While Romanians are concerned about the alleged foreign interference, many are outraged that there is still no publicly available evidence undeniably proving Russian interference in the election.",
      "It's painstaking and complex work untangling an influence operation and its effects. Razvan Lutac, the Editor of Romanian news outlet Snoop, fears it could take a very long time to get clarity.",
      "\"We have these small pieces now, like a puzzle,\" he says, \"I think that maybe in a year or two years we will have a complete image of why they cancelled the elections.\"",

    "summary": "Turkey has been building military bases on Iraqi territory, the BBC finds, raising fears of an occupation.",
    "story": [
      "Nestled in the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan sits the picturesque village of Sergele.",
      "For generations villagers have made a living growing pomegranates, almonds and peaches and foraging in the surrounding forests for wild fruits and spices.",
      "But Sergele, located 16km (10 miles) from the border with Turkey, has become increasingly surrounded by Turkish military bases, which are dotted across the slopes.",
      "One, perched halfway up the western ridge, looms over the village, while another in the east is under construction.",
      "At least seven have been built here over the past two years, including one by a small dam that regulates Sergele's water supply, rendering it off limits to villagers.",
      "\"This is 100% a form of occupation of Kurdish [Iraqi Kurdistan] lands,\" says farmer Sherwan Sherwan Sergeli, 50, who has lost access to some of his land.",
      "\"The Turks ruined it.\"",
      "Sergele is now in danger of being dragged into what's known locally as the \"Forbidden Zone\" - a large strip of land in northern Iraq affected by Turkey's war with the Kurdish militant group the PKK, which launched an insurgency in southern Turkey in 1984.",
      "The Forbidden Zone spans almost the entire length of the Iraqi border with Turkey and is up to 40km (25 miles) deep in places.",
      "Community Peacemaker Teams, a human rights group based in Iraqi Kurdistan, says that hundreds of civilians have been killed by drone and air strikes in and around the Forbidden Zone. According to a 2020 Kurdistan parliamentary report, thousands have been forced off their land and whole villages have been emptied out by the conflict.",
      "Sergele is now effectively on the front line of Turkey's war with the PKK.",
      "When the BBC World Service Eye Investigations team visited the area, Turkish aircraft pummelled the mountains surrounding the village to root out PKK militants, who have long operated from caves and tunnels in northern Iraq.",
      "Much of the land around Sergele had been burned by shelling.",
      "\"The more bases they put up, the worse it gets for us,\" says Sherwan.",
      "Turkey has been rapidly growing its military presence in the Forbidden Zone in recent years, but until now the scale of this expansion was not publicly known.",
      "Using satellite imagery assessed by experts and corroborated with on-the-ground reporting and open-source content, the BBC found that as of December 2024, the Turkish military had built at least 136 fixed military installations across northern Iraq.",
      "Through its vast network of military bases, Turkey now holds de-facto control of more than 2,000 sq km (772 square miles) of Iraqi land, the BBC's analysis found.",
      "Satellite images further reveal that the Turkish military has built at least 660km (410 miles) of roads connecting its facilities. These supply routes have resulted in deforestation and left a lasting imprint on the region's mountains.",
      "While a few of the bases date back to the 1990s, 89% have been constructed since 2018, after which Turkey began significantly expanding its military presence in Iraqi Kurdistan.",
      "The Turkish government didn't respond to the BBC's requests for interviews, but has maintained that its military bases are necessary to push back the PKK, which is designated a terrorist organisation by Ankara and a number of Western nations, including the UK.",
      "The sub-district capital of Kani Masi, which is only 4km (2.5 miles) from the Iraqi-Turkish border and parts of which are within the Forbidden Zone, may offer a glimpse into Sergele's future.",
      "Once famous for its apple production, few residents remain here now.",
      "Farmer Salam Saeed, whose land is in the shadow of a large Turkish base, hasn't been able to cultivate his vineyard for the past three years.",
      "\"The moment you get here, you will have a drone hover over you,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"They will shoot you if you stay.\"",
      "The Turkish military first set up here in the 1990s and has been consolidating its presence since.",
      "Its main military base, featuring concrete blast walls, watch and communication towers and space for armoured personnel carriers to move inside, is much more developed than the smaller outposts around Sergele.",
      "Salam, like some other locals, believes Turkey ultimately wants to claim the territory as its own.",
      "\"All they want is for us to leave these areas,\" he adds.",
      "Little leverage",
      "Near Kani Masi, the BBC saw first-hand how Turkish forces have effectively pushed back the Iraqi border guard, which is responsible for protecting Iraq's international boundaries.",
      "At several locations, the border guards were manning positions well inside Iraqi territory, directly opposite Turkish troops, unable to go right up to the border and potentially risk a clash.",
      "\"The posts that you see are Turkish posts,\" says General Farhad Mahmoud, pointing to a ridge just across a valley, about 10km (6 miles) inside Iraqi territory.",
      "But \"we cannot reach the border to know the number of posts\", he adds.",
      "Turkey's military expansion in Iraqi Kurdistan - fuelled by its rise as a drone power and growing defence budget - is seen as part of a broader foreign policy shift towards greater interventionism in the region.",
      "Similar to its operations in Iraq, Turkey has also sought to establish a buffer zone along its border with Syria to contain Syrian armed groups allied with the PKK.",
      "In public, Iraq's government has condemned Turkey's military presence in the country. But behind closed doors it has accommodated some of Ankara's demands.",
      "In 2024, the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly fight the PKK.",
      "But the document, obtained by the BBC, did not place any limitations on Turkish troops in Iraq.",
      "Iraq depends on Turkey for trade, investment and water security, while its fractured internal politics have further undermined the government's ability to take a strong stance.",
      "Iraq's national government did not respond to the BBC requests for comment.",
      "People outside the UK can watch the documentary on YouTube",
      "Meanwhile, the rulers of the semi-autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan have a close relationship with Ankara based on mutual interests and have often downplayed the civilian harm due to Turkey's military action.",
      "The Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), an arch enemy of the PKK, dominates the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and has officially been in charge since 2005, when Iraq's constitution granted the region its semi-autonomous status.",
      "The KDP's close ties with Turkey have contributed to the region's economic success and have strengthened its position, both against its regional political rivals and with the Iraqi government in Baghdad, with which it tussles for greater autonomy.",
      "Hoshyar Zebari, a senior member of the KDP's politburo, sought to blame the PKK for Turkey's presence in Iraqi Kurdistan.",
      "\"They [the Turkish military] are not harming our people,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"They are not detaining them. They are not interfering in them going about their business. Their focus, their sole goal is the PKK.\"",
      "The conflict shows no signs of ending, despite the PKK's long-jailed leader Abdulla Ocalan calling in February for his fighters to lay down arms and disband.",
      "Turkey has continued to shell targets across Iraqi Kurdistan, while the PKK claimed responsibility for downing a Turkish drone last month.",
      "And while violent incidents in Turkey have declined since 2016, according to a tally by the NGO Crisis Group, those in Iraq have spiked, with civilians living on the border region facing growing risk of death and displacement.",
      "One of those killed was 24-year-old Alan Ismail, a stage-four cancer patient hit by an air strike in August 2023 while on a trip to the mountains with his cousin, Hashem Shaker.",
      "The Turkish military has denied carrying out a strike that day, but a police report seen by the BBC attributes the incident to a Turkish drone.",
      "When Hashem filed a complaint in a local court about the attack he was detained by Kurdish security forces and held for eight months on suspicion of supporting the PKK - an accusation he and his family deny.",
      "\"It has destroyed us. It's like killing the whole family,\" says Ismail Chichu, Alan's father.",
      "\"They [the Turks] have no rights to kill people in their own country on their own land.\"",
      "Turkey's Defence Ministry did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment. It has previously told the media that the Turkish armed forces follow international law, and that in the planning and execution of their operations they only target terrorists, while taking care to prevent harm to civilians.",
      "The BBC has seen documents suggesting Kurdish authorities may have acted to help Turkey evade accountability for civilian casualties.",
      "Confidential papers seen by the BBC show a Kurdish court closed the investigation into Alan's killing, saying the perpetrator was unknown.",
      "And his death certificate - issued by Kurdish authorities and seen by the BBC - says he died because of \"explosive fragments\".",
      "Failing to mention when victims of air strikes have died as a result of violence, rather than an accident, makes it difficult for families to seek justice and compensation, to which they're entitled under both Iraqi and Kurdish law.",
      "\"In most of the death certificates, they only wrote 'infijar', which means explosion,\" says Kamaran Othman from Community Peacemaker Teams.",
      "\"It can be anything exploding.",
      "\"I think the Kurdish Regional Government doesn't want to make Turkey responsible for what they are doing here.\"",
      "The KRG said it acknowledged the \"tragic loss of civilians resulting from military confrontation between the PKK and Turkish army in the region\".",
      "It added that \"a number of casualties\" had been documented as \"civilian martyrs\", meaning they have been unjustly killed and entitling them to compensation.",
      "Almost two years after Alan was killed, his family is still waiting, if not for compensation, at least for acknowledgement from the KRG.",
      "\"They could at least send their condolences - we don't need their compensation,\" says Ismail.",
      "\"When something is gone, it's gone forever.\""

Her 1995 song \"I Kissed A Girl\" was the first openly-gay-themed song to make it into the Billboard Top 20 despite being banned by many Southern radio stations.",
      "Other hits included \"Too Cool to Fall in Love,\" \"Supermodel\" (from the movie \"Clueless\"), and \"Bitter.\"",
      "Born in Denver, Sobule was praised for her witty and poignant writing, which first attracted attention with her 1990 album, \"Things Here Are Different.\" After two record companies dropped her and two indie labels she was tied to went bankrupt, Sobule turned to crowdfunding, with a website, jillsnextrecord.com, to raise $75,000. \"I think I got it within six weeks,\" Sobule told \"CBS Evening News.\" In addition to small dollar gifts, one donor wrote in saying, \"'I'm really not a fan of your music, but I think this is a great new model, so I'm giving you $50.'\" The resulting album, \"California Years,\" was released in 2009. She turned to crowdsourcing again for the 2018 album \"Nostalgia Kills.\"",
      "Sobule performed with such artists as Neil Young, Melissa Etheridge, Billy Bragg, Warren Zevon and Cyndi Lauper; appeared with \"SNL\" comedian Julia Sweeney in a stage show, \"Jill and Julia\"; and played herself performing a song on \"The Simpsons.\" She also starred in \"F*CK7thGrade,\" a 2022 autobiographical off-Broadway show described as \"a queer musical memoir\" that was nominated for a Drama Desk Award.",
      "Last month, in an interview with Cincy Music, Sobule was asked about the changes she has seen in the recording business during her career. \"The demise of the music industry as we once knew it, hasn't been great,\" she said. \"Thinking of the sad-ass checks from Spotify. But it has also made one become creative in other endeavors. For example, musical theater. I do tell my theater pals that I have moved on from the music industry, as I've been told off-Broadway theater is so lucrative. They just laugh.\""

Shortly before her death, her husband, Kent Perkins, had posted a statement on Buzzi's Facebook page, thanking her many fans and telling them: \"She wants you to know she probably had more fun doing those shows than you had watching them.\"",

      "Born Ruth Ann Buzzi on July 24, 1936, in Westerly, Rhode Island, she was the daughter of Angelo Buzzi, a nationally known stone sculptor. Her father and later her brother operated Buzzi Memorials, a gravestone and monument maker in Stonington, Connecticut, where she was head cheerleader in high school.",
      "Buzzi enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse at age 17. Two years later, she traveled with singer Rudy Vallee in a musical and comedy act during her summer break. That earned her an Actors' Equity union card before she graduated from the playhouse's College of Theatre Arts.",
      "Buzzi moved to New York and was immediately hired for a lead role in an off-Broadway musical revue, the first of 19 such shows she performed in on the East Coast.",
      "She got her national television break on \"The Garry Moore Show\" in 1964, just after Carol Burnett was replaced by Dorothy Loudon on the series. She played Shakundala the Silent, a bumbling magician's assistant to Dom DeLuise's character Dominic the Great.",
      "Buzzi was a regular on the CBS variety show \"The Entertainers,\" whose hosts included Burnett and Bob Newhart.",
      "She was in the original Broadway cast of \"Sweet Charity\" with Gwen Verdon in 1966.",
      "Buzzi toured the country with her nightclub act, including appearances in Las Vegas.",
      "She was a semi-regular on \"That Girl\" as Marlo Thomas' friend. She co-starred with Jim Nabors as time-traveling androids on \"The Lost Saucer\" in the mid-1970s.",
      "Her other guest appearances included variety shows hosted by Burnett, Flip Wilson, Glen Campbell, Tony Orlando, Donny and Marie Osmond and Leslie Uggams.",
      "She appeared in Ball's last comedy series, \"Life With Lucy.\"",
      "Buzzi guested in music videos with \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, the B-52's and the Presidents of the United States of America.",
      "She did hundreds of guest voices in cartoon series including \"Pound Puppies,\" \"Berenstain Bears,\" \"The Smurfs\" and \"The Angry Beavers.\"",
      "She received an Emmy nomination for her six-year run as shopkeeper Ruthie on \"Sesame Street.\"",
      "Her movie credits included \"Freaky Friday,\" \"Chu Chu and the Philly Flash,\" \"The North Avenue Irregulars,\" and \"The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again.\"",
      "Buzzi was active on social media and had thousands of followers whom she rewarded with such one-liners as \"I have never faked a sarcasm\" and \"Scientists say the universe is made up entirely of neurons, protons and electrons. They seem to have missed morons.\"",
      "She married Perkins, an actor, in 1978.",
      "The couple moved from California to Texas in 2003 and bought a 640-acre ranch near Stephenville.",
      "Buzzi retired from acting in 2021 and suffered a series of strokes the following year. Her husband told The Dallas Morning News in 2023 that she had dementia.",

      "Meanwhile, the defense brought up an alleged victim's personal attorney, saying they were \"concerned with her behavior here.\" The defense said that attorney had given an interview to a TV network in an attempt to bolster her client's credibility. The judge reminded all the attorneys and witnesses to adhere to rules of professional conduct.",
      "Prospective jurors were asked to arrive at court early Monday. The judge is hoping to complete jury selection in a few days in order to give attorneys the rest of the week to focus on trial prep.",

      "\"They are so majestic, powerful. Unbelievable man. I can't believe I did that,\" Burleson said moments after emerging from the water. \"I don't even know what I was expecting, but I wasn't expecting that.\"",
      "The expedition, which followed Burleson's previous fear-conquering skydive with the U.S. Army, brought him face-to-face with nine Galapagos sharks \u2014 creatures that can grow to more than 10 feet long with 14 rows of serrated teeth.",
      "Dr. Andrew Rossiter, director of the Waikiki Aquarium in Honolulu, said that while sharks are indeed predators, humans are not their natural prey.",
      "\"I've literally seen hundreds and hundreds of sharks while I've been diving,\" Rossiter said. \"Not so much scared, but I've always been in awe of them, because I know what they could do, potentially.\"",
      "Burleson's mother was less enthusiastic about her son's adventure when he called to inform her.",
      "\"Oh I don't feel good about that at all,\" she told him. \"You're serious, Nathaniel? I don't trust you. I don't trust the sharks and I don't trust the water! Period!\"",
      "Despite his mother's concerns, Burleson found unexpected peace once in the water.",
      "\"I felt comfortable around them,\" he reflected. \"The way they circle around, and like peep you out... and if you look at them and you're like 'what's up fam?' They will just cruise on by. It's amazing.\"",
      "The experience changed his perspective, fostered in part by 1975's blockbuster \"Jaws,\" which altered how generations view ocean predators.",

    "summary": "Belichick's statement comes after segments of the interview posted to social media focused attention on the 73-year-old's relationship with his girlfriend, 24-year-old Jordon Hudson.",
    "story": [
      "Former Patriots coach Bill Belichick says his recent\u00a0interview on \"CBS Sunday Morning\"\u00a0created \"a false narrative\" about his relationship with his girlfriend, 24-year-old Jordon Hudson.",
      "Belichick, 73, who is now head coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, sat down with CBS News' Tony Dokoupil ahead of the release of his new book, \"The Art of Winning,\" but many commenters online focused on the glimpses of his relationship with Hudson.",
      "In a statement released Wednesday, Belichick said, \"Prior to this interview, I clearly communicated with my publicist at Simon & Schuster that any promotional interviews I participated in would agree to focus solely on the contents of the book.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, that expectation was not honored during the interview. I was surprised when unrelated topics were introduced, and I repeatedly expressed to the reporter, Tony Dokoupil, and the producers that I preferred to keep the conversation centered on the book,\" the statement continued. \"After this occurred several times, Jordon, with whom I share both a personal and professional relationship, stepped in to reiterate that point to help refocus the discussion.\"",
      "A CBS News spokesperson\u00a0responded: \"When we agreed to speak with Mr. Belichick, it was for a wide-ranging interview. There were no preconditions or limitations to this conversation. This was confirmed repeatedly with his publisher before the interview took place and after it was completed.\"",
      "Belichick's statement comes after portions of the interview posted to social media\u00a0generated scrutiny\u00a0of his relationship.",
      "Out of the eight-minute segment that aired on \"Sunday Morning,\" Belichick and Dokoupil discussed Hudson, whom the football legend described in his upcoming book as his \"creative muse,\" for about one minute and 30 seconds.",
      "Dokoupil said in the recorded voiceover that Hudson was a \"constant presence\" during the interview. He asked Belichick, \"You have Jordon right over there. Everybody in the world seems to be following this relationship. They've got an opinion about your private life. It's got nothing to do with them, but they're invested in it. How do you deal with that?\"",
      "\"I've never been too worried about what everybody else thinks,\" Belichick replied. \"Just try to do what I feel like is best for me and what's right.\"",
      "When Belichick was asked how the two of them met, Hudson spoke up: \"Not talking about this.\"",
      "In his statement Wednesday, Belichick defended Hudson.",
      "\"She was not deflecting any specific question or topic but simply doing her job to ensure the interview stayed on track. Some of the clips make it appear as though we were avoiding the question of how we met, but we have been open about the fact that Jordon and I met on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021,\" he said.",
      "\"The final eight-minute segment does not reflect the productive 35-minute conversation we had, which covered a wide range of topics related to my career. Instead, it presents selectively edited clips and stills from just a few minutes of the interview to suggest a false narrative \u2014 that Jordon was attempting to control the conversation \u2014 which is simply not true.\"",
      "In a separate statement released Tuesday, Belichick's literary agent, InkWell Management, said the segments resulted in \"a raft of hostile social media posts about his personal life.\"",
      "\"Bill has written an authoritative and entertaining book about success that should be judged by its contents, not by the clicks generated by the segment,\" InkWell Management said.",
      "Belichick's book\u00a0\"The Art of Winning\"\u00a0is scheduled for release May 6.",

      "Much of the work at NIOSH, an arm of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had already stalled after an initial round of layoffs on April 1 at the agency ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "New requests for investigations of firefighter injuries and workplace health hazards had already stopped being accepted. A CDC plan to help Texas schools curb the spread of measles infections was also scrapped due to the layoffs.",

Some workers for those programs had been asked to temporarily return to work for another month or two, after pleas from members of Congress.",

      "The main difference with Friday's layoff notices was the date they take effect: workers are being put on leave until an official separation from service on July 2, instead of in June.",
      "The layoffs also stopped work at the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. This NIOSH division had been the government body tasked with vetting safety equipment like N95 masks and breathing devices used by emergency workers.",
      "The laboratory's respirator approval program had been in the middle of processing around 100 applications for personal protective equipment, one laid-off official said.",

      "The number of cases that had their symptoms start during the week of March 30 has grown to 111, according to the agency's latest update. Authorities backdate newly reported measles cases based on when their rash began, to account for delays in reporting and diagnosis.",
      "That tops the 102 cases reported for the week of March 23, 2019, at the height of that year's wave. By the end of 2019, measles cases that year added up to the largest annual tally since endemic spread of the virus was declared eliminated in 2000.",
      "This year, the majority of cases are from an ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states, which is now larger than any other single outbreak since the virus was eliminated. Between\u00a0Texas\u00a0and\u00a0New Mexico, at least 750 of the measles cases reported this year have been linked to that outbreak. Cases in\u00a0Oklahoma\u00a0and other states have also been linked to the outbreak.",
      "There have been 11 other local outbreaks of measles within the U.S. this year, up from 10 last week.",
      "While the pace of new cases looks to have declined in Texas, officials caution it is too soon to say whether the outbreak is truly ending.",
      "\"We look at the trends over time and we'd want to see several weeks of decline. New cases sometimes get reported to public health up to a week after someone was tested, especially if the test was done at a commercial lab,\" Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, told CBS News in a statement.",

      "Death rates from diabetes peaked in 2021, according to CDC figures, at 31.1 deaths per 100,000 people for that year. Diabetes was the eighth leading cause of death in 2021. The CDC says the link between COVID-19 and diabetes may be to blame for that increase.",
      "\"Data show an increase in mortality rates for all people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and research shows that people with underlying conditions, including diabetes, are more likely to become very sick from COVID-19 and have a higher risk of hospitalization and death,\" Christopher Holliday, head of the CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Holliday added that research shows the pandemic may also have made it harder for Americans to properly manage the disease, ranging from interruptions to physical activity to disruptions to routine medical care diagnosing and treating the disease.",
      "\"While diabetes-related death rates have decreased since 2021, they have not returned to pre-pandemic levels,\" Holliday said.",
      "There were 103,294 deaths from diabetes in 2021, up more than 17% from 87,647 deaths in 2019 before the pandemic. Provisional data reported so far for 2024 have tallied 94,294 diabetes deaths last year.",
      "Diabetes deaths had been largely falling in recent years before the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an increase in the prevalence of the disease. Those trends were before the introduction of new diabetes treatments like Ozempic and Mounjaro that have seen high demand.",
      "Nearly 1 in 10 adults had diagnosed diabetes in 2023, according to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey.",
      "Experts caution that analyzing long term trends in diabetes deaths is complex for a number of reasons, including changes in the definition of the disease over the past decades and variation in how death certificates record diabetes deaths.",

      "The startup, called World (formerly Worldcoin), is launching in the U.S. with the distribution of 20,000 tech devices called Orbs that scan a person's retina to verify they are human. After confirming a person's humanity, World then creates a digital ID for users that proves their personhood, distinguishing them from a bot or AI program that can mimic human behavior.",
      "The device, which looks like something out of \"Black Mirror,\" may seem ironic coming from Altman, given that its purpose is to help people stand out from the very same types of technology he helped develop. But World's backers say the Orb and its \"proof of personhood\" is addressing a problem that can stymie everything from finance to online dating: bots impersonating people.",
      "The Orb \"is a privacy-first way to prove you are a human in the world of AI and bots,\" said Jake Brukhman, co-founder of CoinFund, one of the project's earliest backers. \"That is getting relevant as AI is becoming much more prevalent in the world.\"",

      "World isn't exactly new, as it debuted outside the U.S. in 2023 and has already sparked privacy backlash, with Kenya's government shutting down the service, according to the Associated Press. Other jurisdictions followed suit, including Hong Kong and Spain.",
      "\"I will say that upon the launch in 2023 there was a lot of noise about this,\" Brukhman said. \"But a lot of noise came from the lack of understanding about the Orb and how it works.\"",
      "The Orb doesn't store any biometric data, he added. The device takes photos to ensure a person is human, but then stores that info on the user's device, not in the Orb, according to World's website.",
      "World also has a link to cryptocurrencies, as the Orb's human-verification process is designed to be used in the World App, which is a digital wallet that gives people access to decentralized finance and cryptocurrencies.",
      "The time is right for a rollout in the U.S., Brukhman said, with expectations of looser crypto regulations under Trump administration. President Trump, who has vowed to turn the U.S. into the cryptocurrency capital of the world, is working on a \"crypto strategic reserve\" for the nation.",
      "The Orbs will be rolled out in stores in six U.S. cities, including Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nashville, Miami and San Francisco, as well as at gaming retailer Razer, with the idea that people can go to physical locations to get themselves verified as human.",

Companies have been cutting and withdrawing financial forecasts because of the uncertainty over how much tariffs will cost them and how much they will squeeze consumers and sap spending.",
      "Hopes remain that Mr. Trump will roll back some of his tariffs after negotiating trade deals with other countries. China has been a key target, with tariffs of 145%. Its Commerce Ministry said Beijing is evaluating overtures from the U.S. regarding the tariffs.",

You cannot find any evidence of a nascent recession in these figures,\" he said, while noting that tariffs are likely to take a toll on hiring in the months to come.\"We are waiting for layoffs to begin and for claims and unemployment to rise,\" he added. \"This month's payrolls figure was a lot better than expected, but the strong trend in employment does not last in our forecast.\"",
      "Health care companies, along with the transportation and warehousing sector, saw the largest gains in employment last month, adding 51,000 and 29,000 jobs, respectively.",
      "The jump in transportation and warehousing jobs \u2014 more than double its 12-month average of 12,000 \u2014 was notable. Cory Stahle, an economist from Indeed Hiring Lab economist, thinks that could indicate companies are adding to their inventories ahead of tariffs taking effect and boosting their costs.",
      "Federal employment declined by 9,000, up from 4,000 in March. Government layoffs have risen in recent months because of cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which the Trump administration touts as a cost-saving effort.",
      "\"April may have been the last month when we didn't see the aggregate impact of trade war 2.0, DOGE job cuts and tight immigration policy. But look closely enough and there are hints, like the slight decline in manufacturing payrolls and another drop in federal government jobs,\" Elyse Ausenbaugh, head of investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management, said in an email.",
      "Although the latest employment numbers suggest a steady job market, government data this week showed that more Americans are filing for unemployment benefits as layoffs mount. Jobless claims increased 18,000 to 241,000 for the week ending April 26, the highest level since mid-February, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "\"Continued claims are more volatile week to week, but remain elevated, signaling that workers who lose their job are facing challenges in finding new employment,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "In another important snapshot of the economy this week, the nation's gross domestic product shrank 0.3% in the first three months of the year, down from growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter. The main reason for the sharp decline was the rush by consumers and businesses to order imported goods ahead of tariffs taking effect (Imports reduce GDP, while exports increase it.)",
      "What experts are saying",
      "Experts say the economy has proved resilient, with steady hiring despite concern over the Trump administration's trade policies. A recession appears unlikely for now, although economists note it could take several months for tariff-induced instability to appear in the government's monthly job numbers.",
      "\"Some of the increase in employment in April... reflects a burst of pre-tariff activity, which will unravel over the next couple months,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a research note.",
      "Soft data like consumer confidence survey,\u00a0polling\u00a0and jobless claims show signs of economic weakness.",
      "The solid job gains in April also increase the odds that the Federal Reserve will keep its benchmark interest rate steady when policy makers meet next week on May 6-7, experts say.",
      "\"The healthy 177,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in April and unchanged unemployment rate will reassure the Fed that there is no need to be hasty in lowering interest rates when it meets next week,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a report.",

    "published": "Fri, 02 May 2025 13:02:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Cheaper goods from China are no longer exempt from import duties, which could sharply raise prices for consumers.",
    "story": [
      "Cheaper goods from China are set to become a lot more expensive for U.S. consumers with the May 2 expiration of a loophole that formerly allowed lower cost packages to enter the country duty-free.",
      "Ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu are among the major players that until Friday relied on the loophole that allowed them to ship low-value parcels to the U.S. tax-free, allowing them to undercut U.S.-based sellers. American shoppers relied on the de minimis loophole, too, for bargain-basement prices that couldn't be matched for goods made in the U.S.",
      "With the end of the loophole, which exempted packages worth $800 from import levies, many goods from China and other countries will no longer\u00a0be as low-priced as they once were. Trade experts also note that to comply with the law, importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) now face a new administrative challenge: the burden of inspecting millions of additional packages daily. That could mean substantial delays in shipments, experts note.",
      "What is the de minimis loophole?",
      "The provision was introduced in 1938 as Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930. It was designed to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting negligible duties on low-value goods at a high cost to the government.",
      "From 2018 to 2023, the value of low-value e-commerce exports from China ballooned from $5.3 billion to $66 billion, according to a February report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The 1938 provision has been the \"primary path\" for Chinese exports to enter the U.S. market, the report notes.",
      "Why did Trump eliminate the de minimis exemption?",
      "President Trump in February said he would eliminate the loophole because he didn't believe China was taking sufficient action to stem the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump in April signed an executive order eliminating the duty-free treatment for low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2. As of Friday, packages that would have qualified for exemption under the de minimis provision will \"be subject to all applicable duties,\" the executive order states.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump called the de minimis exemption \"a big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses.\"",
      "\"We put an end to it,\" he said.",
      "Goods from China are subject to new tariffs of up to 145%, while Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on goods from the U.S.",
      "What does the end of the exemption mean for consumers?",
      "Retailers are already tacking on hefty tariff surcharges to customers' orders, leading to sticker shock for some U.S. shoppers who had long relied on China for cheap imported goods.",
      "\"The way we shop online will never be the same,\" Ram Ben Tzion, CEO of Publican, a company that authenticates shipment documentation, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Specifically, \"everything will take more time, cost more money, and everything that's price-sensitive won't be available,\" he said.",
      "The rise of trade between the U.S. and China allowed for a much greater variety of goods to enter U.S. markets. But the end of the loophole will lead to a \"much diminished market,\" said Mary Lovely, an international trade expert and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "If prices of Chinese goods rise, there will be less demand, and sellers could decide to import fewer goods.",
      "\"You'll see much diminished market and at some point it won't be worth it to import to a small market,\" so you'll see products disappearing, Lovely said.",
      "Could the new rule cause delays?",
      "Requiring millions more packages to be inspected daily will create a challenge for CBP, experts noted.",
      "\"It will be an administrative nightmare, so you will see a lot of delays,\" Ryan Young, a trade policy expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "It's unclear if the government has enough CBP agents to efficiently inspect packages and enforce policies, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"As these adjustments are made, a key question remains, which is the ability of CBP to effectively regulate and enforce these measures,\" Ben Tzion said. \"As of today. CBP does not have that ability.\"",
      "\"Without personnel, you'll have backlogs and pile ups and U.S. customs might have to get more warehousing space,\" Young added.",
      "Who might benefit?",
      "Companies that sell goods made in the U.S. could face less competition as previously cheap China-made goods rise to new price highs.",
      "\"Consumers could become more wary of foreign brands to avoid paying hefty prices,\" Ines Durand, a retail strategist at Similarwab, a web analytics company.",
      "Larger corporations with bigger profit margins, or more diversified businesses, will likely fare better than smaller retailers that operate on thin profit margins, making it difficult to re-jigger supply chains.",
      "The consumer won't emerge unscathed.",
      "\"The rollback of the de minimis exemption for tariffed goods is poised to hit consumers' wallets,\" PwC consumer markets industry leader Ali Furman told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "story": [
      "Guangzhou, China\u00a0\u2014 The annual Canton Fair in Guangzhou is China's largest import-export trade show. It covers a space equal to about 200 football fields and has been running since 1957 \u2014 when China's economy was isolated from the rest of the world. The country's leaders decided the expo, since formally named the China Import and Export Fair, was the best way to overcome trade obstacles imposed by the West and to drum up business investment and interest from overseas markets.",
      "In the almost seven decades since, China has transformed into the world's manufacturing powerhouse. But President Xi Jinping's government believes the U.S. is once again working to isolate China, through President Trump's tariff trade war, and that Washington will try to force other countries \u2014 and their consumers \u2014 to pick a side.",
      "Richard Qiu told CBS News it's simply unfair. Wearing a pale blue Ralph Lauren shirt, the businessman invited CBS News to sit down in his display booth at the Canton Fair for a chat. Surrounded by thousands of small fabric gift bags designed for everything from Christmas to Easter to birthdays, the fact that Qiu even quickly agreed to an interview was disarming; Every other Chinese businessperson we approached turned our camera away, wary of speaking with foreign media.",
      "His openness and warmth indicated a sense of ease with Westerners, and more importantly, his desire to tell his story about how external forces, completely out of his control, were affecting him and his livelihood.",
      "Qiu's Liaoning Perfect Import/Export Co. Ltd has been making gift bags for 20 years, and he has fostered strong relationships with his U.S. customers, who, in recent years, have made up 30-40% of his exports. He's traveled to the U.S. at least six times and says he loves the country: \"It's about freedom, democracy, it's open and fair.\"",
      "\"But this isn't fair,\" he said of the trade war sparked by President Trump's steep tariffs. \"It makes me feel sick about the U.S. now.\"",
      "Mr. Trump insists his tariffs will, despite current economic pain in the U.S., bring manufacturing back to America and buoy the economy, reshaping the global trade system. But Qiu said it's about something else. He believes President Trump is punishing China for being the best at producing everyday products at affordable prices, and using that prowess to dominate the global market.",
      "\"Our people are industrious, diligent, working hard to make the products good price, good quality, to sell all over the world. It's not our problem,\" he said. \"I think it's your problem.\"",
      "Since Mr. Trump imposed 145% tariffs on all Chinese imports \u2014 though the White House later exempted smartphones and some other electronics from the levies \u2014 Qiu says his U.S. sales have ground to a halt.",
      "\"U.S. buyers said, 'Richard you have to stop production; we have to cancel it.' I think 90% of my U.S. orders will be canceled.\"",
      "For years, the Canton Fair has been packed with American buyers looking to bring their customers back at home the best possible deals on offer. But this year, officials admitted to CBS News that the numbers are way down \u2014 another sign of President Trump's trade war taking hold.",
      "One American we did come across perusing the stalls in Guangzhou wasn't there to buy, but rather to research new products.",
      "\"Tariffs are going to come down at some point and we need to be ready for it,\" Jonathan Scheerz who lives in Michigan, where he runs a homewares business, told CBS News. He said he got a lot of orders in for products from China before Mr. Trump's inauguration, because he was anticipating a trade war \u2014 but not like this.",
      "\"I don't want to bring them in at the current tariff rate,\" he lamented. \"It just doesn't work. It's too high, but I also don't believe it's going to last months and months.\"",
      "The optimism is based on his belief that no one does it better than China when it comes to offering so many different products at such low prices.",
      "\"In my eyes, China produces what you want,\" Scheerz said. \"Simple as that.\"",
      "But if the trade war does drag on, many business owners who spoke with CBS News off camera said they were prepared to take the pain.",
      "Qiu knows tough days are ahead. He's looking to diversify his export portfolio in Europe, but there's only so much the market can absorb, so it's uncertain times.",
      "\"It's like a war, I think. Under a war, the most suffering is the people, no matter if it's the U.S. or China,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Qiu added, however, that over the course of China's history, the country has endured real hardship and pain, and he believes the Chinese people have the strength and fortitude to do it again.",
      "\"If we do something unfair, I will not support the government, but it's your government \u2014 the U.S. government that's put unfair things on us, so we say, 'okay, we fight.'\"",

    "published": "Fri, 02 May 2025 07:02:15 -0400",
    "summary": "The joint economic investment between the U.S. and Ukraine comes after China restricted exports of some rare earth minerals to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The joint economic investment deal announced Wednesday that gives the U.S. access to Ukrainian minerals may provide Ukraine with more support for its defense against Russia. But it also comes at a key moment for the American economy amid its growing trade war with China, a major producer of rare earths and other critical minerals.",
      "The new deal was described by Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economic development minister, as an equal partnership between the U.S. and Ukraine that\u00a0includes development of\u00a0mineral, oil and gas projects. The U.S. will provide either direct financial assistance or new military assistance to Ukraine, which will contribute half of any royalties from future oil, gas and mineral licenses.",
      "The pact comes as America's access to rare earth minerals, which are key to manufacturing high-tech products like computer chips and military equipment, has diminished after China last month announced export restrictions on some of these minerals in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. Although Mr. Trump has suggested buying Greenland, which has rare earths and critical minerals as well as oil and natural gas, Ukraine may provide a more readily available source for these strategically vital natural resources, experts say.",
      "\"You hear a lot about Greenland, but that is a very, very long term play with a lot of building up of infrastructure and a lot of ice-melting, to be fair,\" Heidi Crebo-Rediker, an expert with the Council on Foreign Relations, told CBS News.",
      "By contrast, Ukraine has the workforce and the metallurgical know-how to extract and develop these rare earth minerals, she added. Here's what to know about the U.S.' deal with Ukraine.",
      "What does the U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal cover?",
      "The deal covers minerals, including rare earth elements, but also other valuable resources, including oil and natural gas, according to the text released by Ukraine's government.",
      "It does not include resources that currently generate revenue for the Ukrainian state. In other words, any profits under the deal are dependent on the success of new American investments.",
      "Ukrainian officials have also noted that the deal does not refer to any debt obligations for Kyiv, meaning profits are unlikely to go toward paying the U.S. back for its previous financial support for the country in its war with Russia, according to Svyrydenko.",
      "The text of the deal lists 55 minerals subject to the U.S-Ukraine agreement, but says more can be added to the pact. Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in Ukraine's rare earth elements, and some of them are included in the list, as are other critical minerals, including titanium, lithium and uranium.",
      "What are rare earth minerals?",
      "Rare earth minerals are a set of 17 metallic elements, such as scandium and yttrium, according to U.S. Geological Survey. Scandium is used in aluminum alloys for aerospace parts, while yttrium is used in LEDs and solid oxide fuel cells, according to Stanford Advanced Materials, a scandium supplier.",
      "China is the the world's largest producer of rare earths, data from the Geological Survey shows.",
      "Aside from rare earth minerals, China also dominates production of critical minerals such as lithium and graphite, which are both essential for producing batteries used in electric vehicles and other devices.",
      "How large are Ukraine's mineral reserves?",
      "Ukraine holds about 5% of total global mineral reserves, which include both critical minerals and rare earth elements, according to Capital Economics, which cited the Ukrainian Geological Survey.",
      "\"Monetary estimates of Ukraine's reserves vary wildly. However, there is a lot of skepticism over the accuracy of Ukraine's national estimates given they reportedly rely on outdated Soviet-era assessments,\" Capital Economics said in a May 1 research note.",
      "Currently, Ukraine's critical minerals generate less than $200 million in annual export revenues, analysts with the investment advisory firm said. \"[T]he reality is that most of Ukraine's mineral reserves are unlikely to be economically viable, especially in the near term,\" they added.",
      "Ukraine has large deposits of cobalt and nickel, which are important for high-performance batteries, Crebo-Rediker said.",
      "What's happening with China's minerals?",
      "China placed new restrictions on seven heavy rare earth minerals on April 4, including scandium and yttrium, in retaliation against U.S. tariffs.",
      "\"Beijing has a history of responding to measures such as tariffs and tech controls from Washington by imposing curbs on exports of raw materials to the U.S.,\" Capital Economics analysts wrote in a May 1 report.",
      "They added, \"Under President Trump, it seems that developing alternative sources of supply will remain a key priority, which could limit any disruption to supply chains from geopolitics in the medium term and reduce Western reliance on China and its allies.\"",
      "China has a \"a near complete chokehold on another important critical material \u2014 graphite,\" Crebo-Rediker added. \"Ukraine is the fifth-largest producer of graphite and also gallium, which is restricted by China right now.\"",
      "What is the state of Ukraine's minerals industry?",
      "Ukraine's rare earth elements are largely untapped because of state policies regulating the industry, a lack of good information about deposits and the war with Russia. The industry's potential is also unclear given that mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate, according to analysts.",
      "In general, however, Ukraine's natural resources are considered to have signifiant commercial potential. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe's largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe's largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian minerals industry accounted for 6.1% of the country's gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it's in Mr. Trump's interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",

Small businesses do not have the margin or capital reserves to survive an increase in tariffs, Clark wrote in the letter.",
      "\"The Chamber requests the administration take immediate action to save America's small businesses and stave off a recession,\" she wrote.",
      "The Trump administration's tariff policies are already weighing on growth and have\u00a0raised the chances\u00a0of a recession over the next 12 months, according to economists. Still, the International Monetary Fund\u00a0said\u00a0in April it does not expect the U.S. to enter a recession in 2025.",
      "Clark added that tariffs could cause \"irreparable harm\" to the small business community if trade deals are not reached soon. Products from most countries are subject a 10% tariff, while products from China face a much steeper levy of up to 145%.",
      "In an interview with Time\u00a0magazine last week, President Trump said that trade deals would be reached in the \"next three to four weeks.\" In the meantime, small businesses are being forced to make difficult decisions about how to operate amid uncertainty as a result of on-and-off tariffs.

      "However, unlike huge corporations, any declines in consumer spending as a result of higher prices could spell financial disaster for many small businesses, which typically operate with tight margins. Roughly 43% of small business owners said their companies would not survive if they fell short on revenue for three to four months, according to a recent TD Bank survey.",

    "story": [
      "McDonald's, a stalwart American fast food chain, posted a steep sales drop at U.S. restaurants in its first quarter earnings report Thursday, citing economic uncertainty and diminished consumer sentiment.",
      "\"Heightened anxiety\" about the economy, driven largely by tariffs, is weighing on lower-income Americans, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the call.",
      "The burger chain's same-store sales in the U.S. declined 3.6% in the first quarter, reflecting economic pressures weighing on low- and middle-income consumers in particular, McDonald's said on its earnings call. That marks the biggest U.S. decline for the company since the COVID-19 pandemic forced stores to close nationwide.",
      "Kempczinski added that traffic to U.S. restaurants fell more sharply than the company had anticipated, and that \"we're not immune to the volatility in the industry or the pressures that our consumers are facing.\"",
      "President Trump's sweeping tariff agenda has stoked widespread uncertainty among businesses and consumers alike. Many companies are pulling back on growth and expansion, and delaying placing orders for goods manufactured overseas, as a result of the uncertainty caused by evolving rates, and the on-again, off-again status of U.S. trade policy.",
      "Consumers are also hunkering down and delaying some purchases as their confidence in the health of the economy plunges. Shoppers are concerned that tariffs could re-ignite inflation, and make everyday goods unaffordable, while economists are raising the odds of the U.S. economy entering a recession in 2025.",
      "Mr. Trump, however, insists that tariffs don't hurt Americans, and will instead spark investment in U.S. manufacturing, and create more jobs on U.S. soil.",
      "But consumers and businesses say otherwise, with McDonald's being on among numerous corporations saying they're taking a hit. \"We remain cautious about the overall health of the consumer,\" Kempczinski added.",

      "Amid sweeping tariffs newly imposed by President Trump, including 145% levies on\u00a0goods made in China, businesses are raising prices on a wide range of products, rather than absorbing the added costs from the\u00a0steep taxes on imported items.\u00a0Some are opting to tell consumers exactly why prices are rising by adding tariff surcharges to customers' bills. Others are simply raising prices across the board.",
      "Political news site Punchbowl on Tuesday\u00a0reported\u00a0that Amazon planned to list added costs derived from tariffs next to certain products sold on its site. The e-commerce giant pushed back on the report's claim, telling CBS News on Tuesday that its Amazon Haul store only \"considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products.\"",
      "\"This was never approved and is not going to happen,\" Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle said in statement Tuesday.",
      "Other retailers both big and small are taking the opposite tack and showing customers exactly how much\u00a0tariffs are adding to product costs.",
      "\"This is transparency\"",
      "David Warrick, executive vice president of Overhaul, a supply-chain management company, said most businesses can't absorb tariffs of as high as 145% on goods from China and are passing price hikes onto consumers.",
      "\"This is transparency,\" he said of some retailers' decision to display tariff charges on customer receipts.",
      "\"Consumers should understand that this is what you're paying for, and what the cost of trade policy is and how it's uplifting prices,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's useful, and a good demonstration of how tariffs are impacting daily spending.\"",

      "\"No import charges for all local warehouse items and no extra charges upon delivery,\" the Temu website says of the wide range of goods that are already in the U.S.",
      "Still, that isn't stopping some Temu shoppers from griping about the heavy new import costs on goods purchased from China, which can be greater than the value of goods themselves. In one\u00a0Reddit post dedicated to Temu and tariffs, shoppers shared screenshots of the import duties, which were added to their total bills.",
      "According to another shopper, the purchased goods\u00a0totaled $138.97, while the \"import charges\" amounted to $117.64. A third customer posted\u00a0a receipt showing import charges of $60.57 on goods worth $47.52.",
      "Triangl, an online swimwear company, announced that as of April 30, orders from U.S.-based customers will include tariff charges at checkout. On Thursday, a one-piece woman's swimsuit sold on the site with a retail cost of $119 was subject to tax of $12.35, while shipping costs ran $20. Import duties on the item amounted to $211.11, raising the final price to $362.46.",

    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 15:02:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Starbucks plans to hire more baristas at thousands of stores starting in May as the coffee chain looks to improve customer service.",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks is rethinking the role of \"innovation\" in running a coffee chain.",
      "After rolling out a new system of technical enhancements to streamline cold food and drink orders, the company made an abrupt U-turn this week and said it would halt use of its automated equipment and restore the human touch by bringing more baristas on board.",
      "The reboot comes at a delicate time for the restaurant giant, which is under pressure to boost sales and revive a brand that has lost its luster with some customers. Although Starbucks remains profitable, its sales slowed last year. In the company's most recent quarter its revenues rose 2% to $8.7 billion, falling just short of Wall Street analysts' forecasts of $8.8 billion.",
      "In a bid to win back customers, starting in May Starbucks will expand its \"Green Apron service model\" which will involve hiring new baristas at thousands of locations and fine-tuning an algorithm to manage orders, CEO Brian Niccol said on a call with Wall Street analysts earlier this week.",
      "\"What we've learned over the last couple of months, specifically behind both the algorithm pilot and the labor pilot, is the combination of staffing, deployment and technology gives us the outcomes of a great customer connection experience as well as the right speed and throughput associated with what we want to achieve, both in-cafe, mobile order and drive-thru,\" Niccol said.",
      "What is the Siren system?",
      "Named after the\u00a0twin-tailed mermaid\u00a0that serves as the face of the company's branding, the Siren system is a series of hot and cold food equipment that Starbucks started rolling out in 2022 to \"make crafting beverages and food more straightforward\" for workers, according to the coffee chain's website. The Siren System is installed in less than 10% of U.S. company operated stores, according to a Starbucks spokesperson.",
      "Building on that platform, Starbucks unveiled the Siren Craft System in July 2024. The technology is aimed at streamlining beverage and food preparation, shortening wait times, and helping baristas deal with the daily flood of orders, including the speciality concoctions the coffee chain has become known for, according to Starbucks.",
      "Less than a year later, however, Niccol said the company will halt its deployment of the Siren tech and instead invest more in labor. Focusing on expanding its workforce, the company said, has proven more effective than implementing new tech when it comes to driving growth.",
      "\"It's not that we're not going to ever use the Siren system,\" Niccol said in the earnings call. \"It's just not something that we need to be rolling out across all 10,000 stores.\"",
      "Starbucks will bring more baristas on board this year at thousands of locations and allow employees to pick up extra shifts, the Starbucks CEO said. The company's hope is that small personal touches \u2014 like handwritten notes from baristas on their cups and ceramic to-stay mugs \u2014 will keep customers coming in the door and entice them to stay longer.",
      "\"What we're discovering is the equipment doesn't solve the customer experience that we need to provide, but rather staffing the stores and deploying with this technology behind it does,\" Niccol said.",
      "To be sure, Starbucks isn't turning its back on tech. While Siren is taking a backseat, the CEO also said the company is testing a new sequencing algorithm that has lowered drive-thru and in-store wait times to less than four minutes.",
      "Starbucks\u00a0employs around 361,000 workers worldwide, according to\u00a0The Associated Press. In February, the coffee chain\u00a0announced\u00a0it would lay off 1,100 corporate employees, about 7% of all its white-collar workforce. This did not include baristas who service the stores.",
      "How much do baristas earn?",
      "Starbucks baristas earn an average of $19 an hour, according to a spokesperson. The company also offers health care, retirement and other benefits, distinguishing it from many retailers.",
      "\"When you factor in benefits, our comprehensive compensation package averages $30 per hour,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Starbucks' automation push was part of a larger effort to draw more customers to its stores, known as the \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy. After enjoying years of rapid growth, the company's progress has stalled, with U.S. same-store sales slipping 2% last year.",
      "Looking for a refresh, the company in 2024 brought Niccol \u2014 a highly regarded restaurant industry veteran who as CEO of Chipotle had helped the fast-casual chain more than double its business \u2014 in as chief executive.",
      "In coming aboard in September, Niccol promised\u00a0to elevate the in-store experience, reduce wait times and boost sales. \"It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers and return to growth,\" Niccol\u00a0said\u00a0during a call with analysts last year.",

      "Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm said the electric vehicle maker's board has not contacted recruitment firms to start a search for a new CEO\u00a0to replace Elon Musk.",
      "Denholm was responding to a report in the Wall Street Journal that said board members had reached out to several hiring firms to work on a formal process for finding a new Tesla CEO. The report also said that Tesla board members told Musk he needed to spend more time at the company.",
      "\"Earlier today, there was a media report erroneously claiming that the Tesla Board had contacted recruitment firms to initiate a CEO search at the company,\" Denholm wrote in a May 1 post on X, the social media app owned by Musk. \"This is absolutely false (and this was communicated to the media before the report was published).\"",
      "The Journal's report comes after Tesla's first-quarter sales and profit\u00a0took a hit amid a backlash from some consumers about Musk's role in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Led by Musk, the cost-cutting task force has overseen the mass firings of federal workers, including more than 216,000 government employees terminated from their jobs in March.",
      "When Tesla announced its first-quarter results on April 22, Musk said that he would significantly cut back his time on DOGE and spend more time at Tesla beginning in May.",
      "Since Musk said he would refocus on Tesla, the EV maker's stock has surged 24%.",
      "\"The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead,\" Denholm added in her statement.",
      "On the April 22 earnings call, Musk acknowledged that his role in the Trump administration has \"some blowback.\" But he also praised DOGE's work in cutting what he claims is waste, fraud and abuse in government spending. The CEO added that he planned to continue spending one to two days a week at the group.",
      "While Musk has said he wants to trim $2 trillion in annual spending from the federal budget \u2014 an amount that experts says is unfeasible without cutting major entitlement programs like Medicare \u2014 the\u00a0DOGE website\u00a0says it has saved $160 billion so far.",

    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 08:59:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says steep tariffs on U.S. imports will lead to lower taxes for Americans. Is he right?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump describes his administration's sweeping new tariffs on other countries as a tool for accomplishing a range of key economic goals, including reviving U.S. manufacturing. Recently, he's been highlighting another aim: lowering, or even eliminating, individual income taxes for most Americans.",
      "\"When Tariffs cut in, many people's Income Taxes will be substantially reduced, maybe even completely eliminated. Focus will be on people making less than $200,000 a year,\" he wrote Sunday on Truth Social, his social media app.",
      "Tariffs are already kicking in, with businesses around the country facing import duties of 145% or more on imports from China and tariffs of 10% on goods shipped from almost every other nation. Many Americans say they disapprove of these import duties, which are typically passed onto consumers through higher prices, and are bracing for higher inflation as the costs trickle through the economy.",
      "Mr. Trump's comments also point to his earlier assertions that higher tariffs could raise more than $1 trillion in federal revenue in the next year or so. On Sunday, before boarding Air Force One to return from Pope Francis' funeral, Mr. Trump asserted that the revenue raised by his tariffs \"will be enough to cut all of the income tax\" in the U.S.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment on whether the Trump administration is developing a proposal to cut taxes for most Americans.",
      "What's the link between tariffs and taxes?",
      "Currently, there is no tax bill in Congress \u2014 the arm of government with the authority to change the tax code \u2014 that would eliminate federal income taxes for people earning $200,000 or less. Even so, the House is working on a reconciliation bill that would extend Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add a few new reductions promised by the president on the campaign trail, such as eliminating taxes on employee tips.",
      "If passed, that bill would mean individuals would continue to pay the same tax rates they've paid since Mr. Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act took effect beginning for the 2018 tax year, with\u00a0individual tax brackets ranging from 10% to 37%, depending on a person's income. And if the legislation is enacted, notably, most Americans would see no difference in their federal income tax rate.",
      "\"There is no real connection\" between Mr. Trump's tariffs and lower taxes, said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, a think tank focused on tax issues. \"He has the authority to impose higher tariffs, and he's done that. But he doesn't have the authority to unilaterally cut income taxes \u2014 that's done by Congress.\"",
      "There is \"zero chance\" that Congress would eliminate income taxes for a large swath of the U.S. population because the new tariffs won't generate enough revenue to replace the $2.4 trillion in income taxes\u00a0paid by American households each year, she added.",
      "Even if a president imposed 50% tariffs on all goods imported into the U.S. \u2014 or twice the current rate under Mr. Trump \u2014 the income generated would represent less than 40% of what income taxes bring in, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research firm.",
      "Why tariffs can't replace income taxes",
      "Even the notion of eliminating income taxes for people earning less than $200,000 doesn't add up, York said. Here's why: Mr. Trump's tariffs could raise about $170 billion in revenue this year, while wiping out individual taxes for people earning less than $200,000 would forego $700 billion in tax revenue this year, she estimated.",
      "\"You would need tariffs multiple times higher than what we have now\" to generate the revenue to make up for the gap in lost taxes, York said. Making the math work is \"an impossibility,\" she added.",
      "Yet hiking taxes even more aggressively would heighten the risks of a U.S. recession, which would cause job losses, inhibit consumer spending, suppress business investment and further roil financial markets \u2014 all developments that reduce the government's tax receipts.",
      "Mr. Trump's claim about tariffs lowering taxes amounts to \"an argument that says, 'If Americans pay more out of their left pocket, the government will be able to put more in their right pocket,'\" said Joe Rosenberg, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, another think tank focused on taxes.",
      "\"Even if you make the math work, it's really replacing one form of tax with another \u2014 and the other important point here is these taxes have very different distributional effects across income types,\" he added.",
      "Translation: Tariffs take a bigger bite out of low- and middle-income Americans' budgets because they spend a larger share of their incomes on basics like food and household goods than compared with high-income Americans. A typical low-income household is likely to see their disposable income fall by 5.5% under Mr. Trump's tariffs, compared with 1.9% for the highest-earning families, according to a March 31\u00a0estimate from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "But faced with higher prices for consumer goods, many households would cut back on spending, adding to the challenges of relying on tariffs to raise enough revenue to replace income taxes, experts say.",
      "Dueling goals",
      "Mr. Trump's move lifting the effective U.S. tariff rate to its highest since 1943\u00a0reflects conflicting aims, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. For instance, the president has said he wants to use tariffs to secure better trade deals with other nations. Yet reaching new trade pacts with lower tariff rates would undercut the president's goal of relying on import duties to replace the federal income tax.",
      "Mr. Trump's back-and-forth on his tariffs, including temporarily rolling back some import fees and creating exclusions for certain products, also undermines the administration's ability to generate a new source of federal revenue, Scott Lincicome, a trade expert with the Cato Institute, told CBS News.",
      "\"If you are tariffs on, tariffs off, because of these negotiations that are supposedly going on, you're not raising much revenue, or protecting industry or getting new investment the United States because of all the uncertainty,\" Lincicome said.",
      "By dangling the prospect of a tax cut, Mr. Trump may be seeking to convince Americans to bear the brunt of the tariffs' impact, which economists say could slow U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "\"Americans are about to find out really fast that this is a tax on us,\" York noted. \"It will hurt our trading partners, too, but it is a tax that in large part falls on American businesses and American workers.\"",

      "The nation's gross domestic product \u2014 the total value of products and services \u2014 shrank at a 0.3% annual rate, down from growth of 2.4% in the final three months of 2024, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday in its initial GDP estimate. It's the worst quarterly performance for the U.S. economy since early 2022, when the economy was in recovery after cratering during the COVID pandemic.",
      "The U.S. economy was forecast to show 0.8% growth in the first three months of 2025, according to the average estimate of economists polled by FactSet.",
      "The slowdown comes amid growing concerns that Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy, with some economists raising the chances of the U.S.\u00a0slipping into a recession in 2025. Although the Trump administration's blanket tariffs were announced on April 2 \u2014 after the end of the quarter \u2014 businesses sought to get ahead of the impact of the import duties by front-loading purchases early in the year.",
      "The report may not fully reflect the state of economic growth, economists cautioned, noting that the figures are likely to be noisy because of the surge in imports as businesses sought to get ahead of tariffs. A rise in imports may appear to lower economic growth and show a shift away from domestic consumption, but that doesn't tell the whole story, economists note.",
      "Nevertheless, concerns about the tariffs caused businesses and consumers to change their behavior at year start, signaling that the rollout of steep import fees could create headwinds for the economy later in 2025, experts said.",
      "\"This artificial front-loading of demand sets the stage for a sharper demand cliff in Q2 \u2014 a far more troubling phase of the ongoing economic slowdown.\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",

      "\"Overall, [the GDP data is] not as bad as feared, although some of the drop back in imports in the second quarter will now be partly offset by a slowing in inventory accumulation,\" analysts with the investment advisory firm said in a report. \"We forecast a 2.0% annualized rebound in second-quarter GDP.\"",

      "Economists expect the U.S. economy to slow in 2025, partly due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which are import duties paid by American companies like Walmart or Target. When faced with higher tariffs, companies typically pass on all or some of the costs to shoppers, which can depress consumer spending.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 17:59:43 -0400",
    "summary": "A new proposal from Republican lawmakers would eliminate the popular SAVE repayment plan, which helped lower costs for millions.",
    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers on Monday introduced a proposal to overhaul the nation's student loan system, including eliminating a popular repayment plan that had helped millions save money on their debt payments.",
      "The proposal, which was released by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, would save more than $330 billion, according to a statement by Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan.",
      "The plan comes as Republicans move to slash federal spending in order to pass legislation that would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add measures such abolishing taxes on tips. The student loan proposal also takes aim at a major\u00a0 repayment program that sparked a lawsuit from Republican states last year over allegations the plan would result in lost revenue.",
      "The new GOP proposal is aimed at \"addressing the root causes of skyrocketing college costs,\" Walberg said in a statement.",
      "The Republican plan could result in higher costs for people with college debt, with a typical borrower with a bachelors degree paying almost $3,000 more per year versus other government repayment plans, according to the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student debt.",
      "The Republican proposal, which is in its early stages, may face changes as it progresses through the legislative process. Here's what to know.",
      "How could income-based repayment plans change?",
      "For Americans with student debt, the Republican proposal would eliminate existing income-contingent repayment arrangements, including the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created in 2023 by the Biden administration. These plans typically link a person's monthly loan payment to their income, with the goal of ensuring that borrowers aren't burdened with excessive loan costs.",
      "SAVE proved popular with student borrowers, with more than 8 million enrollees by the time it was paused last year by the courts. The program was heralded by President Biden at the time as \"the most affordable student loan plan ever.\"",
      "Under the Republican proposal, the four existing\u00a0income-based plans would be replaced with one program called the \"repayment assistance plan.\" This would calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of that amount.",
      "Borrowers would need to repay their loans for a maximum of 30 years, the proposal states. Under the SAVE plan, a borrower's student loan could be wiped out after 10 years.",
      "\"Based on our review of this proposal, contrasted with the benefits and protections available to borrowers under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan, we found that a typical borrower will see monthly student loan costs spike by hundreds of dollars per month, or thousands of dollars per year,\" Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said in an April 28 letter to Republican lawmakers.",
      "What other repayment plans would be available?",
      "The GOP plan would offer another option for repaying student loans called the \"standard repayment plan.\" That would allow borrowers to repay their loans with a fixed monthly payment, with terms that extend from 10 to 25 years, based on the amount borrowed.",
      "For instance, people with less than $25,000 in debt could repay their loans over 10 years, while those with $25,000 to $50,000 in loans would have 15 years of repayments, according to the proposed\u00a0bill.",
      "How could Pell grants change?",
      "Under the Republican plan, the Pell grant program \u2014 geared to low- and middle-income students \u2014 would face new limits.",
      "For instance, the proposal would change the definition of a full-time student to someone with at least 15 credit hours per semester, up from the current 12 credit hours. It would also bar students who are attending half-time from receiving Pell grants.",
      "The plan would also make it tougher for families that own assets, yet have low incomes, to qualify for Pell grants.",
      "What other changes could occur?",
      "The Republican plan would scrap Grad PLUS loans, which are for graduate and professional students, as well as subsidized loans for undergraduate students, where students don't have to pay interest on the loans while in school.",
      "The plan would also require undergrad students to take out their maximum loan amount \u2014 $50,000 under the proposal, up from $31,000 currently \u2014 before their parents could take out a Parent PLUS loan to cover the rest of their cost of attending college.",
      "The Parent PLUS loans would be capped at $50,000, versus the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid the student receives.",

      "\"Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?\" Leavitt said during a press briefing Tuesday.",
      "However, Amazon pushed back on the report, saying in a Tuesday statement to CBS News that its Amazon Haul store \"considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products.\" Amazon Haul was introduced late last year by the e-commerce giant to sell low-cost goods to compete with Temu and Shein.",
      "\"This was never approved and is not going to happen,\" said Tim Doyle, an Amazon spokesperson.",

      "\"Jeff Bezos was very nice,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He was terrific. He solved the problem very quickly. And he did the right thing.\"",
      "The president has imposed tariffs as high as 145% on goods imported from China, while he lowered a range of tariffs on most other nations to a 10% baseline rate during a 90-day pause that began earlier this month. Tariffs are import duties that are paid by U.S. companies such as Walmart and Target, which typically pass on the added fee to consumers in the form of higher costs.",
      "The duties are already making foreign-made goods more expensive for U.S.-based consumers.",
      "Earlier this month, data showed that\u00a0Amazon sellers had already hiked prices on nearly 1,000 of the top 100,000 selling products on the site, according to SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike was about 30%.",
      "At the time, Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\"",
      "\"We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, and we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items,\" Amazon said in a statement earlier this month to CBS MoneyWatch.",

The suit claims state and city laws labeled as \"sanctuary\" policies\u00a0are dangerous and hurting the Trump Administration-led efforts to deport people who are here illegally.",
      "The lawsuit was filed Friday in federal court in Denver and states \"The United States has well-established, preeminent, and preemptive authority to regulate immigration matters.\" It specifically mentions the controversial apartment complex in Aurora which President Trump claimed last year had been taken over by a Venezuelan gang. Justice Department attorneys argue Colorado's policies allowed Tren de Aragua to seize control of the building.",
      "Local officials have called Trump's claims that the gang had taken over large swaths of the city exaggerated, but acknowledged the apartment complex was terrorized, including by people linked to Tren de Aragua.",
      "The lawsuit calls out city ordinances and state laws like the one blocking local law enforcement agencies from helping federal immigration authorities. It claims Denver and Colorado's policies \"by intent and design interfere with and discriminate against the Federal Government's enforcement of federal immigration law,\" as stated in the lawsuit's complaint.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge ruled Friday that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and permanently blocked the administration from enforcing it.",
      "In a 102-page decision, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ruled in favor of the firm and said Mr. Trump's directive that sought to punish it sent the message that \"lawyers must stick to the party line, or else.\"",
      "\"Using the powers of the federal government to target lawyers for their representation of clients and avowed progressive employment policies in an overt attempt to suppress and punish certain viewpoints, however, is contrary to the Constitution, which requires that the government respond to dissenting or unpopular speech or ideas with 'tolerance, not coercion,'\" Howell wrote.",
      "She found that the executive order violates the First, Fifth and Sixth amendments to the Constitution.",
      "The decision from Howell, who sits on the U.S. district court in Washington, D.C., is the first summary ruling in one of four cases brought by law firms that have been penalized by the president as a result of their associations with people and causes he disfavors. In addition to Perkins Coie, the firms Jenner & Block, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, and Susman Godfrey have also filed lawsuits challenging their respective executive orders.",
      "Perkins Coie represented former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and hired a research firm that retained former British spy Christopher Steele, who produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "The executive orders are all similar. They call for the immediate suspension of any active security clearances held by firm employees. They direct government agencies to require contractors to disclose any business with the firms, require agency leaders to review all contracts with the firms or entities that do business with them, and limit firm employees' access to federal buildings and government workers.",
      "When taken together, Howell said the directives support Perkins Coie's assertion that Mr. Trump has mounted a campaign of \"using the power of the presidency to target individual lawyers and law firms associated with them based on personal dislike of their legal work \u2014 in other words, for retribution.\"",
      "Howell's ruling in favor of the firm was expected, since she appeared sympathetic to its bid to block Mr. Trump's directive during a hearing last month. She had previously blocked enforcement temporarily of the order's provisions on government contracting and access to federal buildings and personnel. Still, her decision is a significant victory for Perkins Coie and a rebuke of the president.",
      "While four firms have sought to fight Mr. Trump's executive orders targeting them in court, at least nine others have reached agreements with the White House to avoid being penalized by the president. The deals, announced by Mr. Trump on social media, include commitments to provide between $40 million and $125 million in pro bono legal work.",
      "Referencing these nine firms, Howell said they appear to have received Mr. Trump's suggestion that they may be subject to punishment unless they agree to his terms. One firm, Paul Weiss, was the subject of an executive order by the president that was rescinded after it agreed to provide $40 million in free legal services during Mr. Trump's term. Howell said that revocation \"demonstrates the coercive power of such targeting by the Trump administration.\"",
      "\"If the founding history of this country is any guide, those who stood up in court to vindicate constitutional rights and, by so doing, served to promote the rule of law, will be the models lauded when this period of American history is written,\" she wrote in a footnote.",
      "Appointed by former President Barack Obama, Howell said the executive order targeting Perkins Coie \"stigmatizes and penalizes\" the firm and its employees \u2014 from partners to attorneys to mail room attendants \u2014 because of its past and current representation of clients who take positions that the president dislikes.",
      "Perkins Coie, Howell wrote, is neither employed by the government nor a contractor with it, but is instead a \"law firm representing some clients disliked by the president, engaging in some litigation seeking results disliked by the president, and operating its business, in part, in a manner disliked by the president.\"",
      "She said the case \"presents an unprecedented attack\" on the principles of the American judicial system.",
      "\"Here, the Trump administration's blunt exercise of power in EO 14230 to target Perkins Coie for adverse actions by every federal agency violates the Constitution in multiple ways,\" Howell wrote.",
      "The judge said that the executive order was issued as \"retribution\" for Perkins Coie's work and Mr. Trump's \"grievances,\" which she said he has publicly aired since 2017.",
      "Howell repeatedly characterizes the executive order issued by the president as a deliberate means of harming Perkins Coie. In finding that it violates the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law, the judge wrote that \"settling personal vendettas by targeting a disliked business or individual for punitive government action is not a legitimate use of the powers of the U.S. government or an American president.\"",
      "Lawyers for Perkins Coie had argued during a hearing before Howell last month that Mr. Trump's executive order was unlawful retaliation and should be permanently blocked. The Justice Department, meanwhile, had urged the judge to dismiss the case.",

    "summary": "Australia's vote comes just a week after Canada's elections, where President Trump's influence was also felt.",
    "story": [
      "Australians are voting in a national election this weekend, and President Trump appears to be playing an outsized role as nations continue to respond to the vision of U.S. foreign policy he's put in place in the first 100 days of his second term.",
      "Polling stations on the eastern coast of the country, which includes Sydney and Melbourne, opened Saturday at 8 a.m. local time and close at 6 p.m. (4 a.m. ET on Saturday). In Western Australia, which includes Perth, the poll closing time comes two hours later.",
      "Australia's vote comes just a week after Canada's elections, where Mr. Trump's influence was also felt. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney \u2014 whose numbers spiked as he pushed back against tariff threats and Mr. Trump's jibes about annexing Canada into a \"51st state\" \u2014 crushed Pierre Poilievre's hopes to return the Conservative Party to power after a decade of Liberal Party rule.",
      "The center-right Liberal-National Coalition in Australia led the polls for nearly a year and had seemed to be on a path to form a government. Since Mr. Trump took office in January, however, the coalition's support has plummeted, and it now trails the Labor Party by 4.4 points, according to YouGov.",
      "Opposition leader Peter Dutton has run a campaign echoing Mr. Trump's messaging focusing on the economy. His Liberal Party, whose motto is \"Let's get Australia back on track,\" proposed cutting government waste and mandating federal workers return to the office.",
      "\"It was literally as if Dutton was copying what the United States government was doing, and I think as such, that ended up being enormously unpopular,\" Alan Tidwell, a professor of Australian, New Zealand and Pacific studies at Georgetown University, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "The economic downturn in Australia in recent years in the wake of the pandemic initially threatened center-left Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's prospects of remaining in power. But Dutton's similarities to Mr. Trump and the U.S. president's growing unpopularity among the Australian public seem to have boosted Albanese's chances.",
      "Still, Albanese has embraced a moderate approach to Mr. Trump, refraining from criticizing him directly. When asked during a debate last month whether he trusts Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Albanese said he had \"no reason not to\" trust either leader and said in a separate radio interview that he would speak with Mr. Trump after the election, should he win.",
      "\"I assure you I'm not staying up at night trying to ring anyone at the moment,\" Albanese said.",
      "But Tidwell told CBS News that even if tariffs were reversed, Mr. Trump's unpopularity in Australia would still impact the election. \"It's not saving Labor to the point where they can win an outright majority, but I think that they will win office with a minority government,\" he said.",
      "Australia is among several nations with which the U.S. does not have a trade deficit, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The two nations signed the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement in 2004, and it took effect on Jan. 1, 2005. Last month, Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, asked U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer why Australia was included on Mr. Trump's tariff list.",
      "\"The idea we are going to whack friend and foe alike undermines our national security and, frankly, makes us not a good partner going forward,\" Warner said.",
      "The U.S. was Australia's second-largest trading partner after China in the 2023-24 financial year, according to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. While it is unclear if American tariffs would prompt China to fill the gap, Beijing's increased presence in the Indo-Pacific is considered a national security threat by Canberra.",
      "The Australia, U.K. and U.S. trilateral security partnership",
      "Australia and the U.S., along with the U.K., also share a close national security relationship, known as AUKUS, which was formalized in 2021. The trilateral security partnership also allows Australia to obtain Virginia-class nuclear submarines, which are expected to join the Royal Australian Navy's fleet by the early 2030s.",
      "Nishank Motwani, senior fellow and director of alliance strategy at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute USA in Washington, D.C., told CBS News that AUKUS matters a lot to Australia's defense capability, but it needs to show the Trump administration how Canberra is being a responsible ally when it comes to defense spending to counter China.",
      "\"With a more influential China, which is more coercive and aggressive in the way in which it is just carrying out its affairs in the Indo-Pacific, Australia needs to do more as a way to push back against China's ability to carve out its sphere of influence,\" Motwani said.",
      "As the Trump White House redefines America's leadership role abroad and imposes tariffs on allies and adversaries alike, only 36% of Australians expressed any level of trust in the U.S. \"to act responsibly in the world,\" according to the Sydney-based Lowy Institute, whose survey in April also noted this was a \"new low in two decades\" of its polling.",
      "\"The level of distrust has certainly shot through the roof,\" Tidwell said. \"But I think that Donald Trump's launch of the trade war and his other comments about Canada and the Panama Canal and Greenland have all really upset the apple cart, and Australians are really wondering, what does the future hold?\"",

      "President Trump's venture into crypto products has increased his family's wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a new report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole.",
      "The group State Democracy Defenders Action estimated in a new report that the president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth \u2014 or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto exchange affiliated with the Trump family that launched in October 2024. State Democracy Defenders Action identifies itself as non-partisan, but it is overseen by frequent critics of President Trump, with an agenda focused on \"the autocratic threat to our nation.\"",
      "The president's net worth is expected to get another bump, with World Liberty Financial's announcement this week that a Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in the Trump family-affiliated crypto fund. The Emirati firm, MGX, will purchase $2 billion in a stablecoin product offered by World Liberty, the company said in a statement to CBS. The currency, called \"USD1\" will then be used to invest in Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges.",
      "World Liberty has ties to the president and his sons. The fine print on the company's website says an entity affiliated with Mr. Trump and his family members own a 60% stake in the company.",
      "According to the company's public reports, a Trump family entity also holds 22.5 billion of the $WLF tokens \u2013- and takes an additional 75% in net revenue from future token purchases.",
      "Details of the MGX deal have not been released, so it is unclear how much the Trump family stands to benefit from this transaction.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, World Liberty said the deal represents the \"single largest-ever investment in a crypto company\" and sets a \"historic precedent.\" It did not respond to questions about how much the Trump family stands to make from the investment.",

Canter, who co-authored the new report, served as senior ethics counsel for the Treasury Department under both Republican and Democratic administrations.",
      "\"In terms of prior presidents in the modern age, they've all divested their assets, or they've rolled them over into what we call blind trusts,\" Canter said. \"President Trump did not do that in his first term, and it seems as if in the second term he's doubled down and he is all in (on) the crypto industry.\"",
      "The report leans heavily on past media reports, including a Fortune magazine article that reviewed the Trump family's financial disclosures and provided the original estimates of the president's net worth.",
      "Crypto companies are not legally required to disclose who is buying and selling on their platforms to the public, so little is known about who has invested in Trump family-affiliated crypto products.",
      "Canter says this makes it more difficult to identify potential conflicts of interest.",

      "The president, who as recently as 2021 described crypto currency as a \"scam,\" has since embraced digital currency, saying he hopes to make the United States the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "Since his inauguration, Mr. Trump has made several moves to unwind the regulatory environment that many industry insiders say crippled crypto businesses.",
      "He has issued multiple executive orders to promote cryptocurrency, including one that seeks to promote the growth of digital currencies and another that instructed the Treasury Department to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve.",
      "Mr. Trump has also used his office to pardon the three founders of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, who pleaded guilty in 2022 to failing to prevent money laundering on their platform, according to a report by Reuters.",
      "The value of Mr. Trump's crypto assets have at times fluctuated with his policy decisions and social media posts.",
      "The value of $TRUMP increased 18.1% in early March after the president issued an executive order promoting a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, according to the report. A few weeks later, on March 23, the president posted \"I Love $TRUMP\u2013 SO COOL!! The Greatest of them all!!!!\" on Truth Social, which led to an increase in the price of the meme coin from $10.93 to $12.24.",
      "Whether or not the $TRUMP coin increases in value, the president's business collects trading fees when people buy or sell the coin. A Reuters analysis found that business entities behind the $TRUMP coin could have made nearly $100 million in fees in less than two weeks of trading.",

      "After the Trump administration dismissed nearly 400 scientists who compile the nation's major quadrennial report on the impacts of climate change in the U.S., two scientific groups announced a plan to publish a special collection focused on the subject to ensure the scientists' work can be accessed.",
      "The American Geophysical Union, the world's largest association of earth and space scientists, and the American Meteorological Society, the professional society for atmospheric and related sciences and services, announced they would be inviting climate scientists and researchers to submit their work for what they said would be a \"first of its kind\" collection.",
      "The groups say their collection isn't meant to replace the National Climate Assessment, but would complement it, since the dismissal of hundreds of scientists suggests that the next National Climate Assessment may not be as extensive as the previous ones. The Trump administration is legally obligated to produce the assessment, but the White House told CBS News that it's evaluating the scope of the assessment that it will publish.",
      "The National Climate Assessment is a major publication produced every four years that summarizes the impacts of climate change in the U.S., and it is congressionally mandated under the Global Change Research Act of 1990. The sixth edition is scheduled for publication in 2027, and preparations have been underway for months to meet that deadline.",

    "summary": "A federal district court judge blocked DOGE from accessing sensitive information from the Social Security Administration.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to let the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have access to the sensitive information kept by the Social Security Administration.",
      "The emergency appeal to the Supreme Court stems from an injunction issued by a federal district court judge in Maryland who limited DOGE's access to Social Security Administration system of records containing the personal information of millions of Americans.",
      "The judge concluded in her April decision that the plaintiffs, two labor unions and an advocacy group represented by Democracy Forward, were likely to succeed on their claim that the Social Security Administration's decision to give DOGE access to millions of Americans' confidential information violated the Privacy Act and a federal law governing the agency rulemaking process.",
      "\"T]he issue here is not the work that DOGE or the agency want to do. The issue is about how they want to do the work,\" U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander wrote in her 145-page decision. \"The DOGE Team seeks access to the [personally identifiable information] that millions of Americans entrusted to SSA, and the SSA defendants have agreed to provide it. For some 90 years, SSA has been guided by the foundational principle of an expectation of privacy with respect to its records. This case exposes a wide fissure in the foundation.\"",
      "She did allow DOGE team members to have access to redacted or anonymized information from the Social Security Administration, but only if they met certain conditions, such as receiving trainings and undergoing background investigations.",
      "The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit declined a Trump administration request to halt that injunction, leading it to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "In asking the high court to lift the district court's injunction, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that it is forcing the executive branch to stop federal employees tasked with modernizing government systems from accessing the data contained within them.",
      "\"The government cannot eliminate waste and fraud if district courts bar the very agency personnel with expertise and the designated mission of curtailing such waste and fraud from performing their jobs,\" he said.",
      "The solicitor general, who argues on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court, said that the plaintiffs who brought the case did not have the legal right to sue. Sauer also argued that the district court did not have the legal authority to issue sweeping relief, which he said harmed \"urgent federal priorities\" and thwarted the executive branch's functions.",
      "\"Employees charged with modernizing government information systems and routing out fraud, waste, and abuse in data systems plainly need access to those systems,\" he wrote. \"Yet the district court instead viewed agency employees within the SSA DOGE team as the equivalent of intruders who break into hotel rooms.\"",
      "The Trump administration has sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court in at least a dozen cases, as more than 200 legal challenges targeting many aspects of second-term agenda move their way through the federal courts. But the legal battle over DOGE's access to Social Security data is the first directly involving the cost-cutting task force to land before the justices.",
      "President Trump\u00a0established DOGE\u00a0on his first day back in the White House and has said that he tasked Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, with leading the initiative. The White House has said, though, that Amy Gleason, who worked at DOGE's predecessor entity, U.S. Digital Service, is formally the administrator of DOGE. The task force's employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen agencies as part of the president's plan to shrink the size of the government.",
      "But DOGE's attempts to access Americans' sensitive data at agencies including the Departments of Treasury and Education, and the Office of Personnel Management, have led to their own set of lawsuits claiming the task force's members have not been complying with the Privacy Act, the federal law that aims to protect Americans' private information.",
      "Musk's role in DOGE, too, has sparked a set of challenges that argue his actions violate the Constitution's Appointments Clause. A different federal judge in Maryland ruled in March that Musk and DOGE likely violated the Constitution through its unilateral shut down of the U.S. Agency for International Development. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit agreed to pause that decision while it considers an appeal by the Trump administration.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Friday that his administration will be rescinding Harvard University's tax-exempt status, further escalating the ongoing feud with the Ivy League school.",
      "\"We are going to be taking away Harvard's Tax Exempt Status. It's what they deserve!\" the president said in a post to Truth Social.",
      "Mr. Trump did not provide further details about the effort to strip Harvard of its designation as a 501(c)(3) organization, but he has floated taking such a step as recently as last month.",
      "Roughly 2 million organizations have received tax-exempt status from the Internal Revenue Service, including charities like churches, environmental groups and universities. The designation means the groups are exempt from paying federal income taxes and the IRS considers donations to 501(c)(3) organizations to be tax-deductible.",
      "Harvard president Alan Garber expressed doubt about the legality of revoking the status.",
      "\"If the government goes through with a plan to revoke our tax exempt status, it would\u2026be highly illegal, unless there is some reasoning that we have not been exposed to that would justify this dramatic move,\" Garber told the Wall Street Journal. Tax-exempt status, he said, enables universities to carry out their missions of education and research.",
      "\"Obviously that would be severely impaired if we were to lose our tax exempt status,\" he said.",
      "The tax code prohibits executive branch officials from asking an IRS employee to conduct or terminate an audit or investigation into a specific taxpayer.",
      "\"The government has long exempted universities from taxes in order to support their educational mission. The tax exemption means that more of every dollar can go toward scholarships for students, lifesaving and life-enhancing medical research, and technological advancements that drive economic growth. There is no legal basis to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status,\" a Harvard spokesperson said in response to Mr. Trump.",
      "The spokesperson continued: \"Such an unprecedented action would endanger our ability to carry out our educational mission. It would result in diminished financial aid for students, abandonment of critical medical research programs, and lost opportunities for innovation. The unlawful use of this instrument more broadly would have grave consequences for the future of higher education in America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's decision is the latest in a series of moves targeting the university. His administration announced last month that it would be freezing $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts to Harvard after the university rejected a series of demands made by the administration. Among the conditions were for Harvard to discontinue its diversity, equity and inclusion programs, positions and initiatives, change its hiring practices and change its leadership.",
      "After the Trump administration announced it would be freezing the funding to Harvard, the university sued and alleged the move was unlawful. It's likely a withdrawal of Harvard's tax-exempt status will prompt further legal action.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security also demanded Harvard turn over information on certain foreign student visa holders or risk losing its certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. There were more than 6,700 international students enrolled at the school as of October, according to data from the university.",

    "summary": "Army plans for a potential military parade on President Trump's birthday in June include military vehicles and \"thousands\" of troops.",
    "story": [
      "The Army is planning for a potential military parade on President Trump's birthday on June 14 that would include \"thousands\" of troops, as well and Bradley and Stryker fighting vehicles, the White House and a defense official confirmed.",
      "According to planning documents obtained by the AP, the parade calls for over 6,600 soldiers, at least 150 vehicles, 50 helicopters, tanks, seven bands and possibly a couple thousand civilians.",
      "The documents, dated April 29 and 30, have not been publicly released. They represent the Army's most recent blueprint for its long-planned 250th anniversary festival on the National Mall and the newly added element \u2014 a large military parade that Mr. Trump has long wanted.",
      "The Army anniversary coincides with Mr. Trump's 79th birthday, which falls on June 14.",
      "A parade of this size is likely to cost tens of millions of dollars. The price would include moving the military vehicles, equipment, aircraft and troops from across the country to Washington, D.C., and the need to feed and house thousands of service members.",
      "High costs halted Mr. Trump's push for a parade in his first term, and the tanks and other heavy vehicles that are part of the Army's latest plans have raised concerns from city officials about damage to roads.",
      "Asked about plans for a parade, Army spokesman Steve Warren said Thursday that no final decisions have been made. Col. Dave Butler, another Army spokesman, said the Army is excited about the plans for its anniversary.",
      "\"We want to make it into an event that the entire nation can celebrate with us,\" said Butler. \"We want Americans to know their Army and their soldiers. A parade might become part of that, and we think that will be an excellent addition to what we already have planned.\"",
      "Others familiar with the documents, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans have not been finalized, said they represent the Army's plans as it prepares for any White House approval of the parade. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "There has been no formal approval yet. Changes to the plans have been made in recent weeks and more are likely. Much of the equipment would have to be brought in by train or flown in.",
      "Mr. Trump weighed in on the military Thursday night, though he didn't mention plans for June 14. Writing on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said, \"We are going to start celebrating our victories again!\" He said he would rename May 8 \u2014 known as Victory in Europe Day \u2014 as \"Victory Day for World War II\" and change Veterans Day, on Nov. 11, to \"Victory Day for World War I.\"",
      "Some equipment and troops were already going to be included in the Army's birthday celebration, which has been in the works for more than a year. The festival was set to involve activities and displays on the National Mall, including a fitness competition, climbing wall, armored vehicles, Humvees, helicopters and other equipment.",
      "A parade, however, would increase the equipment and troops involved. According to the plans, as many as 6,300 of the service members would be marching in the parade, while the remainder would be responsible for other tasks and support.",
      "The Army's early festival plans did not include a parade, but officials confirmed last month that the Army had started discussions about adding one.",
      "The plans say the parade would showcase the Army's 250 years of service and foresee bringing in soldiers from at least 11 corps and divisions nationwide. Those could include a Stryker battalion with two companies of Stryker vehicles, a tank battalion and two companies of tanks, an infantry battalion with Bradley vehicles, Paladin artillery vehicles, Howitzers and infantry vehicles.",
      "There would be seven Army bands and a parachute jump by the Golden Knights. And documents suggest that civilian participants would include historical vehicles and aircraft and two bands, along with people from veterans groups, military colleges and reenactor organizations.",
      "According to the plan, the parade would be classified as a national special security event, and that request has been submitted by the National Park Service and is under review.",
      "And it is expected that the evening parade would be followed by a concert and fireworks.",
      "One of the documents raises concerns about some limitations, which include where troops would be housed and \"significant concerns regarding security requirements\" as equipment flows into the city. It says the biggest unknown so far is which units would be participating.",
      "In his first term, Trump proposed having a parade after seeing one in France on Bastille Day in 2017. Mr. Trump said that after watching the two-hour procession along the famed Champs-Elysees that he wanted an even grander one on Pennsylvania Avenue.",
      "That plan was ultimately dumped due to the huge costs \u2014 with one estimate of a $92 million price tag \u2014 and other logistical issues. Among those were objections from city officials who said including tanks and other heavy armored vehicles would tear up the roads.",
      "Trump said in a social media post in 2018 that he was canceling the event over the costs and accused local politicians of price gouging.",
      "This year, as plans progressed for the Army to host its birthday festival in Washington, talk about a parade began anew.",
      "D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser acknowledged in April that the administration reached out to the city about holding a parade on June 14 that would stretch from Arlington, Virginia, where the Pentagon and Arlington National Cemetery are located, across the Potomac River and into Washington.",
      "Bowser at the time said she didn't know if the event was being \"characterized as a military parade\" but added that tanks rolling through the city's streets \"would not be good.\"",
      "\"If military tanks were used, they should be accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads,\" she said.",
      "In 2018, the Pentagon appeared to agree. A memo from the defense secretary's staff said plans for the parade \u2014 at that time \u2014 would include only wheeled vehicles and no tanks to minimize damage to local infrastructure.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has reached a settlement with the family of Ashli Babbitt, the Trump supporter who was shot and killed while in the mob breaching the House Speaker's Lobby on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News the settlement has been reached in principle but is not yet signed. In a court proceeding Friday, a plaintiff's attorney confirmed the settlement in principle was reached. It would avert a trial and further proceedings in a $30 million civil suit filed by the conservative activist group Judicial Watch on behalf of Babbitt's estate, including her late husband.",
      "Babbitt's death was a rallying point for Trump loyalists and Capitol rioters who alleged police used unnecessary force in stopping the mob on Jan. 6. In the civil lawsuit, Babbitt's estate alleged U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd was negligent in the issue of force and his firearm. The suit also argued Byrd was not in uniform and was wearing a COVID mask when he opened fire against Babbitt. The suit accused Byrd of failing to \"de-escalate.\"",
      "\"Ashli was unarmed,\" the lawsuit said. \"Her hands were up in the air, empty, and in plain view of Lt. Byrd and other officers in the lobby. Ashli posed no threat to the safety of anyone.\"",
      "The case, which was initially filed in California, was transferred to the Washington, D.C., federal court in 2024 and was defended by the Justice Department under the Biden administration.",
      "In a 2024 court filing, the department argued, \"Ms. Babbitt unlawfully entered the Capitol. She made her way to the east doors of the Speaker's Lobby situated immediately behind the Chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives, the site of Joint Sessions of Congress. Although officers had barricaded the Speaker's Lobby doors with heavy furniture, demonstrators broke through the glass panels of the lobby doors and matching windows (called \"sidelights\") on either side of the doors.\"",
      "It went on to say, \"Michael Byrd, a U.S. Capitol Police lieutenant, was positioned on the other side of the lobby doors. When Ms. Babbitt, wearing a backpack, tried to climb through a sidelight into the Speaker's Lobby, Lt. Byrd fatally shot her.\"",
      "In an August 2021 internal review, the U.S. Capitol Police said Byrd saved lives and did not engage in misconduct.",
      "\"This officer and the officer's family have been the subject of numerous credible and specific threats for actions that were taken as part of the job of all our officers: defending the Congress, Members, staff and the democratic process,\" the review said. \"The actions of the officer in this case potentially saved Members and staff from serious injury and possible death from a large crowd of rioters who forced their way into the U.S. Capitol and to the House Chamber where Members and staff were steps away.\"",
      "Footage from Jan. 6 shows Babbitt trying to climb through a smashed window as the mob sought to breach the House Speaker's Lobby, where the counting of the electoral votes had been interrupted. Members of Congress were evacuating the area during the riot.",
      "Babbitt's mother, Micki Wittehoff helped lead a nightly protest outside the Washington, D.C., jail for more than two years, in defense of U.S. Capitol riot defendants and convicted felons. Wittehoff's advocacy helped secure meetings with then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, references to Babbitt by President Trump and a selfie photo with Kash Patel, who later was confirmed as the director of the FBI.",
      "Hours after he was inaugurated, the president issued a blanket pardon for more than 1,500 Capitol riot defendants. The Justice Department has fired prosecutors who handled the Jan. 6 cases.",
      "Last month, Brendan Ballou, one of the Jan. 6 prosecutors who resigned after Trump took office told CBS News the pardons and firings were an effort to whitewash history.",
      "\"The goal here is to rewrite the history of Jan. 6,\" Ballou said. \"There are enormous number of politicians whose whole careers now depend on that day being forgotten because if it's remembered, people will realize they are supporting a president that tried to incite an insurrection and overthrow the peaceful democratic transfer of power. And so there's a concerted effort by these folks to make sure that that history is forgotten, and firing those prosecutors is part of that effort.\"",

      "The president's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would slash non-defense discretionary spending by $163 billion from current levels, the official told reporters on a conference call Friday, while defense spending would surpass $1 trillion for the first time ever. The president's budget proposal, along with efforts by the White House and Republicans to claw back some federal funding already authorized by Congress, would solidify cuts championed by the White House's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.",
      "\"This is a pretty historic effort to deal with the bureaucracy that you have heard and seen such action from our administration with DOGE to be able to deal with the bureaucracy that we believe has grown up over many years to be entrenched against the interests of the American people,\" the senior OMB official told reporters on a conference call Friday, speaking on condition of anonymity.",
      "The president's proposed budget would put all discretionary spending at $1.7 trillion, down from $1.83 trillion in the current fiscal year, and increase defense spending by 13%, the official said. The president's budget recommendation would have the lowest non-defense discretionary spending since 2017, or, adjusted for inflation, the lowest non-defense discretionary spending since 2000, the official said.",
      "The White House isn't yet saying what their deficit or revenue projections will be. The president's recommendation is in the hands of the Republican-controlled Congress, which is responsible for crafting and passing a budget.",
      "On average, agencies would see about 35% in cuts, although some entities, like the Department of Homeland Security, would see more funding under the proposal. Entities including the State Department and Department of Health and Human Services would see significant cuts under the president's proposal.",
      "The senior OMB official said the president's budget proposal includes \"an enormous cut to foreign aid, but one that still preserves substantial presence\" to provide for \"targeted\" aid when it's in the interest of the United States.",
      "But spending on things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to be the biggest drivers of the federal deficit and national debt, and those programs, along with interest on the debt, are taking up an increasingly large piece of the federal spending pie.",
      "A senior administration official said the president has been \"very, very involved\" in the budget proposal process.",
      "\"Obviously, this president's budget, he's very, very involved throughout the process,\" the official told reporters on the conference call, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"We had four years of budgets to build on and come into office, see the damage that the Biden administration has wrecked on our fiscal house, and to make updates and incorporate many of the changes that have been identified from DOGE and come to you with a proposal.\"",

It covers a space equal to about 200 football fields and has been running since 1957 \u2014 when China's economy was isolated from the rest of the world. The country's leaders decided the expo, since formally named the China Import and Export Fair, was the best way to overcome trade obstacles imposed by the West and to drum up business investment and interest from overseas markets.",
      "In the almost seven decades since, China has transformed into the world's manufacturing powerhouse. But President Xi Jinping's government believes the U.S. is once again working to isolate China, through President Trump's tariff trade war, and that Washington will try to force other countries \u2014 and their consumers \u2014 to pick a side.",
      "Richard Qiu told CBS News it's simply unfair. Wearing a pale blue Ralph Lauren shirt, the businessman invited CBS News to sit down in his display booth at the Canton Fair for a chat. Surrounded by thousands of small fabric gift bags designed for everything from Christmas to Easter to birthdays, the fact that Qiu even quickly agreed to an interview was disarming; Every other Chinese businessperson we approached turned our camera away, wary of speaking with foreign media.",
      "His openness and warmth indicated a sense of ease with Westerners, and more importantly, his desire to tell his story about how external forces, completely out of his control, were affecting him and his livelihood.",
      "Qiu's Liaoning Perfect Import/Export Co. Ltd has been making gift bags for 20 years, and he has fostered strong relationships with his U.S. customers, who, in recent years, have made up 30-40% of his exports. He's traveled to the U.S. at least six times and says he loves the country: \"It's about freedom, democracy, it's open and fair.\"",
      "\"But this isn't fair,\" he said of the trade war sparked by President Trump's steep tariffs. \"It makes me feel sick about the U.S. now.\"",
      "Mr. Trump insists his tariffs will, despite current economic pain in the U.S., bring manufacturing back to America and buoy the economy, reshaping the global trade system. But Qiu said it's about something else. He believes President Trump is punishing China for being the best at producing everyday products at affordable prices, and using that prowess to dominate the global market.",
      "\"Our people are industrious, diligent, working hard to make the products good price, good quality, to sell all over the world. It's not our problem,\" he said. \"I think it's your problem.\"",
      "Since Mr. Trump imposed 145% tariffs on all Chinese imports \u2014 though the White House later exempted smartphones and some other electronics from the levies \u2014 Qiu says his U.S. sales have ground to a halt.",
      "\"U.S. buyers said, 'Richard you have to stop production; we have to cancel it.' I think 90% of my U.S. orders will be canceled.\"",
      "For years, the Canton Fair has been packed with American buyers looking to bring their customers back at home the best possible deals on offer. But this year, officials admitted to CBS News that the numbers are way down \u2014 another sign of President Trump's trade war taking hold.",
      "One American we did come across perusing the stalls in Guangzhou wasn't there to buy, but rather to research new products.",
      "\"Tariffs are going to come down at some point and we need to be ready for it,\" Jonathan Scheerz who lives in Michigan, where he runs a homewares business, told CBS News. He said he got a lot of orders in for products from China before Mr. Trump's inauguration, because he was anticipating a trade war \u2014 but not like this.",
      "\"I don't want to bring them in at the current tariff rate,\" he lamented. \"It just doesn't work. It's too high, but I also don't believe it's going to last months and months.\"",
      "The optimism is based on his belief that no one does it better than China when it comes to offering so many different products at such low prices.",
      "\"In my eyes, China produces what you want,\" Scheerz said. \"Simple as that.\"",
      "But if the trade war does drag on, many business owners who spoke with CBS News off camera said they were prepared to take the pain.",
      "Qiu knows tough days are ahead. He's looking to diversify his export portfolio in Europe, but there's only so much the market can absorb, so it's uncertain times.",
      "\"It's like a war, I think. Under a war, the most suffering is the people, no matter if it's the U.S. or China,\" he told CBS News.",

      "Lowell & Associates has hired multiple attorneys who left firms that cut deals with the Trump administration as the president sought to punish prominent practices to settle his long-held grievances against his political opponents. Mr. Trump has issued executive orders targeting major law firms that represented his political opponents, were involved in legal challenges against him or hired attorneys connected to the investigations into him.",

    "summary": "The party-line vote marked the first time in the 55-year history of the Clean Air Act that Congress has moved to weaken the power of the landmark environmental law.",
    "story": [
      "The Senate on Thursday approved an effort to overturn an Environmental Protection Agency rule tied to the Clean Air Act and designed to limit seven of the most hazardous air pollutants that are emitted by heavy industry.",
      "The 52-46 party-line vote marked the first time in the 55-year history of the Clean Air Act that Congress has moved to weaken the power of the landmark environmental law.",
      "Senate Republicans utilized the Congressional Review Act to overturn the regulation, which was passed by the Biden administration in 2024.",
      "The joint resolution now goes to the Republican-led House, where it also expected to pass.",
      "The rule\u00a0tied to the Clean Air Act\u00a0was finalized last year to close a loophole that required all \"major\" sources of seven hazardous air pollutants to reduce their emissions by the maximum achievable amount, a policy called \"Once in, Always In.\"",
      "The rule requires that industrial facilities \u2014 often chemical plants, oil refineries, and other industrial factories classified as \"major\" sources of toxic air pollution \u2014 always maintain strict pollution controls. Even if they comply and limit those pollution levels, those facilities would always be labeled \"major\" sources under the rule.",
      "The Trump Administration had killed the rule in President Trump's first term, but the EPA, under former President Joe Biden, finalized and updated it last September. The environmental advocacy group Earthjustice has said that\u00a0the rule forced 1,800 facilities across the country\u00a0to tighten air pollution controls to comply with the law.",
      "The seven pollutants in question are:",
      "Alkylated lead compoundsPolycyclic organic matter (POM)MercuryHexachlorobenzenePolychlorinated biphenyls(PCB)2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofurans (TCDF)2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin",

      "Several Republican lawmakers have been attempting to revoke the rule. Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah introduced\u00a0the resolution\u00a0which passed Thursday. Curtis had argued that the rule disincentivized companies to deploy new technology to reduce pollution.",
      "\"The rule put forward under the former administration shut the door on progress,\" Curtis said in a statement after the resolution's passage. \"It told companies that no matter how much they invest to reduce harmful emissions, they would still be punished with permanent red tape. That's not good science, it's not good governance, and it certainly isn't good for the environment. My resolution restores a common-sense incentive: if you clean up, you get credit for it.\"",
      "Several environmental groups, however, blasted the move.",
      "\"Today, I worry for children's health more than ever before,\" Melody Reis, director of federal policy for\u00a0Moms Clean Air Force, said in a statement to CBS News. \"Just now Senate Republicans voted to hand a couple of thousand of the nation's largest industrial polluters an easy way to release toxic air pollutants linked to cancer, birth defects, and brain damage. They voted to allow chemical manufacturers, pesticide makers, refineries and other facilities to turn off their pollution controls for the most insidious air pollutants known to humankind \u2014 chemicals such as dioxins, mercury, and PCBs. This will put our children, and all of us, at grave risk. It is a shameful, and completely unnecessary move.\"",
      "Michelle Roos, executive director of the Environmental Protection Network, which is made up of former EPA staffers, said in his own statement, \"Congress should be strengthening EPA's ability to protect the public from mercury, benzene, and other dangerous emissions, not stripping away rules that hold polluters accountable.\"",
      "The vote marks a major victory for the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries, which had lobbied against the \"Once in, Always In\" rule for some time. The National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group,\u00a0sent a letter to Mr. Trump\u00a0after his inauguration calling the rule \"burdensome,\" and listing it as one of several environmental regulations that are \"strangling our economy\" and should be reversed.",

    "story": [
      "Senior U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton on Wednesday dismissed criminal charges against Henrry Villatoro Santos, a Virginia man accused of being a regional leader of the violent MS-13 gang, clearing the way for expedited deportation proceedings.",
      "Earlier this month, the Justice Department asked the court to drop the charges, indicating the government planned to deport Villatoro Santos. A U.S. marshal from the Fugitive Task Force was in the courtroom, suggesting Villatoro Santos could be transferred into immigration custody after the hearing.",
      "\"They're likely to take him very quickly,\" Villatoro Santos' defense attorney, Muhammad Elsayed, said after the hearing.",
      "Villatoro Santos' arrest was announced last month in a nationally televised news conference featuring Attorney General Pam Bondi, who alleged he was the \"East Coast leader\" of the MS-13 transnational gang. He was accused of unspecified violent crimes and helping to lead the gang's criminal attacks across the country. But as the Justice Department has pursued the dismissal of charges against Villatoro Santos, it has not publicly tied him to any acts of violence. His attorneys have repeatedly questioned the nature of the proceedings.",
      "\"This is an unusual case,\" Elsayed said in court, emphasizing that it was up to the court \"to determine whether the motion was made in good faith.\" He argued that the Justice Department had provided \"no explanation whatsoever\" for withdrawing the charges and questioned the lack of clarity regarding what legal process would follow.",
      "\"There will likely be additional proceedings,\" Elsayed said after the hearing.",
      "Villatoro Santos was facing a federal felony gun possession charge in Virginia. Charging documents in his criminal case made only a fleeting reference to MS-13. An immigration officer's affidavit said, \"FBI agents and TFOs also observed indicia of MS-13 association in the garage bedroom\" of Villatoro Santos' home.",
      "Villatoro Santos' attorney accused the Justice Department of misusing Rule 48(a) \u2014 the procedural tool used to dismiss the indictment \u2014 arguing it amounted to an attempt to bypass due-process protections. \"They want to deport him without due process,\" Elsayed said, referencing statements by Bondi and criticizing the lack of input from the Department of Homeland Security.",

    "summary": "President Trump issued a proclamation in March invoking the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants who he claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge ruled Thursday that the Trump administration cannot rely on the wartime Alien Enemies Act to detain or remove from the U.S. a group of Venezuelan migrants who are being held at a facility in southern Texas.",
      "The decision from U.S. District Judge Fernando Rodriguez, appointed by President Trump in his first term, is a significant setback for the president as he seeks to crack down on illegal immigration into the U.S. Mr. Trump issued a proclamation in March invoking the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport Venezuelan migrants who he claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua, but Rodriguez's order permanently blocks the administration from using the AEA and Mr. Trump's proclamation to detain, transfer or remove Venezuelan migrants who either live or are detained in the Southern District.",
      "Rodriguez's order clarifies that his permanent injunction does not prohibit administration officials from moving forward with removal proceedings under the Immigration and Nationality Act.",
      "\"The question that this lawsuit presents is whether the president can utilize a specific statute, the AEA, to detain and remove Venezuelan aliens who are members of TdA,\" Rodriguez wrote. \"As to that question, the historical record renders clear that the president's invocation of the AEA through the proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and is contrary to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute's terms.\"",
      "As a result of that finding, the judge said that the executive branch cannot use Mr. Trump's invocation of the AEA through his proclamation to detain or deport the Venezuelan migrants in southern Texas.",
      "The Trump administration, Rodriguez wrote in a 36-page opinion, does \"not possess the lawful authority under the AEA, and based on the proclamation, to detain Venezuelan aliens, transfer them within the United States, or remove them from the country.\" The decision is likely to be appealed.",
      "\"The court ruled that the president lacks authority simply to declare that there's been an invasion of the U.S.\u00a0 and then invoke an 18th Century wartime authority during peacetime,\" Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who argued on behalf of the Venezuelan migrants, said in a statement. \"Congress never meant for this law to be used in this manner and the court correctly ruled that the president's actions are subject to judicial scrutiny.\"",
      "Enacted in 1798, the Alien Enemies Act allows the president to assert broad powers when there is a \"declared war\" or when \"any invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted to threatened\" against the U.S. by a foreign nation or government.",
      "The law has only been invoked three times, and all during periods of declared wars. But Mr. Trump's March proclamation claimed that the gang Tren de Aragua \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.\" The measure claimed that the gang is undertaking \"hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare\" against the U.S. directly and at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's regime.",
      "Mr. Trump's proclamation said that all Venezuelan citizens who are at least 14 years old and in the U.S. unlawfully were subject to apprehension and removal as \"alien enemies.\"",
      "Shortly after the president invoked the Alien Enemies Act, three Venezuelan migrants detained at the El Valle Detention Center in Raymondville, Texas, who were subject to removal because of the proclamation, filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Washington, D.C., seeking to block the move.",
      "That lawsuit set off a series of events that played out in March and led the Supreme Court to allow removals under the Alien Enemies Act. But crucially, the high court said Venezuelan migrants covered by the declaration were entitled to notice and the opportunity to challenge their confinement and removal under the Alien Enemies Act through habeas corpus proceedings brought in the district where they are being detained.",
      "As a result of that decision, the three Venezuelan migrants detained at the El Valle facility sought relief in the Southern District of Texas. While they did not take issue with their detention, they challenged the Trump administration's ability to deport them based on the president's proclamation and the Alien Enemies Act, and denied being members of Tren De Aragua.",
      "In granting the Venezuelan migrants relief, Rodriguez said that a presidential declaration invoking the Alien Enemies Act must include \"sufficient factual statements\" or refer to other pronouncements that allow a court to determine whether the alleged actions satisfy the conditions to apply the law.",
      "\"Allowing the president to unilaterally define the conditions when he may invoke the AEA, and then summarily declare that those conditions exist, would remove all limitations to the Executive Branch's authority under the AEA, and would strip the courts of their traditional role of interpreting congressional statutes to determine whether a government official has exceeded the statute's scope. The law does not support such a position,\" he wrote.",
      "Rodriguez also found that \"invasion\" and \"predatory incursion,\" as used in the law, \"must involve an organized, armed force entering the United States to engage in conduct destructive of property and human life in a specific geographical area.\" That action, however, does not need to be a precursor to an actual war, the judge said.",
      "\"As for the activities of the Venezuelan-directed TdA in the United States, and as described in the proclamation, the court concludes that they do not fall within the plain, ordinary meaning of 'invasion' or 'predatory incursion' for purposes of the AEA,\" Rodriguez wrote.",
      "The Trump administration's attempted use of the Alien Enemies Act has sparked similar challenges in judicial districts across the country where Venezuelan migrants facing removal under the president's proclamation are being detained. Federal judges in New York and Colorado have temporarily blocked deportations relying on the 225-year-old law while proceedings continue.",
      "The clash involving the migrants in South Texas, initially brought in Washington, D.C., led a judge there to find probable cause to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court. That finding arose from what the judge said was immigration officials' defiance of an order to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants subject to removal under the Alien Enemies Act that was bound for El Salvador.",

      "She later added that \"the tariffs, as I predicted, are clearly inviting a recession.\"",
      "\"But please, let us not be duped into thinking everything is chaos. It may feel like that,\" Harris said. \"But understand: What we are, in fact, witnessing is a high velocity event, where a vessel is being used for the swift implementation of an agenda that has been decades in the making.\"",
      "Harris also touched on Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown, saying \"it is not OK to detain or disappear American citizens without due process.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court\u00a0on Wednesday appeared divided over efforts in Oklahoma to create an online Catholic charter school, a case that could open the door to public dollars flowing directly to religious schools.",
      "A ruling in favor of the school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, could lead to the country's first religious charter school and upend laws in at least 45 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the federal charter school program, all of which require charter schools to be nonsectarian, Oklahoma's Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, has warned.",
      "Eight of the nine justices are considering the case, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself. Following arguments, it seemed likely that the outcome hinges on Chief Justice John Roberts, who focused on the level of state involvement in its charter school program during the arguments. If the Supreme Court deadlocks 4-4, it would leave intact the decision of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which ruled that the contract establishing St. Isidore's as a Catholic charter school was a violation of state and federal law.",
      "Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh appeared most sympathetic to St. Isidore's argument that excluding it from Oklahoma's charter school system unconstitutionally discriminated against the school.",
      "Kavanuagh said religious institutions can't be treated as \"second class\" and said keeping sectarian schools from operating charter schools, when the program is open to nonreligious private entities, seems like \"rank discrimination\" based on religion.",
      "\"They're not asking for special treatment. They're not asking for favoritism. They're just saying don't treat us worse because we're religious,\" he said of the school.",
      "But the three liberal justices, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, seemed concerned that a decision allowing the religious charter school would weaken the wall between church and state.",
      "\"The state is running these schools,\" Kagan said. Jackson said charter schools are \"a creation and creature of the state.\"",
      "But there was some concern about how a ruling allowing St. Isidore's to be established as a religious charter school would impact the systems in other states, and specifically the level of oversight and control over them. Justice Neil Gorsuch warned such a result could lead states to impose more requirements on charter schools, such as mandating public officials to serve on their boards and boosting state involvement in their creation.",
      "\"Have you thought about that boomerang effect?\" he asked James Campbell, who argued on behalf of the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which joined St. Isidore's in the case.",
      "A decision will follow the Supreme Court's three\u00a0rulings in recent years that were in favor of religious plaintiffs, which all allowed public funds to be used for religious institutions.",
      "\"This would really be the first time that the Supreme Court sanctions, if it rules in favor of the charter school, the direct flow of funds from the government and financial support from the government to a religious entity for religious activities,\" said Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University who focuses on the law and religion.",
      "St. Isidore, she said, is asking the state to \"quite literally establish a religious school. It's essentially making a religious school, creating an affiliation between the religious entity and the state that we haven't seen before.\"",
      "But backers of St. Isidore argue that its position is simply an application of those decisions and would not create any new principles.",
      "\"The unifying thread is the idea that once the government decides to open up a program and to distribute benefits or to contract with people, it can't single out religious people or institutions for special disadvantage,\" said Richard Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School who directs its Program on Church, State and Society.",

      "Oklahoma has offered charter schools within its public education system since 1999 and, like at least 44 other states and the federal charter school program, requires the institutions to be \"nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations.\" The state has at least 30 charter schools that serve more than 50,000 students, and they received $314 million from the state and $69 million in federal funds in the 2022 to 2023 school year, according to a 2023 report from the Oklahoma State Department of Education.",
      "In January 2023, the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa formed the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Charter School Inc. for the purpose of establishing and operating St. Isidore as a Catholic school, according to court records. That May, St. Isidore applied to the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board to establish it as a virtual charter school that \"fully embraces the teachings of the Catholic Church's Magisterium\" and \"fully incorporates these [teachings] into every aspect of the school.\"",
      "The school estimated initial enrollment of 500 students and projected it would receive roughly $2.7 million in state funding for its first year of operation, according to court documents.",
      "Ahead of a vote by the board, Drummond warned against approval of St. Isidore's application, and said an earlier analysis from his predecessor supporting the school could be \"used as a basis for taxpayer-funded religious schools, which is exactly what [St. Isidore] seeks to become.\"",
      "Drummond also warned that approving St. Isidore's application to become a charter school \"will create a slippery slope.\"",
      "\"I doubt most Oklahomans would want their tax dollars to fund a religious school whose tenets are diametrically opposed to their own faith,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the approval of a charter school by one faith will compel the approval of charter schools by all faiths, including even those most Oklahomans would consider reprehensible and unworthy of public funding.\"",
      "Still, the charter school board voted 3-2 to approve St. Isidore's application, and in October 2023, it and the school entered in a contract establishing St. Isidore's as a charter school.",
      "That month, Drummond sued the board directly in the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked it to rescind the charter contract and declare St. Isidore's establishment as a charter school unlawful.",
      "The attorney general prevailed before the state's highest court, which ruled that because St. Isidore's is a public charter school, it violated the state's requirement that those entities be nonreligious, as well as the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, in part because it would \"permit state spending in direct support of the religious curriculum and activities within St. Isidore.\"",
      "\"The state will be directly funding a religious school and encouraging students to attend it,\" the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which split 6-2, found.",
      "The Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore's both asked the Supreme Court to review the decision, and it agreed to do so in January.",
      "A \"major breach\" in the wall",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in a string of recent decisions sided with religious families and institutions that challenged state-funded programs for excluding religious beneficiaries as violations of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.",
      "In 2017, the court said that Missouri violated the free exercise right of Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center when it denied it grant funding to resurface its playground. Then, in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Montana could not exclude religious schools from a program providing tax credits to people who donate to scholarships for private-school students. Most recently, in 2022, the Supreme Court said Maine cannot limit a tuition assistance program to nonsectarian schools.",
      "Citing those decisions, Roberts said the programs at issue in Missouri, Montana and Maine were also creations and creatures of the state. But he also said they involved \"fairly discrete\" state involvement, as opposed to the \"much more comprehensive involvement\" of Oklahoma in funding and overseeing its charter schools.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Drummond argued that the justices have drawn a clear line through those decisions: If the state offers tuition assistance that parents can direct to the school of their choosing, it cannot exclude religious private schools. But when it comes to public schools, he said, states can provide a secular education.",
      "Drummond said the Supreme Court has never held that the Constitution's Establishment Clause allows \"direct aid for religious instruction in public schools,\" and added that creating and funding a religious public school would violate that provision of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Religious education is an invaluable benefit for millions of Americans who choose it,\" Drummond wrote. \"But our Constitution has never required the creation of religious public schools. There is no basis to change that now.\"",
      "He warned that if the Supreme Court rules for St. Isidore, \"state funds will pour into religious public charter schools just as they do traditional public schools,\" and the firewall between public funds flowing to a school because of private choice versus a direct subsidy would be damaged.",
      "\"A ruling for petitioners would eliminate the buffer this court has long enforced between religious instruction and public schools \u2014 including in areas where charter schools are the only or default public-school option,\" Drummond argued, noting that the issue is direct aid.",
      "A crucial question in the court fight is whether Oklahoma's charter schools are public schools.",
      "Drummond says they are, because the state's charter schools have to comply with anti-discrimination laws; they are free, open to all students, created and funded by the state, and are subject to government regulation and oversight regarding curriculum, testing and other issues. And because charter schools are public schools, the attorney general said they are government entities.",
      "Gregory Garre, who argued on behalf of Drummond, said that St. Isidore's is seeking special status compared to secular charter schools, because it said it can only comply with laws that are consistent with its constitutional rights as a religious school under the direction of the Catholic Church.",
      "He warned that a decision in favor of the school would render the laws in nearly all states and the federal charter school program unconstitutional because they all require charter schools to be nonsectarian.",
      "Such an outcome would \"create uncertainty, confusion and disruption\" for the millions of charter school students across the country.",
      "He warned that allowing religious institutions to participate in state charter school systems would open the door to more litigation over issues like who can be admitted, who can teach at the schools and over their curriculum.",
      "But lawyers for the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore disagree. Backing them in the case are Oklahoma's GOP governor, Kevin Stitt, and the state superintendent of public instruction, Ryan Walters.",
      "The board and school said St. Isidore is a privately operated school providing free publicly funded education through a contract with the state, and the Free Exercise Clause protects its right to participate in the charter school program.",
      "\"The state did not design the school. It did not create or encourage St. Isidore's religious character. It did not appoint any member of St. Isidore's board. It did not instruct the school to offer an education in the Catholic tradition. And it will not hire or supervise the school's teachers and administrators,\" lawyers for St. Isidore wrote in a filing.",
      "Campbell, who argued on behalf of the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, told the justices that St. Isidore's was created not by the state, but by two Catholic organizations, and it's controlled by a privately selected board of directors.",
      "The restrictions in state law, lawyers for St. Isidore's and the charter school board said, amount to unconstitutional religious discrimination because Oklahoma is excluding religious observers from otherwise available public benefits and programs. And because the state's charter school program is neutrally administered, the Establishment Clause doesn't prevent public dollars from flowing to religious schools.",
      "\"This is particularly true when private choice directs government dollars to religious schools,\" they said.",
      "Garnett, of Notre Dame Law School, said that public money would only go to St. Isidore if a parent made the choice to send their child to the virtual school.",
      "\"If the court thinks that what Oklahoma has done is create a program that private entities are eligible to participate in, then it's straightforward to say once they do that, they can't discriminate on the basis of religion,\" he said.",
      "But professor Hill, like Drummond, said charter schools are public schools, and warned there's always been a line where the Supreme Court did not allow the direct flow of government funds to religious schools for religious instruction. She said the case is part of a progression that began with the Supreme Court's 2017 ruling and comes as traditional public schools are being starved of resources in many states.",
      "\"The agenda has been to require, not just allow, direct government funding of religious schools in particular,\" she said. \"Vouchers are one thing, but I do think it's a major breach in the wall of separation if the charter school wins.\"",
      "Barrett's recusal from the case could create a situation in which the Supreme Court renders a 4-4 decision, leaving the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling intact. She did not provide a reason for her stepping aside, though it may be because the Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Clinic is representing St. Isidore.",
      "Barrett taught at Notre Dame before she was appointed to the federal bench and was an adjunct professor at the law school in 2023, according to her most recent financial disclosure report. Barrett is also close friends with Nicole Stelle Garnett, an associate dean at Notre Dame Law School who authored a paper that suggested that as a result of a June 2020 Supreme Court ruling, states with charter schools must permit religious charter schools or risk violating the Free Exercise Clause.",

    "summary": "An effort aimed at blocking President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in the Senate fell short Wednesday, with Senate Republicans largely united in opposition.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 An effort aimed at blocking President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in the Senate amid anxiety over how the wide-ranging tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy fell short on Wednesday, with Senate Republicans largely united in their opposition.",
      "In a 49 to 49 vote, all but three Republicans opposed the measure, in a victory for the White House and GOP leadership in the Senate as the party seeks to remain united on the issue. Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, did not vote.",
      "\"Senator Whitehouse is on his way back from representing the United States at the Our Ocean summit, where he was the sole American official,\" a spokesperson for the Senator said in a statement explaining his absence. \"The Senator expressed America's continued support for the Blue Economy, climate solutions, fisheries, and maritime security, even as the Trump administration cedes leadership on the oceans to the rest of the world.\"",
      "The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, would terminate the April 2 national emergency that the president is using to impose the tariffs, effectively blocking the sweeping levies on foreign imports. Along with Paul, Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined Democrats and independents in support of the measure, falling short of the majority needed for passage.",
      "The measure almost certainly wouldn't have been taken up in the GOP-controlled House, making the vote largely a symbolic one.",
      "The vote came after the president on April 2 announced a 10% baseline tariff on almost all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of other countries. Days later, as investors appeared spooked, Mr. Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, keeping the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China.",
      "Wyden told CBS News ahead of the vote of the measure's chances that \"this is a choice for senators.\"",
      "\"They've been home and they've heard from their constituents, like small businesses, that are getting clobbered by these tariffs,\" Wyden said. \"If they're going to listen to their constituents, we'll get their support, and if they're more concerned about Donald Trump being mean to them, they'll go with opposition.\"",
      "Paul admonished his fellow Republicans on the Senate floor ahead of the vote Wednesday, saying \"this should not be a partisan issue\" and noting that \"Congress didn't debate these tariffs, Congress didn't vote to enact these tariffs \u2014 the tariffs are simply imposed by presidential fiat.\"",
      "\"If Americans are to live under this emergency rule, it will not be because the president sought too much power,\" Paul said. \"It will be because Congress let it happen.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Senate approved another resolution to block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada, which fall under an earlier national emergency. At the time, four Republicans joined all Democrats and independents to support the measure \u2014 Murkowski, Collins and McConnell, along with Paul. The House did not vote on the measure.",
      "Mr. Trump had put pressure on Senate Republicans to oppose the measure, calling out the senators expected to support it by name. But those senators held fast in their opposition.",
      "Ahead of the vote this time around, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Vice President JD Vance joined the conference during their launch meeting on Tuesday, where senators said Greer told them the administration is making progress on trade deals.",
      "Meanwhile, House Republican leadership has taken steps to quash efforts to block Mr. Trump's tariffs. Earlier this month, Republicans included in a key piece of legislation a provision that would prevent members from forcing a vote to block the tariffs announced on April 2, after also doing so with the earlier tariffs. And any measure to roll back the tariffs would need the president's signature, leaving opponents in Congress with little likelihood of reining in his levies.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday that it isn't appropriate for Congress to \"jump in\" a handful of weeks into the administration's tariff policy, saying at an Axios event that \"the executive has a broad array of authority that's been recognized over the years\" on trade. But he suggested limited openness to stepping in down the road.",
      "\"If it gets close to where the imbalance is there, then we would step in,\" Johnson said, while adding that the first step would be for him to call the president to discuss the concerns. \"But right now I think ultimately this policy is going to achieve the desired outcome and it's going to be good for the country, and so we're applauding that.\"",
      "Still, anxieties continued to run high over the economic impact of the tariffs. And economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2025, the Commerce Department reported in its estimate of the nation's gross domestic product Wednesday.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Wednesday following the GDP report that \"the tariff issue is one that's probably going to take some time to realize the results and the benefits from.\"",
      "\"Overall, the things we're going to be doing to support a healthy economy, on taxes and regulations and energy, are going to have a positive impact long term,\" Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said. \"The tariff issue is something that's, like I said, it's an open question, but we're giving them some space to negotiate and see if they can get some good deals.\"",

    "summary": "The National Climate Assessment, a major publication produced every four years that summarizes the impacts of climate change in the U.S., is scheduled for publication in 2027.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly 400 scientists across the United States were informed Monday afternoon that their services were no longer needed to help write a major report on climate change for the federal government.",
      "The report, known as the National Climate Assessment, is a major publication produced every four years that summarizes the impacts of climate change in the United States, and it is congressionally mandated under the Global Change Research Act of 1990. The sixth edition is scheduled for publication in 2027 and preparations have been underway for months to meet that deadline.",
      "The National Climate Assessment is the basis for which federal, state, and local governments, as well as private companies, can prepare for climate change impacts, understand future projections of climate risk, as well as learn to adapt and mitigate those challenges.",
      "An email sent to participants from the deputy director of services of the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a federal office that organizes the publication of the report read, \"Thank you for your participation in the 6th National Climate Assessment ... we are now releasing all current assessment participants from their roles.\"",
      "According to the email, the \"scope\" of the assessment is being \"reevaluated\" as the Trump administration looks to comply with the law, something the White House also reaffirmed to CBS News.",
      "But many in the scientific community are concerned about how the report will be written without the subject matter expertise of the hundreds of scientists and researchers, many of whom were non-federal employees voluntarily working on the report in service of the government.",
      "\"The Trump administration has dismissed all the scientists from their work on the nation's most important climate change report,\" Steven Hamburg, chief scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, said in a statement. \"Refusing to study climate change won't make it go away \u2014 or help us deal with stronger storms, droughts, floods, wildfires and hotter temperatures, or help us stop emitting the pollution that is making it worse.\"",
      "The move doesn't come as a major surprise as Project 2025 outlined a plan to reshape the report and the office that organizes it, the U.S. Global Change Research Program. In Project 2025, a policy roadmap outlined by the Heritage Foundation for the next Republican president, authors argued that bureaucratic offices like USGCRP should not have so much control and reports like NCA should include \"diverse viewpoints.\"",
      "The steps to accomplish this were laid a few weeks ago when many federal employees of the USGCRP were fired, according to a Politico report, and the contract for outside work to publish the NCA was canceled in early April.",
      "When asked how scientists feel about their expertise no longer being needed, most said they expected the news.",
      "\"I feel badly for the federal leaders who have put a lot of time into this, but to some extent, I think the writing was on the wall when they dismissed the support staff a few weeks ago,\" said Dr. Robert Kopp a climate scientist and professor at Rutgers University, who was also working on the current assessment. \"I think now it's clear, many of the authors would like to see an up-to-date evidence based report.\"",
      "How an independent report can be published outside the purview of the federal government remains to be seen. Dr. Kopp says independent fundraising would need to occur to help support the report's publishing as it requires a lot of time, energy, and resources to organize the efforts of hundreds of volunteer scientists who write the content.",
      "Failing to publish a report of record that stands up to rigorous scientific review of past national assessments is significant, says Dr. Mijin Cha, a climate and environmental justice professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz and a fellow author on this year's assessment.",
      "\"We're losing our status as the premiere data and research country,\" Dr. Cha said.",
      "Many in the scientific community have begun to talk about how to move forward, but fears remain that the Trump administration will proceed with its own report, assigning authors that represent alternative viewpoints on climate change.",
      "\"I'm worried who will do the NCA moving forward and putting something forward that is false,\" said Dr. Cha.",
      "Because the Global Change Research Act of 1990 mandates the NCA to be written, the Trump administration is legally obligated to abide by the law and has until the end of 2027 to produce the sixth version of the report.",

    "story": [
      "Cicadas are poised to return at some point in the spring of 2025, potentially bringing billions of bugs to neighborhoods across the eastern United States.",
      "The group of cicadas set to appear has been labeled Brood XIV. Emerging once every 17 years, Brood XIV is the second-largest group of periodical cicadas \u2014 which rise from underground en masse \u2014 and will be the only group this spring. That means\u00a0there will likely be fewer cicadas\u00a0above ground than there were in 2024, when\u00a0multiple broods of cicadas\u00a0emerged at the same time.",
      "Where will cicadas emerge in spring 2025?",
      "Cicadas this year will likely be concentrated in Kentucky and much of Tennessee. The insects from Brood XIV are also expected to show up in parts of Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, in addition to smaller pockets farther north in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, central Pennsylvania and Long Island, New York.",
      "CBS News' data team created an interactive map that shows where cicadas are expected to be this year. The map uses information from the University of Connecticut's Cicada Project, which plots the brood's spread based on its known locations in the past.",
      "When will cicadas emerge in spring 2025?",
      "The huge groups of cicadas emerge when the soil reaches about 64 degrees Fahrenheit, according to University of Connecticut researchers. In warmer states, cicadas usually come out in late April or May. In cooler states, their arrival tends to occur in May or early June.",
      "How long will cicadas be above ground?",
      "Researchers say cicadas typically remain in a given area for 4 to 6 weeks after they first emerge. Most individual cicadas live for just a few weeks, but, since the emergence itself happens over two weeks, their eventual fading will also be staggered.",
      "What are cicadas?",
      "Cicadas are a type of insect, related to stink bugs, bed buds and aphids. The ones expected to arrive in droves this year are a variety called periodical cicadas, which appear in huge swarms and often create loud buzzing sounds, according to the National Wildlife Federation. Annual cicadas exist as well.",
      "Periodical cicadas have earned a reputation across eastern North America because of their conspicuous recurrence. Individual \"broods\" are biologically synchronized to crop up simultaneously in 13- or 17-year intervals, when they rise from their burrows underground in populations that can reach up to the trillions. Between intervals, they live in soil as larvae and feed on fluids from plant roots, the wildlife federation explains.",
      "There are three species of cicadas that emerge every 17 years, and four species that materialize every 13 years, according to researchers at the University of Connecticut. When cicadas share the same emergence year, they're considered part of a brood.",
      "The interactive map below shows where different broods are scattered across the country.",
      "Active periodical cicada broods in the U.S.",
      "Select a brood:",
      "Why do cicadas make noise?",
      "The noise people often hear from cicadas is a mating tactic, according to the wildlife foundation, which notes that male cicadas tend to crowd together and produce raucous choruses in efforts to attract females. Once the mating process has ended, female cicadas deposit their eggs in tree branches. When they hatch, the larvae fall to the ground, burrow into the soil, and the cycle starts again.",

Compared with annual cicadas, which appear in generally modest amounts each summer, periodical cicadas emerge in the spring and essentially rise from the ground in unison, in either 13-year or 17-year intervals. Cicadas that emerge on the same schedule are called a brood, and each is labeled using Roman numerals.",
      "This year, the group belongs to Brood XIV, the second-largest brood of periodical cicadas known to scientists, according to the University of Connecticut. Researchers with the university's Cicada Project note that, while they cannot technically know with certainty where a particular brood is going to emerge next, its last known locations during previous emergence events usually provide valuable insights. Because periodical cicadas typically lay their eggs in or near the areas where they've just emerged, the next generation of broods tend to emerge themselves in similar places.",
      "Cicada map predicts where they will emerge in 2025",
      "Based on University of Connecticut research, CBS News' data team created an interactive map that charts the expected spread of Brood XIV, which last arose 17 years ago and is the only brood emerging in 2025.",
      "The map shows the cicadas primarily concentrated in Kentucky and Tennessee, in addition to parts of Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. Farther north, the brood is also expected to take shape in smaller pockets, in Cape Cod, Massachusetts; Long Island, New York; and central Pennsylvania.",
      "When will Brood XIV emerge?",
      "The brood will emerge before the end of spring on June 21, but cicadas' arrivals in different parts of the U.S. will likely vary.",
      "Cicada expert Matthew Kasson told CBS News in 2024 that\u00a0the exact timing of a brood's emergence\u00a0is linked to the temperature of the soil they're in before moving above ground. Kasson said cicadas are prompted to exit the soil when it reaches 64 degrees, so groups within the larger brood may travel to the surface sooner than others in cooler locations.",
      "What do cicadas do?",
      "The life cycles of periodical cicadas are closely tied to how and where they emerge. Before a brood materializes on land, each of its members \u2014 sometimes trillions of them \u2014 exist underground as larvae, subsiding on fluids from plant roots, according to the National Wildlife Federation. They live in those conditions for 13 or 17 years, depending on their brood. Then, almost all at once, the insects burrow upward and break through the surface of the soil, often making their presence known by erupting in loud and at times constant choruses.",
      "Conspicuous noises from cicada swarms are a mating tactic, the wildlife federation writes, as the male insects gather in groups and create loud sounds to attract females. The mating process begins within a few days of cicadas emerging. When it ends, the females cut shallow grooves into tree branches and lay their eggs inside. Researchers at Arizona State University say\u00a0those eggs usually hatch\u00a0within 8 weeks, and newly born cicadas fall from the branches down to the ground. Called nymphs at that point, the young bugs proceed to dig their way back underneath the soil, where they remain until it's time to emerge again.",
      "Adult cicadas typically remain above ground in a given location for 4 to 6 weeks after they first emerge. Researchers note that most of the individual insects live for less time, but that window accounts for some degree of staggering when the brood emerges, since that happens over a period of about two weeks.",
      "Are cicadas dangerous?",
      "Cicadas are not dangerous to humans or pets, experts say. They don't bite or sting and they aren't poisonous or venomous.",
      "\"If dogs or cats eat many cicadas, this may temporarily cause an upset stomach or vomiting, but there is no need to worry if a pet eats a small number of cicadas,\" the Environmental Protection Agency says.",
      "They are also largely beneficial to the ecosystem. They are a food source for birds and other predators that eat insects. They can aerate soil, and when they decompose, they provide nutrients that can help trees grow.",
      "Cicadas may harm young trees, which can be protected with mesh or netting. They don't eat leaves, flowers, fruits or garden produce, the EPA says.",

The new discovery revealed the important role played by women in the oldest center of civilization in the Americas, researchers said.",
      "\"What has been discovered corresponds to a woman who apparently had elevated status, an elite woman,\" archaeologist David Palomino told AFP.",

That reflector will receive data from the world's forests, the ESA said.",
      "Forests on Earth collectively absorb and store about 8 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually, the ESA said. That regulates the planet's temperature. Deforestation and degradation, especially in tropical regions, means that stored carbon is being released back into the atmosphere, the ESA said, which can contribute to climate change. There's a lack of accurate data on how much carbon the planet's estimated 1.5 trillion trees store and how much human activity can impact that storage, the ESA said.",
      "To \"weigh\" the planet's trees and determine their carbon dioxide capacity, Biomass will use a P-band synthetic aperture radar. It's the first such piece of technology in space. The radar can penetrate forest canopies and measure woody biomass, including trunks, branches and stems, the ESA said. Most forest carbon is stored in these parts of the trees. Those measurements will act as a proxy for carbon storage, the ESA said.",

      "In Smith's case, an image of her was doctored to create explicit pictures and videos, with her face edited onto different, partly nude bodies, and then used to try to extort money from others. \"Sextortion\" scams like this one have targeted tens of thousands of Americans in the past year alone, according to the FBI.",
      "\"I cry myself to sleep most nights, mostly because I don't want my kids to see me,\" said Smith, who is 43.

      "The deepfakes quickly multiplied, accompanying offers for private dinners and intimate acts in exchange for hundreds of dollars, and targeting anyone who might recognize Smith.

And last week, a bill Smith backed passed in the Tennessee Senate. The bill, called the \"Preventing Deepfake Images Act,\" was sent to Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, who is expected to sign it into law. It provides a path for people targeted by sextortion scams to sue if images of them are shared without their consent.",

      "There were over 34,000 victims of sextortion in 2023, according to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. That number climbed to more than 54,000 victims last year.

    "summary": "A leaking well continues to spew a geyser of oil into waters off Louisiana's Gulf Coast.",
    "story": [
      "Former federal disaster response specialists and national environmental groups warn that DOGE job cuts may hamper the response to a major oil spill off Louisiana's Gulf Coast this week, a leak that is fast contaminating marshlands and threatening vital wildlife habitats and fisheries.",
      "Although the amount of crude oil currently leaking out of the well is not yet known, a report from the U.S. Coast Guard's National Response Center earlier this week said \"the amount discharged could potentially reach the threshold of a major spill for coastal waters (over 100,000 gallons).\" The leak was first reported on Friday, April 26, as a \"well blowout.\" The cause is not yet known.",
      "On Thursday, the Coast Guard reported more than 30,000 gallons of an \"oily watery mixture\" had been collected from the spill site, and while more than two miles of booms had already been deployed, crews were waiting for more containment materials to arrive.",
      "More than 1,000 employees of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were laid off or have taken early retirement in recent days. That is in addition to around 1,000 that were cut earlier this year, according to sources familiar with the reduction in forces. This week eight of 28 staff members from NOAA's Office of Response and Restoration Emergency Response Division \u2014 the very team tasked with addressing the oil spill \u2014 left the agency.",
      "The office handles approximately 150 oil and chemical spills annually. Its core mission is to answer the following questions: .",
      "What was spilled?\u00a0Where will it go?\u00a0What will it impact?\u00a0What damage will it cause?\u00a0How can the effects be mitigated?",
      "What was spilled?",
      "Where will it go?",
      "What will it impact?",
      "What damage will it cause?",
      "How can the effects be mitigated?",
      "According to NOAA, the office has helped recover $10.8 billion from responsible parties over the past three decades to support environmental restoration.",
      "A recently retired NOAA senior manager involved in spill responses told CBS News that the agency has undergone \"substantial reductions\" in the team that provides scientific support to the Coast Guard, which is currently in charge of coordinating operations, and is the lead agency investigating the cause of the spill in Garden Island Bay.",
      "Adriana Bejarano until this week was a chemical scientist in that Emergency Response Division and was let go because of her probationary status. Although Bejarano had been in the job for under a year, she was previously a senior eco-toxicologist at Shell Oil who holds a Ph.D. and had been in this field of work for 20 years.",
      "\"If this continues and other disasters happen at the same time, I don't think NOAA will have the expertise or personnel to respond,\" Bejarano told CBS News.",
      "Gib Brogan, who is with the nonprofit group Oceana, told CBS News that the equivalent of \"27,000 years of NOAA experience are walking out the door this week with early retirement.\"",
      "\"We are very concerned about staff and expertise that won't be able to respond to this oil spill,\" Brogan said. \"No part of NOAA has been spared from DOGE and early retirements, we know the expertise is not there and the support from the agency and the support isn't there for the responses.\"",
      "Currently, what has been described by witnesses as a geyser of oil is shooting 30 to 40 feet into the air from a well operated by Spectrum Opco LLC. Clean-up crews have been spraying the airborne oil with water to push it back to the surface to more easily collect it, and prevent the oil from drifting further away from the spill site.",
      "The well, known as Well 59, was drilled in 1942 to a depth of nearly 7,000 feet and has changed ownership multiple times. It was capped in 2016 and has not been operational since then, the Coast Guard said. But according to Scott Eustis of Healthy Gulf, a nonprofit that monitors the health of the region and advocates for moving away from oil and gas extraction, it should have been plugged a decade ago. That's a process that involves injecting concrete into the well to permanently seal it off.",
      "The leaked oil appears to have reached critical habitats, including areas used by the threatened loggerhead sea turtle, although no harm to wildlife has been reported.",
      "This incident is part of a larger issue that has concerned experts for years: a study in 2023 identified 14,000 unplugged, abandoned wells in the Gulf. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has pushed to expand offshore oil drilling and accelerate the permitting process, reducing timelines to just weeks.",
      "The leak is occurring near the Garden Island Bay area of the Pass-a-Loutre Wildlife Management Area, a sensitive ecological zone in southeastern Louisiana.",
      "According to Eustis the spill threatens a range of species including black terns, bottlenose dolphins, larval yellowfin tuna, marsh birds, spring pogies, and young fish migrating into the estuaries for spring growth.",
      "There are also potential threats to the region's shrimp industry, with the shrimping season scheduled to start in just a couple of weeks, including in the marsh where the spill is still actively spraying.",
      "The Coast Guard announced yesterday that response efforts have been \"federalized,\" allowing federal agencies to take full control of the containment and cleanup operation. A capping stack and other well control equipment were en route on Thursday.",
      "An update on operations Thursday said that 32,718 gallons of oily water mixture had been recovered.",
      "\"We're currently still actively using 12 skimmers on site,\" said Coast Guard Captain Gregory Callaghan, the man in charge of coordinating the multi-agency response efforts to the Well 59 leak, in an interview with CBS News. \"I'd say one of the unique things about this incident is its location\u2026 a pretty remote area in the marshes. That it does make it difficult to get to\u2026 [and] to stage resources.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to Spectrum Energy, a Houston-based firm with overlapping leadership with Spectrum Opco, and the company referred inquiries to a Gmail account being used by the Coast Guard for coordination.",
      "Asked about whether he was concerned that federal spending cuts were impacting his teams' response, Callaghan said, \"I would say no from the federal agency coordinator role. Our goal is to utilize all resources necessary to get this source controlled and then take every mitigating, uh, effort we can to, uh, respond to the environmental impacts.",
      "A spokesperson for NOAA told CBS News the agency would not comment on personnel or management matters, but said NOAA \"remains dedicated to its mission, providing timely information, research, and resources that serve the American public and ensure our nation's environmental and economic resilience.\"",
      "\"We continue to provide oil spill information, trajectory forecasts and other scientific analysis pursuant to our public safety mission,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "CBS News has also reached out the White House for comment and has not received a response.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell found the executive order targeting Perkins Coie violates First, Fifth and Sixth amendments.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge ruled Friday that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and permanently blocked the administration from enforcing it.",
      "In a 102-page decision, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ruled in favor of the firm and said Mr. Trump's directive that sought to punish it sent the message that \"lawyers must stick to the party line, or else.\"",
      "\"Using the powers of the federal government to target lawyers for their representation of clients and avowed progressive employment policies in an overt attempt to suppress and punish certain viewpoints, however, is contrary to the Constitution, which requires that the government respond to dissenting or unpopular speech or ideas with 'tolerance, not coercion,'\" Howell wrote.",
      "She found that the executive order violates the First, Fifth and Sixth amendments to the Constitution.",
      "The decision from Howell, who sits on the U.S. district court in Washington, D.C., is the first summary ruling in one of four cases brought by law firms that have been penalized by the president as a result of their associations with people and causes he disfavors. In addition to Perkins Coie, the firms Jenner & Block, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, and Susman Godfrey have also filed lawsuits challenging their respective executive orders.",
      "Perkins Coie represented former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and hired a research firm that retained former British spy Christopher Steele, who produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "The executive orders are all similar. They call for the immediate suspension of any active security clearances held by firm employees. They direct government agencies to require contractors to disclose any business with the firms, require agency leaders to review all contracts with the firms or entities that do business with them, and limit firm employees' access to federal buildings and government workers.",
      "When taken together, Howell said the directives support Perkins Coie's assertion that Mr. Trump has mounted a campaign of \"using the power of the presidency to target individual lawyers and law firms associated with them based on personal dislike of their legal work \u2014 in other words, for retribution.\"",
      "Howell's ruling in favor of the firm was expected, since she appeared sympathetic to its bid to block Mr. Trump's directive during a hearing last month. She had previously blocked enforcement temporarily of the order's provisions on government contracting and access to federal buildings and personnel. Still, her decision is a significant victory for Perkins Coie and a rebuke of the president.",
      "While four firms have sought to fight Mr. Trump's executive orders targeting them in court, at least nine others have reached agreements with the White House to avoid being penalized by the president. The deals, announced by Mr. Trump on social media, include commitments to provide between $40 million and $125 million in pro bono legal work.",
      "Referencing these nine firms, Howell said they appear to have received Mr. Trump's suggestion that they may be subject to punishment unless they agree to his terms. One firm, Paul Weiss, was the subject of an executive order by the president that was rescinded after it agreed to provide $40 million in free legal services during Mr. Trump's term. Howell said that revocation \"demonstrates the coercive power of such targeting by the Trump administration.\"",
      "\"If the founding history of this country is any guide, those who stood up in court to vindicate constitutional rights and, by so doing, served to promote the rule of law, will be the models lauded when this period of American history is written,\" she wrote in a footnote.",
      "Appointed by former President Barack Obama, Howell said the executive order targeting Perkins Coie \"stigmatizes and penalizes\" the firm and its employees \u2014 from partners to attorneys to mail room attendants \u2014 because of its past and current representation of clients who take positions that the president dislikes.",
      "Perkins Coie, Howell wrote, is neither employed by the government nor a contractor with it, but is instead a \"law firm representing some clients disliked by the president, engaging in some litigation seeking results disliked by the president, and operating its business, in part, in a manner disliked by the president.\"",
      "She said the case \"presents an unprecedented attack\" on the principles of the American judicial system.",
      "\"Here, the Trump administration's blunt exercise of power in EO 14230 to target Perkins Coie for adverse actions by every federal agency violates the Constitution in multiple ways,\" Howell wrote.",
      "The judge said that the executive order was issued as \"retribution\" for Perkins Coie's work and Mr. Trump's \"grievances,\" which she said he has publicly aired since 2017.",
      "Howell repeatedly characterizes the executive order issued by the president as a deliberate means of harming Perkins Coie. In finding that it violates the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law, the judge wrote that \"settling personal vendettas by targeting a disliked business or individual for punitive government action is not a legitimate use of the powers of the U.S. government or an American president.\"",
      "Lawyers for Perkins Coie had argued during a hearing before Howell last month that Mr. Trump's executive order was unlawful retaliation and should be permanently blocked. The Justice Department, meanwhile, had urged the judge to dismiss the case.",

      "Weekly measles cases have set a new record, according to figures published Friday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, topping the peak of an outbreak in 2019 that ranked as the worst since the 1990s.",
      "The number of cases that had their symptoms start during the week of March 30 has grown to 111, according to the agency's latest update. Authorities backdate newly reported measles cases based on when their rash began, to account for delays in reporting and diagnosis.",
      "That tops the 102 cases reported for the week of March 23, 2019, at the height of that year's wave. By the end of 2019, measles cases that year added up to the largest annual tally since endemic spread of the virus was declared eliminated in 2000.",
      "This year, the majority of cases are from an ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states, which is now larger than any other single outbreak since the virus was eliminated. Between\u00a0Texas\u00a0and\u00a0New Mexico, at least 750 of the measles cases reported this year have been linked to that outbreak. Cases in\u00a0Oklahoma\u00a0and other states have also been linked to the outbreak.",

      "After the Trump administration dismissed nearly 400 scientists who compile the nation's major quadrennial report on the impacts of climate change in the U.S., two scientific groups announced a plan to publish a special collection focused on the subject to ensure the scientists' work can be accessed.",
      "The American Geophysical Union, the world's largest association of earth and space scientists, and the American Meteorological Society, the professional society for atmospheric and related sciences and services, announced they would be inviting climate scientists and researchers to submit their work for what they said would be a \"first of its kind\" collection.",
      "The groups say their collection isn't meant to replace the National Climate Assessment, but would complement it, since the dismissal of hundreds of scientists suggests that the next National Climate Assessment may not be as extensive as the previous ones. The Trump administration is legally obligated to produce the assessment, but the White House told CBS News that it's evaluating the scope of the assessment that it will publish.",
      "The National Climate Assessment is a major publication produced every four years that summarizes the impacts of climate change in the U.S., and it is congressionally mandated under the Global Change Research Act of 1990.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to let the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have access to the sensitive information kept by the Social Security Administration.",
      "The emergency appeal to the Supreme Court stems from an injunction issued by a federal district court judge in Maryland who limited DOGE's access to Social Security Administration system of records containing the personal information of millions of Americans.",
      "The judge concluded in her April decision that the plaintiffs, two labor unions and an advocacy group represented by Democracy Forward, were likely to succeed on their claim that the Social Security Administration's decision to give DOGE access to millions of Americans' confidential information violated the Privacy Act and a federal law governing the agency rulemaking process.",
      "\"T]he issue here is not the work that DOGE or the agency want to do. The issue is about how they want to do the work,\" U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander wrote in her 145-page decision. \"The DOGE Team seeks access to the [personally identifiable information] that millions of Americans entrusted to SSA, and the SSA defendants have agreed to provide it. For some 90 years, SSA has been guided by the foundational principle of an expectation of privacy with respect to its records. This case exposes a wide fissure in the foundation.\"",
      "She did allow DOGE team members to have access to redacted or anonymized information from the Social Security Administration, but only if they met certain conditions, such as receiving trainings and undergoing background investigations.",
      "The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit declined a Trump administration request to halt that injunction, leading it to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "In asking the high court to lift the district court's injunction, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that it is forcing the executive branch to stop federal employees tasked with modernizing government systems from accessing the data contained within them.",
      "\"The government cannot eliminate waste and fraud if district courts bar the very agency personnel with expertise and the designated mission of curtailing such waste and fraud from performing their jobs,\" he said.",
      "The solicitor general, who argues on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court, said that the plaintiffs who brought the case did not have the legal right to sue. Sauer also argued that the district court did not have the legal authority to issue sweeping relief, which he said harmed \"urgent federal priorities\" and thwarted the executive branch's functions.",
      "\"Employees charged with modernizing government information systems and routing out fraud, waste, and abuse in data systems plainly need access to those systems,\" he wrote. \"Yet the district court instead viewed agency employees within the SSA DOGE team as the equivalent of intruders who break into hotel rooms.\"",
      "The Trump administration has sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court in at least a dozen cases, as more than 200 legal challenges targeting many aspects of second-term agenda move their way through the federal courts. But the legal battle over DOGE's access to Social Security data is the first directly involving the cost-cutting task force to land before the justices.",
      "President Trump\u00a0established DOGE\u00a0on his first day back in the White House and has said that he tasked Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, with leading the initiative. The White House has said, though, that Amy Gleason, who worked at DOGE's predecessor entity, U.S. Digital Service, is formally the administrator of DOGE. The task force's employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen agencies as part of the president's plan to shrink the size of the government.",
      "But DOGE's attempts to access Americans' sensitive data at agencies including the Departments of Treasury and Education, and the Office of Personnel Management, have led to their own set of lawsuits claiming the task force's members have not been complying with the Privacy Act, the federal law that aims to protect Americans' private information.",
      "Musk's role in DOGE, too, has sparked a set of challenges that argue his actions violate the Constitution's Appointments Clause. A different federal judge in Maryland ruled in March that Musk and DOGE likely violated the Constitution through its unilateral shut down of the U.S. Agency for International Development. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit agreed to pause that decision while it considers an appeal by the Trump administration.",

After confirming a person's humanity, World then creates a digital ID for users that proves their personhood, distinguishing them from a bot or AI program that can mimic human behavior.",

But World's backers say the Orb and its \"proof of personhood\" is addressing a problem that can stymie everything from finance to online dating: bots impersonating people.",
      "The Orb \"is a privacy-first way to prove you are a human in the world of AI and bots,\" said Jake Brukhman, co-founder of CoinFund, one of the project's earliest backers. \"That is getting relevant as AI is becoming much more prevalent in the world.\"",

      "The documents, dated April 29 and 30, have not been publicly released. They represent the Army's most recent blueprint for its long-planned 250th anniversary festival on the National Mall and the newly added element \u2014 a large military parade that Mr. Trump has long wanted.",
      "The Army anniversary coincides with Mr. Trump's 79th birthday, which falls on June 14.",
      "A parade of this size is likely to cost tens of millions of dollars. The price would include moving the military vehicles, equipment, aircraft and troops from across the country to Washington, D.C., and the need to feed and house thousands of service members.",
      "High costs halted Mr. Trump's push for a parade in his first term, and the tanks and other heavy vehicles that are part of the Army's latest plans have raised concerns from city officials about damage to roads.",
      "Asked about plans for a parade, Army spokesman Steve Warren said Thursday that no final decisions have been made. Col. Dave Butler, another Army spokesman, said the Army is excited about the plans for its anniversary.",
      "\"We want to make it into an event that the entire nation can celebrate with us,\" said Butler. \"We want Americans to know their Army and their soldiers. A parade might become part of that, and we think that will be an excellent addition to what we already have planned.\"",
      "Others familiar with the documents, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans have not been finalized, said they represent the Army's plans as it prepares for any White House approval of the parade. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "There has been no formal approval yet. Changes to the plans have been made in recent weeks and more are likely. Much of the equipment would have to be brought in by train or flown in.",
      "Mr. Trump weighed in on the military Thursday night, though he didn't mention plans for June 14. Writing on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said, \"We are going to start celebrating our victories again!\" He said he would rename May 8 \u2014 known as Victory in Europe Day \u2014 as \"Victory Day for World War II\" and change Veterans Day, on Nov. 11, to \"Victory Day for World War I.\"",
      "Some equipment and troops were already going to be included in the Army's birthday celebration, which has been in the works for more than a year. The festival was set to involve activities and displays on the National Mall, including a fitness competition, climbing wall, armored vehicles, Humvees, helicopters and other equipment.",
      "A parade, however, would increase the equipment and troops involved. According to the plans, as many as 6,300 of the service members would be marching in the parade, while the remainder would be responsible for other tasks and support.",
      "The Army's early festival plans did not include a parade, but officials confirmed last month that the Army had started discussions about adding one.",
      "The plans say the parade would showcase the Army's 250 years of service and foresee bringing in soldiers from at least 11 corps and divisions nationwide. Those could include a Stryker battalion with two companies of Stryker vehicles, a tank battalion and two companies of tanks, an infantry battalion with Bradley vehicles, Paladin artillery vehicles, Howitzers and infantry vehicles.",
      "There would be seven Army bands and a parachute jump by the Golden Knights. And documents suggest that civilian participants would include historical vehicles and aircraft and two bands, along with people from veterans groups, military colleges and reenactor organizations.",
      "According to the plan, the parade would be classified as a national special security event, and that request has been submitted by the National Park Service and is under review.",
      "And it is expected that the evening parade would be followed by a concert and fireworks.",
      "One of the documents raises concerns about some limitations, which include where troops would be housed and \"significant concerns regarding security requirements\" as equipment flows into the city. It says the biggest unknown so far is which units would be participating.",
      "In his first term, Trump proposed having a parade after seeing one in France on Bastille Day in 2017. Mr. Trump said that after watching the two-hour procession along the famed Champs-Elysees that he wanted an even grander one on Pennsylvania Avenue.",
      "That plan was ultimately dumped due to the huge costs \u2014 with one estimate of a $92 million price tag \u2014 and other logistical issues. Among those were objections from city officials who said including tanks and other heavy armored vehicles would tear up the roads.",
      "Trump said in a social media post in 2018 that he was canceling the event over the costs and accused local politicians of price gouging.",
      "This year, as plans progressed for the Army to host its birthday festival in Washington, talk about a parade began anew.",
      "D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser acknowledged in April that the administration reached out to the city about holding a parade on June 14 that would stretch from Arlington, Virginia, where the Pentagon and Arlington National Cemetery are located, across the Potomac River and into Washington.",
      "Bowser at the time said she didn't know if the event was being \"characterized as a military parade\" but added that tanks rolling through the city's streets \"would not be good.\"",
      "\"If military tanks were used, they should be accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads,\" she said.",
      "In 2018, the Pentagon appeared to agree. A memo from the defense secretary's staff said plans for the parade \u2014 at that time \u2014 would include only wheeled vehicles and no tanks to minimize damage to local infrastructure.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has reached a settlement with the family of Ashli Babbitt, the Trump supporter who was shot and killed while in the mob breaching the House Speaker's Lobby on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News the settlement has been reached in principle but is not yet signed. In a court proceeding Friday, a plaintiff's attorney confirmed the settlement in principle was reached. It would avert a trial and further proceedings in a $30 million civil suit filed by the conservative activist group Judicial Watch on behalf of Babbitt's estate, including her late husband.",
      "Babbitt's death was a rallying point for Trump loyalists and Capitol rioters who alleged police used unnecessary force in stopping the mob on Jan. 6. In the civil lawsuit, Babbitt's estate alleged U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd was negligent in the issue of force and his firearm. The suit also argued Byrd was not in uniform and was wearing a COVID mask when he opened fire against Babbitt. The suit accused Byrd of failing to \"de-escalate.\"",
      "\"Ashli was unarmed,\" the lawsuit said. \"Her hands were up in the air, empty, and in plain view of Lt. Byrd and other officers in the lobby. Ashli posed no threat to the safety of anyone.\"",
      "The case, which was initially filed in California, was transferred to the Washington, D.C., federal court in 2024 and was defended by the Justice Department under the Biden administration.",
      "In a 2024 court filing, the department argued, \"Ms. Babbitt unlawfully entered the Capitol. She made her way to the east doors of the Speaker's Lobby situated immediately behind the Chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives, the site of Joint Sessions of Congress. Although officers had barricaded the Speaker's Lobby doors with heavy furniture, demonstrators broke through the glass panels of the lobby doors and matching windows (called \"sidelights\") on either side of the doors.\"",
      "It went on to say, \"Michael Byrd, a U.S. Capitol Police lieutenant, was positioned on the other side of the lobby doors. When Ms. Babbitt, wearing a backpack, tried to climb through a sidelight into the Speaker's Lobby, Lt. Byrd fatally shot her.\"",
      "In an August 2021 internal review, the U.S. Capitol Police said Byrd saved lives and did not engage in misconduct.",
      "\"This officer and the officer's family have been the subject of numerous credible and specific threats for actions that were taken as part of the job of all our officers: defending the Congress, Members, staff and the democratic process,\" the review said. \"The actions of the officer in this case potentially saved Members and staff from serious injury and possible death from a large crowd of rioters who forced their way into the U.S. Capitol and to the House Chamber where Members and staff were steps away.\"",
      "Footage from Jan. 6 shows Babbitt trying to climb through a smashed window as the mob sought to breach the House Speaker's Lobby, where the counting of the electoral votes had been interrupted. Members of Congress were evacuating the area during the riot.",
      "Babbitt's mother, Micki Wittehoff helped lead a nightly protest outside the Washington, D.C., jail for more than two years, in defense of U.S. Capitol riot defendants and convicted felons. Wittehoff's advocacy helped secure meetings with then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, references to Babbitt by President Trump and a selfie photo with Kash Patel, who later was confirmed as the director of the FBI.",
      "Hours after he was inaugurated, the president issued a blanket pardon for more than 1,500 Capitol riot defendants. The Justice Department has fired prosecutors who handled the Jan. 6 cases.",
      "Last month, Brendan Ballou, one of the Jan. 6 prosecutors who resigned after Trump took office told CBS News the pardons and firings were an effort to whitewash history.",
      "\"The goal here is to rewrite the history of Jan. 6,\" Ballou said. \"There are enormous number of politicians whose whole careers now depend on that day being forgotten because if it's remembered, people will realize they are supporting a president that tried to incite an insurrection and overthrow the peaceful democratic transfer of power. And so there's a concerted effort by these folks to make sure that that history is forgotten, and firing those prosecutors is part of that effort.\"",

      "The president's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would slash non-defense discretionary spending by $163 billion from current levels, the official told reporters on a conference call Friday, while defense spending would surpass $1 trillion for the first time ever. The president's budget proposal, along with efforts by the White House and Republicans to claw back some federal funding already authorized by Congress, would solidify cuts championed by the White House's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.",

The president's budget recommendation would have the lowest non-defense discretionary spending since 2017, or, adjusted for inflation, the lowest non-defense discretionary spending since 2000, the official said.",

      "The rule requires that industrial facilities \u2014 often chemical plants, oil refineries, and other industrial factories classified as \"major\" sources of toxic air pollution \u2014 always maintain strict pollution controls. Even if they comply and limit those pollution levels, those facilities would always be labeled \"major\" sources under the rule.",
      "The Trump Administration had killed the rule in President Trump's first term, but the EPA, under former President Joe Biden, finalized and updated it last September. The environmental advocacy group Earthjustice has said that\u00a0the rule forced 1,800 facilities across the country\u00a0to tighten air pollution controls to comply with the law.",
      "The seven pollutants in question are:",
      "Alkylated lead compoundsPolycyclic organic matter (POM)MercuryHexachlorobenzenePolychlorinated biphenyls(PCB)2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofurans (TCDF)2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin",

      "2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin",
      "Several Republican lawmakers have been attempting to revoke the rule. Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah introduced\u00a0the resolution\u00a0which passed Thursday. Curtis had argued that the rule disincentivized companies to deploy new technology to reduce pollution.",
      "\"The rule put forward under the former administration shut the door on progress,\" Curtis said in a statement after the resolution's passage. \"It told companies that no matter how much they invest to reduce harmful emissions, they would still be punished with permanent red tape. That's not good science, it's not good governance, and it certainly isn't good for the environment. My resolution restores a common-sense incentive: if you clean up, you get credit for it.\"",
      "Several environmental groups, however, blasted the move.",
      "\"Today, I worry for children's health more than ever before,\" Melody Reis, director of federal policy for\u00a0Moms Clean Air Force, said in a statement to CBS News. \"Just now Senate Republicans voted to hand a couple of thousand of the nation's largest industrial polluters an easy way to release toxic air pollutants linked to cancer, birth defects, and brain damage. They voted to allow chemical manufacturers, pesticide makers, refineries and other facilities to turn off their pollution controls for the most insidious air pollutants known to humankind \u2014 chemicals such as dioxins, mercury, and PCBs. This will put our children, and all of us, at grave risk. It is a shameful, and completely unnecessary move.\"",
      "Michelle Roos, executive director of the Environmental Protection Network, which is made up of former EPA staffers, said in his own statement, \"Congress should be strengthening EPA's ability to protect the public from mercury, benzene, and other dangerous emissions, not stripping away rules that hold polluters accountable.\"",
      "The vote marks a major victory for the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries, which had lobbied against the \"Once in, Always In\" rule for some time. The National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group,\u00a0sent a letter to Mr. Trump\u00a0after his inauguration calling the rule \"burdensome,\" and listing it as one of several environmental regulations that are \"strangling our economy\" and should be reversed.",

    "summary": "A ruling by the Supreme Court in favor of St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School would lead to the country's first religious charter school.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court\u00a0on Wednesday appeared divided over efforts in Oklahoma to create an online Catholic charter school, a case that could open the door to public dollars flowing directly to religious schools.",
      "A ruling in favor of the school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, could lead to the country's first religious charter school and upend laws in at least 45 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the federal charter school program, all of which require charter schools to be nonsectarian, Oklahoma's Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, has warned.",
      "Eight of the nine justices are considering the case, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself. Following arguments, it seemed likely that the outcome hinges on Chief Justice John Roberts, who focused on the level of state involvement in its charter school program during the arguments. If the Supreme Court deadlocks 4-4, it would leave intact the decision of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which ruled that the contract establishing St. Isidore's as a Catholic charter school was a violation of state and federal law.",
      "Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh appeared most sympathetic to St. Isidore's argument that excluding it from Oklahoma's charter school system unconstitutionally discriminated against the school.",
      "Kavanuagh said religious institutions can't be treated as \"second class\" and said keeping sectarian schools from operating charter schools, when the program is open to nonreligious private entities, seems like \"rank discrimination\" based on religion.",
      "\"They're not asking for special treatment. They're not asking for favoritism. They're just saying don't treat us worse because we're religious,\" he said of the school.",
      "But the three liberal justices, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, seemed concerned that a decision allowing the religious charter school would weaken the wall between church and state.",
      "\"The state is running these schools,\" Kagan said. Jackson said charter schools are \"a creation and creature of the state.\"",
      "But there was some concern about how a ruling allowing St. Isidore's to be established as a religious charter school would impact the systems in other states, and specifically the level of oversight and control over them. Justice Neil Gorsuch warned such a result could lead states to impose more requirements on charter schools, such as mandating public officials to serve on their boards and boosting state involvement in their creation.",
      "\"Have you thought about that boomerang effect?\" he asked James Campbell, who argued on behalf of the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which joined St. Isidore's in the case.",
      "A decision will follow the Supreme Court's three\u00a0rulings in recent years that were in favor of religious plaintiffs, which all allowed public funds to be used for religious institutions.",
      "\"This would really be the first time that the Supreme Court sanctions, if it rules in favor of the charter school, the direct flow of funds from the government and financial support from the government to a religious entity for religious activities,\" said Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University who focuses on the law and religion.",
      "St. Isidore, she said, is asking the state to \"quite literally establish a religious school. It's essentially making a religious school, creating an affiliation between the religious entity and the state that we haven't seen before.\"",
      "But backers of St. Isidore argue that its position is simply an application of those decisions and would not create any new principles.",
      "\"The unifying thread is the idea that once the government decides to open up a program and to distribute benefits or to contract with people, it can't single out religious people or institutions for special disadvantage,\" said Richard Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School who directs its Program on Church, State and Society.",
      "The formation of a Catholic charter school",
      "Oklahoma has offered charter schools within its public education system since 1999 and, like at least 44 other states and the federal charter school program, requires the institutions to be \"nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations.\" The state has at least 30 charter schools that serve more than 50,000 students, and they received $314 million from the state and $69 million in federal funds in the 2022 to 2023 school year, according to a 2023 report from the Oklahoma State Department of Education.",
      "In January 2023, the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa formed the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Charter School Inc. for the purpose of establishing and operating St. Isidore as a Catholic school, according to court records. That May, St. Isidore applied to the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board to establish it as a virtual charter school that \"fully embraces the teachings of the Catholic Church's Magisterium\" and \"fully incorporates these [teachings] into every aspect of the school.\"",
      "The school estimated initial enrollment of 500 students and projected it would receive roughly $2.7 million in state funding for its first year of operation, according to court documents.",
      "Ahead of a vote by the board, Drummond warned against approval of St. Isidore's application, and said an earlier analysis from his predecessor supporting the school could be \"used as a basis for taxpayer-funded religious schools, which is exactly what [St. Isidore] seeks to become.\"",
      "Drummond also warned that approving St. Isidore's application to become a charter school \"will create a slippery slope.\"",
      "\"I doubt most Oklahomans would want their tax dollars to fund a religious school whose tenets are diametrically opposed to their own faith,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the approval of a charter school by one faith will compel the approval of charter schools by all faiths, including even those most Oklahomans would consider reprehensible and unworthy of public funding.\"",
      "Still, the charter school board voted 3-2 to approve St. Isidore's application, and in October 2023, it and the school entered in a contract establishing St. Isidore's as a charter school.",
      "That month, Drummond sued the board directly in the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked it to rescind the charter contract and declare St. Isidore's establishment as a charter school unlawful.",
      "The attorney general prevailed before the state's highest court, which ruled that because St. Isidore's is a public charter school, it violated the state's requirement that those entities be nonreligious, as well as the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, in part because it would \"permit state spending in direct support of the religious curriculum and activities within St. Isidore.\"",
      "\"The state will be directly funding a religious school and encouraging students to attend it,\" the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which split 6-2, found.",
      "The Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore's both asked the Supreme Court to review the decision, and it agreed to do so in January.",
      "A \"major breach\" in the wall",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in a string of recent decisions sided with religious families and institutions that challenged state-funded programs for excluding religious beneficiaries as violations of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.",
      "In 2017, the court said that Missouri violated the free exercise right of Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center when it denied it grant funding to resurface its playground. Then, in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Montana could not exclude religious schools from a program providing tax credits to people who donate to scholarships for private-school students. Most recently, in 2022, the Supreme Court said Maine cannot limit a tuition assistance program to nonsectarian schools.",
      "Citing those decisions, Roberts said the programs at issue in Missouri, Montana and Maine were also creations and creatures of the state. But he also said they involved \"fairly discrete\" state involvement, as opposed to the \"much more comprehensive involvement\" of Oklahoma in funding and overseeing its charter schools.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Drummond argued that the justices have drawn a clear line through those decisions: If the state offers tuition assistance that parents can direct to the school of their choosing, it cannot exclude religious private schools. But when it comes to public schools, he said, states can provide a secular education.",
      "Drummond said the Supreme Court has never held that the Constitution's Establishment Clause allows \"direct aid for religious instruction in public schools,\" and added that creating and funding a religious public school would violate that provision of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Religious education is an invaluable benefit for millions of Americans who choose it,\" Drummond wrote. \"But our Constitution has never required the creation of religious public schools. There is no basis to change that now.\"",
      "He warned that if the Supreme Court rules for St. Isidore, \"state funds will pour into religious public charter schools just as they do traditional public schools,\" and the firewall between public funds flowing to a school because of private choice versus a direct subsidy would be damaged.",
      "\"A ruling for petitioners would eliminate the buffer this court has long enforced between religious instruction and public schools \u2014 including in areas where charter schools are the only or default public-school option,\" Drummond argued, noting that the issue is direct aid.",
      "A crucial question in the court fight is whether Oklahoma's charter schools are public schools.",
      "Drummond says they are, because the state's charter schools have to comply with anti-discrimination laws; they are free, open to all students, created and funded by the state, and are subject to government regulation and oversight regarding curriculum, testing and other issues. And because charter schools are public schools, the attorney general said they are government entities.",
      "Gregory Garre, who argued on behalf of Drummond, said that St. Isidore's is seeking special status compared to secular charter schools, because it said it can only comply with laws that are consistent with its constitutional rights as a religious school under the direction of the Catholic Church.",
      "He warned that a decision in favor of the school would render the laws in nearly all states and the federal charter school program unconstitutional because they all require charter schools to be nonsectarian.",
      "Such an outcome would \"create uncertainty, confusion and disruption\" for the millions of charter school students across the country.",
      "He warned that allowing religious institutions to participate in state charter school systems would open the door to more litigation over issues like who can be admitted, who can teach at the schools and over their curriculum.",
      "But lawyers for the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore disagree. Backing them in the case are Oklahoma's GOP governor, Kevin Stitt, and the state superintendent of public instruction, Ryan Walters.",
      "The board and school said St. Isidore is a privately operated school providing free publicly funded education through a contract with the state, and the Free Exercise Clause protects its right to participate in the charter school program.",
      "\"The state did not design the school. It did not create or encourage St. Isidore's religious character. It did not appoint any member of St. Isidore's board. It did not instruct the school to offer an education in the Catholic tradition. And it will not hire or supervise the school's teachers and administrators,\" lawyers for St. Isidore wrote in a filing.",
      "Campbell, who argued on behalf of the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, told the justices that St. Isidore's was created not by the state, but by two Catholic organizations, and it's controlled by a privately selected board of directors.",
      "The restrictions in state law, lawyers for St. Isidore's and the charter school board said, amount to unconstitutional religious discrimination because Oklahoma is excluding religious observers from otherwise available public benefits and programs. And because the state's charter school program is neutrally administered, the Establishment Clause doesn't prevent public dollars from flowing to religious schools.",
      "\"This is particularly true when private choice directs government dollars to religious schools,\" they said.",
      "Garnett, of Notre Dame Law School, said that public money would only go to St. Isidore if a parent made the choice to send their child to the virtual school.",
      "\"If the court thinks that what Oklahoma has done is create a program that private entities are eligible to participate in, then it's straightforward to say once they do that, they can't discriminate on the basis of religion,\" he said.",
      "But professor Hill, like Drummond, said charter schools are public schools, and warned there's always been a line where the Supreme Court did not allow the direct flow of government funds to religious schools for religious instruction. She said the case is part of a progression that began with the Supreme Court's 2017 ruling and comes as traditional public schools are being starved of resources in many states.",
      "\"The agenda has been to require, not just allow, direct government funding of religious schools in particular,\" she said. \"Vouchers are one thing, but I do think it's a major breach in the wall of separation if the charter school wins.\"",
      "Barrett's recusal from the case could create a situation in which the Supreme Court renders a 4-4 decision, leaving the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling intact. She did not provide a reason for her stepping aside, though it may be because the Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Clinic is representing St. Isidore.",
      "Barrett taught at Notre Dame before she was appointed to the federal bench and was an adjunct professor at the law school in 2023, according to her most recent financial disclosure report. Barrett is also close friends with Nicole Stelle Garnett, an associate dean at Notre Dame Law School who authored a paper that suggested that as a result of a June 2020 Supreme Court ruling, states with charter schools must permit religious charter schools or risk violating the Free Exercise Clause.",

    "summary": "The National Climate Assessment, a major publication produced every four years that summarizes the impacts of climate change in the U.S., is scheduled for publication in 2027.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly 400 scientists across the United States were informed Monday afternoon that their services were no longer needed to help write a major report on climate change for the federal government.",
      "The report, known as the National Climate Assessment, is a major publication produced every four years that summarizes the impacts of climate change in the United States, and it is congressionally mandated under the Global Change Research Act of 1990. The sixth edition is scheduled for publication in 2027 and preparations have been underway for months to meet that deadline.",
      "The National Climate Assessment is the basis for which federal, state, and local governments, as well as private companies, can prepare for climate change impacts, understand future projections of climate risk, as well as learn to adapt and mitigate those challenges.",
      "An email sent to participants from the deputy director of services of the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a federal office that organizes the publication of the report read, \"Thank you for your participation in the 6th National Climate Assessment ... we are now releasing all current assessment participants from their roles.\"",
      "According to the email, the \"scope\" of the assessment is being \"reevaluated\" as the Trump administration looks to comply with the law, something the White House also reaffirmed to CBS News.",
      "But many in the scientific community are concerned about how the report will be written without the subject matter expertise of the hundreds of scientists and researchers, many of whom were non-federal employees voluntarily working on the report in service of the government.",
      "\"The Trump administration has dismissed all the scientists from their work on the nation's most important climate change report,\" Steven Hamburg, chief scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, said in a statement. \"Refusing to study climate change won't make it go away \u2014 or help us deal with stronger storms, droughts, floods, wildfires and hotter temperatures, or help us stop emitting the pollution that is making it worse.\"",
      "The move doesn't come as a major surprise as Project 2025 outlined a plan to reshape the report and the office that organizes it, the U.S. Global Change Research Program. In Project 2025, a policy roadmap outlined by the Heritage Foundation for the next Republican president, authors argued that bureaucratic offices like USGCRP should not have so much control and reports like NCA should include \"diverse viewpoints.\"",
      "The steps to accomplish this were laid a few weeks ago when many federal employees of the USGCRP were fired, according to a Politico report, and the contract for outside work to publish the NCA was canceled in early April.",
      "When asked how scientists feel about their expertise no longer being needed, most said they expected the news.",
      "\"I feel badly for the federal leaders who have put a lot of time into this, but to some extent, I think the writing was on the wall when they dismissed the support staff a few weeks ago,\" said Dr. Robert Kopp a climate scientist and professor at Rutgers University, who was also working on the current assessment. \"I think now it's clear, many of the authors would like to see an up-to-date evidence based report.\"",
      "How an independent report can be published outside the purview of the federal government remains to be seen. Dr. Kopp says independent fundraising would need to occur to help support the report's publishing as it requires a lot of time, energy, and resources to organize the efforts of hundreds of volunteer scientists who write the content.",
      "Failing to publish a report of record that stands up to rigorous scientific review of past national assessments is significant, says Dr. Mijin Cha, a climate and environmental justice professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz and a fellow author on this year's assessment.",
      "\"We're losing our status as the premiere data and research country,\" Dr. Cha said.",
      "Many in the scientific community have begun to talk about how to move forward, but fears remain that the Trump administration will proceed with its own report, assigning authors that represent alternative viewpoints on climate change.",
      "\"I'm worried who will do the NCA moving forward and putting something forward that is false,\" said Dr. Cha.",
      "Because the Global Change Research Act of 1990 mandates the NCA to be written, the Trump administration is legally obligated to abide by the law and has until the end of 2027 to produce the sixth version of the report.",

    "summary": "Officials said there are active discussions about sending third country deportees from U.S. soil to the east African nation.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rwanda's government and the Trump administration are discussing details about a potential agreement for Kigali to accept deportees from the U.S., including Africans and other non-Rwandan nationals, CBS News has learned.",
      "Decisions on potential financial compensation for taking in the deportees and other details would be discussed within the next two weeks, according to a Rwandan official. A U.S. official and a Rwandan official both confirmed the active talks about sending third-country deportees from U.S. soil to the east African nation.",
      "During a televised Cabinet meeting event earlier this week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was actively searching for other countries to take in migrants expelled from the U.S.",
      "\"We are working with other countries to say, 'We want to send you some of the most despicable human beings,'\" he said while sitting alongside President Trump. Rubio added that the \"further away from America, the better.\"",
      "The Rwanda arrangements were first reported by the Washington Post, which also cited work by an independent journalist who had uncovered the recent deportation from the U.S. of an Iraqi national to Rwanda.",
      "A Rwandan official told CBS News that the Trump administration had indeed carried out that deportation, but did not share additional information about the man. The Rwandan official also told CBS News that Kigali had unique past experience with handling deportees, and cited a past deal with the United Kingdom. The U.K.'s deportation of asylum seekers in 2024 sparked legal and political controversy for the then conservative U.K. government. Immediately after taking office last year, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the policy was \"dead and buried.\"",
      "The Trump administration has looked to third countries to handle America's influx of migrants and attempts to deport them. El Salvador has an arrangement with the Trump administration to accept deportees and to imprison some of them for a fee, including at the notorious CECOT prison, a move which has led to a flurry of legal action. Other countries, including Mexico and Panama, have agreed to accept deportees who are not their own nationals.",
      "The deportation talks with the State Department come at the same time that the U.S. is trying to broker a peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.",
      "In front of the cameras, Rubio also praised Mr. Trump's envoy to Africa, Massad Boulos, who is Tiffany Trump's father-in-law, and said he'd recently sent him to the region. Boulos, who has the title of senior advisor for Africa, has publicly spoken of his efforts to broker billion-dollar minerals deals in the region.",
      "Rubio also said he recently oversaw the signing of a declaration of peace between the DRC and Rwanda, and stated that he hopes to broker a lasting permanent peace.",

    "story": [
      "A 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck off the southern coasts of Chile and Argentina on Friday, the United States Geological Survey said. The quake triggered a tsunami warning, but it was later canceled, and there were no reports of damage or casualties.",
      "The quake hit at 8:58 a.m. local time and was followed by at least a dozen aftershocks. Chilean authorities issued an evacuation alert for the entire coastal section of the Strait of Magellan, in the far south of the country, as a precaution.",
      "\"We call for evacuation of the coastline throughout the Magallanes region,\" Chile's President Gabriel Boric posted\u00a0on social media after an emergency service\u00a0alert, which also ordered evacuations in the nearby Antarctic areas.",
      "Photos and social media videos showed people calmly evacuating as sirens blared in the background, Reuters reported.",
      "In Punta Arenas, located in Chilean Patagonia and on the Strait of Magellan, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the streets quickly filled with residents searching for shelters, according to images broadcast on local television.",
      "The evacuation proceeded calmly and without panic. \"We received the alert and we had to evacuate at work, but people are calm and well prepared,\" Roberto Ram\u00edrez told the 24-hour channel.",
      "The USGS said the quake's epicenter was under the ocean 219 kilometers (173 miles) south of the Argentinian city of Ushuaia, in the Drake Passage between Cape Horn and Antarctica.",
      "In Ushuaia, considered the world's southernmost city, local authorities suspended all types of water activities and navigation in the Beagle Channel for at least three hours. No damage was reported.",
      "\"The earthquake was felt primarily in the city of Ushuaia and, to a lesser extent, in towns across the province,\" the local government reported. \"In the face of these types of events, it is important to remain calm.\"",
      "Chile's Antarctic Institute told Reuters that bases there were also being evacuated.",
      "A tsunami warning was issued for coastal areas within 185 miles of the epicenter soon after the quake.\u00a0Chilean authorities withdrew the warning later Friday after determining that no tsunami was occurring, allowing people to trickle back to their homes even as officials continued to caution the public to steer clear of boardwalks and beaches.",

    "summary": "Australia's vote comes just a week after Canada's elections, where President Trump's influence was also felt.",
    "story": [
      "Australians are voting in a national election this weekend, and President Trump appears to be playing an outsized role as nations continue to respond to the vision of U.S. foreign policy he's put in place in the first 100 days of his second term.",
      "Polling stations on the eastern coast of the country, which includes Sydney and Melbourne, opened Saturday at 8 a.m. local time and close at 6 p.m. (4 a.m. ET on Saturday). In Western Australia, which includes Perth, the poll closing time comes two hours later.",
      "Australia's vote comes just a week after Canada's elections, where Mr. Trump's influence was also felt. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney \u2014 whose numbers spiked as he pushed back against tariff threats and Mr. Trump's jibes about annexing Canada into a \"51st state\" \u2014 crushed Pierre Poilievre's hopes to return the Conservative Party to power after a decade of Liberal Party rule.",
      "The center-right Liberal-National Coalition in Australia led the polls for nearly a year and had seemed to be on a path to form a government. Since Mr. Trump took office in January, however, the coalition's support has plummeted, and it now trails the Labor Party by 4.4 points, according to YouGov.",
      "Opposition leader Peter Dutton has run a campaign echoing Mr. Trump's messaging focusing on the economy. His Liberal Party, whose motto is \"Let's get Australia back on track,\" proposed cutting government waste and mandating federal workers return to the office.",
      "\"It was literally as if Dutton was copying what the United States government was doing, and I think as such, that ended up being enormously unpopular,\" Alan Tidwell, a professor of Australian, New Zealand and Pacific studies at Georgetown University, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "The economic downturn in Australia in recent years in the wake of the pandemic initially threatened center-left Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's prospects of remaining in power. But Dutton's similarities to Mr. Trump and the U.S. president's growing unpopularity among the Australian public seem to have boosted Albanese's chances.",
      "Still, Albanese has embraced a moderate approach to Mr. Trump, refraining from criticizing him directly. When asked during a debate last month whether he trusts Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Albanese said he had \"no reason not to\" trust either leader and said in a separate radio interview that he would speak with Mr. Trump after the election, should he win.",
      "\"I assure you I'm not staying up at night trying to ring anyone at the moment,\" Albanese said.",
      "But Tidwell told CBS News that even if tariffs were reversed, Mr. Trump's unpopularity in Australia would still impact the election. \"It's not saving Labor to the point where they can win an outright majority, but I think that they will win office with a minority government,\" he said.",
      "Australia is among several nations with which the U.S. does not have a trade deficit, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The two nations signed the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement in 2004, and it took effect on Jan. 1, 2005. Last month, Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, asked U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer why Australia was included on Mr. Trump's tariff list.",
      "\"The idea we are going to whack friend and foe alike undermines our national security and, frankly, makes us not a good partner going forward,\" Warner said.",
      "The U.S. was Australia's second-largest trading partner after China in the 2023-24 financial year, according to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. While it is unclear if American tariffs would prompt China to fill the gap, Beijing's increased presence in the Indo-Pacific is considered a national security threat by Canberra.",
      "The Australia, U.K. and U.S. trilateral security partnership",
      "Australia and the U.S., along with the U.K., also share a close national security relationship, known as AUKUS, which was formalized in 2021. The trilateral security partnership also allows Australia to obtain Virginia-class nuclear submarines, which are expected to join the Royal Australian Navy's fleet by the early 2030s.",
      "Nishank Motwani, senior fellow and director of alliance strategy at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute USA in Washington, D.C., told CBS News that AUKUS matters a lot to Australia's defense capability, but it needs to show the Trump administration how Canberra is being a responsible ally when it comes to defense spending to counter China.",
      "\"With a more influential China, which is more coercive and aggressive in the way in which it is just carrying out its affairs in the Indo-Pacific, Australia needs to do more as a way to push back against China's ability to carve out its sphere of influence,\" Motwani said.",
      "As the Trump White House redefines America's leadership role abroad and imposes tariffs on allies and adversaries alike, only 36% of Australians expressed any level of trust in the U.S. \"to act responsibly in the world,\" according to the Sydney-based Lowy Institute, whose survey in April also noted this was a \"new low in two decades\" of its polling.",
      "\"The level of distrust has certainly shot through the roof,\" Tidwell said. \"But I think that Donald Trump's launch of the trade war and his other comments about Canada and the Panama Canal and Greenland have all really upset the apple cart, and Australians are really wondering, what does the future hold?\"",

      "Guangzhou, China\u00a0\u2014 The annual Canton Fair in Guangzhou is China's largest import-export trade show. It covers a space equal to about 200 football fields and has been running since 1957 \u2014 when China's economy was isolated from the rest of the world. The country's leaders decided the expo, since formally named the China Import and Export Fair, was the best way to overcome trade obstacles imposed by the West and to drum up business investment and interest from overseas markets.",
      "In the almost seven decades since, China has transformed into the world's manufacturing powerhouse. But President Xi Jinping's government believes the U.S. is once again working to isolate China, through President Trump's tariff trade war, and that Washington will try to force other countries \u2014 and their consumers \u2014 to pick a side.",
      "Richard Qiu told CBS News it's simply unfair. Wearing a pale blue Ralph Lauren shirt, the businessman invited CBS News to sit down in his display booth at the Canton Fair for a chat. Surrounded by thousands of small fabric gift bags designed for everything from Christmas to Easter to birthdays, the fact that Qiu even quickly agreed to an interview was disarming; Every other Chinese businessperson we approached turned our camera away, wary of speaking with foreign media.",
      "His openness and warmth indicated a sense of ease with Westerners, and more importantly, his desire to tell his story about how external forces, completely out of his control, were affecting him and his livelihood.",
      "Qiu's Liaoning Perfect Import/Export Co. Ltd has been making gift bags for 20 years, and he has fostered strong relationships with his U.S. customers, who, in recent years, have made up 30-40% of his exports. He's traveled to the U.S. at least six times and says he loves the country: \"It's about freedom, democracy, it's open and fair.\"",
      "\"But this isn't fair,\" he said of the trade war sparked by President Trump's steep tariffs. \"It makes me feel sick about the U.S. now.\"",
      "Mr. Trump insists his tariffs will, despite current economic pain in the U.S., bring manufacturing back to America and buoy the economy, reshaping the global trade system. But Qiu said it's about something else. He believes President Trump is punishing China for being the best at producing everyday products at affordable prices, and using that prowess to dominate the global market.",
      "\"Our people are industrious, diligent, working hard to make the products good price, good quality, to sell all over the world. It's not our problem,\" he said. \"I think it's your problem.\"",
      "Since Mr. Trump imposed 145% tariffs on all Chinese imports \u2014 though the White House later exempted smartphones and some other electronics from the levies \u2014 Qiu says his U.S. sales have ground to a halt.",
      "\"U.S. buyers said, 'Richard you have to stop production; we have to cancel it.' I think 90% of my U.S. orders will be canceled.\"",
      "For years, the Canton Fair has been packed with American buyers looking to bring their customers back at home the best possible deals on offer. But this year, officials admitted to CBS News that the numbers are way down \u2014 another sign of President Trump's trade war taking hold.",
      "One American we did come across perusing the stalls in Guangzhou wasn't there to buy, but rather to research new products.",
      "\"Tariffs are going to come down at some point and we need to be ready for it,\" Jonathan Scheerz who lives in Michigan, where he runs a homewares business, told CBS News. He said he got a lot of orders in for products from China before Mr. Trump's inauguration, because he was anticipating a trade war \u2014 but not like this.",
      "\"I don't want to bring them in at the current tariff rate,\" he lamented. \"It just doesn't work. It's too high, but I also don't believe it's going to last months and months.\"",
      "The optimism is based on his belief that no one does it better than China when it comes to offering so many different products at such low prices.",
      "\"In my eyes, China produces what you want,\" Scheerz said. \"Simple as that.\"",
      "But if the trade war does drag on, many business owners who spoke with CBS News off camera said they were prepared to take the pain.",
      "Qiu knows tough days are ahead. He's looking to diversify his export portfolio in Europe, but there's only so much the market can absorb, so it's uncertain times.",
      "\"It's like a war, I think. Under a war, the most suffering is the people, no matter if it's the U.S. or China,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Qiu added, however, that over the course of China's history, the country has endured real hardship and pain, and he believes the Chinese people have the strength and fortitude to do it again.",
      "\"If we do something unfair, I will not support the government, but it's your government \u2014 the U.S. government that's put unfair things on us, so we say, 'okay, we fight.'\"",

    "summary": "The joint economic investment between the U.S. and Ukraine comes after China restricted exports of some rare earth minerals to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The joint economic investment deal announced Wednesday that gives the U.S. access to Ukrainian minerals may provide Ukraine with more support for its defense against Russia. But it also comes at a key moment for the American economy amid its growing trade war with China, a major producer of rare earths and other critical minerals.",
      "The new deal was described by Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economic development minister, as an equal partnership between the U.S. and Ukraine that\u00a0includes development of\u00a0mineral, oil and gas projects. The U.S. will provide either direct financial assistance or new military assistance to Ukraine, which will contribute half of any royalties from future oil, gas and mineral licenses.",
      "The pact comes as America's access to rare earth minerals, which are key to manufacturing high-tech products like computer chips and military equipment, has diminished after China last month announced export restrictions on some of these minerals in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. Although Mr. Trump has suggested buying Greenland, which has rare earths and critical minerals as well as oil and natural gas, Ukraine may provide a more readily available source for these strategically vital natural resources, experts say.",
      "\"You hear a lot about Greenland, but that is a very, very long term play with a lot of building up of infrastructure and a lot of ice-melting, to be fair,\" Heidi Crebo-Rediker, an expert with the Council on Foreign Relations, told CBS News.",
      "By contrast, Ukraine has the workforce and the metallurgical know-how to extract and develop these rare earth minerals, she added. Here's what to know about the U.S.' deal with Ukraine.",
      "What does the U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal cover?",
      "The deal covers minerals, including rare earth elements, but also other valuable resources, including oil and natural gas, according to the text released by Ukraine's government.",
      "It does not include resources that currently generate revenue for the Ukrainian state. In other words, any profits under the deal are dependent on the success of new American investments.",
      "Ukrainian officials have also noted that the deal does not refer to any debt obligations for Kyiv, meaning profits are unlikely to go toward paying the U.S. back for its previous financial support for the country in its war with Russia, according to Svyrydenko.",
      "The text of the deal lists 55 minerals subject to the U.S-Ukraine agreement, but says more can be added to the pact. Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in Ukraine's rare earth elements, and some of them are included in the list, as are other critical minerals, including titanium, lithium and uranium.",
      "What are rare earth minerals?",
      "Rare earth minerals are a set of 17 metallic elements, such as scandium and yttrium, according to U.S. Geological Survey. Scandium is used in aluminum alloys for aerospace parts, while yttrium is used in LEDs and solid oxide fuel cells, according to Stanford Advanced Materials, a scandium supplier.",
      "China is the the world's largest producer of rare earths, data from the Geological Survey shows.",
      "Aside from rare earth minerals, China also dominates production of critical minerals such as lithium and graphite, which are both essential for producing batteries used in electric vehicles and other devices.",
      "How large are Ukraine's mineral reserves?",
      "Ukraine holds about 5% of total global mineral reserves, which include both critical minerals and rare earth elements, according to Capital Economics, which cited the Ukrainian Geological Survey.",
      "\"Monetary estimates of Ukraine's reserves vary wildly. However, there is a lot of skepticism over the accuracy of Ukraine's national estimates given they reportedly rely on outdated Soviet-era assessments,\" Capital Economics said in a May 1 research note.",
      "Currently, Ukraine's critical minerals generate less than $200 million in annual export revenues, analysts with the investment advisory firm said. \"[T]he reality is that most of Ukraine's mineral reserves are unlikely to be economically viable, especially in the near term,\" they added.",
      "Ukraine has large deposits of cobalt and nickel, which are important for high-performance batteries, Crebo-Rediker said.",
      "What's happening with China's minerals?",
      "China placed new restrictions on seven heavy rare earth minerals on April 4, including scandium and yttrium, in retaliation against U.S. tariffs.",
      "\"Beijing has a history of responding to measures such as tariffs and tech controls from Washington by imposing curbs on exports of raw materials to the U.S.,\" Capital Economics analysts wrote in a May 1 report.",
      "They added, \"Under President Trump, it seems that developing alternative sources of supply will remain a key priority, which could limit any disruption to supply chains from geopolitics in the medium term and reduce Western reliance on China and its allies.\"",
      "China has a \"a near complete chokehold on another important critical material \u2014 graphite,\" Crebo-Rediker added. \"Ukraine is the fifth-largest producer of graphite and also gallium, which is restricted by China right now.\"",
      "What is the state of Ukraine's minerals industry?",
      "Ukraine's rare earth elements are largely untapped because of state policies regulating the industry, a lack of good information about deposits and the war with Russia. The industry's potential is also unclear given that mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate, according to analysts.",
      "In general, however, Ukraine's natural resources are considered to have signifiant commercial potential. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe's largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe's largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian minerals industry accounted for 6.1% of the country's gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it's in Mr. Trump's interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",

      "The Freedom Flotilla said in an earlier social media post that the ship's hull had been breached and it was taking on water, prompting the crew to issue a distress call. There were about 30 activists on board the vessel, the organization said. Nighttime photos and video shared by the group showed what it said was a fire toward the front of a vessel.",
      "The group did not immediately attribute the drone attack to any nation or group, and there were no claims of responsibility issued.",
      "Israeli forces have previously boarded and seized Freedom Flotilla vessels to prevent them from breaching the Gaza blockade, including a raid on a boat in 2010 that left at least nine activists dead.",
      "CBS News asked the Israel Defense Forces on Friday if it carried out any operation involving the Freedom Flotilla ship near Malta. There was no immediate response from the IDF.",
      "Francesca Albanese, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Palestinian territories, said in a social media post on Friday that she had \"received a distressed call from the people of the Freedom Flotilla that is carrying essential food and medicine to the starving Gaza population. I call on concerned state authorities, including maritime authorities, to support the ship and its crew as needed. I trust the competent authorities will also ascertain the facts and intervene appropriately.\"",
      "Aid organizations have condemned Israel's blockade, which, since the end of March,\u00a0has been strictly enforced\u00a0to prevent any goods entering the Palestinian territory, including humanitarian supplies that aid workers say are desperately needed in the enclave. Much of Gaza's infrastructure has been destroyed during the war sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel, which has also killed more than 52,000 people according to health officials in the Hamas-run territory.",
      "Hamas and allied groups killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel in the 2023 attack and took 251 others as hostages back into Gaza, according to Israeli officials, who've said as many as 24 of the captives could still be alive.",
      "In its statement, reported by Reuters, Malta's government said all those aboard the Freedom Flotilla vessel had been \"confirmed safe.\"",
      "\"The vessel had 12 crew members on board and four civilian passengers; no casualties were reported,\" the statement said, adding that a nearby tug had been directed to aid the vessel. \"The tug arrived on scene and began firefighting operations. By 1:28 a.m. (2328 GMT Thursday), the fire was reported under control. An Armed Forces of Malta patrol vessel was also dispatched to provide further assistance.\"",
      "\"By 2:13 a.m., all crew were confirmed safe but refused to board the tug ... The ship remains outside territorial waters and is being monitored by the competent authorities.\"",
      "It was not immediately clear why the activist group had reported nearly twice as many people being on the vessel as the Maltese authorities.",
      "The Freedom Flotilla describes itself as a \"solidarity movement composed of campaigns and initiatives from different parts of the world, working together to end the illegal Israeli blockade of Gaza.\"",
      "Among its goals with the defiant sailings to Gaza, the organization says it aims to \"condemn and publicize the complicity of other governments and global actors in enabling the blockade,\" including, \"most notably, the US government,\" which it says \"has underwritten Israel's violence against Palestinians for decades.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Thursday imposed economic sanctions on three Mexican nationals \u2014 including one accused drug lord with a fondness for exotic animals and luxury cars \u2014 and two Mexico-based entities involved in a drug trafficking and fuel theft network linked to Mexico's Jalisco New Generation Cartel.",
      "It is one of Mexico's most powerful cartels and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says it has some 19,000 members in its ranks. The cartel developed rapidly into an extremely violent force after it split from the Sinaloa cartel after the 2010 killing of Sinaloa cartel capo Ignacio \"Nacho\" Coronel Villarreal by the military.",
      "The new sanctions against Jalisco New Generation, including top members Cesar Morfin Morfin (dubbed \"Primito\") and his brothers Alvaro Noe Morfin Morfin and Remigio Morfin Morfin, target the group's fuel theft network.",
      "U.S. officials allege Primito is involved in the transportation and distribution of fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana into the United States.",
      "\"Primito's luxurious lifestyle has included ownership of exotic animals and dozens of luxury vehicles,\" the Treasury said in a news release, while releasing an image of a jaguar allegedly seized from Primito by Mexican authorities in December 2023.",
      "The Treasury Department says that network has resulted in tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue to the Mexican government and also funds the flow of illicit fentanyl into the United States.",
      "The sanctions freeze any assets the individuals or companies have in the U.S. and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.",
      "The U.S. administration has made it a priority to combat that flow, which has been blamed for tens of thousands of overdose deaths every year.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement that his department \"will continue to use all available tools to relentlessly target drug cartels and foreign terrorist organizations to Make America Safe Again.\"",
      "Paul Anthony Perez, president of the National Border Patrol Council, said the sanctions actions \"will ensure that the cartels no longer have the ability to provide unlimited funds to further their criminal enterprises and allow the U.S. government \"to disrupt their daily activities on both sides of the border.\"",
      "In February, the administration designated Jalisco New Generation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and Specially Designated Global Terrorist.\u00a0 The group has been accused of using fake job advertisements to lure new members and of\u00a0torturing and killing recruits\u00a0who resist. In March, a group of people looking for missing relatives found\u00a0charred bones, shoes and clothing\u00a0at a suspected training ground for the cartel.",
      "Thursday makes the eighth time the Trump Treasury Department has taken action against cartels. The Biden administration also imposed sanctions on the Jalisco New Generation group.",
      "The cartel is led by Nemesio Rub\u00e9n Oseguera Cervantes, who is better known as \"El Mencho.\" Washington has offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his capture.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, when asked Tuesday about the fight against fuel theft and smuggling, said her party in Congress was working to strengthen the government's tools so there will be \"traceability\" when it comes to fuel shipments.",
      "\"So that any tanker truck carrying fuel, whichever kind, we know: where it came from; where it's going; if it's imported, with what import permit did it enter, where was it stored, and from there to which service station is it going to be taken,\" Sheinbaum said. \"If a tanker has stolen fuel from a pipeline and is stopped on the highway, it has to show where that fuel came from; if it doesn't, there's something illegal.\"",
      "A man known as \"The Tank\" leads the cartel's fuel theft arm, supplying it with tens of millions of dollars a year by selling stolen gasoline through a network of seemingly legitimate businesses, according to the U.S. Treasury.",
      "The White House has linked fentanyl to President Trump's tariff plan, saying he wants \"to hold Mexico, Canada, and China accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country.\"",

      "\"The family system works, and this is why it's been in place for centuries.\"",
      "\"In fact,\" she adds, \"I would push for an extended family unit, which includes grandparents, cousins, etc., because we're seeing a stark rise in loneliness in the last five years, and it has become a psychological pandemic of sorts. In Japan, people can even rent a family; they essentially pay \u2018actors' to play their husband/wife/children for a day.\"",
      "She says she recently found out from a \"beautiful and successful woman\" in a professional women\u2019s group about hiring a \"body double,\" a person who is paid just to be present \"while they work/live/do life.\"",
      "\"While I do not judge the woman in the group, it is devastating to me as a Matchmaker that we as a society are normalizing paying someone to be a companion,\" she says. \"This is one of the benefits of a relationship.

      "\"He's been able to thread the needle really, really well between traditional conservative foreign policy voices and the more populist America First policy voices,\" the Florida GOP source said of Waltz.",

      "Waltz, who previously represented Florida\u2019s 6th congressional district, is a retired Army National Guard colonel and former Green Beret who served four deployments to Afghanistan and earned four Bronze Stars \u2014 the fourth-highest military combat award, issued for heroic service against an armed enemy.",
      "While Waltz and Hegseth both were embroiled in the Signal chat discussing strike plans against the Houthis, Hegseth has attracted more of the heat, at least publicly, stemming from the incident. Democrats have called for Hegseth\u2019s resignation as a result of the chat, but staffers at the White House \u2014 including Waltz \u2014 have openly backed Hegseth and shut down reports that the administration is seeking his replacement.",
      "But Waltz could get his turn attracting the ire of lawmakers as Democrats find an opportunity to openly grill him in front of the Senate, amid displeasure with Trump\u2019s foreign policy and national security agenda.",
      "\"The second hundred days of national security under President Trump will apparently be just as chaotic as the first hundred,\" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said in a statement to Fox News Digital about Waltz\u2019s departure from the White House.",
      "\"President Trump\u2019s consistent hirings, firings and upheaval sap morale from our warfighters and intelligence officers, degrade our military readiness, and leave us less prepared to respond to threats from our adversaries,\" Coons said. \"American citizens at home and around the world are less safe because of President Trump\u2019s non-existent national security strategy.\"",

Fire and investigate them all.\"",
      "In addition to the Signal chat, Waltz\u2019s exit from the White House was tied to several other issues. For example, Axios reports that Waltz treated White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles like \"staff,\" and his disrespect rubbed her the wrong way.",
      "\"He treated her like staff and didn't realize he's the staff, she's the embodiment of the president,\" a White House official told Axios. \"Susie is a deeply loyal person and the disrespect was made all the worse because it was disloyal.\"",
      "Waltz reportedly discussed different roles he could take on following his stint at the White House with Wiles, according to CBS News. Waltz was reportedly offered jobs, including the ambassador to Saudi Arabia, but ultimately settled on U.N. ambassador.",

      "NEXT STEPS",
      "With Waltz out as national security advisor, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will temporarily step into that role.",

      "While the exact timeline for a potential confirmation vote in the Senate is unclear, the first hurdle that Waltz must clear is a confirmation vote out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Although it is uncertain when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will schedule the nomination hearing for Waltz and the subsequent vote, the committee said his nomination is a \"priority.\"",

That means that Waltz could take a few months off, start the confirmation process in June or July and wrap up his confirmation by September at the latest, the source said.",
      "\"He's got plenty of time. So, this isn't a looming fight that's going to happen next week,\" the Florida GOP source said. \"This is going to play out probably in June or July, which by then, people are going to forget about the Signalgate stuff, or at the very, very least, they're going to forget about Mike Waltz's role in it.\"",
      "But there are a few Republican wildcards in the Senate who have voted against several of Trump\u2019s nominees, most prominently Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who voted against Hegseth, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer.",

      "Other Republicans who have opposed Trump nominees include Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, both of whom voted against Hegseth, as well as Sens. Ted Budd of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky, both of whom voted against Chavez-DeRemer.",
      "Aside from former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., whom Trump initially nominated to serve as attorney general, Trump\u2019s entire cabinet has been approved. Gaetz withdrew his nomination amid a House Ethics Committee investigation into sexual misconduct and drug-use allegations.",
      "Despite opposition from Democrats, and possibly a few Republicans, it appears unlikely that any fire that Waltz will face will sink his nomination.",
      "\"The reality of it is, the president can lose three votes in the Senate, and the vice president can still vote to break a tie,\" the Florida GOP source said. \"There's no way he's probably going to lose three votes.\"",
      "Meanwhile, other Republicans have openly stated they endorse Waltz\u2019s nomination, including Senate Foreign Relations Chairman John Risch, R-Idaho, who lauded Trump\u2019s decision to nominate Waltz for the role.",

      "\"Donald Trump has fired a lot of people,\" Vance said in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier Thursday. \"He doesn\u2019t give them Senate-confirmed appointments afterward.

      "HEGSETH ORDERS SWEEPING ARMY OVERHAUL AND CONSOLIDATION AIMED AT COUNTERING CHINA AND GOLDEN DOME CAPABILITIES",
      "\"We still have just over 100,000 Humvees,\" Alex Miller, the Army\u2019s Chief Technology Officer, told Fox News Digital, speaking about the now-obsolete legacy vehicle first introduced in the 1980s. (Reuters/Romeo Ranoco/File Photo)",
      "\"We\u2019re playing by the same post-Cold War rules that told us if you have a requirement, you\u2019re going to keep on buying it,\" Miller said. \"Because the requirements process and the acquisition process and the fielding process sort of never changed, we find ourselves in this conundrum where we still have just over 100,000 Humvees.\"",
      "Despite introducing newer vehicles like the JLTV \u2013 designed to replace the Humvee with better armor and mobility \u2013 Miller says the rapid pace of technological change and emerging threats have left even those newer systems at risk of becoming obsolete.",
      "\"Even though we continue to buy them and have them in the budget,\" he said, \"that might not be the right answer either.\"",
      "Miller laid out the Army's plans to solve a decades-long issue at the Pentagon, bringing new weapons systems from the proposal stage to the battlefront before technology renders them outdated \u2013 just as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a new memo directing an overhaul of the Army's acquisitions process.",
      "\"To build a leaner, more lethal force, the Army must transform at an accelerated pace by divesting outdated, redundant, and inefficient programs, as well as restructuring headquarters and acquisition systems,\" Hegseth wrote.",
      "NEW ARMY SECRETARY PRAISES TRUMP, HEGSETH FOR CREATING 'A LANE FOR CHANGE' AS HE ZEROES IN ON CUTTING WASTE",
      "\"Ukraine has not asked for a single Apache,\" he noted. \"Our Apaches are a great platform. It's amazing. But ... looking at more unmanned systems is probably the way to go\" (Getty Images)",
      "Fighting today\u2019s war with yesterday\u2019s tools",
      "Miller warned that some of the Army\u2019s marquee weapons platforms may not be suited for the battlefields of the future.",
      "\"Ukraine has not asked for a single Apache,\" he noted. \"Our Apaches are a great platform. It's amazing. But ... looking at more unmanned systems is probably the way to go.\"",
      "He also raised questions about the utility of legacy artillery platforms like the Paladin howitzer. Although artillery is dominating the war in Ukraine, the Army is stockpiling more Paladins largely to meet a \"minimum sustainment rate\" \u2014 not because commanders are asking for them.",
      "That kind of bureaucratic inertia, Miller suggested, is exactly what needs to be upended.",
      "In an effort to modernize more rapidly, the Army is now slashing red tape and rewriting regulations. Under a new initiative called\u00a0\"Transforming in Contact,\" Army leaders have sent requirement writers into the field to live and train alongside soldiers, gathering real-time feedback instead of drafting 300-page documents back in Washington.",
      "\"Rather than trying to define what types of things they need, how about we just listen to them for a change?\" Miller said. \"We started that last year \u2026 and that has been wildly successful.\"",
      "Units heading to the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Johnson, Louisiana next week will be equipped with some of the most advanced gear in the Army, including autonomous infantry vehicles built with Silicon Valley partners, advanced battery tech and hundreds of drones.",
      "\"All because our leadership just said, go do the right thing, rather than trying to check boxes,\" Miller said.",
      "The RQ-4 had an impressive payload capacity of 3,000 pounds and advanced reconnaissance capabilities - at an enormous cost. (Erik Hildebrandt/Northrop Grumman/Handout via Reuters.)",
      "Now, according to Miller, the requirements documentation for things like next-generation unmanned aerial vehicles has been whittled down from between 200 and 300 pages to 10.",
      "In other cases, modernization isn't always necessary, according to Abigail Blanco, defense expert and professor at the University of Tampa.",
      "Up until a few years ago when it was finally retired, one of the primary reconnaissance systems in the War on Terror was the RQ-4 Global Hawk.",
      "The RQ-4 had an impressive payload capacity of 3,000 pounds and advanced reconnaissance capabilities - at an enormous cost. Each one was originally slated to cost $20 million but wound up costing $220 million per unit.",
      "\"If you look at reports from the Air Force, they repeatedly stated that instead of the [RQ-4], they preferred the U-2 spy plane, which, to be clear, is a relic in military terms. It's from the Cold War period. And so it's not always clear that the modernization piece is desirable.\"",
      "A Battle Inside the Beltway",
      "Some lawmakers and defense officials initially resisted the Army\u2019s push to streamline systems.",
      "\"The OSD comptroller pushed back really hard. Some parts of the Hill pushed back really hard,\" Miller said. \"But we ran a really aggressive ground game.\u2026 We\u2019re not asking for more money. We\u2019re asking to spend taxpayer dollars better.\"",
      "The problem, according to Blanco, is Congress has long continued to budget for equipment way beyond its point of usefulness.",

      "\"If you are an elected representative and your district manufactures Humvees or tanks, you have a really strong vested interest in ensuring that that technology continues to be produced, regardless whether or not it's operationally necessary.\"",
      "In the end, Miller said, acquisition reform isn\u2019t about cutting corners \u2013 it\u2019s about keeping pace with an adversary who doesn\u2019t care about red tape.",
      "\"The environment, the threat, and the reality change so fast,\" he said. \"We have permission to just be ruthless about working with commercial entities ... and figuring out what can we get in the hands of soldiers faster.\""

      "If you\u2019re still weighing your options, here\u2019s how the two approaches stack up.",
      "Manual opt-outs demand a significant time investment, requiring you to personally navigate each data broker\u2019s unique removal process. While free, this approach offers variable coverage depending on how diligently you track down brokers, and consistency is challenging; you\u2019ll need to repeat the process regularly to keep your data private. Success also depends heavily on your ability to decipher vague opt-out instructions and adapt to each broker\u2019s requirements.",
      "In contrast, data removal services save time by handling the legwork for you. They provide broad coverage by targeting numerous brokers simultaneously and maintain consistency through ongoing monitoring. While these services come with subscription fees, they eliminate the need for personal expertise, offering a hands-off solution to data privacy.",
      "The bottom line: Why personal data removal services win the privacy battle",
      "After testing both manual opt-outs and automated services, using a personal data removal service emerges as the clear solution for reclaiming your data. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "If you\u2019ve got the time and patience, you can absolutely take the DIY route. But if you\u2019re looking for a way to protect your privacy without sinking hours into research, filling out forms and monitoring, a data removal service makes things a lot quicker and more convenient. For most people, this is likely the better option. Many states have privacy laws that give you the right to request that data brokers remove your personal information, but the system seems to be rigged to make exercising those rights unreasonably difficult.\u00a0While it shouldn\u2019t be necessary, data removal services offer a way to cheat that system.",

This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.

      "4.\u00a0Use strong and unique passwords: Use long, complex passphrases that are unique for each account.

      "5.

Be cautious of phishing attempts and verify the legitimacy of requests for personal information.",
      "6.

If they become aggressive and try to exploit you, tell them you will report them and hang up.",
      "2. Avoid unknown contact numbers:\u00a0Never call phone numbers that appear in pop-ups, unsolicited texts or emails. These numbers often belong to scammers trying to trick you into sharing personal information or making payments. Instead, always verify contact details through official websites or trusted sources before reaching out.",

This launch transitioned\u00a0Project Kuiper from prototype testing to full-scale deployment. Each satellite was equipped with state-of-the-art technology, including phased array antennas for high-speed data transmission, advanced processors, electric propulsion systems for orbit adjustments and optical inter-satellite links to enable seamless communication between satellites.",

While both systems share similarities, such as using low Earth orbit satellites for reduced latency, they differ in key aspects like satellite design, pricing and service goals.",
      "Starlink: With over 7,000 satellites already in orbit and plans for a constellation of up to 42,000, Starlink currently leads in deployment. Its satellites orbit at approximately 248 miles, allowing for lower latency but requiring more satellites for global coverage.",
      "Project Kuiper: Kuiper plans to deploy over 3,200 satellites orbiting at 311 miles. This higher altitude provides broader coverage per satellite but results in a 40% reduction in signal strength compared to Starlink due to increased distance. To compensate, Kuiper\u2019s satellites use larger antennas to maintain performance.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Cybercriminals always find new ways to scam you, whether it\u2019s mimicking a government agency, creating a fake website or delivering malware disguised as a software update. Just when you think you\u2019ve seen it all, they come up with a new trick.",
      "This time, the FBI has issued an alert: Hackers are using a \"time-traveling\" technique to bypass your device\u2019s security measures. No, we\u2019re not talking about actual time travel (though wouldn\u2019t that be something?). This is a sophisticated cyberattack where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to sneak past security defenses.",
      "Join The FREE \"CyberGuy Report\":\u00a0Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free\u00a0\"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"\u00a0when you sign up.",
      "A man working on his laptops (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "The concept of \"time-traveling hackers\" refers not to literal time travel but to a sophisticated cyberattack technique where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to bypass security measures. This attack is reportedly tied to the Medusa ransomware gang.",
      "In this type of attack, hackers exploit expired security certificates by altering the system date on a targeted device to a time when those certificates were still valid. For example, a security certificate that expired in, say, 2020 could be made usable again if the system's clock is set back to 2019. This allows malicious software signed with these outdated certificates to be recognized as legitimate by the system, effectively \"traveling back in time\" from a security perspective.",
      "This technique was notably used in the Medusa ransomware attacks, which targeted critical infrastructure and prompted an\u00a0FBI cybersecurity advisory (AA25-071A) earlier in 2025. The campaign has affected over 300 critical infrastructure targets. The attackers combined this method with social engineering and exploited unpatched vulnerabilities, amplifying the threat.",
      "The FBI has warned that such attacks pose a significant risk, as they can disable modern security protections like Windows Defender by tricking the system into accepting outdated drivers or software.",

      "DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVERS",
      "What does the FBI recommend?",
      "The FBI is urging organizations to take action quickly, warning that this technique can slip past traditional defenses by taking advantage of how systems trust old certificate data.",
      "To stay protected, they recommend turning on two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere, especially for important stuff like webmail and VPNs. It also helps to have strong endpoint protection and clear security policies and to keep an eye out for any weird changes to system settings, like the device clock suddenly jumping back in time.",
      "A man working on his laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "RELENTLESS HACKERS ABANDON WINDOWS TO TARGET YOUR APPLE ID",
      "5 ways to stay safe from Medusa malware",
      "1) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0A strong antivirus isn\u2019t just for catching old-school viruses anymore. It can detect phishing links, block malicious downloads and stop ransomware before it gets a foothold. Since the Medusa gang uses fake updates and social engineering to trick users, having strong antivirus software adds a critical layer of protection against threats you might not see coming. Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2)\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0The FBI specifically recommends\u00a0enabling 2FA across all services, especially for high-value targets like webmail accounts, VPNs and remote access tools. 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to break in, even if they\u2019ve managed to steal your username and password through phishing or other tactics.",
      "3)\u00a0Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Many ransomware groups, including Medusa, rely on reused or weak passwords to gain access. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don\u2019t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4) Monitor for suspicious system time changes:\u00a0The core of this \"time-traveling\" attack is clock manipulation: Hackers roll back a device\u2019s clock to a time when expired security certificates were still valid. This allows outdated and potentially malicious software to appear trustworthy. Be alert to unexpected system time changes, and if you're managing an organization, use tools that flag and log these types of configuration shifts.",
      "5) Keep systems updated and patch known vulnerabilities:\u00a0The Medusa ransomware campaign has a track record of exploiting unpatched systems. That means old software, outdated drivers and ignored security updates can all become entry points. Regularly\u00a0installing updates for your OS, applications and drivers is one of the most effective ways to stay protected. Don't put off those system notifications; they exist for a reason.",
      "CLICKFIX MALWARE TRICKS YOU INTO INFECTING YOUR OWN WINDOWS PC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Medusa attack is a good example of how cybercriminals are shifting tactics. Instead of relying on traditional methods like brute force or obvious exploits, they are targeting the basic logic that systems depend on to function. In this case, it is something as simple as the system clock. This kind of strategy challenges the way we think about security. It is not just about building stronger defenses but also about questioning the default assumptions built into the technology we use every day.",

      "Kurt Knutsson talks about a soft, vine-like robot called SPROUT that aids safe survivor rescues in collapsed buildings.",
      "When disaster strikes and buildings collapse, every second counts for emergency responders searching for survivors trapped beneath rubble. Traditional tools often fall short in these dangerous, chaotic environments, but a new breed of robot, SPROUT, is poised to make a life-saving difference.",

      "Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit (MIT Lincoln Laboratory) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is SPROUT?",
      "SPROUT, short for Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit, is a flexible, vine-like robot developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory in collaboration with the University of Notre Dame. Unlike rigid robots or static cameras, SPROUT can \"grow\" into tight, winding spaces that are otherwise inaccessible, giving first responders a new way to explore, map and assess collapsed structures.",

      "ELECTRIC SUV IS THE ULTIMATE LIFELINE FOR SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSIONS",
      "How does SPROUT work?",
      "SPROUT is made of an airtight fabric tube that inflates with air, allowing it to extend from a fixed base. As it grows, it can flex around corners and squeeze through narrow gaps, mimicking the movement of a plant vine. Operators control SPROUT using a joystick, steering it through debris while watching a live video feed from a camera mounted at the tip. This setup lets responders see and map hidden void spaces without entering dangerous areas themselves.",
      "Three pouch motors along the vine\u2019s length enable SPROUT to bend and turn, while an internal reel system allows the robot to be compactly stored and precisely deployed as needed. In addition to cameras, SPROUT can carry other sensors to image, map and even assess hazards within the collapsed structure.",

      "RESCUE DRONE HITS BEACHES DESIGNED TO SAVE LIVES AS A FLYING LIFEBUOY",
      "Why traditional tools fall short",
      "Traditional search-and-rescue gear, such as rigid robots or specialized cameras, struggles in disaster zones for several reasons. Cameras can only probe straight paths, often requiring teams to cut new access holes to see further into the rubble.",
      "Rigid robots are prone to damage in unstable, cramped environments and are expensive to repair. Manual probing is time-consuming and physically exhausting for responders.",
      "SPROUT\u2019s soft, flexible design directly addresses these challenges, offering a safer, faster and more adaptable solution for navigating the unpredictable landscape of collapsed buildings.",

      "Real-world testing and impact",
      "SPROUT has already been put through its paces at the Massachusetts Task Force 1 training site, where it demonstrated its ability to flex around corners and penetrate void spaces in engineered collapsed structures. These tests allowed the team to refine SPROUT\u2019s durability, portability and steering controls, with plans for larger field studies underway.",
      "The project is a true collaboration, pairing MIT\u2019s engineering expertise with Professor Margaret Coad\u2019s pioneering work on vine robots at Notre Dame. This partnership has accelerated SPROUT\u2019s development, bringing hands-on demonstrations to first responders, many of whom have limited research and development budgets.",

      "Looking ahead: The future of SPROUT",
      "The team behind SPROUT is continuously working to expand its capabilities. Current models can extend up to 10 feet, with future versions aiming to reach beyond 25 feet. Researchers are also exploring the use of multiple SPROUT robots to cover larger areas and expedite rescue operations in major disasters.",
      "Beyond disaster response, the technology could be adapted for inspecting military systems or critical infrastructure in hard-to-reach places, making SPROUT a versatile tool for a variety of high-stakes scenarios.",

      "A person doing a Google search\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson))",
      "What you need to know",
      "Blue Shield of California just admitted to a major data privacy slip that went on for almost three years, from April 2021 to January 2024. It was using Google Analytics to track how people used its member websites. This is totally normal since every business does it. But the tool was accidentally sharing sensitive info with Google Ads because it wasn\u2019t set up properly.",
      "What I find extremely shocking is that it took the company three years to realize it was sharing its user data with Google to run ads. This says a lot about how much these healthcare giants care about protecting your data.",
      "The shared data included a broad array of protected health information (PHI), including names, zip codes, gender, medical claim dates, online account numbers, insurance plan names, group numbers, family data and even search criteria used in its \"Find a Doctor\" feature.",
      "\"Google may have used this data to conduct focused ad campaigns back to those individual members. We want to reassure our members that no bad actor was involved, and, to our knowledge, Google has not used the information for any purpose other than these ads or shared the protected information with anyone,\"\u00a0the company\u00a0said in a notice on its website.",
      "This incident is not isolated. Over the past few years, healthcare and tech companies have come under scrutiny for similar missteps. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have already issued warnings about the use of tracking technologies in healthcare, especially those that might expose patient data to third parties without adequate transparency or safeguards.",
      "A Google spokesperson provided the following comment to CyberGuy when asked about the Blue Shield data breach:",
      "\"Businesses, not Google, manage the data they collect and must inform users about its collection and use. By default, any data sent to Google Analytics for measurement does not identify individuals, and we have strict policies against collecting private health information (PHI) or advertising based on sensitive information.\"",

      "Since the data was only shared with Google and not any other party, the overall risk is relatively low, apart from the clear privacy violation. It\u2019s highly unlikely that anyone else will gain access to it, so the chances of the data being misused are slim. Google says it doesn\u2019t allow ads to be served based on sensitive information like health, so there\u2019s a good chance your data wasn\u2019t even used for advertising.",
      "Blue Shield's case follows a string of similar breaches. Companies like GoodRx, BetterHelp and Kaiser have all faced regulatory and legal consequences for sharing sensitive user data with advertising vendors. Some even settled for millions of dollars. Despite the risks, many healthcare organizations have continued using these tools due to the lack of clear regulatory guardrails, a situation complicated further by a federal court ruling that blocked the Biden administration\u2019s attempts to curb the use of online trackers in healthcare settings.",

      "1. Limit what you share on health portals:\u00a0Avoid entering more personal details than absolutely necessary on insurance or provider websites. Tools like \"Find a Doctor\" might log your search terms, so keep inputs vague when possible.",
      "2. Use privacy-focused browsers:\u00a0Browsers like Brave or Firefox offer built-in privacy protections, such as blocking third-party trackers that could expose health-related browsing activity.",
      "3. Turn off ad personalization:\u00a0Visit\u00a0Google\u2019s Ad Settings and disable ad personalization. This won\u2019t stop tracking, but it can reduce how your data is used for targeting.",
      "4. Opt out of tracking where possible:\u00a0Many healthcare sites use cookies and tracking tools. Choose \"reject all\" or the strictest privacy settings in cookie banners. If a tracking opt-out tool is available, use it.",
      "5. Read privacy policies (yes, really):\u00a0Look for language like \"third-party sharing,\" \"advertising,\" or \"analytics.\" If a healthcare provider mentions tools like Google Analytics or Meta Pixel, that\u2019s a cue to proceed cautiously.",
      "6. Monitor your accounts and credit:\u00a0Keep an eye out for unusual insurance claims or medical charges. Set up credit alerts or monitoring services if your provider offers them, especially after a breach.",
      "7. Ask questions:\u00a0Call or email your healthcare provider or insurer. Ask what tracking tools they use and how they protect your data. The more consumers push for transparency, the more pressure there is to improve standards.",

      "Consider identity theft protection services:\u00a0If you\u2019re concerned about fraud or medical identity theft, you'll want to consider using identity theft protection services. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0To guard against malware or phishing attacks that could compromise access to your online health accounts, be sure to use strong antivirus software. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It baffles me how careless most companies are when it comes to protecting user data. Blue Shield \"mistakenly\" shared your data with Google, which then used it to show personalized ads. It took the company three years to realize this. While most cyber incidents involve an attacker, this breach didn\u2019t need one.

      "FIRST ON FOX: The United Nations\u2019 UN80 Task Force is examining multiple suggested methods for reorganizing the institution, according to a leaked, confidential document shared with Fox News Digital. The six-page paper cites multiple inefficiencies and areas of improvement needed to combat \"geopolitical shifts and substantial reductions in foreign aid budgets\" which are \"challenging the legitimacy and effectiveness of the organization.\"",
      "The effort is \"eight and a half years late,\" Hugh Dugan,\u00a0former National Security Council Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for International Organization Affairs, told Fox News Digital: \"If [Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio] Guterres really comprehends that the system needs a major overhaul, he should step down and facilitate an early U.N.

      "The UN80 Task Force document notes that \"overlapping mandates, inefficient use of resources, and inconsistent delivery of services\" are among the problems with proliferating agencies, funds and programs, and notes ways to integrate, consolidate, and coordinate among reformed entities to maximize the benefit for those who rely on the U.N.",
      "As another means of reducing outlays, the task force also recommended reducing the quantity of high-level posts, establishing single entities to coordinate Peace and Security, Humanitarian Affairs, and Human Rights, and \"reduc[ing] the number of U.N. development system entities.\"",
      "Dugan said the document \"looks more like a whiteboard stream of consciousness approach that you find on the first day of a business retreat.\" He said that it lacks mention of human resource improvements, finding ways of recruiting \"the very best in the world,\" or \"identifying performance measurements or metrics against the leaders of the organization, branches, [or] offices.\"",
      "Dugan said that the task force is also missing the important confidence-building measures needed to increase buy-in from members, to keep them \"impressed and enthusiastic\" about U.N. programs. \"They\u2019re assuming that they are the leaders that are the right people at the right time.\" Dugan said this is \"a real shortcoming.\"",

      "\"I don\u2019t think they have the confidence of the world community or the talents or the resources to hold out another year and a half under this regime of Secretary Guterres,\" Dugan said. Rather than utilize the \"Noah\u2019s Ark management mentality\" of attempting to \"weather the storm,\" Dugan said that the U.N. must \"get very creative very quickly with what they have at hand.\"",
      "Dugan noted that the U.N. has gone through a \"fall-off in relevance\" with its lack of involvement in \"real world dynamics between member states.\" He urged the organization to identify \"the multilateral collateral, meaning we\u2019ve got to identify what\u2019s good, and then we have to get rid of what\u2019s damaged after eight years.\"",

      "Dujarric pointed to a speech Guterres delivered in March when introducing the UN80 Initiative, in which he called for an \"ambitious reform agenda to strengthen how we work and deliver.\" Guterres said this involves increasing transparency and accountability, being more effective and cutting costs, and decentralizing decisions to serve those who rely on the U.N.",

      "For Dugan, Guterres\u2019 failure to attempt those \"sweeping\" reforms prior to 2025 is an indication that regime change is needed. He reiterated that \"the Secretary-General\u2019s \u2018Trust me\u2019 window dressing is no longer convincing us to pay full retail.\"",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge on Friday struck down President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie in a blistering opinion calling the president\u2019s efforts \u201can unprecedented attack\u201d on the U.S. judicial system.",
      "U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, issued a permanent injunction barring the enforcement of any part of Trump\u2019s order from March, which focused on the firm\u2019s representation of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and its work with billionaire donor George Soros.",
      "\u201cNo American President has ever before issued executive orders like the one at issue in this lawsuit targeting a prominent law firm with adverse actions to be executed by all Executive branch agencies but, in purpose and effect, this action draws from a playbook as old as Shakespeare, who penned the phrase: \u2018The first thing we do, let\u2019s kill all the lawyers,\u2019\u201d Howell wrote.",
      "\u201cThe importance of independent lawyers to ensuring the American judicial system\u2019s fair and impartial administration of justice has been recognized in this country since its founding era,\u201d Howell wrote, referencing John Adams\u2019 decision to represent eight British soldiers charged with murder in connection with the Boston Massacre.",
      "She said Trump\u2019s order \u201cviolates the Constitution and is thus null and void.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Perkins Coie said in a statement that the judge's ruling \"affirms core constitutional freedoms all Americans hold dear, including free speech, due process, and the right to select counsel without the fear of retribution.\"",
      "\"We are pleased with this decision and are immensely grateful to those who spoke up in support of our positions. As we move forward, we remain guided by the same commitments that first compelled us to bring this challenge: to protect our firm, safeguard the interests of our clients, and uphold the rule of law,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately provide a comment Friday night.",
      "Trump\u2019s executive order limited Perkins Coie employees\u2019 access to government buildings, revoked security clearances at the firm, and ordered the heads of all federal agencies to terminate contracts with the firm and refrain from hiring employees who worked there.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Howell had grilled Justice Department lawyer Richard Lawson at a hearing over the measure last week, and Lawson was unable to answer basic questions about the other firms that had reached deals with the White House to avoid their own executive orders.",
      "Howell also used a footnote in Friday\u2019s order to criticize firms that took deals with the White House, writing that \u201csome clients may harbor reservations about the implications of such deals for the vigorous and zealous representation to which they are entitled from ethically responsible counsel, since at least the publicized deal terms appear only to forestall, rather than eliminate, the threat of being targeted in an Executive Order.\u201d",
      "Trump has targeted numerous law firms via executive order, prompting some to strike deals with the White House that include committing millions of dollars in pro bono representation for clients and causes supported by the Trump administration and getting rid of internal DEI policies.",
      "Concessions by firms such as Paul Weiss and Skadden Arps have generated backlash within the legal community, including a protest letter signed by dozens of Skadden alumni who were outraged by the firm\u2019s deal with Trump.",
      "In Friday's order, Howell wrote that Trump\u2019s \u201cmulti-year history of lodging public attacks\u201d on Perkins Coie and \u201chis promises during the 2024 campaign to act on his displeasure\u201d toward the firm if he won further demonstrates that the executive order \u201cwas issued to seek retribution against plaintiff for the Firm\u2019s representation of clients in political campaigns or litigation, about which President Trump expressed disapproval, dating back to 2017.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis purpose amounts to no more than unconstitutional retaliation for plaintiff\u2019s First Amendment protected activity,\u201d she added."

The district court has now blocked these time-sensitive efforts for over a month, without any legal basis for doing so,\u201d he wrote.",

      "Since starting its work in January, DOGE has faced at least 11 lawsuits specifically targeting its efforts to access large swaths of Americans' personal information. Many of the lawsuits argue DOGE is violating the\u00a0Privacy Act of 1974, which heavily regulates what information about American citizens federal agencies can store and who can access that information.",
      "A federal judge in March blocked\u00a0DOGE\u00a0and its affiliates from accessing sensitive personal information from the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Personnel Management and the Department of Treasury.",
      "The administration's effort to secure DOGE greater access to sensitive information comes as polling suggests voters are concerned with how the Musk-led group has executed its work. A recent NBC News poll found 47% of voters hold a negative view of the effort, while 51% hold negative views about Musk specifically.",
      "Musk has announced plans to soon wind down his work at the White House to focus more on his businesses, telling reporters on Wednesday that he's confident DOGE's work will continue in his absence."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump released a budget proposal Friday calling for a mix of cuts to domestic programs involving public health, education and clean energy, while seeking to increase spending on the military when factoring in a one-time boost.",
      "The 40-page request was addressed to congressional leaders and accompanied by a letter from Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought addressed to Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.",
      "Overall, Vought said the proposal contains a 23% cut ($163 billion) in discretionary funding, and a 13% increase in military spending after including the $150 billion Republicans are eying in a separate bill.",
      "The White House budget comes as the Republican-led Congress is seeking to craft a massive bill for Trump\u2019s priorities of tax cuts, higher spending on immigration enforcement and the military, spending cuts in other parts of the federal government, and a debt limit increase. Vought mentioned the calls for border funding in the new budget blueprint.",
      "The budget sparked some unusual pushback from Republican defense hawks, including Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker, R-Miss., who accused the White House of using accounting tricks to make it look like the White House wants \u201ca trillion-dollar budget.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is requesting a budget of $892.6 billion, which is a cut in real terms,\u201d Wicker said in a statement, referring to the Pentagon spending level outside the one-time supplemental. \u201cThis budget would decrease President Trump\u2019s military options and his negotiating leverage. We face an Axis of Aggressors led by the Chinese Communist Party, who have already started a trade war rather than negotiate in good faith.\u201d",
      "White House budgets are usually symbolic and never become law as written. But they represent the president\u2019s vision for spending and tend to influence the debate on Capitol Hill. They also tend to be a vehicle for messaging on the White House\u2019s most popular priorities \u2014 and often propose difficult policy compromises or cuts that become the basis for political attacks from the opposition party.",
      "Trump\u2019s new proposals could affect the next round of government funding talks, with funding set to expire on Sept. 30 after passage of a six-month funding bill in early March. That legislation \u2014 unlike the party-line \"reconciliation\" bill \u2014 is subject to the 60-vote filibuster rule in the Senate, meaning it will need significant Democratic support to become law in the Republican-controlled Congress.",
      "Trump's budget proposes a variety of steep cuts to well-known government programs, including cutting the National Institutes of Health by $18 billion compared with 2025 levels, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) by $4 billion, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by $3.6 billion.",
      "The budget also calls for various cuts to clean energy funding, education funding, scientific research and international aid.",
      "And it proposes a funding boost for Trump priorities, including a $43.8 billion boost to the Department of Homeland Security, $113.3 billion for the Defense Department and $500 million for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"MAHA\" \u2014 \"make America healthy again\" \u2014 priorities like promoting nutrition and exercise.",
      "The Trump proposal is limited to \"discretionary\" spending and excludes proposals on \"mandatory\" spending, the major part of the U.S. budget that covers safety net programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Yet that's where difficult decisions on federal spending ultimately lie, with Medicaid proving to be a sticking point among Republicans as they consider their big bill on Trump's tax and spending priorities later this year.",
      "Trump's budget won praise from Republicans like House Speaker Mike Johnson, who called it \"a bold blueprint that reflects the values of hardworking Americans and the commitment to American strength and\u00a0prosperity.\"",
      "\"House Republicans stand ready to work alongside\u00a0President\u00a0Trump to implement a responsible budget that puts America first,\" he said.",
      "It was slammed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who vowed that Democrats will \"fight this heartless budget with everything we\u2019ve got.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump\u2019s days of pretending to be a populist are over. His policies are nothing short of an all out assault on hardworking Americans,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"As he guts healthcare, slashes education, and hollows out programs families rely on \u2014 he\u2019s bankrolling tax breaks for billionaires and big corporations. It\u2019s not just fiscally irresponsible, it\u2019s a betrayal of working people from a morally bankrupt president.\"",
      "Collins also responded in a Friday statement calling the request \u201csimply one step in the annual budget process\u201d and noting: \u201cUltimately, it is Congress that holds the power of the purse.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis request has come to Congress late, and key details still remain outstanding,\u201d Collins said, expressing \u201cserious objections\u201d to various provisions including cuts to programs like \u201cLIHEAP, TRIO [an Education Department program], and those that support biomedical research.\u201d"

She had previously testified that, weeks later, Weinstein raped her in a Tribeca hotel room.",

    "story": [
      "Video taken at a Minnesota public park this week shows a white woman apparently admitting she used a racist slur against a Black youth she accused of taking an item that belongs to her child.",
      "The man who recorded the video, Sharmake Omar, 30, said in an interview Friday that the 5-year-old child was called the N-word by the woman Monday.",
      "\"The Rochester Police Department is aware of the video that was posted on social media and has received multiple calls related to it,\" it said Friday. \"We are gathering information and actively looking into the matter.\"",
      "Omar said that when he saw the woman berating the child of Somali heritage, a background he shares, he intervened and she turned her apparent anger on him, using the slur repeatedly, which was captured on the video.",
      "In the video, verified by NBC News, the woman, apparently carrying her child away, answered, \"Yeah\" when asked if she called the youth the slur.",
      "\"He took my son's stuff,\" she said.",
      "Omar asks if \"digging\" through her child's belongings at the park, which is what the mother said the boy had done, would justify using the racist word against a child.",
      "The woman responded, \"If that's what he's going to act like,\" the video shows.",
      "On that video, and in Friday's interview, Omar said the child has autism spectrum disorder. He said that he knows the boy's parents, who he said are from Somalia, and that they were also supervising their three other children at the park.",
      "The parents, he said, have expressed support for prosecuting the woman, if possible.",
      "\u201cThat little boy ... was visibly upset by the incident,\u201d Omar said.",
      "Omar said that when he intervened, the woman, whom he had never met before, also told him he and his wife shouldn't have more children because they are a drain on the welfare system.",
      "Minnesota has a long history of supporting and resettling international refugees accepted by the United States.",
      "The office of Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, in 2023 estimated the number of people in the state who have Somali heritage at more than 86,000. On Thursday, Rochester's congressional delegation issued a joint statement commending Omar for \"standing up and protecting one of our youngest community members\" and condemning \"these vile acts of racism\" he has described.",
      "Also on Thursday, the NAACP Rochester Branch said in a statement that it \"stands in solidarity with the impacted child\" and called on police, the Rochester city attorney and the Olmsted County Attorney\u2019s Office to investigate and charge the woman in the video, suggesting her interaction with the boy may have been a hate crime.",
      "The Rochester Branch said the Monday incident was one of multiple recent examples of \"a disturbing increase in racially motivated acts\" in the city of more than 122,000, perhaps best known for being home of the Mayo Clinic and its world-renowned hospital and research.",
      "\"What happened at the park is yet another painful reminder that hate continues to exist,\" it said in its statement.",
      "Protesters are expected to gather Monday for a Protect Our Children: Arrest & Charge event organized by Rochester Action People's Community.",
      "Minnesota law defines one type of assault as an action taken with \"intent to cause fear.\" Separately, it states that a hate crime has taken place when someone is assaulted \"because of the victim\u2019s actual or perceived race,\" a misdemeanor.",
      "Attempts to contact the woman in the video, verify her name, and speak to a family member have so far been unsuccessful."

      "Asked twice by \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker whether it would be OK in the long term if there was a recession in the short term, the president said, \u201cLook, yeah, it\u2019s \u2014 everything\u2019s OK. What we are \u2014 I said, this is a transition period. I think we\u2019re going to do fantastically.\u201d",

      "U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, issued a permanent injunction barring the enforcement of any part of Trump\u2019s order from March, which focused on the firm\u2019s representation of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and its work with billionaire donor George Soros.",
      "\u201cNo American President has ever before issued executive orders like the one at issue in this lawsuit targeting a prominent law firm with adverse actions to be executed by all Executive branch agencies but, in purpose and effect, this action draws from a playbook as old as Shakespeare, who penned the phrase: \u2018The first thing we do, let\u2019s kill all the lawyers,\u2019\u201d Howell wrote.",
      "\u201cThe importance of independent lawyers to ensuring the American judicial system\u2019s fair and impartial administration of justice has been recognized in this country since its founding era,\u201d Howell wrote, referencing John Adams\u2019 decision to represent eight British soldiers charged with murder in connection with the Boston Massacre.",
      "She said Trump\u2019s order \u201cviolates the Constitution and is thus null and void.\u201d",

      "The Justice Department did not immediately provide a comment Friday night.",
      "Trump\u2019s executive order limited Perkins Coie employees\u2019 access to government buildings, revoked security clearances at the firm, and ordered the heads of all federal agencies to terminate contracts with the firm and refrain from hiring employees who worked there.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Howell had grilled Justice Department lawyer Richard Lawson at a hearing over the measure last week, and Lawson was unable to answer basic questions about the other firms that had reached deals with the White House to avoid their own executive orders.",
      "Howell also used a footnote in Friday\u2019s order to criticize firms that took deals with the White House, writing that \u201csome clients may harbor reservations about the implications of such deals for the vigorous and zealous representation to which they are entitled from ethically responsible counsel, since at least the publicized deal terms appear only to forestall, rather than eliminate, the threat of being targeted in an Executive Order.\u201d",
      "Trump has targeted numerous law firms via executive order, prompting some to strike deals with the White House that include committing millions of dollars in pro bono representation for clients and causes supported by the Trump administration and getting rid of internal DEI policies.",
      "Concessions by firms such as Paul Weiss and Skadden Arps have generated backlash within the legal community, including a protest letter signed by dozens of Skadden alumni who were outraged by the firm\u2019s deal with Trump.",

      "\u201cThis purpose amounts to no more than unconstitutional retaliation for plaintiff\u2019s First Amendment protected activity,\u201d she added."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Secretary of state is a big job. But try piling on top of that acting administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, acting head of the National Archives and Records Administration and acting national security adviser.",
      "That\u2019s Marco Rubio\u2019s resume right now, and it might be that way for a while.",
      "Rubio gained his latest title after President Donald Trump announced that Michael Waltz \u2014 who has been under scrutiny since his central role in the Signal chat leak \u2014 would be stepping down and instead be nominated for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.",
      "The White House raised the possibility of Rubio taking over Waltz\u2019s job more than a month ago, according to a senior administration official. But it was tabled until recently, when Trump decided he\u2019d had enough of Waltz.",
      "There is a very real possibility that Trump keeps Rubio in the national security adviser role for the long term, according to three people familiar with the matter, including two administration officials. Trump appears to be in no hurry to find a replacement.",
      "\u201cThe president has assembled an incredibly talented team that is fully committed to putting America and Americans first,\u201d a senior State Department official said in a statement. \u201cSecretary Rubio looks forward to serving as his interim National Security Advisor while ensuring the mission critical work at the State Department continues uninterrupted.\u201d",
      "Two of the sources said Waltz\u2019s departure had been simmering for weeks after The Atlantic reported on March 24 that he created a group chat with top administration officials on the private messaging app Signal and inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of the magazine. But, one of the sources added, there was no appetite for immediately handing critics a victory by firing Waltz \u2014 leading to the decision to send him to the United Nations instead.",
      "The senior administration official said the move was partly a lesson Trump learned from his first term: firing officials so they exit creates potential enemies who know a lot about the inner workings of the White House and how the president has operated. But moving them to a different job keeps them close.",
      "Another senior administration official disputed this assessment, saying, \u201cThat was not part of the calculus at all.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s widely expected that Waltz will get confirmed by the Senate if Trump does follow through and nominate him to be ambassador.",
      "Several names have been mentioned as possible candidates to be the next national security adviser, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke with NBC News. They include Michael Anton, the policy planning director at the State Department; Chris Landau, deputy secretary of state; and Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and one of the administration\u2019s most influential voices on policy.",
      "Miller did not return a request for comment Friday.",
      "There\u2019s also a question about who will serve as deputy national security adviser \u2014 a role that could have outsize importance if Rubio continues to hold multiple jobs.",
      "Alex Wong, who was Waltz\u2019s deputy, remains at the National Security Council for now, both to help with the transition and to make sure Trump\u2019s upcoming foreign trip to the Middle East goes smoothly, according to two senior administration officials. Much of the planning for a trip \u2014 which will be Trump\u2019s first major foreign trip in his second term, aside from attending the pope\u2019s funeral \u2014 is done by the council.",
      "Rubio is the first person since Henry Kissinger to hold the role of secretary of state and national security adviser at the same time."

      "According to initial measurements released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday, the U.S. economy shrank by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, a reduction largely driven by a fall in exports and a boost in imports ahead of Trump\u2019s expected tariffs.",
      "On Wednesday, while meeting with members of his Cabinet, Trump deflected blame for the first-quarter gross domestic product numbers, saying they were a result of the economy former President Joe Biden left behind.",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s not Trump,\u201d he added Wednesday. \u201cBecause we came in on January, these are quarterly numbers, and we came in and I was very against everything that Biden was doing in terms of the economy, destroying our country in so many ways.\u201d",
      "Since the start of his administration in January, Trump has sought to impose tariffs on America\u2019s largest trading partners, including Canada, Mexico and China.",
      "Early last month, the president paused the introduction of larger tariffs on most countries for 90 days, just days after imposing them. His partial retreat fueled a rally in markets, which as of Friday recovered the losses they suffered after his initial tariff announcement on April 2.",
      "At the same time, Trump slapped even more tariffs on China, raising the tariff rate on the Asian nation to 145%.",
      "Still, the president has repeatedly dismissed concerns that the tariffs on China will have major effects on the prices or availability of consumer goods in the U.S.",
      "During the Cabinet meeting, he told reporters, \u201cSomebody said, \u2018Oh, the shelves are going to be open.\u2019 Well,\u00a0maybe the children will have two\u00a0dolls\u00a0instead of 30\u00a0dolls, you know?

      "Since starting its work in January, DOGE has faced at least 11 lawsuits specifically targeting its efforts to access large swaths of Americans' personal information.

      "In the wake of the administration\u2019s action, the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and American Meteorological Society (AMS) announced Friday that they would develop a special collection of research focused on climate, according to a news release from both organizations.",

      "While the National Climate Assessment is the product of hundreds of researchers who volunteer their time, the report has been organized by staffers at USGCRP. In April, the White House ended funding for that organization.",

That celebration will\u00a0potentially\u00a0bring\u00a0tanks and hundreds of other military vehicles and aircraft onto and over the streets of the nation\u2019s capital in June, according to three defense officials familiar with the planning.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, the president sought to have a big military parade, but the plans were shelved over cost and concerns that some of the military vehicles, particularly tracked vehicles like tanks, could significantly damage the streets of Washington, D.C. and incur a huge price tag for repairs. The estimate for the parade\u00a0being planned now\u00a0is \u201ctens of millions of dollars,\u201d according to two of the defense officials.",
      "Trump didn\u2019t forget and now is considering a military parade to honor both birthdays. Current plans call for more than 150 military vehicles and 50 aircraft to rumble through a parade route through Washington on June 10, the three defense officials said. That could include Army wheeled vehicles, like Humvees and trucks, and so-called tracked vehicles, like tanks, two of the officials said.",
      "The aircraft will include CH-47 Chinook helicopters and UH 60 Black Hawk helicopters, two of the officials said. And the famed Golden Knights are expected to jump from above, land near the viewing stands, and deliver a flag to the VIPs, most likely\u00a0Trump, two of the officials said.",
      "The Army is celebrating its 250th birthday with a number of events, including a fireworks display, a festival and a parade, Army spokesman Steve Warren said in a statement. \"Parade planning is actively underway, and we anticipate approximately 150 vehicles, 50 aircraft, and 6,600 Soldiers to highlight the Army\u2019s 250 years of service to the nation,\" Warren said.",
      "The plan for the tanks is not yet final. One option under consideration is to put the tanks on trailers, which would mitigate some of the damage to the streets, but that could also impact the aesthetics of the parade, officials said. They also plan to have a separate staging area for the heavy vehicles so they do not have to cross any of D.C.\u2019s bridges, two of the officials said.",
      "The vehicles would roll down the streets of Washington in columns,\u00a0the officials said,\u00a0in a way that some critics of the planned parade in his first term compared to what is more typically seen\u00a0in places like North Korea and Russia. For now, the plan is to have Bradley Fighting Vehicles, Stryker Armored Fighting Vehicles, the Army\u2019s new Infantry Squad Vehicles and more, the officials said. All the Army vehicles would be drawn from the Army\u2019s 10 divisions, brought in mostly via train from bases like Fort Bliss, Texas to Fort Drum, New York.",
      "Each division will dedicate between 200 and 400 people to the parade, the officials said. Under the current plan, some of the troops would sleep in government buildings, including the Department of Agriculture and U.S. General Services Administration buildings, according to two of the defense officials.",
      "Asked about the parade last month, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser confirmed that planning was in the early stages and that the Trump administration had reached out about it, but said she had not been directly involved yet.",
      "The parade theme will include U.S. wars throughout the Army\u2019s history and include soldiers marching in period uniforms, the officials explained.",
      "The plans are still evolving but the current early estimate is the parade and static displays in D.C. will cost as much as $45 million, according to two of the defense officials, who said that could\u00a0change\u00a0as planning continues. The final estimates from inside the Army are not yet complete as plans for the parade have not yet been fully approved by the White House and the Army, two of the officials said.",
      "Individual Army units will bear the ultimate cost of the parade, three of the officials said. In some cases, units would have to spend more than $1 million to participate.\u00a0That could impact\u00a0funds used for\u00a0training, officials said. \u201cCould the parade potentially impact training? Absolutely,\u201d said one of the defense officials. \u201cWill it impact training? That\u2019s unclear.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Freida McFadden is the master of nail-biting thrillers \u2014 and we have a preview of her next one. \u201cThe Intruder\u201d begins on a dark and stormy night, like so many eerie tales.",
      "\u201c\u2018The Intruder\u2019\u00a0is about a woman trapped in her remote cabin by a terrible storm, and she invites in a pre-teen girl who she finds squatting in her tool shed.\u00a0But as the night goes on, she discovers that the girl might be even more dangerous than the storm raging outside,\u201d McFadden tells TODAY.com in an interview over email.",
      "While she\u2019s a bestselling author many times over, writing is actually McFadden\u2019s side hustle. By day, she\u2019s a doctor specializing in brain injuries. In fact, Freida McFadden is her pen name.",
      "In her books, like \u201cThe Boyfriend\u201d and \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d twists come fast (and unexpectedly). Where does she come up with those plot lines?",
      "\u201cI am always tempted to answer, \u2018my brain\u2019!\u00a0I definitely have a very analytic brain,\u201d she says.\u00a0\u201cWhen I was a teenager, I was on the math team and solving puzzles was very fun for me.",
      "\u201cBut it does seem like readers expect more in a twist these days because everything has already been done.\u00a0You have to step out of the box of: \u2018The suspects were A, B, C, D, and A is the killer.\u2019\u00a0It\u2019s not even enough to say E is the killer,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt has to be E is the killer because he is actually B and was the victim\u2019s mother and his daughter, and also was dead the whole time.\u201d",
      "She notes that it can be frustrating to have a \u201cgreat idea\u201d but still be missing the \u201cgreat twist\u201d \u2014 \u201cyet it\u2019s always exciting and satisfying when I do come up with it.\u201d",
      "Her novels tend to show women using their smarts to outrun dangerous situations and people. This time around, the inspiration for Ella, one of the main characters of \u201cThe Intruder,\u201d was close to home.",
      "\u201cOne of my biggest inspirations for this book was my own daughter, who is about the same age as Ella, and in my opinion, just as much of a badass,\u201d she says.",
      "Below, read a preview of her upcoming novel, set to publish in October 2025.",
      "Read an excerpt of 'The Intruder'",
      "There is at least a 50% chance that in the next 24 hours, the roof of the cabin I\u2019m renting will collapse and kill me.",
      "It\u2019s an apt metaphor for the rest of my life.",
      "There\u2019s not much I can do much about my shattered life, but the roof issue is more surmountable. I have been calling my landlord, Rudy, for the last month to try and fix it. Every day, I find a few new shingles on the ground next to the cabin, and one day, I\u2019m fairly sure I\u2019ll sit on my living room sofa and look straight up to see the moon.",
      "And then a few days ago, my calls became more urgent. There\u2019s a storm coming, and if this roof doesn\u2019t get fixed ASAP, I could die. So I told Rudy he needed to get his butt over here \u2014 now. I wasn\u2019t nice, but I said what I had to say.",
      "Now, a dozen messages later, Rudy is finally here in the flesh.",
      "As we stand together just outside the cabin, Rudy squints up at my roof with his droopy blue eyes. He\u2019s a scrawny man in his late 50s who looks like he only eats one or two nonliquid meals per day. He scratches the gray stubble on his chin and adjusts the worn gray baseball cap he always wears. As usual, he reeks of cigarette smoke. The stench of it was overpowering when I first moved into the cabin, and it took me a week to get it aired out. It still clings to some of the furniture months later.",
      "\u201cLooks OK to me, Casey,\u201d he says.",
      "My fists clench in barely restrained rage. \u201cHow? How does it look OK? There are shingles all over the ground!\u201d",
      "I in fact gathered the flat rectangular shingles into a little pile that I now gesture toward angrily. I don\u2019t entirely understand how a roof is constructed, but I know those things are needed to keep it together. The fact that they are falling off does not bode well for my roof.",
      "At least this is just a rainstorm. Once it snows in a month or so? Forget it. I\u2019m going to wake up one morning in a snowdrift.",
      "I wish I could afford a decent isolated shack in the woods.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not safe,\u201d I insist.",
      "\u201cYou worry too much.\u201d Rudy grabs a pack of cigarettes out of his back pocket, and before I can ask him not to, he lights one up and takes a deep drag. I\u2019ve never known him to go more than two minutes without a smoke. \u201cYou need to learn to relax a little, Casey.\u201d",
      "You need to learn to relax a little. That was my goal when I moved out to this cabin in The Middle of Nowhere, New Hampshire. I wanted peace and quiet, which is exactly what I got. Even with all the chirping birds and crickets and woodpeckers, it\u2019s so quiet that I\u2019ve got no distractions from thinking about the complete mess I made of my life.",
      "I came out here after I lost my teaching job. I had this idea about living off the grid for a little while, but then I discovered what living \u201coff the grid\u201d actually meant. As much as I enjoy roughing it a bit, I very much did not want to build my own septic system. So here I am, not living off the grid \u2014 I have electricity, running hot and cold water, and a working landline telephone \u2014 but I do not have a television, and I look back with disdain on the days when my smartphone was glued to my right hand. I sold the phone before I came out here.",
      "Living off the grid is great. As long as you can still use the toilet. Oh, and you definitely need a roof.",
      "I grit my teeth. \u201cI want my roof fixed, Rudy.\u201d",
      "I wish I were anywhere else but here. I especially wish I were back in Boston, in front of my classroom. I miss my students. I would have done anything for those kids.",
      "Except that\u2019s what got me into trouble.",
      "\u201cJust hold your horses, little lady,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t fix the roof now. That storm is coming.\u201d",
      "I clench my fists. I know there\u2019s a thunderstorm coming tonight. There will be buckets of rain and winds strong enough that I\u2019ll likely lose power. I\u2019ve mentioned it in every single one of my increasingly urgent phone calls to Rudy.",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d I say in a clipped tone. \u201cThat\u2019s why I want you to fix it.\u201d",
      "\u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t got my tools,\u201d he points out. \u201cOr a ladder.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhy the hell not? I told you my roof needed to be fixed.\u201d",
      "\u201cI had to check it out first, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Rudy takes another drag from his cigarette. \u201cI\u2019ll fix it when the storm is over, okay? Next week.\u201d",
      "He doesn\u2019t give me a specific day or time, which is par for the course. Undoubtedly, he\u2019ll call me with an hour\u2019s notice, and if I happen to be out, then my roof just won\u2019t get fixed that day. I\u2019ll have to annoy him as much as I can to make sure this gets done.",
      "\u201cAnd one other thing\u2026\u201d I add.",
      "Rudy grunts impatiently. \u201cThere\u2019s more?\u201d",
      "I shoot him a look. On a scale of one to 10, Rudy gets a two on the landlord scale. Not only does he never answer my messages, but he refuses to believe there\u2019s a problem with anything. When the refrigerator randomly stopped working a few months ago, his response was, Well, it was working when you moved in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m worried about that tree,\u201d I tell him.",
      "Rudy cocks his head in the direction I\u2019m pointing, at the tree on the edge of my property. I don\u2019t know what kind of tree it is, but the trunk is wider than three of me, and it towers over the cabin.",
      "\u201cAnd why are you worried about the tree?\u201d he asks me in a patronizing voice.",
      "I stomp over to the culprit in my waterproof boots and press my palm against its bark. In response to the pressure, the tree groans threateningly and shifts over about two inches.",
      "Rudy frowns. \u201cSo?\u201d",
      "\u201cSo trees aren\u2019t supposed to move like that.\u201d",
      "\u201cSometimes they do.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo, Rudy. They are inanimate.\u201d",
      "He takes a long drag from his cigarette, then blows out a giant cloud of smoke. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll call a landscaper. Happy?\u201d",
      "No. I\u2019ll be happy when the tree is gone. I\u2019ve been worried about it for the last month, and now that a storm is coming, I\u2019m really worried.",
      "I look up at the roof of my house. It will probably hold. And the tree probably won\u2019t fall down. I probably won\u2019t die tonight.",
      "And if I do, the good news is that nobody will miss me."

      "Singer Jill Sobule, best known for her 1995 hit \u201cI Kissed a Girl,\u201d died May 1 in a Minnesota house fire, her publicist confirmed to NBC News. She was 66.",
      "The blaze happened in Woodbury, which is located about 15 miles outside of Minneapolis.",
      "Sobule\u2019s 1990 debut album, \u201cThings Here Are Different,\u201d spawned the single \u201cToo Cool to Fall in Love,\u201d which reached No. 17 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.",
      "Her biggest mainstream success came five years later with \u201cI Kissed a Girl,\u201d which reached the top 20 on Billboard\u2019s Modern Rock chart (now known as the Alternative Airplay chart), the first openly queer-themed track to do so. The song was accompanied by a video featuring Fabio. Sobule\u2019s \u201cI Kissed a Girl\u201d was a different song altogether from Katy Perry\u2019s smash 2008 song of the same name.",
      "Sobule once made sarcastic comments about Perry\u2019s song, which some Perry fans took seriously and lashed out at Sobule because of it.",
      "\u201cI may be a touch cynical about the business, but I have never really been angry or had ill feelings towards Katy herself,\u201d Sobule wrote in response to the backlash in a post for The Huffington Post in 2009. \u201cI was actually in a small way happy to not be the \u2018Kissed a Girl\u2019 girl anymore. That said, I hope her and her fans (god knows I don\u2019t want to piss them off anymore) are okay with the title of my brand new song, \u201c I Kissed a Girl ...First.\u2019 Wink.\u201d",
      "Sobule\u2019s song \u201cSupermodel\u201d also appeared on the soundtrack for Alicia Silverstone\u2019s hit 1995 movie, \u201cClueless.\u201d",
      "Most recently, Sobule, who was also an early proponent of crowdfunding, created \u201cF--- 7th Grade,\u201d an autobiographical coming-of-age off-Broadway musical that was a New York Times Critic\u2019s pick that debuted in 2022. The production earned a Drama Desk nomination for outstanding musical.",
      "\u201cJill Sobule was a force of nature and human rights advocate whose music is woven into our culture. I was having so much fun working with her. I lost a client & a friend today. I hope her music, memory, & legacy continue to live on and inspire others,\u201d her manager, John Porter, said in a statement.",
      "Sobule had been scheduled to perform May 2 in Denver at Swallow Hill. That site will now be host to a gathering in her honor.",
      "Sobule is survived by her brother and sister-in-law, James and Mary Ellen Sobule, as well as nephews, Ian Matthew and Robert and Robert\u2019s wife, Irina."

      "The theme for this year is \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,\u201d which celebrates the concept of Black dandyism.",
      "In a press release, the Met said the theme was inspired by Barnard College chair and professor Monica L. Miller\u2019s 2009 book called \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity.\u201d",
      "The museum also said the dress code, \u201cTailored For You,\u201d is \u201ca nod to the exhibition\u2019s focus on suiting and menswear.\u201d",

      "Since then, it's been a tradition, enough so that a documentary about the Met Gala was entitled \"The First Monday in May.\" This means next year's Met Gala will be on May 4, May 3 in 2027 and May 1 in 2028.",
      "Though the Met Gala is not always in May. In 2021, the celebration was moved to September due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

      "Lively starred and produced \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d while Baldoni directed and co-starred. The film premiered in August 2024, yet before its release, people began speculating that there was tension between the cast.",
      "By December 2024, Lively filed a sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni, with her attorneys stating that, in multiple incidents, Baldoni harassed Lively on set and crossed boundaries during intimate scenes, according to an administrative complaint filed Dec. 20, 2024 and obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "Attorneys for Baldoni denied the accusations at the time.",
      "On Dec. 31, Baldoni sued the New York Times for libel, seeking $250 million in damages, over the newspaper's coverage of Lively's accusations of sexual harassment and being the target of a smear campaign.",
      "Also on Dec. 31, Lively filed a\u00a0lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath, Baldoni\u2019s publicist Jennifer Abel, crisis publicist Melissa Nathan and others connected to Baldoni and \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d in which her legal team argued she had been a victim of\u00a0sexual harassment and a smear campaign, according to court documents obtained by NBC News.",
      "In response, in January 2025, Baldoni sued Lively, accusing her, her husband Ryan Reynolds, publicist Leslie Sloane and Sloane\u2019s PR firm of\u00a0defamation\u00a0and\u00a0other contractual claims.",
      "In a statement to NBC News in Jan. 16, 2025, Lively\u2019s legal team said the lawsuit was \u201canother chapter in the abuser playbook,\u201d denying the allegations.",
      "Baldoni and his team would go on to create a website about the lawsuit against Lively, filled with their complaint and alleged emails and texts from those involved in the creation of \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d Lively's",
      "By February, the judge overseeing their trial didn't restrict what their attorneys could say publicly but he did issue a warning about public comments, according to NBC News. Later that month, Lively amended her original complaint, alleging that other women had complained about Baldoni's misconduct, as well as added a new claim for defamation.",
      "Attorneys for Baldoni did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News about Lively\u2019s amended complaint at the time."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 After losing a legal battle over his lack of publicly funded security, Prince Harry on Friday expressed a desire to rebuild his strained relationship with the Royal Family.",
      "\u201cI would love\u00a0reconciliation\u00a0with my family. ... There\u2019s no point in continuing to fight people,\u201d Harry told the BBC. \u201cIt would be nice to have that\u00a0reconciliation\u00a0part now. If they don\u2019t want that, that\u2019s entirely up to them.\u201d",
      "Harry's interview with the BBC came after he lost his appeal against the U.K. government\u2019s decision to axe his publicly funded security detail, an issue that he says has driven a wedge between him and his father.",
      "\u201cHe won\u2019t speak to me because of this security stuff,\u201d Harry said, adding that he didn\u2019t know how long his father had left to live. King Charles III, from whom Harry says he is currently cut off, was diagnosed with cancer last year.",
      "And without security, Harry said, \u201cI can\u2019t see a world in which I would bring my wife and children back to the U.K. at this point.\u201d",
      "Charles' second son\u2019s protection was downgraded in February 2020 when he stepped down as a full-time member of the royal family and moved to the United States with his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. That meant the British state provided security on a case-by-case basis.",
      "Harry, who is the fifth in line to the throne, had argued that the body responsible for protecting the Royal Family was not following its own rules, that all high-profile members of the Royal Family, like the king and his brother Prince William, have around-the-clock protection.",
      "The Royal and VIP Executive Committee, known as Ravec, made the decision on his security arrangements after he and Meghan stepped down from being a working member of the Royal Family in 2020. Currently, his security in the U.K. is decided on a case-by-case basis, the same way as the country\u2019s other high-profile visitors.",
      "After the ruling Friday, a spokesperson from Buckingham Palace said \u201cAll of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.\u201d",
      "In their ruling Friday, judges Lord Justice David Bean, Lord Justice Andrew Edis and Sir Geoffrey Vos dismissed his appeal.",
      "Harry \u201cwas in effect stepping in and out of the cohort of protection provided by Ravec,\u201d Sir Geoffrey Vos told the court.",
      "\u201cOutside the U.K. he was outside the cohort, but when in the U.K. his security would be considered as appropriate depending on the circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was imposssible, I said in my judgement to say that this reasoning was illogical or innappropriate. Indeed it seemed sensible,\u201d he added.",
      "In an earlier written submission to the court, his legal team said that Harry \u201cinherited a security risk at birth, for life.\u201d It added that he \u201cserved two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats.\u201d",
      "Harry and his wife felt \u201cforced to step back\u201d from their roles \u201cas they considered they were not being protected by the institution,\u201d it said.",
      "Harry has said he and his family were under particular threat because of the abuse his wife receives from some sections of the public and the media, which he has said are racially motivated.",
      "Rejecting his challenge in February 2024, Britain\u2019s High Court said the decision to change Harry\u2019s security status was neither irrational nor procedurally unfair. Two months later he lost the right to appeal the ruling, although that was later overturned.",
      "Harry failed to persuade a different judge last year that he should be able to privately pay for London\u2019s Metropolitan Police force to guard him while he is in the U.K. after a government lawyer argued that officers shouldn\u2019t be used as \u201cprivate bodyguards for the wealthy.\u201d",
      "Harry has been a regular in British courts in recent years, challenging both his security arrangements and tabloid newspaper publishers for allegedly hacking phones and using private investigators to snoop on his life for news stories.",
      "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s company, News Group Newspapers, agreed to pay \u201csubstantial damages\u201d to Harry after settling a long-running legal battle. NGN admitted that between 1996 and 2011, staff on The Sun newspapers used unlawful methods to dig up private information about Harry and his late mother, Princess Diana.",
      "The duke is also among a group of celebrities suing another publisher, Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), which prints the Daily Mail, accusing it of lawbreaking in its attempts to gather information on them. The trial is due to start next year.",
      "In 2023, he dropped a libel case against ANL for its coverage of his legal battle over personal security. And the same year, he was awarded 140,600 pounds ($179,350) after successfully bringing a phone-hacking claim against Mirror Group Newspapers."

      "Brand was accused of rape, sexual assault and emotional abuse by four women.\u00a0One of them said she was 16 (the age of consent in the U.K.) and Brand was 30 when they began a relationship that included abuse and sexual assault.",
      "Born in Essex, Brand rose to fame in British television in the early 2000s, including a stint as a broadcaster on the BBC, from which he resigned in 2008 after he and his co-presenter made prank calls to British actor Andrew Sachs, which resulted in more than 42,000 complaints.",
      "He later moved to Hollywood and starred in numerous films, including \u201cForgetting Sarah Marshall\u201d in 2008 and \u201cGet Him to the Greek\u201d in 2010.",
      "He married\u00a0pop star Katy Perry in 2010, but the couple divorced 14 months later. In 2017, he married Laura Gallacher, with whom he has three children. Last year, he said he had become a Christian.",
      "Brand, who has since faded from mainstream culture, is an outspoken critic of American politics and free speech and regularly posts his views on his YouTube channel.",
      "\u201cThese allegations pertain to the time when I was working in the mainstream, when I was in the newspapers all the time, when I was in the movies,\u201d he said in another video on X posted in September 2023. \u201cAnd as I\u2019ve written about extensively in my books, I was very, very promiscuous,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe relationships I had were very absolutely, always consensual,\u201d he added, before suggesting that the mainstream media may have an agenda against him."

      "Since Assad was ousted in December, Israel has seized ground in the southwest, vowed to protect the Druze, lobbied Washington to keep the neighboring state weak, and has blown up much of the Syrian army\u2019s heavy weapons in the days after he was toppled.",
      "Sharaa, who was an Al Qaeda commander before renouncing ties to the group in 2016, has repeatedly vowed to govern Syria in an inclusive way. But incidents of sectarian violence, including the\u00a0killing of hundreds of Alawites in March, have hardened fears among minority groups about the now dominant Islamists.",

    "story": [
      "Before this week's federal election in Canada, Derek Ouellette and his wife, Yecenia Ouellette, could never have imagined voting for anyone but a Conservative.",
      "\u201cWe were both raised Conservative and we both kind of thought, Conservative is just what you do,\u201d Derek Ouellette, a 46-year-old insurance broker from Belle River, near Windsor, Ontario, said in a phone interview late Tuesday.",
      "But Ouellette said he was proud to have done the once unthinkable, voting for Liberal leader and Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is projected to have secured a minority victory in this week's poll.",
      "Across social media, a number of once-dedicated Conservatives said that they would be casting their ballots for the Liberal Party this week for the first time in their lives. Many described their vote as a rejection of \"Canada's Trump\" \u2014 Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre \u2014 and his aggressive campaign, which experts say appeared to pull from the playbook of President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cThere were some elements of his campaign that echoed Trump,\u201d Roland Paris, director of the University of Ottawa\u2019s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, said Wednesday.",
      "That included talking \u201cabout eliminating wokeism\u201d and \u201creferring to his political opponents with nasty nicknames,\u201d Paris added. \u201cNone of these features of his campaign helped him once Trump came to be seen by many Canadians as an enemy of Canada.\u201d",
      "Just weeks ago, the pugnacious approach of Poilievre, who had previously allied himself with the so-called Freedom Convoy that protested vaccine mandates for truck drivers, appeared to be working.",
      "His campaign, during which he focused on small-government and libertarian issues, combined with dissatisfaction at the scandal-hit Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's handling of the economy to see the Conservatives move 24 points ahead of the Liberals in January, according to a poll tracker run by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.",
      "But within a matter of weeks, everything changed: Trudeau announced his resignation Jan. 6, while Trump swept back to power in the U.S., threatening to use economic pressure to annex Canada as the \u201c51st state,\u201d before imposing sweeping 25% tariffs on goods from America\u2019s northern neighbor and sparking outrage across the country.",
      "Trump's bellicose remarks gave a huge boost to Canadian nationalism, with many vowing to boycott the U.S. and its products.",
      "As anti-Trump sentiment grew across Canada, Poilievre's own bullish rhetoric rapidly lost its sheen for many Canadian Conservatives.",
      "When Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, was named Canada\u2019s interim prime minister and the Liberal candidate for the 2025 election, distaste for Trudeau and worries about the Liberals' ability to handle the economy quickly evaporated.",
      "When it did, a new way forward emerged for those who had felt politically homeless.",
      "Poilievre, now the former leader of the opposition, even lost the parliamentary seat he had held for two decades to a Liberal neophyte Monday.",
      "'Maple MAGA'",
      "\u201cListening to Poilievre speak, it\u2019s like talking points from Trump,\u201d Ouellette said. \u201cIt just reeks of what\u2019s happening south of the border.\u201d",
      "By comparison, he added, Carney \u201chas shown himself to be very decisive in dealing with Trump\u201d by billing himself as candidate who could stand up to the president.",
      "\u201cI just cannot support the hate rhetoric ... and this \u2018Maple MAGA\u2019 movement that\u2019s happening here in Canada,\u201d said Chantal Dugdale, 57, another Conservative who voted Liberal for the first time in her life Monday.",
      "Dugdale said she found parallels between Poilievre\u2019s campaign and support base, and Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement particularly off-putting.",
      "\u201cWe need unity. We need to be together. We need positive messaging,\u201d said Dugdale, who is from Barrie, just north of Toronto, and works in marketing and sales.",
      "Trump appeared aware of his likely impact on Canada\u2019s election, saying in an interview conducted last week and published Monday by The Atlantic that until he \u201ccame along, remember, that the Conservative was leading.\u201d",
      "\u201cThen I was disliked by enough of the Canadians that I\u2019ve thrown the election into a close call, right?\u201d he said.",
      "A close call indeed, with Ouellette, Dugdale and political experts noting that Carney\u2019s victory was far from a landslide, with the next Liberal government projected to fall short of winning the majority of seats in Parliament.",
      "And while lifelong Conservatives may have helped propel the Liberal leader forward, Paris said he believed \u201cMark Carney would likely not have won if not for Donald Trump.\u201d",
      "\u201cCanadians were tired of the Liberal Party after 10 years, but they were even more concerned about Trump\u2019s threats,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, Dugdale pointed out, the election\u2019s projected outcome was a far cry from the Conservative victory that felt increasingly certain just weeks ago, with Poilievre now out of a job.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so ironic. Paul [Poilievre] was shouting, \u2018we need change,\u2019\u201d Dugdale said. \u201cHe got change alright.\u201d"

      "Trust in the United States is plummeting in Australia, which votes Saturday amid global financial turmoil sparked by tariffs Trump has imposed on trading partners around the world including Australia, a U.S. ally and vital security partner in countering China.",
      "As in Canada, Australia\u2019s opposition conservative party, the Coalition, was primed to win before Trump returned to office, thanks to public anger over the cost of living and record-high home prices. But it has since lost support among voters increasingly concerned about how their government will handle Trump.",
      "On Thursday, two polls showed the Coalition trailing the center-left Labor Party, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.",
      "His opponent, Peter Dutton, has pushed pushed\u00a0the Liberal party \u2014 the larger of the two parties that make up the conservative Coalition\u00a0\u2013 further to the right since becoming party leader in 2022.",
      "His nods to Trump include pledging to slash 41,000 public service jobs, proposing to reduce legal migration to Australia and appointing a shadow minister for government efficiency, prompting his opponents to call him \u201cDOGE-y Dutton.\u201d",
      "Though Dutton says he\u2019s his \u201cown person,\u201d his association with Trump appears to have become a liability among Australian voters, said John Blaxland, a professor of international security and intelligence studies at the Australian National University.",
      "\u201cDutton, perhaps overenthusiastically, endorsed President Trump\u2019s victory without recognizing how difficult that would make his position \u2014 not with the bolted-on right, but with the swing voters, the center of the center, where all elections are won in Australia,\u201d he said.",
      "A poll released last month by the Lowy Institute, a research foundation, found only 36% of Australians expressed any level of trust in the United States \u2014 the lowest in the annual poll\u2019s two-decade history.",
      "Blaxland described Trump\u2019s disregard for long-standing alliances and his quid pro quo approach to U.S. foreign policy as \u201cvertigo inducing\u201d for politicians, policymakers and voters in Australia, where voting is mandatory.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s \u201chyperrealist, short-term, transactional approach to its relationships is deeply unsettling and corrosive of goodwill,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has treated Australia as just another freeloader, slapping a 10% tariff on all exports to the U.S., even though the U.S. generally runs a trade surplus with Australia rather than a deficit. (In a rare deviation, Australia reported Thursday that it sold more to the U.S. than it bought in the first quarter as investors spooked by Trump\u2019s tariffs rushed to buy gold, one of Australia\u2019s top metals exports.)",
      "While 81% of Australians disapprove of Trump\u2019s tariffs, the vast majority (80%) continue to say the U.S. alliance is important for Australia\u2019s security.",
      "Those numbers reflect the economic and security dichotomy Australia faces: how to balance its security ties with the U.S. and its trade interests with China.",
      "Albanese has spent his prime ministership working to stabilize relations with China, which nosedived under the previous conservative government, prompting China to impose punishing trade restrictions.",
      "China is Australia\u2019s largest two-way trading partner, accounting for 25% of the country\u2019s goods and services trade in 2023-24. The U.S. is Australia\u2019s third-largest two-way trading partner and largest source of foreign investment.",
      "If the United States, which has imposed 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, \u201creally damages the Chinese economy, then that is going to have a major impact on Australia,\u201d said Stuart Rollo, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney.",

      "\u201cFor us to make the decision to disconnect from that \u2014 because we need American protection forever \u2014 that\u2019s going to be a real cost to the living standards of Australians moving forward.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration has designated a coalition of Haitian gangs that have embroiled the Caribbean nation in mass violence as terrorist organizations, a White House official confirmed to NBC News.",
      "The Viv Ansanm coalition and the Gran Grif gang will now be labeled a Foreign Terrorist Organizations and as Specifically Designated Global Terrorists by the State Department.",
      "The designation was first reported by the Miami Herald.",
      "The Treasury Department also applied the designation to the Gran Grif gang. In October, the gang took responsibility for a massacre of at least 115 people in Pont-Sonde, a rural town.",
      "Earlier this year, Secretary of State Marco Rubio authorized a similar designation for several Mexican cartels and gangs, including MS-13 and Tren de Aragua, according to which, if an individual is found to be providing \u201cmaterial support\u201d to them, they could face sanctions and penalties.",
      "\"Engaging in transactions with members of these groups entails risk in relation to counterterrorism sanctions authorities, not only for Haitians but also for U.S. lawful permanent residents and U.S. citizens,\" Rubio said in a statement on Friday. \"Individuals and entities providing material support\u00a0or resources to Viv Ansanm or Gran Grif could face criminal charges and inadmissibility or removal from the United States.\"",
      "The terrorist designation for Tren de Aragua and MS-13 has been used as one determining factor in deporting several people in the U.S. to a Salvadorian prison. The move comes as thousands of Haitians living in the U.S. under protected status programs were told they must leave the country months before their status was set to expire.",
      "According to a fact sheet by the State Department, Gran Grif is the largest gang in Haiti's rural Artibonite region. The department said the gang is responsible for 80% of the deaths in that area, including an attack earlier this year that killed a Kenyan military officer on a mission to provide security in Haiti.",
      "Viv Ansanm is a coalition of gangs especially concentrated in Port-au-Prince, where most of the violence has centralized since 2021. According to the State Department, this group coordinated the attacks that have destabilized critical infrastructure, including prisons, government buildings and the main airport.",
      "Rubio told the Herald that the designation was part of America\u2019s responsibility to address the widespread violence and political upheaval in the country.\u00a0The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News.",
      "In anticipation of the designation, Democratic representatives Gregory Meeks of New York and Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick of Florida, sent a letter to Rubio sharing their problems with the plan.",
      "\"While we support efforts to target the financial support of violent gangs wreaking havoc on innocent Haitians,\" they wrote on April 30, \"we are concerned that an FTO designation, absent a clear, comprehensive U.S. strategy to defeat the gangs and their enablers, is counterproductive and will only exacerbate Haitians\u2019 suffering.\"",
      "Guerline Jozef, the executive director of Haitian Bridge Alliance, said the designation \"would not weaken the gangs \u2014 it would criminalize survivors, block humanitarian aid, and escalate deportations and target of people of Haitian descent fleeing for their lives. We must address the flow of guns and armed groups in Haiti while pursuing lawful, effective tools\u2014not political theater.\u201d",
      "In addition to potentially cracking down on anyone in the U.S. who sends cash to people in Haiti, Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who is monitoring the situation in the country, said the designation may have more of a social effect on Haitians living here.",
      "More than 1 million people have been displaced by the conflict as the violence has spread to central Haiti. The instability throughout the country has forced health facilities to close and has caused widespread famine.",
      "Meanwhile, the Dominican Republic and other countries have been deporting Haitian migrants back to their home country despite pleas from the United Nations to stand down over humanitarian concerns, according to Reuters."

      "Officials said the suspect, Kai-Ji Adam Lo, 30, who has been charged with eight counts of second-degree murder, had a history of mental illness and was known to police. Lo was under the care of a mental health team at Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH), the facility said in a statement Tuesday. But he was on an extended leave under the Mental Health Act at the time of the attack.",
      "Toan Le told NBC News that his brother, Richard Le, 47; his sister-in-law, Linh Hoang, 30; and his niece, Katie Le, 5, were killed. Andy Le survived, the GoFundMe said, because he opted to stay home to finish his homework instead of attending the festival with the rest of his family.",
      "The fundraiser was initially started to pay for Andy Le\u2019s college education in addition to final expenses for his three family members. In a post on the GoFundMe page, Toan Le said that the funds would now also go toward direct or indirect victims and cover expenses including funeral costs, education, counseling and medical expenses.",

      "\u201cHe devoted his life to teaching young people the values of sportsmanship and team spirit,\u201d Le wrote on the GoFundMe. \u201cHe served his community and clients with pride and always went out of his way to help others.\u201d",
      "Le went on to say that Linh Hoang, Andy Le\u2019s stepmother, was \u201cknown for her kindness and gentle spirit.\u201d And Katie was just about to graduate from kindergarten.",
      "\u201cShe was vibrant, joyful, and full of life,\u201d Toan Le said of Katie, who was among the youngest of the attack victims.",
      "In his video, Andy Le said that he plans to continue living with his grandparents.",
      "Locals previously told NBC News that the festival that was attacked is one of the largest Filipino celebrations of the year. It honors the 16th century Filipino chieftain Datu Lapu-Lapu, who defeated Spanish forces and remains a symbol of resistance against colonialism.",
      "Diana Silva, a vendor at the festival who left just 30 minutes before the attack, said that during a vigil for the victims, community members didn\u2019t hesitate to start brainstorming ways to support survivors and help grieving community members.\u201d Silva said it was reflective of the spirit of the chieftain himself.",
      "\u201cLapu-Lapu is all about resilience, and he stood up for the Philippines,\u201d Silva said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what our community is doing now.\u201d"

      "The arrest last month of Paul Chambers, a political science lecturer at Naresuan University in the northern province of Phitsanulok, had drawn concern from the academic community, especially from Asian studies scholars around the world, as well as the U.S. government.",
      "The decision not to prosecute Chambers, a 58-year-old Oklahoma native, does not immediately clear him of the charge of insulting the monarchy \u2014 also known as \u201cl\u00e8se majest\u00e9\u201d \u2014 or a related charge of violating the Computer Crime Act, which covers online activities.",
      "The announcement said that the Phitsanulok provincial prosecutor will request the provincial court to drop the charges and forward the case file and nonprosecution order to the commissioner of Provincial Police Region 6, covering Phitsanulok, who may review and contest the decision.",

      "He has studied the power and influence of the Thai military, which plays a major role in politics. It has staged 13 coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, most recently 11 years ago.",
      "The army\u2019s Internal Security Operations Command told a parliamentary inquiry that it filed the complaint based on a Facebook post that translated words from a website operated by ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute, a think tank in Singapore, about a webinar on Thai politics that included Chambers as a participant.",
      "Chambers\u2019 supporters said that the blurb for the webinar, which was cited in his charge sheet as evidence, was not written by him.",
      "He had been jailed in April for two nights after reporting himself to the Phitsanulok police, and then granted release on bail, with several conditions, including wearing an ankle monitor. A court on Tuesday allowed him to take off the device.",

      "\u201cThis case reinforces our longstanding concerns about the use of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 laws in Thailand,\u201d the U.S. State Department said after Chambers\u2019 arrest. \u201cWe continue to urge Thai authorities to respect freedom of expression and to ensure that laws are not used to stifle permitted expression.\u201d",

Critics say it is among the harshest such laws anywhere and also has been used to punish critics of the government and the military.",
      "The monarchy has long been considered a pillar of Thai society and criticizing it used to be strictly taboo. Conservative Thais, especially in the military and courts, still consider it untouchable.",
      "However, public debate on the topic has grown louder in the past decade, particularly among young people, and student-led pro-democracy protests starting in 2020 began openly criticizing the institution.",
      "That led to vigorous prosecutions under the previously little-used law. The legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights has said that since early 2020, more than 270 people \u2014 many of them student activists \u2014 have been charged with violating the law."
