      "Thousands of tourists are descending on Puerto Rico this summer for one of Bad Bunny\u2019s concerts as part of the rapper's residency that has boosted the U.S. territory\u2019s fragile economy",
      "VEGA BAJA, Puerto Rico -- Tourists slipped into borrowed red polyester vests from the Puerto Rico supermarket where Bad Bunny once worked, grinning as they posed for photographs in the superstar\u2019s old uniform.",
      "They listened intently as his former boss recalled how he loved classic salsa songs. \"He always liked going to the parking lot to gather the shopping carts because it seemed that he felt free there and would sing,\u201d said Delza V\u00e9lez, the head of HR at Econo, the supermarket.",
      "In 2016, Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio quit that job, leaving V\u00e9lez a note. Two years later, he launched his first album \u2014 and the singer known as Bad Bunny stepped into stardom.",
      "This summer, thousands descended on Puerto Rico, where the singer's concert residency in San Juan, running from mid-June through mid-September, has single-handedly boosted the island's fragile economy. The prodigious son has elevated the global profile of the U.S. territory, singing about Puerto Rico\u2019s turmoil and identity.",
      "Visitors come not only to see him but to explore his island. Thousands have stood in line for days or waited hours online to snag a ticket for the reggaet\u00f3n singer and rapper, one of the most streamed artists in the world.",
      "A father and son with the same name, Eddie Villanueva, traveled from Switzerland for a full Bad Bunny experience on a $5,000 budget, including $40 tickets for a tour of the star's hometown of Vega Baja.",
      "\u201cDelighted. Incredible,\u201d said the younger Villanueva, 23.",
      "Nearly three dozen hotels are participating in Bad Bunny packages, which include the concert and which have generated nearly $200 million, according to Discover Puerto Rico, an organization that promotes the island.",
      "More than 48,000 nights have been booked at hotels at a time when visits dwindle ahead of the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season. Concert organizers say 25,000 packages were sold in just one day.",
      "Hotel reservations were 10% higher on July 27, compared with the same date last year. Short-term rentals are up 42% this month, compared to last August, and 61% higher for September. With up to hundreds of dollars per concert ticket, the show is expected to attract about 600,000 people.",
      "Nearly 7% more flights were booked between July and September from the U.S. mainland to Puerto Rico\u2019s main international airport than during the same period last year, according to aviation analytics company Cirium.",
      "The windfall comes as Puerto Rico promoters focus more on its culture, rather than beaches.",
      "\u201cWe can argue that they\u2019re the prettiest, but they\u2019re beaches. What makes us unique is the culture. No one can steal that,\u201d said Ricardo Cort\u00e9s Chico, a spokesperson for Discover Puerto Rico.",
      "In Bad Bunny\u2019s hometown, tourists visit his former high school, the supermarket where he worked \u2014 even the church where he served as an altar boy.",
      "On a recent morning, the Villanuevas posed in front of a Bad Bunny mural on an agricultural supply store that sells harnesses for horses and feed for fighting cocks. For $20, they bought two caps emblazoned with \u201cPR\u201d for Puerto Rico, drawing a wide smile from the cashier.",
      "G8, a nonprofit that helps impoverished communities in the capital of San Juan, launched a $25 guided bike tour called \u201cI should have biked more\u201d \u2014 a play on Bad Bunny\u2019s newest album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d which translates to \u201cI should have taken more photos.\u201d",
      "Another nonprofit, Acci\u00f3n Valerosa, partnered with the music group Los Pleneros de la Cresta, which plays at Bad Bunny\u2019s concerts, to create the \u201cCaf\u00e9 con Ron\u201d tour, named after one of his songs.",
      "They ferry tourists to Ciales, a coffee-producing town nestled in the central mountains. The tour includes a workshop on Puerto Rico\u2019s traditional music, and the money generated will be used to convert a former casino into a community center.",

      "NEW YORK -- When the musical \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d said goodbye to Broadway a decade ago, there were tears and hugs and tons of applause. In the audience of its last show, one woman wasn't entirely buying it.",
      "\u201cI felt then that it wasn\u2019t goodbye forever. I felt we\u2019d be back one day,\u201d says producer Judy Craymer, who had conceived of the show in the 1980s. \u201cI always hoped.\u201d",
      "That one day has become today as the ABBA-fueled, feel-good musical returns to its first home on Broadway, the Winter Garden Theatre. It reopens Thursday night.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like when you go to visit the old place where you went to high school,\u201d says Victor Wallace, who made his Broadway debut in the show in 2012, stayed to the final curtain in 2015 and has returned. \u201cThere's so many backstage stories and people and I\u2019m a little overwhelmed.\u201d",
      "Fans have fueled the return of \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d to make it among the top earners on Broadway, last week grossing $1.57 million over seven previews, fourth behind only \u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cThe Lion King\u201d and \u201cHamilton.\u201d",
      "\u201cMamma Mia!\u201d endured plenty during its first Broadway life \u2014 wars, hurricanes, the 2008 financial meltdown, the move to a smaller theater and critics, who never warmed to the show\u2019s high-energy sweetness.",
      "A hit in London \u2014 where it is still playing \u2014 \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d opened in New York just a few weeks after the 2001 terror attacks when there was deep gloom and anxiety.",
      "Christine Sherrill, who recently toured as the show's mom and is now making her Broadway debut in the role, says audiences are responding to another time of stress.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re kind of in a time of peril again, where communities are divided. So to be able to go into some of these cities and have 3,000 people \u2014 who would never find themselves enjoying the same thing outside of the theater \u2014 sitting there all enjoying this communal experience is really interesting.\u201d",
      "The show, featuring more than 20 classic ABBA hits, including \u201cDancing Queen\u201d and \u201cWaterloo,\u201d has been a smash in dozens of countries, including South Korea, Italy, Denmark, South Africa and Spain.",
      "Craymer sees the data about the new flock of theatergoers and notes this \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d is popular with groups. \u201cThere were people that had seen it on Broadway \u2014 probably when they were younger \u2014 and now coming back in their 20s and 30s and then bringing their daughters or family.\u201d",

      "The musical prompted Craymer to produce a movie version starring Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried, Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth, that became the fifth highest-grossing film of 2008. A sequel, \u201cMamma Mia! Here We Go Again,\u201d came out a decade later. ABBA\u2019s music continues to be the backdrop for numerous popular TikTok trends.",

    "story": [
      "After getting out of the scripted TV business in 2021 for reality TV and sports coverage, USA Network is returning to air scripted originals with the legal drama \u201cThe Rainmaker.\"",
      "Since 2021, the USA Network had stacked its lineup with reality shows and sports, entirely forgoing original, scripted programming. Fans of \"Suits\u201d, \u201cWhite Collar\u201d and \u201cMonk\u201d were left with only memories of those shows' case-of-the-week storytelling. But on Friday, the network returns to scripted TV with the legal thriller \u201cThe Rainmaker.\u201d",
      "If the title sounds familiar, it's because it\u2019s based on the 1995 novel by John Grisham, which was first adapted into the 1997 Matt Damon-starring film directed by Francis Ford Coppola. In this \u201cRainmaker,\u201d British actor Milo Callaghan plays Rudy Baylor. It's the first leading role for Callaghan, who had previously played recurring characters in shows like HBO's \u201cDune: Prophecy\" and Starz\u2019s \u201cThe Spanish Princess.\u201d",
      "Baylor is fresh out of law school and about to start working at the largest law firm in the state, run by Leo F. Drummond (John Slattery). On his first day, Baylor gets fired after challenging Drummond in a meeting. Desperate for work, he takes a job at a small ambulance-chasing firm that works out of a former taco joint. His boss is Jocelyn \u201cBruiser\u201d Stone (Lana Parrilla, in a gender swap from the film where Mickey Rourke had the role). She\u2019s smart, confident and not afraid to use her sex appeal to get what she wants. Rudy\u2019s first big case pits him against the big, fancy law firm that let him go \u2014 and his girlfriend who still works there.",
      "Callaghan told The Associated Press about learning legalese while doing a Memphis accent and familiarizing himself with the source material. Answers are edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "CALLAGHAN: I watched it when I got cast. Matt Damon is somebody that every young actor would look up to. I wanted to be aware of the work that he did. I mean, it was a Coppola movie as well, so I was excited to see it. And then I gave it maybe like 20 minutes' thought and focused on the script because it is different and I think we have 10 hours of television to explore this character. We go on a windier road than the movie.",
      "CALLAGHAN: Yes. It\u2019s a slow-paced thriller, really, but fantastic. And there\u2019s this chunk, it must be about 100 pages, of him just preparing for this case for months and months and months. So I never wanted it to feel like it was off-the-hand genius. It felt like this is a situation that has to be honored to a certain extent. Like, you can be a fantastic lawyer, but you don\u2019t get there without grinding and grafting. We had great scenes where we were working late into the night.",

For a movie, you might get away with it, but for 10 hours of television, it just has to be light, it has to be quick, it has to be at your fingertips.",
      "CALLAGHAN: \u201cNorth City Hospital.\u201d It was the hardest thing. I was like, 'Why did you call it this?\" I got all this legalese down and then \u201cNorth City Hospital\u201d would shoot me in the foot every time.",
      "CALLAGHAN: I went through major trials, like the whole O.J. Simpson murder trial and the Gwyneth Paltrow trial. And also obscure trials. I studied attorneys and their patterns of speech and the way they address the court. We don't really have the same kind of pop star element to the legal system of like, \u201cThat\u2019s the guy who represented this person and that person.\u201d Studying that is fascinating.",

In the full episode, Swift revealed she worked on the album in Europe while she was on the \u201cEras Tour\" \u2014 flying between dates to record, truly embodying the album's title, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl.\u201d Then she read the track list. The entire album was completed in Sweden with producers Max Martin and Shellback.3. Why orange? The color embodies \u201cwhat was going on in my inner life during this tour,\u201d she said, before referring to Martin as her \u201cmentor.\u201d \u201cThese guys, they're just geniuses,\u201d she said of Martin and Shellback.4. \u201cBangers,\u201d is how she describes the album. She also said, \u201cThere aren't other ones coming,\u201d referring to a surprising double album like in the case of 2024's \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department.\u201d The release is 12 tracks \u2014 that's it. And it arrives Oct. 3. \u201cI care about this record more than I can even overstate,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's a lot more upbeat,\u201d Travis Kelce said, describing it as a \u201c180 from \u2018Tortured Poets.\u2019\u201d Swift agreed, adding, \"Life is more upbeat.\u201d5.

Themed after \u201cthe end of my day,\u201d she said. \u201cMy day ends with me in a bathtub.\"8. She also shared personal information on \u201cNew Heights,\" arguably in a way she hasn't in years.

It made $70 million internationally.",
      "The film\u2019s success also handed its distributor, Warner Bros. Pictures, the seventh No. 1 opening of the year, and became the studio\u2019s sixth film in a row to debut with over $40 million domestically.",

      "\u201cThe top two films could not be more different, and that\u2019s what makes this weekend so appealing for moviegoers,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cBoth are perfectly tailored for their audiences to react in real time over the weekend to these films and then post on social media.\u201d",

      "The film is Cregger\u2019s follow-up to his solo directorial debut with the 2022 genre-bending horror, \u201cBarbarian.\u201d That critically-acclaimed film had a slower start and smaller budget, but still topped the charts during its premiere with $10 million domestically and made a splash in the genre.",

      "Republican lawmakers are blaming Canada for not preventing and containing wildfires, whose smoke has fouled the air in several states this year",
      "The sternly worded statements and letters are filled with indignation and outrage: Republican U.S. lawmakers say Canada has done too little to contain wildfires and smoke that have fouled the air in several states this summer.",
      "\u201cInstead of enjoying family vacations at Michigan\u2019s beautiful lakes and campgrounds, for the third summer in a row, Michiganders are forced to breathe hazardous air as a result of Canada\u2019s failure to prevent and control wildfires,\u201d read a statement last week from the state\u2019s GOP congressional delegation, echoing similar missives from Republicans in Iowa, New York, North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin.",
      "They\u2019ve demanded more forest thinning, prescribed burns and other measures to prevent fires from starting. They've warned the smoke is hurting relations between the countries and suggested the U.S. could make it an issue in tariff talks.",
      "But what they haven't done is acknowledge the role of climate change \u2014 a glaring and shortsighted omission, according to climate scientists. It also ignores the outsized U.S. contribution to heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas that cause more intense heat waves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires, scientists say.",
      "\u201cIf anything, Canada should be blaming the U.S. for their increased fires,\u201d said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.",
      "On Tuesday, the Canadian government announced almost $46 million in funding for wildfire prevention and risk assessment research projects. But Corey Hogan, parliamentary secretary to the federal energy and natural resources minister, said international cooperation is needed.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no people that want to do more about wildfires than Canadians,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cBut I think this also underlines the international challenges that are brought on by climate change ... we need to globally tackle this problem.\u201d",
      "The country has \u201cbeen fighting wildfires in this country at unprecedented rates since 2023,\u201d when Canada saw its largest wildfire on record, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs. This year\u2019s first fire started in April, one of the earliest on record, and 2025 is now the second-worst year.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 700 wildfires were burning across the country, two-thirds of them out of control, with more than 28,000 square miles (72,520 square kilometers) burned in 4,400 wildfires so far this year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. That's almost five times the surface area that's burned so far in the U.S. this year. Most wildfires are started by people, sometimes on purpose but mostly by mistake, though McMullen said lightning is the culprit in many of Canada's fires, especially in remote areas.",
      "McMullen said he has no interest in debating the role of climate change, but data show that something has changed. Sloughs and basins have dried up and water that once lapped at people\u2019s back doors in Canada\u2019s lake communities now is often hundreds of feet away.",
      "\u201cPeople can make up their own mind as to why that is,\u201d he said. \u201cBut something clearly has changed.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax \u2014 a belief echoed by many in the GOP \u2014 and his administration has worked to dismantle and defund federal climate science and data collection, with little to no pushback from Republicans in Congress.",
      "He\u2019s proposed to revoke the scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare \u2014 the central basis for U.S. climate change action. He's declared a national energy emergency to expedite fossil fuel development, canceled grants for renewable energy projects and ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels.",

Several have played prominent roles in defending their state's abortion restrictions in court and in cases that have had national impact, including on access to medication abortion.",
      "As President Donald Trump pushes the Senate to confirm his federal judicial nominees, a review by The Associated Press shows that roughly half of them have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions.",
      "Trump has offered shifting positions on the issue while indicating he wants to leave questions of abortion access to the states. But his court nominees will have lifetime appointments and be in position to roll back abortion access long after the Republican president leaves the White House.",
      "Bernadette Meyler, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford University, said judicial nominations \u201care a way of federally shaping the abortion question without going through Congress or making a big, explicit statement.\u201d",
      "\"It\u2019s a way to cover up a little bit what is happening in the abortion sphere compared to legislation or executive orders that may be more visible, dramatic and spark more backlash,\u201d she said.",
      "Of the 17 judicial nominees so far in Trump's second term, at least eight have argued in favor of abortion restrictions or against expanded abortion access. No such records could be found for the other nine, nor did the AP review find evidence that any of Trump's judicial nominees support increased access to abortion.",
      "\"Every nominee of the President represents his promises to the American people and aligns with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling,\" a White House spokesman, Harrison Fields, said in a statement that referenced the 2022 decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade. \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 extreme position on abortion was rejected in November in favor of President Trump\u2019s commonsense approach, which allows states to decide, supports the sanctity of human life, and prevents taxpayer funding of abortion.\u201d",
      "Trump's first term also had an enduring impact on the courts, appointing 234 judges. By the end of that term, more than one-quarter of active federal judges were nominated by Trump, including three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade.",
      "In his second term, all but five of his 17 nominees are from states that went for Trump in 2024 and where Republicans have pushed severe abortion restrictions. Among them, four nominees are from Missouri and five are from Florida.",
      "Here is a look at the nominees who have tried to reduce abortion access or have advocated for restrictions. They did not respond to requests for comment:",
      "\u2014 Whitney Hermandorfer, who has been confirmed to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, has built much of her relatively short career as a lawyer around challenging former President Joe Biden\u2019s policies related to abortion and transgender rights. She challenged a federal law requiring employers to provide workers with reasonable accommodations to get abortion care, as well as Title X regulations that required providers who receive funding through the program to give information about abortions to patients if asked.",
      "Hermandorfer defended Tennessee\u2019s abortion ban, one of the strictest in the country, in court and tried to dismiss a lawsuit from doctors seeking clarification on exemptions to the ban. She said abortion deserves special scrutiny because \u201cthis is the only medical procedure that terminates a life.\u201d",
      "\u2014 Maria Lanahan, a district court nominee in Missouri, helped write the state's complaint in a lawsuit that had sweeping national implications for access to medication abortion. The case challenged the FDA approval of the abortion pill mifepristone despite decades of evidence showing the drug is safe and effective.",
      "The lawyer supported Missouri's effort to strip Planned Parenthood of state Medicaid funding and defended the state's abortion ban after a group of clergy sued, arguing it violated the state constitution\u2019s protections for religious freedom.",
      "\u2014 Jordan Pratt, a nominee for the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, called abortion a \u201cbarbaric practice\u201d and \u201cone of the most severe invasions of personal rights imaginable\u201d in an amicus brief supporting Florida's 15-week abortion ban. The state now bans the procedure at six weeks.",
      "In 2025, Pratt struck down a Florida law that created a judicial waiver program for minors seeking to have abortions without parental consent. The lawyer also worked for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal organization that opposes abortion and has sued to reverse the FDA approval of mifepristone.",

During the ensuing legal battles, Divine represented the state in defending a host of abortion restrictions.",

That included a law requiring doctors to perform ultrasounds and describe images to abortion patients.",
      "\u2014 Bill Mercer, a Republican state lawmaker in Montana who is nominated for a U.S. District Court judgeship in the state, has repeatedly supported anti-abortion bills. Those include ones that sought to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy; require a 24-hour waiting period and mandatory ultrasounds for abortion patients; require parental notification for minors to get an abortion; prohibit the use of state funding for abortions; prohibit certain insurance policies from covering abortions; and restrict what types of medical professionals can dispense medication abortion.",
      "\u2014 Jennifer Mascott, a lawyer in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office and a Trump nominee to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, has spoken repeatedly about abortion law in panels and interviews.",

    "summary": "Reusable menstrual products, including cups, discs and period underwear, have gained traction as a cost-effective, long-lasting, environmental alternative to single-use products",
    "story": [
      "Reusable menstrual products, including cups, discs and period underwear, have gained traction as a cost-effective, long-lasting, environmental alternative to single-use products",
      "It was six months ago that Selin Celikoyar bought her last tampon and switched to a reusable menstrual disc.",
      "\"I had already been wary of tampons from an environmental perspective and also from a biological perspective. I felt that they were very wasteful and expensive to consistently keep buying,\" she said.",
      "The flexible discs and other reusable menstrual products are gaining traction as alternatives to the billions of single-use pads and tampons that get tossed into landfills every year. Products such as the discs, silicone cups and period underwear can be reused for years, so they\u2019re cost-effective and long-lasting in addition to helping people reduce waste. The popularity of the reusable alternatives has grown since the pandemic, when it was easier to experiment with period products in the privacy of a home bathroom, according to women's health experts.",
      "Celikoyar said she used tampons and pads for years because those are the options she grew up knowing about. But when she saw her friend make the switch to a menstrual disc, she decided to try it too.",
      "\u201cThe experience has been such a game changer,\u201d she said.",
      "About 12 billion disposable pads and 7 billion tampons go into U.S. landfills every year, according to Dr. Luwam Semere, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Kaiser Permanente Santa Clara. Pads are mostly plastic. Once they're in the landfill, they take up to 800 years to degrade, according to the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Single-use pads and tampons are by far the most popular period products. Women's health expert Dr. Navya Mysore said that's not because they're better, they're just usually the first options kids are shown.",
      "\u201cIt was often like, \u2018What did your mom use? What did your grandma use?\u2019 And that\u2019s how you were introduced into period hygiene,\u201d said Mysore, a primary care physician based in New York City.",
      "The most popular is the menstrual cup, which gets inserted much like a tampon. The discs get inserted farther in, so they don't interrupt intercourse. Both can hold several times more than a tampon and can stay inserted for up to 12 hours, instead of the four to eight hours recommended for tampons. Semere also said the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome commonly associated with tampons is much lower with menstrual cups and discs.",
      "The cons? The products require some technique to put them in right, and doing it wrong can get messy. The cups and discs also have to be cleaned regularly with soap and water.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to do that if you\u2019re at work and you\u2019re in a shared, public restroom. It\u2019s not the most convenient,\u201d said Mysore.",
      "Cups prevent leakage by creating a suction, so people who use intrauterine devices for contraception risk dislodging them if they pull out a menstrual cup without breaking the seal.",
      "The placement of discs, which don\u2019t use suction, can also take some getting used to.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s high up there, you don\u2019t feel it, but it can be sometimes harder for women to pull them out,\u201d said Dr. Annemieke van Eijk, an epidemiologist with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s an ease of use there for the modern woman that is significantly better than traditional methods,\u201d she said.",
      "Menstrual cups and discs typically cost between $15 and $40 and come in different shapes and sizes. They're available online and at pharmacies and big box stores.",
      "\u201cIdeally, you would like to experiment a bit with what type of cup works best for you. And the cost can be kind of prohibitive to do that,\u201d van Eijk said.",
      "A reusable product can help save money over the long term. Celikoyar estimates that she was using three tampons every day for seven days, or about 20 per month. With tampons costing 20 to 25 cents each, someone who switched to a reusable product would likely break even after a few months.",
      "For people who prefer pads, the most common reusable option is period underwear, which is comparable to regular-looking underwear with an extra absorbent lining.",
      "\u201cThose are nice because we do see people getting irritation from pad use,\" said Semere. \"Because of the different materials that are in the disposable pads.\u201d",
      "The downside, just like with pads, is the inability to tell when it's absorbed all that it can.",
      "Mysore said that's why some of her patients use the underwear as a backup, and pair them cups, discs or tampons.",

      "Three women in Gambia have been charged over the death of a one-month-old girl who underwent female genital mutilation",
      "SERREKUNDA, Gambia -- Three women were charged in Gambia over the death of a one-month-old girl who had undergone female genital mutilation, the police said, in the first such case since the country stopped short of reversing a ban on the practice last year.",
      "The West African nation banned female genital cutting in 2015, but the country was rocked by a renewed debate about the practice last year following the first prosecutions of female cutters. It was the first time the practice \u2014 also known as female circumcision and outlawed in many nations \u2014 was publicly discussed.",
      "Eventually, the Gambian parliament upheld the ban, but many say the practice continues in secrecy.",
      "Three women were charged Tuesday under the ban, the Women\u2019s (Amendment) Act, 2015, the Gambian police said in a statement published Wednesday on social media. One woman is facing life imprisonment, and the other two were charged as accomplices.",
      "\u201cPreliminary findings indicate the child was allegedly subjected to circumcision and later developed severe bleeding,\u201d the police said in a separate statement published Sunday, following the infant's death. \u201cShe was rushed to Bundung Maternal and Child Health Hospital, where she was pronounced dead on arrival.\u201d",
      "The United Nations estimates that about 75% of women in Gambia have been subjected as young girls to the procedure known by its initials FGM, which includes partial or full removal of a girl\u2019s external genitalia. The World Health Organization says it\u2019s a form of torture.",
      "More than 200 million women and girls across the world are survivors of FGM, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa, according to U.N. estimates. In the past eight years alone, some 30 million women globally have been cut, most of them in Africa but also in Asia and the Middle East, UNICEF said last year.",
      "The procedure, typically performed by older women or traditional community practitioners, is often done with tools such as razor blades and can cause serious bleeding, death and complications later in life, including in childbirth.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- The United States is discussing the possible deployment of more missile launchers to the Philippines to strengthen deterrence against aggression in the disputed South China Sea and other Asian security hotspots, but no final decision has been reached by both sides, Manila\u2019s ambassador to Washington said Thursday.",
      "The U.S. military delivered a mid-range missile system called the Typhon, a land-based weapon that can fire the Standard Missile-6 and the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile, to the northern Philippines as part of joint combat exercises in April last year. That was followed by the transport by the U.S. military of an anti-ship missile launcher in April this year to the northernmost Philippine province of Batanes, just a sea border away from Taiwan.",
      "Beijing strongly protested the installation of the U.S. missile systems, saying they were aimed at containing China\u2019s rise and warning that these would threaten regional stability. China has asked the Philippines to withdraw the missile launchers from its territory, but officials led by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. had rejected the demand.",
      "Ambassador Jose Manuel Romualdez said without elaborating that the possible deployment by the U.S. of more Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System or NMESIS missile launchers \"was being discussed for consideration by both sides.\u201d The anti-ship missile systems could be installed along Philippine coastal regions facing the South China Sea and outlying regions to beef up deterrence against aggression, he said.",
      "\u201cThis is part of the strong U.S. and Philippines defense partnership,\u201d Romualdez told The Associated Press.",
      "Romualdez spoke on the sidelines of a trade and investment conference in Manila, where he and Philippine Foreign Secretary Theresa Lazaro encouraged major U.S. companies to invest in a wide array of industries \u2014 from energy and telecommunications to infrastructure and navy shipbuilding \u2014 in the Philippines, the oldest treaty ally of the U.S. in Asia.",
      "\u201cWhen U.S. companies invest here, it\u2019s not just about returns on capital \u2014 it\u2019s about returns on alliance,\u201d Romualdez told U.S. business executives at the conference. \u201cA stronger Philippine economy means a more capable and reliable defense partner for the United States.\u201d",

      "Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has submitted his final defense to the Supreme Court",
      "SAO PAULO -- Lawyers for Brazil\u2019s former President Jair Bolsonaro denied coup charges against him during their final defense in a Supreme Court trial over his alleged attempt to stay in power after losing the 2022 election to current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "The lawyers argued late Wednesday that no solid evidence had been presented to prove that Bolsonaro acted against Brazil\u2019s democratic institutions or incited others to do so, and said the fact that he allowed the presidential transition to proceed contradicts the basic allegation that he plotted to thwart it. \u201cThis is evidence that eliminates the most essential of the accusatory premises,\u201d they said.",
      "The former president and other defendants were required to present their final arguments by Wednesday. This marks the last procedural step before the trial concludes, which is expected by year\u2019s end.",
      "A panel of five Supreme Court justices will now decide whether Bolsonaro and his allies are guilty. If convicted of attempting a coup, Bolsonaro could face up to 12 years in prison. Combined with other charges, he could spend decades behind bars. Even if convicted, Bolsonaro can appeal the decision to the full Supreme Court.",
      "Brazil\u2019s top court on elections has already barred the far-right leader from running for office until 2030, ruling that he abused his authority by undermining confidence in the country\u2019s electoral system.",
      "Bolsonaro has been under house arrest since Aug. 5. Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversees the case, said Bolsonaro violated precautionary measures by spreading content through his three lawmaker sons. Last week, De Moraes eased the restrictions, allowing unrestricted family visits.",
      "The case has gripped Brazil as it navigates a trade dispute with the United States.",

      "Former Bolivian president Evo Morales has launched a campaign for a contender called \u201cNulo,\u201d representing a null-and-void vote",
      "EL ALTO, Bolivia -- Barred from appearing on Sunday\u2019s ballot, former leftist president Evo Morales has launched a scrappy campaign for a presidential contender with no name, no face and no formal platform.",
      "The contender's known as \u201cNulo\" \u2014 Spanish for the null-and-void vote.",
      "Nulo has a reliable base in Bolivia, where voting is compulsory. For many years, voters disillusioned with Morales' increasingly high-handed attempts to prolong his presidency over three consecutive terms defaced their ballots or left them blank.",
      "But with the coca-farming union leader disqualified from the race and seeking to distance himself from the unpopular President Luis Arce and other leftists associated with Bolivia's worst economic crisis in four decades, Morales has emerged as Nulo's greatest champion.",
      "\u201cBrothers, we are on the right track. Absenteeism, blank ballots, undecided voters, all of it,\u201d Morales told Radio Kawsachun Coca, his media outlet in the Bolivian jungle of Chapare, where he has been holed up for months among fiercely loyal coca-growing labor unions.",
      "If Morales leaves his tropical stronghold, he risks arrest on charges related to statutory rape. He denies the allegations.",
      "\u201cNulo is where we belong,\u201d he said, urging voters to scratch, scribble and sketch on their ballots. \u201cWe\u2019ve already won here.\u201d",
      "But under Bolivian law, Nulo cannot win the elections\u2014 nor trigger a redo. Because authorities must remove spoiled and blank ballots from the final count, a surge by Nulo would give all the candidates a boost without affecting the distribution of votes.",
      "Morales is betting that an unusually high proportion of votes for Nulo would embarrass the right-wing front-runners, former President Jorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga and businessman Samuel Doria Medina, undermine the credibility of the consequential election and extend his own political relevance.",
      "\u201cEvo wants to be in the election and say, \u2018This is my vote ... I\u2019m the winner without even having participated,'\" said political analyst Carlos Saavedra.",
      "Morales' bid for Nulo comes after the iconic leftist leader, like other Latin American populists of his generation, exhausted a range of tactics to stay in power.",
      "To run for a third term in 2014, Morales changed the Constitution\u2019s two-consecutive-term limit and stacked the top courts with his supporters.",
      "To run for a fourth term in 2019, he found a way around a referendum blocking his bid. That last attempt six years ago led to Morales resigning under pressure from the military and fleeing into exile as violent protests erupted over his disputed reelection.",
      "This time, with his ally-turned-rival Arce in power, Morales had all the cards \u2014 rather, courts \u2014 stacked against him.",
      "The ex-president's power struggle with Arce splintered his once-dominant Movement Toward Socialism.",
      "Although running with a different faction, Senate President Andr\u00f3nico Rodr\u00edguez represents the MAS party's best hope.",
      "But support for Rodr\u00edguez, a coca-farming union activist like Morales, has declined in recent weeks as an accelerating currency crisis stokes outrage at the long-dominant MAS party.",
      "Morales' followers can appear even more disgusted with the left than with the right-wing establishment that their leader built his career opposing.",
      "\"Evo Morales taught Andr\u00f3nico everything he knows, and Andr\u00f3nico stabbed him in the back. How can we trust a candidate like that?\" asked Wendy Chipana, a 28-year-old volunteer at a Nulo campaign office in El Alto, the sprawling city of rural migrants overlooking Bolivia\u2019s capital of La Paz.",
      "\u201cWe only have one candidate, Evo Morales. That\u2019s why we\u2019re deciding not to cast a single valid vote.\u201d",

      "Twenty years ago, Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip, dismantling 21 Jewish settlements and pulling out its forces",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Twenty years ago, Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip, dismantling 21 Jewish settlements and pulling out its forces. The Friday anniversary of the start of the landmark disengagement comes as Israel is mired in a nearly 2-year war with Hamas that has devastated the Palestinian territory and means it is likely to keep troops there long into the future.",
      "Israel\u2019s disengagement, which also included removing four settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, was then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon\u2019s controversial attempt to jump-start negotiations with the Palestinians. But it bitterly divided Israeli society and led to the empowerment of Hamas, with implications that continue to reverberate today.",
      "The emotional images of Jews being ripped from their homes by Israeli soldiers galvanized Israel\u2019s far-right and settler movements. The anger helped them organize and increase their political influence, accounting in part for the rise of hard-line politicians like National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.",
      "On Thursday, Smotrich boasted of a settlement expansion plan east of Jerusalem that will \u201cbury\u201d the idea of a future Palestinian state.",
      "For Palestinians, even if they welcomed the disengagement, it didn\u2019t end Israel\u2019s control over their lives.",
      "Soon after, Hamas won elections in 2006, then drove out the Palestinian Authority in a violent takeover. Israel and Egypt imposed a closure on the territory, controlling entry and exit of goods and people. Though its intensity varied over the years, the closure helped impoverish the population and entrenched a painful separation from Palestinians in the West Bank.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians claim all three territories for a future independent state.",
      "Israel couldn\u2019t justify the military or economic cost of maintaining the heavily fortified settlements in Gaza, explained Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Misgav Institute and the Institute for National Security Studies think tanks. There were around 8,000 Israeli settlers and 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza in 2005.",
      "\u201cThere was no chance for these settlements to exist or flourish or become meaningful enough to be a strategic anchor,\u201d he said. By contrast, there are more than 500,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank, most living in developed settlement blocs that have generally received more support from Israeli society, Michael said. Most of the world considers the settlements illegal under international law.",
      "Because Israel withdrew unilaterally, without any coordination with the Palestinian Authority, it enhanced Hamas' stature among Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "\u201cThis contributed to Hamas\u2019 win in the elections in 2006, because they leveraged it and introduced it as a very significant achievement,\u201d Michael said. \u201cThey saw it as an achievement of the resistance and a justification for the continuation of the armed resistance.\u201d",
      "Footage of the violence between Israeli settlers and Israeli soldiers also created an \u201copen wound\u201d in Israeli society, Michael said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think any government will be able to do something like that in the future,\u201d he said. That limits any flexibility over settlements in the West Bank if negotiations over a two-state solution with the Palestinians ever resume.",
      "\u201cDisengagement will never happen again, this is a price we\u2019re paying as a society, and a price we\u2019re paying politically,\u201d he said.",
      "Anita Tucker, now 79, was part of the first nine Jewish families that moved to the Gaza Strip in 1976. She and her husband and their three kids lived in an Israeli army outpost near what is today Deir al-Balah, while the settlement of Netzer Hazoni was constructed.",
      "Originally from Brooklyn, she started a farm growing vegetables in the harsh, tall sand dunes. At first relations were good with their Palestinian neighbors, she said, and they worked hard to build their home and a \u201cbeautiful community.\u201d She had two more children, and three chose to stay and raise their families in Netzer Hazoni.",
      "She can still recall the moment, 20 years ago, when 1,000 Israeli soldiers arrived at the gate to the settlement to remove the approximately 400 residents. Some of her neighbors lit their houses on fire in protest.",
      "\u201cObviously it was a mistake to leave. The lives of the Arabs became much worse, and the lives of the Jews became much, much worse, with rockets and Oct. 7,\u201d she said, referring to the decades of rockets fired from Gaza into Israel and the date in 2023 of the Hamas attack that launched the ongoing war.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe, because of all the terrible things that happened that we predicted, but we\u2019re willing to build there again,\u201d said Tucker.",
      "After Israel\u2019s withdrawal 20 years ago, many Palestinians described Gaza as an \u201copen-air prison.\u201d They had control on the inside \u2013 under a Hamas government that some supported but some saw as heavy-handed and brutal. But ultimately, Israel had a grip around the territory.",
      "Many Palestinians believe Sharon carried out the withdrawal so Israel could focus on cementing its control in the West Bank through settlement building.",
      "Now some believe more direct Israeli occupation is returning to Gaza. After 22 months of war, Israeli troops control more than 75% of Gaza, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks of maintaining security control long term after the war.",
      "Amjad Shawa, the director of the Palestinian NGO Network, said he doesn\u2019t believe Netanyahu will repeat Sharon\u2019s full withdrawal. Instead, he expects the military to continue controlling large swaths of Gaza through \u201cbuffer zones.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe had such a blind spot with Hamas, we didn\u2019t see them morph from a terror organization into an organized military, with battalions and commanders and infrastructure,\u201d he said.",
      "The Oct. 7 attack, Israel\u2019s largest military intelligence failure to date, was not a result of the disengagement, said Harel. \u201cThe main issue is what we did in the 18 years in between.\u201d",

      "The AI-generated errors caused a 24-hour delay in resolving a case that Elliott had hoped to conclude on Wednesday. Elliott ruled on Thursday that Nathwani\u2019s client, who cannot be identified because he is a minor, was not guilty of murder because of mental impairment.",
      "\u201cAt the risk of understatement, the manner in which these events have unfolded is unsatisfactory,\u201d Elliott told lawyers on Thursday.",

      "The errors were discovered by Elliott\u2019s associates, who couldn\u2019t find the cases and requested that defense lawyers provide copies.",
      "The lawyers admitted the citations \u201cdo not exist\u201d and that the submission contained \u201cfictitious quotes,\u201d court documents say.",
      "The lawyers explained they checked that the initial citations were accurate and wrongly assumed the others would also be correct.",

      "A U.N.-backed commission has found widespread and systematic violence against civilians in Syria's coastal region",
      "BEIRUT -- A U.N.-backed commission that investigated sectarian violence on Syria\u2019s coast earlier this year found that there was \u201cwidespread and systematic\u201d violence against civilians perpetrated by some government-affiliated factions, but found no evidence that it was directed by the central government.",
      "An extensive report released Thursday by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria examined the violence that began with clashes between armed groups aligned with former Syrian President Bashar Assad and the new government\u2019s security forces in March. It then spiraled into sectarian revenge attacks and massacres that killed hundreds of civilians from the Alawite religious minority to which Assad belongs.",
      "The violence came months after Assad was ousted in a lightning rebel offensive in December and at a time when the country's new rulers were attempting to forge a new national army out of a patchwork of former insurgent factions.",
      "The commission named several government-affiliated factions whose members allegedly took part in \u201cextrajudicial killings and torture and ill-treatment of primarily the civilian population of Alawi majority villages and neighborhoods in a manner that was both widespread and systematic\" during the coastal violence.",
      "They include the 62nd and 76th divisions of the new Syrian army, also known as the Sultan Suleiman Shah Brigade and the Hamza Division \u2014 both of them formerly part of a coalition made up of Turkish-backed armed factions in northwest Syria. The report also singled out the 400th Division, made up of former brigades of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist rebel group that was formerly led by Syria's current interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa.",
      "However, the report said the commission \"found no evidence of a governmental policy or plan to carry out such attacks.\" It also found that pro-Assad armed groups had committed \u201cacts that likely amount to crimes, including war crimes\" during the violence.",
      "A separate investigation into the coastal violence ordered by the government released its findings last month. It concluded that some members of the new Syrian military had committed \u201cwidespread, serious violations against civilians,\u201d but said there was no evidence that military leaders had ordered those attacks. The government investigation found that more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, were killed.",
      "In a letter in response to Thursday's U.N. report, Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani said the government takes \u201cserious note of the alleged violations\u201d detailed in it the report and said that the recommendations \u2014 which included increased screening of recruits to the security forces and recruiting from minority communities \u2014 \u201cwill serve as a roadmap for Syria's continued progress.\u201d",
      "The U.N. commission's report noted that in the leadup to the coastal violence in March there had been scattered clashes between pro-Assad and new government forces as well as increasing incidents of \u201charassment and violations\" against Alawite communities, \"including killings, abductions, looting or occupation of property.\u201d",
      "In early March, pro-Assad armed groups launched a series of attacks on the General Security forces of the new government along the coast. During the clashes that followed, pro-Assad fighters also overran hospitals, shot at and abducted journalists coming to cover the conflict, and in at least one case shot and killed women and children, the report said.",
      "With the General Security forces overwhelmed, tens of thousands of fighters from allied factions, as well as armed civilians, converged on the coast. Many began raiding houses in Alawite-majority areas, where in many cases they \u201casked civilians whether they were Sunni or Alawi\u201d and \u201dAlawi men and boys were then taken away to be executed,\u201d the report found.",

In some cases, the bodies were then desecrated, and family members were prevented from burying their dead.",
      "The report also found that there had been widespread cases of robbery and looting by armed groups.",
      "The commission also investigated reports of kidnapping of Alawite women and found \u201ccredible information\u201d of at least six cases in the weeks preceding and following the main outbreak of violence in March. It is investigating \u201cdozens\u201d of other reports. In at least two of the confirmed cases, the victims were \u201cabducted for the purpose of forced marriage,\u201d while in other cases, the kidnappers demanded ransoms from the victims' families.",
      "In one particularly disturbing case prior to the coastal clashes, the report said masked men dressed in black and wearing black headbands inscribed with \u201cThere is no god but God\u201d abducted a woman from the street and gang-raped her, then sold her to an older man to whom she was forcibly married.",
      "\u201cThe Commission is not aware of any individuals being arrested or prosecuted yet in connection with these abductions,\u201d the report said.",
      "The investigation into the coastal violence comes as Syria is reeling from another outbreak of sectarian violence last month that has again threatened the country's fragile political transition after nearly 14 years of civil war.",
      "This time, clashes broke out in the southern Sweida province between government forces and local Bedouin tribesmen on one side, and fighters from the country\u2019s Druze minority on the other. Hundreds were killed and tens of thousands displaced, and allegations have surfaced of government fighters executing Druze civilians and looting and burning houses.",
      "The government has again launched an investigation into the allegations, but minority communities have become increasingly wary of the Sunni Muslim-led authorities. Last week, representatives of Syria\u2019s various ethnic and religious groups held a conference in Kurdish-controlled northeastern Syrian city and called for the formation of a decentralized state and the drafting of a new constitution that guarantees religious, cultural and ethnic pluralism.",

      "The top court upheld lower court rulings dating back to 2021 and 2023 that found no sufficient grounds to conclude the company, Pinkfong, infringed on Jonathan Wright\u2019s copyright.",
      "Wright, also known as Johnny Only, released his version in 2011, four years before Pinkfong\u2019s, but both were based on a traditional melody popular for years at children\u2019s summer camps in the United States.",
      "The courts ruled Wright\u2019s version did not differ enough from the original melody to qualify as an original creative work eligible for copyright protection, and that Pinkfong\u2019s song had clear differences from Wright\u2019s.",

      "Baby Shark remains a crucial product for Pinkfong, which earned 45.1 billion won ($32.6 million) in revenue in the first half of 2025, according to its regulatory filing.

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s new liberal president, Lee Jae Myung, said Friday he will seek to restore a 2018 military agreement with North Korea aimed at reducing border tensions and urged Pyongyang to respond to Seoul\u2019s efforts to rebuild trust and revive dialogue.",
      "Speaking on the 80th anniversary of Korea\u2019s liberation from Japanese colonial rule, Lee\u2019s overture came amid soaring tensions fueled by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s nuclear ambitions and deepening ties with Russia over the war in Ukraine.",
      "The 2018 military agreement, reached during a brief period of diplomacy between Kim and South Korea\u2019s former liberal President Moon Jae-in, created buffer zones on land and sea and no-fly zones above the border to prevent clashes.",
      "South Korea\u2019s previous conservative government suspended the deal in 2024, citing tensions over North Korea\u2019s launches of trash-laden balloons toward the South, and moved to resume frontline military activities and propaganda campaigns. The step came after North Korea had already declared it would no longer abide by the agreement.",
      "\u201cTo prevent accidental clashes between South and North Korea and to build military trust, we will take proactive, gradual steps to restore the (2018) Sept. 19 military agreement,\u201d Lee said in a televised speech.",
      "Lee said his government affirms \u201cour respect for the North\u2019s current system\u201d and that the wealthier South \u201cwill not pursue any form of unification by absorption and has no intention of engaging in hostile acts.\u201d",
      "Lee said South Korea remains committed to an international push to denuclearize North Korea and urged Pyongyang to resume dialogue with Washington and Seoul. Amid a prolonged diplomatic stalemate with its rivals, Kim\u2019s government has made clear it has no intention of giving up the weapons it sees as its strongest guarantee of survival and would reject any future talks on denuclearization.",
      "\u201cDenuclearization is a complex and difficult task that cannot be resolved quickly,\u201d Lee said. \u201cHowever, inter-Korean and U.S.-North Korea dialogue as well as international cooperation will help us approach a peaceful resolution.\u201d",
      "Japan\u2019s defeat in World War II liberated Korea from colonial rule, but the peninsula was then divided into a U.S.-backed, capitalist South and a Soviet-supported, socialist North \u2014 a separation cemented by the devastating 1950\u201353 Korean War.",
      "Lee, whose speech came days before he plans to travel to Japan for a summit with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, took a conciliatory tone toward Tokyo, calling for the fellow U.S. allies to overcome grievances rooted in Japan\u2019s brutal colonial rule and develop future-oriented ties. However, he noted that some historical issues remain unresolved and called on the government in Tokyo to \u201csquarely face up to our painful history and strive to maintain trust between our two countries.\u201d",
      "Lee\u2019s meeting with Ishiba will come just before he flies to Washington for a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump over trade and defense issues, a setup that underscores how Trump\u2019s push to reset global trade and U.S. security commitments is drawing the often-feuding neighbors closer.",

      "It\u2019s unclear whether North Korea would respond to Lee\u2019s overture. Expressing anger over Yoon\u2019s hardline policies and expansion of South Korean-U.S. military exercises, Kim last year declared that North Korea was abandoning long-standing goals of a peaceful unification with South Korea and rewrote the North\u2019s constitution to mark the South as a permanent enemy.",
      "Lee\u2019s speech came a day after Kim\u2019s powerful sister mocked his government for clinging to hopes of renewed diplomacy between the war-divided rivals, and misleading the public by falsely claiming the North had removed its own frontline speakers as a reciprocal gesture toward the South. South Korea\u2019s military maintains that it confirmed the North dismantling some of its speakers.",
      "Kim Yo Jong also reiterated previous North Korean statements that it has no immediate interest in reviving long-stalled negotiations with Washington and Seoul, citing an upcoming joint military exercise between the allies as proof of their continued hostility toward Pyongyang.",
      "Analysts say North Korea clearly sees no urgency to resume diplomacy with South Korea or the United States, remaining focused on its alignment with Russia.

Police fired tear gas in at least two cities and numerous other incidents were reported throughout the country.",

      "Paleontologists have identified a new whale species from a 25-million-year-old fossil found on an Australian beach",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Long before whales were majestic, gentle giants, some of their prehistoric ancestors were tiny, weird and feral. A chance discovery of a 25 million-year-old fossil on an Australian beach has allowed paleontologists to identify a rare, entirely new species that could unlock mysteries of whale evolution.",
      "Researchers this week officially named Janjucetus dullardi, a cartoonish creature with bulging eyes the size of tennis balls, in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. Unlike today's whales, the juvenile specimen was small enough to fit in a single bed.",
      "Boasting fiendish teeth and a shark-like snout, however, this oddball of the ocean was nasty, mean and built to hunt.",
      "\u201cIt was, let\u2019s say, deceptively cute,\u201d said Erich Fitzgerald, senior curator of vertebrate paleontology at Museums Victoria Research Institute, and one of the paper's authors.",
      "\u201cIt might have looked for all the world like some weird kind of mash-up between a whale, a seal and a Pok\u00e9mon but they were very much their own thing.\u201d",
      "The rare discovery of the partial skull, including ear bones and teeth, was made in 2019 on a fossil-rich stretch of coast along Australia\u2019s Victoria state. Jan Juc Beach, a cradle for some of the weirdest whales in history, is becoming a hotspot for understanding early whale evolution, Fitzgerald said.",
      "Few family trees seem stranger than that of Janjucetus dullardi, only the fourth species ever identified from a group known as mammalodontids, early whales that lived only during the Oligocene Epoch, about 34 to 23 million years ago. That marked the point about halfway through the known history of whales.",
      "The tiny predators, thought to have grown to 3 meters (10 feet) in length, were an early branch on the line that led to today\u2019s great baleen whales, such as humpbacks, blues and minkes. But the toothy ancestors with powerful jaws would have looked radically different to any modern species.",
      "\u201cThey may have had tiny little nubbins of legs just projecting as stumps from the wall of the body,\u201d said Fitzgerald.",
      "That mystery will remain tantalizingly unsolved unless a specimen is uncovered with more of its skeleton intact, which would be something of a miracle. Even the partial skull that allowed the initial identification this week was an astonishing discovery.",
      "Janjucetus dullardi was named by researchers after an amateur fossil hunter who doesn\u2019t mind its looks in the slightest.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s literally been the greatest 24 hours of my life,\u201d said Ross Dullard, who discovered the skull while fossil hunting at Jan Juc Beach. After Wednesday\u2019s confirmation of the new species, the school principal walked like a rock star onto campus with \u201chigh fives coming left, right and center,\u201d he said.",
      "His friends and family are probably just relieved it\u2019s over.",

      "He knew enough to recognize it was unlikely to belong to a dog or a seal.",
      "\u201cI thought, geez, we\u2019ve got something special here,\u201d he said. Dullard sent photos to Museums Victoria, where Fitzgerald saw them and immediately suspected a new species.",
      "Confirming the find was another matter. This was the first mammalodontid to be identified in Australia since 2006 and only the third on record in the country.",
      "Fossils of sufficient quality, with enough of the right details preserved to confirm uniqueness, aren\u2019t common.",
      "\u201cCetaceans represent a fairly miniscule population of all life,\u201d Fitzgerald said. Millions of years of erosion, scavengers and ocean currents take their toll on whale skeletons too.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s only the chosen few, the vast minority of all whales that have ever lived and died in the oceans over millions of years, that actually get preserved as fossils,\u201d he added.",
      "Finds such as Janjucetus dullardi can unlock insights into how prehistoric whales ate, moved, behaved \u2014 and evolved. Researchers said the discoveries also helped to understand how ancient cetacean species adapted to warmer oceans, as they study how today\u2019s marine life might respond to climate change.",
      "Meanwhile, Dullard planned to host a fossil party this weekend, featuring cetacean-themed games and whale-shaped treats in jello, to celebrate his nightmare Muppet find, finally confirmed.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s taken my concentration for six years,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had sleepless nights. I\u2019ve dreamt about this whale.\u201d",

      "The company has faced lawsuits and backlash for not doing enough to protect kids on its gaming services.

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Berkshire Hathaway revealed three new investments Thursday in steelmaker Nucor and two of the nation's biggest homebuilders \u2014 Lennar and DR Horton \u2014 but none of the investments are big enough to ensure that legendary investor Warren Buffett handled them.",
      "Buffett, who plans to retire as CEO at the end of the year after six decades of building Berkshire, handles all of the conglomerate's biggest investments worth $1 billion or more. All three of these new investments disclosed Thursday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission are worth less than that, so they could be the ideas of one of Berkshire's two other investment managers.",
      "Berkshire's filings simply offer a snapshot of its $258 billion portfolio at the end of the second quarters. Many investors comb through Berkshire's filings every quarter because they like to follow Buffett's moves. His record of trouncing the S&P 500 for decades has inspired legions of followers.",
      "The filing doesn't make clear who at Berkshire handled each investment. Besides Buffett, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs also pick stocks, but they generally handle smaller portfolios and Combs also serves as Geico's CEO. But Buffett has had a hard time finding stocks or any other investments in recent years that he wants to invest much of Berkshire's $344 billion cash in.",
      "Berkshire's Nucor stake of 6.6 million shares was the biggest new investment worth roughly $857 million at the end of the quarter. Shares of that company rose more than 6% in extended after-hours trading.",

    "story": [
      "Allegheny County is increasing air quality monitoring after an explosion at a U.S. Steel plant south of Pittsburgh killed two people and injured more than 10 others",
      "The Pennsylvania county where an explosion at a U.S. Steel plant south of Pittsburgh killed two people and injured more than 10 others announced Thursday that it is stepping up air quality monitoring in the area of the sprawling facility that has a troubled environmental record.",
      "The Allegheny County Health Department announced that mobile air units provided by the state and Carnegie Mellon University will be stationed in the Mon Valley where the plant is Thursday and Friday. The county said these measures are part of its ongoing investigation into Monday's explosion at Clairton Coke Works.",
      "The county said the measures go \u201cwell beyond the normal and rigorous regulatory air quality monitoring\u201d and will assess parts of the valley for different types of pollutants such as volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 pollutants and sulfur dioxide.",
      "After Monday\u2019s blast, the county health department initially told residents within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the plant to remain indoors and close all windows and doors. The department lifted the advisory after its monitors didn\u2019t detect levels of soot or sulfur dioxide above federal standards.",
      "The Allegheny County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office also confirmed Thursday that the second person who died in the blast was Steven Menefee, 52, of Clairton. Earlier, the county medical examiner\u2019s office identified one of the dead as Timothy Quinn, 39.",
      "U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt said Tuesday the company is working closely with local, state and federal authorities. He would not speculate about the cause of the explosion.",
      "The massive plant along the Monongahela River in Clairton converts coal to coke, a key component in the steelmaking process. The facility is considered the largest coking operation in North America and is one of four major U.S. Steel plants in Pennsylvania.",
      "To make coke, coal is baked in special ovens for hours at high temperatures to remove impurities that could otherwise weaken steel. The process creates what is known as coke gas \u2014 a lethal mix of methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.",
      "The plant has a long history of environmental problems, especially fouling the air in communities nearby the sprawling plant.",
      "In 2018, a Christmas Eve fire damaged pollution-control equipment and led to repeated releases of sulfur dioxide, according to a subsequent lawsuit. The fire prompted Allegheny County to warn residents to limit outdoor activities. Residents said it was hard to breathe for weeks afterward and that the air felt acidic and smelled like rotten eggs. U.S. Steel settled a lawsuit last year with an agreement to spend $19.5 million in equipment upgrades and $5 million on local clean air efforts and programs.",

      "Matthew Mehalik, executive director of the Breathe Project, a public health advocacy group in Pittsburgh, said the regulations were deemed to be almost insignificant to operational costs and would have helped protect the public with air quality monitoring.",
      "The regulation would have required \u2014 like is already required at refineries all over the United States \u2014 fence-line monitoring for hazardous air pollutants at the Clairton plant, Mehalik said.",

      "NEW YORK -- WK Kellogg Co. plans to remove artificial dyes from its breakfast cereals in the next two and a half years, according to the company and the attorney general of Texas. The maker of Froot Loops and Apple Jacks gave the timeline as U.S. food producers face increasing pressure from the U.S. government and consumers to phase out synthetic colorings from their products.",

      "Paxton launched an investigation earlier this year into whether Kellogg violated state consumer protection laws by continuing to use blue, red, yellow, green, and orange artificial dyes. Around the same time, U.S. health officials said that they would urge foodmakers to voluntarily work toward removing petroleum-based colors.",
      "Both Kellogg and General Mills, another major U.S. cereal maker, said they would. General Mills later joined Kraft Heinz, Nestle, Smuckers and some other food manufacturers in announcing target dates for making all their products without artificial dyes.",
      "But Paxton's office said Kellogg was the first to sign a \u201clegally binding\u201d agreement. \u201cFollowing months of investigating and negotiating, I\u2019m proud to officially say Kellogg\u2019s will stop putting these unhealthy ingredients in its cereals,\u201d the attorney general said in a statement.",
      "Details about the terms of the agreement Kellogg signed, which is legally known as an assurance of voluntary compliance, were not immediately clear. The company did not comment on it directly when reached by The Associated Press on Thursday but said it appreciates \u201cthe opportunity to work collaboratively with the Texas AG\u2019s office and share their focus on health and wellness.\u201d",
      "Kellogg also pointed to its earlier commitment to phase out FD&C dyes, which are synthetic additives that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for use in food, drugs and cosmetics. It said it already planned to stop launching new products with the dyes in January.",

      "The U.S. has seen a record increase in tariff income, with a 273% rise in customs revenue from last year",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. budget deficit in July climbed 20% this fiscal year compared to the last despite the U.S. taking in record income from President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, according to Treasury Department data released Tuesday.",
      "The U.S. saw a 273% increase \u2014 or $21 billion \u2014 in customs revenue in July over the same period last year, the data showed.",
      "A Treasury official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the data said overall increased spending is in part due to a mix of expenditures, including growing interest payments on the public debt and cost-of-living increases to Social Security payouts, among other costs. This comes as the federal government\u2019s gross national debt creeps up to the $37 trillion mark.",
      "Even as Trump talks about America becoming rich because of his import tax hikes, federal spending keeps outpacing the revenues collected by the government. That financial picture might change as companies exhaust their pre-tariff inventories, forcing them to import more goods and generate even more in tax revenues that could whittle away at the deficit without meaningfully reducing it as promised.",
      "If tariffs fail to deliver on Trump's pledge to improve the government's balance sheet, the American public could be faced with fewer job options, more inflationary pressures and higher interest rates on mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. The budget deficit is the annual gap between what the U.S. government raises in taxes and what it spends, over time feeding into the overall national debt.",
      "While organizations like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget say that tariff income can be a stream of meaningful revenue \u2014 estimated to generate about $1.3 trillion over the course of President Trump\u2019s four-year term in office; some economists like Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Penn Wharton Budget Model say tariffs are likely to result \u201c in only modest reductions in federal debt.\u201d",
      "In June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall. But revenue estimates are also difficult to predict as the president has changed his tariff rates repeatedly and the taxes declared as part of an economic emergency are currently under appeal in a U.S. court.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s new President Lee Jae Myung will travel to Washington later this month to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump, Lee\u2019s office said Tuesday, for talks on trade and defense cooperation in the face of nuclear-armed North Korea and other threats.",
      "Their Aug. 25 summit will follow a July trade deal in which Washington agreed to cut its reciprocal tariff on South Korea to 15% from the initially proposed 25% and to apply the same reduced rate to South Korean cars, the country\u2019s top export to the United States.",
      "South Korea also agreed to purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy and invest $350 billion in the country, and Lee and Trump may discuss how the investment package will be structured and managed. The talks are expected to cover expanding cooperation in key industries such as semiconductors, batteries and shipbuilding, Lee\u2019s spokesperson Kang Yu-jung said.",
      "Lee, a liberal who won an early election in June to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, has made the economy his top priority, aiming to shield the trade-dependent nation from the shocks of Trump\u2019s tariff hikes and his demands that allies cut reliance on Washington and shoulder more of their own defense costs.",
      "Lee's meeting with Trump comes amid concerns in Seoul that the Trump administration could shake up the decades-old alliance by demanding higher payments for the U.S. troop presence in South Korea and possibly move to reduce it as Washington shifts more focus on China.",
      "Lee and Trump will discuss strengthening the allies\u2019 defense posture against growing North Korean threats, and also developing the partnership into a \u201cfuture-oriented, comprehensive strategic alliance\u201d to address the changing international security and economic environment, according to Kang, who didn\u2019t elaborate on the specific issues to be addressed.",
      "Dating back to his first term, Trump has regularly called for South Korea to pay more for the 28,500 American troops stationed on its soil. Recent comments by key Trump administration officials, including Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby, have also suggested a desire to restructure the alliance, which some experts say could potentially affect the size and role of U.S. forces in South Korea.",
      "Under this approach, South Korea would take a greater role in countering North Korean threats while U.S. forces focus more on China, possibly leaving Seoul to face reduced benefits but increased costs and risks, experts say.",
      "In a meeting with South Korean reporters last week, Gen. Xavier Brunson, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, stressed the need to \u201cmodernize\u201d the alliance to address the evolving security environment, including North Korea\u2019s expanding nuclear program, its deepening alignment with Russia, and what he called Chinese threats to a \u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhat\u2019s being asked of Korea is to be stronger against DPRK \u2014 that we might have the flexibility as we modernize our alliance so that we could go do other things,\u201d Brunson said, using the initials of North Korea\u2019s formal name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.",
      "During his first term, Trump suspended U.S. military exercises with South Korea while pursuing diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. They met three times in 2018 and 2019 but their diplomacy quickly collapsed over disagreements about exchanging the release of U.S.-led sanctions against the North and the North\u2019s steps to wind down its nuclear and missile program.",
      "Kim has since suspended virtually all diplomacy with Washington and Seoul while accelerating the expansion of his weapons program. His foreign policy priority is now Russia, which he has supplied with weapons and troops to help prolong Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Kim\u2019s powerful sister recently dismissed Washington and Seoul\u2019s stated desires to restart diplomacy aimed at defusing the North\u2019s nuclear program, indicating that Pyongyang feels no urgency to resume diplomacy with South Korea and the U.S. anytime soon.",
      "Tensions on the peninsula could rise again later this month, when South Korea and the United States proceed with their annual large-scale combined military exercises, which begin on Aug. 18. North Korea labels the allies\u2019 joint drills as invasion rehearsals and often uses them as a pretext to dial up military demonstrations and weapons tests aimed at advancing its nuclear program.",

      "According to the lawsuit filed in Hawaii Circuit Court on Friday, Ohtani\u2019s agent, Nez Balelo, increasingly demanded concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto before demanding that their business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, drop them from the deal.",
      "\u201cBalelo and Otani, who were brought into the venture solely for Otani\u2019s promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs\u2019 role in the project \u2014 for no reason other than their own financial self-interest,\u201d the lawsuit claims.",
      "The suit accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say that Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture.",
      "A spokesman for Balelo's agency, CAA Baseball, declined comment. Attempts to reach Kingsbarn officials for comment were not immediately successful.",
      "\u201cThis case is about abuse of power,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cDefendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built.",
      "\u201cDefendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants\u2019 misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all \u2014 celebrity or not.\u201d",
      "Ohtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. A five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series.",
      "Investment materials for The Vista at Mauna Kea Resort, which remained online on Monday night, listed Hayes and Matsumoto as part of the management team, along with Kingsbarn. It called Ohtani \u201cJapan's Babe Ruth\u201d and the \u201c1st Resident,\u201d giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, \u201cone of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii,\u201d Hapuna Beach, \u201crated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler\u201d and two golf courses \u2013 one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr.",

      "The suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and \u201cas part of a bold marketing strategy\u201d signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, \u201cone of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable.\"",

      "The reason: There simply are more national games than ever, now that the league\u2019s new 11-year, $76 billion agreements with ABC-ESPN, NBC-Peacock and Amazon Prime Video are about to formally begin.",
      "There will be 247 games scheduled on those networks this season, up from 172 last season between ABC, ESPN and TNT.",
      "Other notes from this season\u2019s schedule release:",
      "The NBA, which did not play on Election Day in 2022, 2023 or 2024, will have games on that date this season. It falls on Nov. 4.",
      "The NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder play the Los Angeles Clippers as part of the six-game slate on that date.",
      "There is one special election to fill a congressional seat on that date this year, along with two gubernatorial races and numerous state and local races. The NBA still plans to not have games on Election Days during midterm and Presidential election years, which would mean no games on those dates in 2026 or 2028.",
      "There will be games this season on April 6, the day of the NCAA men\u2019s basketball national championship game in Indianapolis.",
      "Atlanta, Orlando, Memphis, San Antonio and Denver all host games on that date. The Knicks at Atlanta is the Peacock game.",
      "There were two games on NCAA title day last season, breaking the unofficial tradition of the league not playing on that night.",
      "The final day of the regular season is April 12, and all 30 teams will be playing. But the league is rolling back the start times; all games were at either 1 p.m. or 3:30 p.m. Eastern last season, and it\u2019ll be either 6 p.m. or 8:30 p.m. this season.",
      "One advantage to that: All games will end, and some will be played in their entirety, after the final putt drops in the final round of the Masters at Augusta National Golf Club that same day. The Masters typically ends around 7 p.m. Eastern.",
      "All 30 teams also will play on Friday, April 10. There are no games on Saturday, April 11. The play-in tournament begins on April 14.",

      "Organizers of the Los Angeles Olympics will sell naming rights for a handful of its venues in deals expected to bring multiple millions of dollars to the 2028 Games while breaking down the International Olympic Committee's long-sacrosanct policy of keeping brand names off its arenas and stadiums.",
      "The organizing committee announced the landmark deal Thursday, saying contracts were already in place with two of its founding partners \u2014 Honda, which already has naming rights for the arena in Anaheim that will host volleyball, and Comcast, which will have its name on the temporary venue hosting squash.",
      "LA28 chairman and CEO Casey Wasserman said revenue from the deals goes above what's in LA's current $6.9 billion budget.",
      "He portrayed the deal as the sort of paradigm-shifting arrangement that Los Angeles needs more than other host cities because, as is typical for American-hosted Olympics, the core cost of these games aren't backed by government funding.",
      "\u201cWe're a private enterprise responsible for delivering these games,\u201d Wasserman said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt's my job to push. That doesn't mean we're going to win every time we push, but it's our job to always push because our context is pretty unique.\u201d",
      "Wasserman said he also spent time explaining to IOC members how arena and stadium names are part of the lexicon in American sports.",
      "\u201cPeople know \u2018Crypto\u2019 as 'Crypto,' they don't know it as \u2018the gymnastics arena downtown,\u2019\" Wasserman said of the home of the Lakers, Crypto.com Arena, which will host gymnastics and boxing in 2028.",
      "Rights for up to 19 temporary venues could be available. The IOC's biggest sponsors \u2014 called TOP sponsors \u2014 will have first chance to get in on the deals. Wasserman said no venues will be renamed \u2014 so, for instance, if organizers don't reach a deal with SoFi (opening and closing ceremonies, swimming) or Intuit (basketball), no other sponsor can put its name on the arena.",
      "Not included in this new arrangement are the LA Coliseum, Rose Bowl and Dodger Stadium, some of the most iconic venues in a city that hosted the Olympics in 1932 and 1984. Organizers said IOC rules that forbid advertising on the field of play will still apply.",
      "The deal adds to a growing list of accommodations pushed through for Los Angeles, which is once again poised to reshape the Olympic brand, much the way it did in 1984.",
      "In 2017, the city was bidding for the 2024 Olympics against Paris, but agreed to instead host the 2028 Games. It was part of a then-unheard-of bid process that rescued the IOC from the reality that cities were becoming reluctant to absorb the cost and effort to bid for and host the Summer Games.",

      "Paramount and UFC have announced a billion-dollar rights deal, marking a significant shift for the fight company",
      "Hours after Paramount and UFC announced a billion-dollar rights deal, Dana White said he had yet to hear from his friend, President Donald Trump, on his thoughts about the fight company\u2019s new streaming home.",
      "That was fine with White. The UFC CEO was set to travel to Washington on Aug. 28 to meet with Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, to catch up and discuss logistics on the proposed Fourth of July fight card next year at the White House.",
      "Trump said last month he wanted to stage a UFC match on the White House grounds with upwards of 20,000 spectators to celebrate 250 years of American independence.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely going to happen,\" White told The Associated Press. \u201cThink about that, the 250th birthday of the United States of America, the UFC will be on the White House south lawn live on CBS.\u201d",
      "The idea of cage fights at the White House would have seemed improbable when the Fertitta brothers purchased UFC for $2 million in 2001 and put White in charge of the fledging fight promotion.",
      "White helped steer the company into a $4 billion sale in 2016 and broadcast rights deals with Fox and ESPN before landing owner TKO Group's richest one yet \u2014 a seven-year deal with Paramount starting in 2026 worth an average of $1.1 billion a year, with all cards on its streaming platform Paramount+ and select numbered events also set to simulcast on CBS.",
      "ESPN, Amazon and Netflix and other traditional sports broadcast players seemed more in play for UFC rights \u2014 White had previously hinted fights could air across different platforms \u2014 but Paramount was a serious contender from the start of the negotiating window.",
      "The Paramount and UFC deal came just days after Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger \u2014 kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line. White said he was impressed with the vision Skydance CEO David Ellison had for the the global MMA leader early in contract talks and how those plans should blossom now that Ellison is chairman and CEO of Paramount.",
      "\u201cWhen you talk about Paramount, you talk about David Ellison, they're brilliant businessmen, very aggressive, risk takers,\u201d White said. \u201cThey're right up my alley. These are the kind of guys that I like to be in business with.\u201d",
      "The $1.1 billion deals marks a notable jump from the roughly $550 million that ESPN paid each year for UFC coverage today. But UFC\u2019s new home on Paramount will simplify offerings for fans \u2014 with all content set to be available on Paramount+ (which currently costs between $7.99 and $12.99 a month), rather than various pay-per-view fees.",
      "Paramount also said it intends to explore UFC rights outside the U.S. \u201cas they become available in the future.\u201d",
      "UFC matchmakers were set to meet this week to shape what White said would be a loaded debut Paramount card. The UFC boss noted it was still too early to discuss a potential main event for the White House fight night.",
      "\u201cThis is a 1-of-1 event,\u201d White said.",
      "There are still some moving parts to UFC broadcasts and other television programming it has its hands in as the company moves into the Paramount era. White said there are still moving parts to the deal and that includes potentially finding new homes for \u201cThe Ultimate Fighter,\u201d \u201cRoad To UFC,\u201d and \u201cDana White\u2019s Contender Series.\u201d It's not necessarily a given the traditional 10 p.m. start time for what were the pay-per-view events would stand, especially on nights cards will also air on CBS.",

Again, most of those issues are to-be-determined as UFC and Paramount settle in to the new deal \u2014 with $1.1 billion headed the fight company's way.",
      "\u201cIt will affect fighter pay, big time,\u201d White said. \u201cFrom deal-to-deal, fighter pay has grown, too. Every time we win, everybody wins.\u201d",
      "Boxer Jake Paul wrote on social media the dying PPV model \u2014 which was overpriced for fights as UFC saw a decline in buys because of missing star power in many main events \u2014 should give the fighters an increased idea of their worth.",
      "\u201cEvery fighter in the UFC now has a clear picture of what the revenue is...no more PPV excuses,\u201d Paul wrote. \u201cGet your worth boys and girls.\u201d",
      "White also scoffed at the idea that the traditional PPV model is dead.",
      "There are still UFC cards on pay-per-view the rest of the year through the end of the ESPN contract and White and Saudi Arabia have teamed to launch a new boxing venture that starts next year and could use a PPV home.

      "\u201cYou have the NFL, the NBA, the UFC, and soccer globally,\u201d White said. \u201cWe\u2019re coming. We\u2019re coming for all of them.\u201d",

      "The Minnesota Twins are no longer for sale after a 10-month exploratory process, according to executive chair Joe Pohlad",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Twins are no longer for sale, executive chair Joe Pohlad announced Wednesday on behalf of his family.",
      "After exploring a variety of options since publicizing the sale 10 months ago, the Pohlad family will remain the principal owner of the club and add new investors instead. Carl Pohlad, a banking magnate and the late grandfather of Joe Pohlad, purchased the Twins in 1984 for $44 million.",
      "\u201cFor more than four decades, our family has had the privilege of owning the Minnesota Twins. This franchise has become part of our family story, as it has for our employees, our players, this community, and Twins fans everywhere,\" Joe Pohlad said in his announcement. \u201cOver the past several months, we explored a wide range of potential investment and ownership opportunities. Our focus throughout has been on what\u2019s best for the long-term future of the Twins. We have been fully open to all possibilities.\u201d",
      "Pohlad said the family was in the process of adding two \u201csignificant\u201d limited partnership groups to bring in fresh ideas, bolster critical partnerships and shape the long-term vision of the franchise that relocated to Minnesota in 1961 after originating as the Washington Senators. Details about the new investors were being kept private until Major League Baseball approval of the transactions, Pohlad said.",
      "Financial analysis earlier this year by Forbes valued the franchise at $1.5 billion, ranked 23rd in MLB. Sportico ($1.7 billion) and CNBC ($1.65 billion) pegged them higher.",
      "The Pohlads hired Allen & Company, a New York-based investment bank, to direct the sale and keep inquiries confidential. Multiple published reports identified Justin Ishbia, a part owner of the NBA's Phoenix Suns, as the front-runner. But the Chicago White Sox announced last month that Ishbia was becoming a limited partner in a deal that provides a runway for him to become controlling owner.",
      "MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred acknowledged during the All-Star break, without naming him directly, that Ishbia's decision sidetracked the process.",
      "\u201cThere will be a transaction,\" Manfred said. \"You just need to be patient while they rework.\u201d",
      "The Twins are on track for their lowest attendance total in 16 seasons at Target Field, and an ownership-mandated payroll reduction last year in light of decreased regional television revenue, among other factors, has contributed to a dissatisfied customer base. The Twins traded 10 players off their roster leading up to the July 31 deadline, furthering the frustration.",
      "Word that the Pohlads are staying put certainly won't help the morale of Minnesota baseball fans, who've been waiting for another World Series title since 1991 and saw the investment in the roster plunge right after an American League Central title in 2023. The Twins won a playoff series then, too, their first in 21 years.",
      "\u201cWe see and hear the passion from our partners, the community, and Twins fans. That passion inspires us,\" Pohlad said. \"This ownership group is committed to building a winning team and culture for this region, one that Twins fans are proud to cheer for.\u201d",

He said one of the investment groups is made up of Minnesotans and the other is a family based on the East Coast.",
      "Pohlad also said the teardown of the roster was not driven by a request from ownership to further cut costs.",

      "The San Francisco 49ers are counting on receiver Ricky Pearsall to step up this season",
      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Any contribution the San Francisco 49ers got from receiver Ricky Pearsall last season was viewed as a positive after his rookie campaign got derailed when he got shot in the chest a week before the opener.",
      "The 49ers are counting heavily on Pearsall this season as they need him to elevate his performance in year two after they traded away Deebo Samuel and are expecting to be without Brandon Aiyuk for most of the first half of the season.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m approaching it the same exact way,\u201d Pearsall said. \u201cWhether those guys are in the room or not, that\u2019s just how I look at myself. I just got to be able to step in that role. That\u2019s just how I look at it.\"",
      "Pearsall is one of several second-year players being counted on for major breakthroughs this season. The flashes they showed as rookies now need to lead to more consistent performances this season.",
      "Here's a look at some of the top breakout candidates:",
      "Pearsall didn't even make his debut last season until Week 7 and then had only two catches over a five-game stretch from Week 11 through 15. But he showed why he was a first-round pick with his performance in the final two weeks of the season when he had 14 catches for 210 yards and two TDs.",
      "Pearsall spent extra time in the offseason working with quarterback Brock Purdy to build chemistry and has been the team's best wideout early in training camp as he has shown repeatedly his ability to get open down the field to create big plays.",
      "The 33rd pick in last year's draft had only 29 catches on 57 targets as a rookie as he was unable to fill the void created when the Bills traded away Stefon Diggs.",
      "Buffalo thrived without consistent production from Coleman thanks in part to a big season from Khalil Shakir, but the Bills will need another top outside threat if they want to get over the hump and make it to the Super Bowl. Coleman is the best choice for that thanks to his big frame and ability to make contested catches down field.",
      "The 11th pick in last year's draft started just seven games as a rookie as the team eased his transition to the NFL behind veteran tackles Tyronn Smith and Morgan Moses.",
      "That won't be the case this season when Fashanu is slated to start at left tackle across from rookie Armand Membou as New York hopes it has found its bookend tackles for years to come.",

      "The third-round pick out of Houston Christian was a pleasant surprise in his limited action as a rookie with 1 1/2 sacks in the regular season and then 1 1/2 more in the playoffs.",
      "Hunt has gone from a bit of a luxury to more of a necessity after the Eagles lost Josh Sweat to free agency, Brandon Graham to retirement and traded away Bryce Huff. Hunt is slated to start this season but could be pushed by veteran acquisitions Joshua Uche and Azeez Ojulari.",
      "The first defensive player taken in the 2024 draft had a relatively quiet rookie season with four sacks and 38 pressures. But a year of experience and the change in scheme under new defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo should help Latu emerge as one of the better young pass rushers.",
      "Injuries limited Robinson to six games as a rookie and his impact was minimal with just one sack and two pressures. Robinson is now part of a revamped defensive front that the Cardinals hope can lead the team back to the postseason. A healthy season and the addition of veterans Sweat, Calais Campbell and Dalvin Tomlinson should open things up for Robinson.",

      "All four best-of-three Wild Card Series are scheduled for consecutive days from Sept. 30 to Oct. 2 at the side of the higher seed.",
      "Twelve teams make the playoffs under the format that began in 2022. The top two teams in each league get first-round byes, while the No. 3 seed faces No. 6 and No. 4 plays No. 5. The higher seed will be home in each best-of-three series.",

      "BOSTON -- A manatee was recently spotted off the coast of Massachusetts for the first time in almost a decade and scientists want to monitor its condition to see if a rescue is necessary before it succumbs to the cold water or lack of food, they said Friday.",
      "The threatened species, which makes its habitat in warmer southern Gulf waters in places like Florida, was first seen July 26 off the southwestern coast of Cape Cod in the area of Nantucket Sound. Mashpee resident Jennifer Sullivan took a video of it swimming alongside paddle boarders in an inlet behind a marina surrounded by sea grass.",
      "She said on Monday that she found the manatee, which was as long and wide as her paddleboard, \u201cjust lazing around there in the grass going as slowly as possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was completely unfazed by us,\" said Sullivan, who went on to say she felt \u201cjust in awe of how graceful the creature was and to be so close in the wild to it.\u201d",
      "A few days later, the animal was seen stranded on the tidal flats in Mattapoisett. Bystanders who found the manatee beached on the flats around sunrise pushed it back into the water, said Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries Protected Species Program Manager Erin Burke.",
      "It hasn't been spotted since, Burke said, but a team with the International Fund for Animal Welfare is standing by to rescue the animal if it becomes necessary.",
      "The species prefers swimming in warmer waters, usually traveling only as far north as the Carolinas. If the manatee stays in water that is too cold for too long, it could suffer severe illness or death, said New England Aquarium Research Scientist Dr. Nadine Lysiak.",
      "Additionally, manatees are herbivores that sustain themselves on extensive seagrass beds and mangroves not typically found in New England.",
      "\u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t experience cold stunning, it may have some health declines associated with not having enough food, not having enough water,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s important to intervene as soon as it's sighted again to prevent health declines.\u201d",
      "Lysiak said it's unclear how and why the manatee found its way so far north. It may have followed the warm water Gulf Stream current system from Florida up past the Carolinas and eventually found its way to New England, she said.",
      "\u201cWe have kind of an average understanding of what a wild population does in terms of their range, or their habitat range, and some individuals will go beyond that and maybe wander or seek out other habitats or other food sources,\" she said. \"It\u2019s hard to know exactly why this manatee came to Cape Cod.\u201d",

      "Some cottontail rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, have been drawing attention because they have wart-like growths on their faces that look like horns",
      "DENVER -- A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there's no reason to be spooked \u2014 the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.",
      "The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.",
      "Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including \u201cFrankenstein bunnies,\u201d \u201cdemon rabbits\u201d and \u201czombie rabbits.\u201d But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.",
      "The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists' knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.",
      "The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.",
      "News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.",

      "\"People over-assign impact to actually pretty low-impact actions such as recycling, and underestimate the actual carbon impact of behaviors much more carbon intensive, like flying or eating meat,\" said Madalina Vlasceanu, report co-author and professor of environmental social sciences at Stanford University.",
      "The top three individual actions that help the climate, including avoiding plane flights, choosing not to get a dog and using renewable electricity, were also the three that participants underestimated the most. Meanwhile, the lowest-impact actions were changing to more efficient appliances and swapping out light bulbs, recycling, and using less energy on washing clothes. Those were three of the top four overestimated actions in the report.",
      "Vlasceanu said marketing focuses more on recycling and using energy-efficient light bulbs than on why flights or dog adoption are relatively bad for the climate, so participants were more likely to give those actions more weight.",

So that\u2019s why we don\u2019t associate emissions with flying,\u201d said Jiaying Zhao, who teaches psychology and sustainability at the University of British Columbia.",
      "Zhao added it's easier to bring actions to mind that we do more often. \u201cRecycling is an almost daily action, whereas flying is less frequent. It\u2019s less discussed,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result, people give a higher psychological weight to recycling.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere has been a lot of deliberate confusion out there to support policies that are really out of date,\" said Brenda Ekwurzel, a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit.",
      "Dogs are big meat eaters, and meat is a significant contributor to climate change. That is because many of the farm animals, which will become food, release methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Beef is especially impactful, in part because around the world cattle are often raised on land that was illegally deforested. Since trees absorb carbon dioxide, the most abundant greenhouse gas, cutting them to then raise cattle is a double whammy.",

      "Planes emit a lot of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides, also greenhouse gases. Additionally, planes emit contrails, or vapor trails that prevent planet-warming gases from escaping into space. A round-trip economy-class flight on a 737 from New York to Los Angeles produces more than 1,300 pounds of emissions per passenger, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency.",
      "Skipping that single flight saves about as much carbon as swearing off eating all types of meat a year, or living without a car for more than three months, according to U.N. estimates.",
      "Switching to energy that comes from renewable sources, such as solar and wind, has a large positive impact because such sources don't emit greenhouse gases. Some of the biggest climate decisions individuals can make include how they heat and cool their homes and the types of transportation they use. Switching to renewable energy minimizes the impact of both.",
      "Recycling is effective at reducing waste headed for landfill, but its climate impact is relatively small because transporting, processing and repurposing recyclables typically relies on fossil fuels. Plus, less than 10% of plastics actually get recycled, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Other decisions with overestimated impact, including washing clothes in cold water and switching to more efficient light bulbs, are relatively less important. That is because those appliances have a relatively small impact compared to other things, such plane flights and dogs, so improving on them, while beneficial, has a much more limited influence.",

      "Farmer Richard Shika, 68, has had some close encounters. \u201cOne time, I was trying to chase away an elephant that was in my maize field, but it turned and charged me,\u201d Shika remembers. \u201cIt stopped when it was right in front of me, and I managed to jump out of the way.\u201d",

      "The area where Shika has his farm is almost surrounded by Kenya\u2019s biggest National Park. The border of Tsavo East National Park is less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) to the east, and Tsavo West curves around to the north, west and south. The parks have always been unfenced, allowing animals to migrate. Increasingly, that puts them in the path of humans.",

If an elephant touches the wire, the hives are rocked, disturbing the bees. It\u2019s an army of tiny security guards that keeps elephants well away from the farm.",

      "That could soon change. The FAA proposed a new rule last week that would make it easier for companies to fly drones outside of an operator's line of sight and therefore over longer distances. A handful of companies do that now, but they had to obtain waivers and certification as an air carrier to deliver packages.",
      "While the rule is intended to streamline the process, authorized retailers and drone companies that have tested fulfilling orders from the sky say they plan to make drone-based deliveries available to millions more U.S. households.",

The e-commerce company has since expand its drone delivery program to suburban Phoenix and has plans to offer the service in Dallas, San Antonio, Texas, and Kansas City.",
      "The concept of drone delivery has been around for well over a decade. Drone maker Zipline, which works with Walmart in Arkansas and the Dallas-Fort Worth area, began making deliveries to hospitals in Rwanda in 2016. Israel-based Flytrex, one of the drone companies DoorDash works with to carry out orders, launched drone delivery to households in Iceland in 2017.",

      "DoorDash, which works with both Wing and Flytrex, tested drone drop-offs in rural Virginia and greater Dallas before announcing an expansion into Charlotte. Getting takeout food this way may sound futuristic, but it's starting to feel normal in suburban Brisbane, Australia, where DoorDash has employed delivery drones for several years, said Harrison Shih, who leads the company's drone program.",
      "\u201cIt comes so fast and it's something flying into your neighborhood, but it really does seem like part of everyday life,\u201d Shih said.",
      "Even though delivery drones are still considered novel, the cargo they carry can be pretty mundane. Walmart said the top items from the more than 150,000 drone deliveries the nation's largest retailer has completed since 2021 include ice cream, eggs and Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups.",
      "Unlike traditional delivery, where one driver may have a truck full of packages, drones generally deliver one small order at a time. Wing\u2019s drones can carry packages weighing up to 2.5 pounds. They can travel up to 12 miles round trip. One pilot can oversee up to 32 drones.",
      "Zipline has a drone that can carry up to 4 pounds and fly 120 miles round trip. Some drones, like Amazon\u2019s, can carry heavier packages.",
      "Once an order is placed, it's packaged for flight and attached to a drone at a launch site. The drone automatically finds a route that avoids obstacles. A pilot observes as the aircraft flies to its destinations and lowers its cargo to the ground with retractable cords.",
      "Shakiba Enayati, an assistant professor of supply chain and analytics at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, researches ways that drones could speed the delivery of critical health supplies like donated organs and blood samples. The unmanned aircraft offer some advantages as a transport method, such as reduced emissions and improved access to goods for rural residents, Enayati said.",
      "But she also sees plenty of obstacles. Right now, it costs around $13.50 per delivery to carry a package by drone versus $2 for a traditional vehicle, Enayati said. Drones need well-trained employees to oversee them and can have a hard time in certain weather.",

She thinks the same thing could happen with drones, especially as improved technology reduces the chance for errors.",
      "Woodworth added that U.S. airspace is tightly controlled, and companies need to demonstrate to the FAA that their drones are safe and reliable before they are cleared to fly. Even under the proposed new rules, the FAA would set detailed requirements for drone operators.",

      "Others worry that drones may potentially replace human delivery drivers. Shih thinks that\u2019s unlikely. One of DoorDash's most popular items is 24-packs of water, Shih said, which aren't realistic for existing drones to ferry.",

      "DoorDash said that in the areas where it offers drone deliveries, orders requiring the services of human delivery drivers also increase.",
      "That\u2019s been the experience of John Kim, the owner of PurePoke restaurant in Frisco, Texas. Kim signed on to offer drone deliveries through DoorDash last year. He doesn\u2019t know what percentage of his DoorDash customers are choosing the service instead of regular delivery, but his overall DoorDash orders are up 15% this year.",

      "Toth now orders drone delivery a few times a month. Her 9-year-old daughter Julep said friends often come over to watch the drone.",

      "The tests initially will only affect a sliver of YouTube's audience in the U.S., but it will likely become more pervasive if the system works as well at guessing viewers' ages as it does in other parts of the world. The system will only work when viewers are logged into their accounts, and it will make its age assessments regardless of the birth date a user might have entered upon signing up.",

      "The safeguards include reminders to take a break from the screen, privacy warnings and restrictions on video recommendations. YouTube, which has been owned by Google for nearly 20 years, also doesn't show ads tailored to individual tastes if a viewer is under 18.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- Sixty years ago, residents of a canal-crossed borough in Mexico City could pluck axolotls \u2014 the large salamander reminiscent of a tiny dragon \u2014 out of the water with their hands because they were so plentiful. Now it\u2019s almost impossible to find them in the wild.",

      "\u201cWe all shed DNA along our path across the world and that can be captured by filtering air or water,\u201d said biologist Luis Zambrano, from the university's ecological restoration lab.",
      "As they try to monitor the axolotls\u2019 dwindling numbers, scientists increasingly rely on this technique as their nets come back empty during periodic surveys of the population, which is only found in Xochimilco.",
      "They sample water taken from the canals and filter it for environmental DNA, or the genetic particles left by animals and plants that have contact with the water. That\u2019s then compared to the profiles contained in a genetic library put together some years ago by British scientists, said Esther Quintero of Conservation International in Mexico, which has collaborated with Zambrano since 2023.",

      "Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia\u2019s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.",
      "The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.",

      "Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren\u2019t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.",

      "Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% \u2014 or $9.3 billion \u2014 of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.",
      "Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers \u201cpaying billions more than is necessary.\u201d",

      "More than 70 million Americans have experienced the muggiest start to summer on record, with climate change increasing humidity in the Eastern U.S. An Associated Press analysis shows that parts of 20 states and Washington, D",
      "More than 70 million Americans sweated through the muggiest first two months of summer on record as climate change has noticeably dialed up the Eastern United States' humidity in recent decades, an Associated Press data analysis shows.",
      "And that meant uncomfortably warm and potentially dangerous nights in many cities the last several weeks, the National Weather Service said.",
      "Parts of 27 states and Washington, D.C., had a record amount of days that meteorologists call uncomfortable \u2014 with average daily dew points of 65 degrees Fahrenheit or higher \u2014 in June and July, according to data derived from the Copernicus Climate Service.",
      "And that's just the daily average. In much of the East, the mugginess kept rising to near tropical levels for a few humid hours. Philadelphia had 29 days, Washington had 27 days and Baltimore had 24 days where the highest dew point simmered to at least 75 degrees, which even the the weather service office in Tampa calls oppressive, according to weather service data.",
      "Dew point is a measure of moisture in the air expressed in degrees that many meteorologists call the most accurate way to describe humidity. The summer of 2025 so far has had dew points that average at least 6 degrees higher than the 1951-2020 normals in Washington, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Richmond, Columbus and St. Louis, the AP calculations show. The average June and July humidity for the entire country east of the Rockies rose to more than 66 degrees, higher than any year since measurements started in 1950.",
      "\u201cThis has been a very muggy summer. The humid heat has been way up,\u201d said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central.",
      "Twice this summer climate scientist and humidity expert Cameron Lee of Kent State University measured dew points of about 82 degrees at his home weather station in Ohio. That's off the various charts that the weather service uses to describe what dew points feel like.",
      "\u201cThere are parts of the United States that are experiencing not only greater average humidity, especially in the spring and summer, but also more extreme humid days,\u201d Lee said. He said super sticky days are now stretching out over more days and more land.",
      "High humidity doesn't allow the air to cool at night as much as it usually does, and the stickiness contributed to multiple nighttime temperature records from the Ohio Valley through the Mid-Atlantic and up and down coastal states, said Zack Taylor, forecast operations chief at the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center. Raleigh, Charlotte, Nashville, Virginia Beach, Va., and Wilmington, N.C., all reached records for the hottest overnight lows. New York City, Columbus, Atlanta, Richmond, Knoxville, Tennessee and Concord, New Hampshire came close, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat really impacts the body is that nighttime temperature,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cSo if there\u2019s no cooling at night or if there\u2019s a lack of cooling it doesn\u2019t allow your body to cool off and recover from what was probably a really hot afternoon. And so when you start seeing that over several days, that can really wear out the body, especially of course if you don\u2019t have access to cooling centers or air conditioning.\u201d",
      "An extra hot and rainy summer weather pattern is combining with climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Woods Placky said.",
      "The area east of the Rockies has on average gained about 2.5 degrees in summer dew point since 1950, the AP analysis of Copernicus data shows. In the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and part of the 1990s, the eastern half of the country had an average dew point in the low 60s, what the weather service calls noticeable but OK. In four of the last six years that number has been near and even over the uncomfortable line of 65.",

      "The company has faced lawsuits and backlash for not doing enough to protect kids on its gaming services.

      "Despite Bosnia\u2019s notoriously poor record-keeping, tourism officials in the mountainous Balkan country of 3.3 million say a clear trend is emerging.",
      "\u201cWe used to rely on snow, but there is no escaping the fact that snow is now likely to fall and accumulate at altitudes above 2,500 meters (8,000 feet) and our mountains are simply not that high,\u201d said Haris Fazlagic, the Sarajevo tourism board president.",
      "Fazlagic believes that by expanding their summer offerings, mountain resorts can lure tourists away from the scorching heat and high costs of traditional seaside vacations along the Adriatic coast of Croatia and Montenegro. He said increasing the area's year-round appeal is \u201cthe future of tourism,\u201d but acknowledged it\u2019s a long-term strategy.",
      "In 2017, after several winters with little snow, the Jahorina and Bjelasnica mountains near Sarajevo began to expand their summer offerings. These mountains, which hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics, have elevations of 1,906 meters (6,253 feet) and 2,067 meters (6,781 feet), respectively.",
      "They now operate ski lifts year-round for scenic views and are steadily adding new hiking, biking and ATV trails and tours.",

      "Like other visitors exploring the forest trails and riding ski lifts around Sarajevo, Kurtovic was dressed for balmy summer weather. Temperatures here typically stay between 24 and 30 degrees Celsius (75-86 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "The weather is a welcome change for tourists, as coastal regions in Central and Eastern Europe have experienced increasingly frequent and prolonged heat waves, with daily temperatures often reaching 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in the past few years.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Thursday struck down two Trump administration actions aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the nation\u2019s schools and universities.",
      "In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland found that the Education Department violated the law when it threatened to cut federal funding from educational institutions that continued with DEI initiatives.",
      "The guidance has been on hold since April when three federal judges blocked various portions of the Education Department\u2019s anti-DEI measures.",
      "The ruling Thursday followed a motion for summary judgment from the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association, which challenged the government\u2019s actions in a February lawsuit.",
      "The case centers on two Education Department memos ordering schools and universities to end all \u201crace-based decision-making\u201d or face penalties up to a total loss of federal funding. It\u2019s part of a campaign to end practices the Trump administration frames as discrimination against white and Asian American students.",
      "The new ruling orders the department to scrap the guidance because it runs afoul of procedural requirements, though Gallagher wrote that she took no view on whether the policies were \u201cgood or bad, prudent or foolish, fair or unfair.\u201d",
      "Gallagher, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, rejected the government\u2019s argument that the memos simply served to remind schools that discrimination is illegal.",
      "\u201cIt initiated a sea change in how the Department of Education regulates educational practices and classroom conduct, causing millions of educators to reasonably fear that their lawful, and even beneficial, speech might cause them or their schools to be punished,\u201d Gallagher wrote.",
      "Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy firm representing the plaintiffs, called it an important victory over the administration's attack on DEI.",
      "\u201cThreatening teachers and sowing chaos in schools throughout America is part of the administration\u2019s war on education, and today the people won,\u201d said Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO.",
      "A statement from the Education Department on Thursday said it was disappointed in the ruling but that \u201cjudicial action enjoining or setting aside this guidance has not stopped our ability to enforce Title VI protections for students at an unprecedented level.\u201d",

      "The memo dramatically expanded the government\u2019s interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring colleges from considering race in admissions decisions. The government argued the ruling applied not only to admissions but across all of education, forbidding \u201crace-based preferences\u201d of any kind.",

      "A further memo in April asked state education agencies to certify they were not using \u201cillegal DEI practices.\u201d Violators risked losing federal money and being prosecuted under the False Claims Act, it said.",
      "In total, the guidance amounted to a full-scale reframing of the government\u2019s approach to civil rights in education. It took aim at policies that were created to address longstanding racial disparities, saying those practices were their own form of discrimination.",
      "The memos drew a wave of backlash from states and education groups that called it illegal government censorship.",
      "In its lawsuit, the American Federation of Teachers said the government was imposing \u201cunclear and highly subjective\u201d limits on schools across the country.

      "The order by Judge Maya Guerra Gamble in Austin on Wednesday has the potential to shut Jones out of his studio in the coming days. It also appeared to restart an effort by The Onion satirical publication to buy Infowars and its assets and turn the platform into a parody site. \u201cWe're working on it,\u201d Ben Collins, chief executive of The Onion, said in a social media post Wednesday.",
      "On his daily show Thursday, Jones called the Texas court order improper and vowed to keep broadcasting if he is locked out. He added he has another studio already set up in the event of such a scenario.",

      "Jones said he expected Infowars to be sold to someone or some entity that will keep it on the air.",
      "The Sandy Hook families won nearly $1.5 billion in judgments in 2022 against Jones and Infowars' parent company, Free Speech Systems, in lawsuits filed in Connecticut and Texas accusing him of defamation and inflicting emotional distress. They sued over Jones' repeated comments that the 2012 school shooting in Connecticut that killed 20 first graders and six educators was a hoax. Victims\u2019 relatives testified in court about being terrorized by Jones\u2019 supporters.",
      "Jones and his company both filed for bankruptcy in 2022. A federal Bankruptcy Court judge in Houston ordered Free Speech Systems' assets, including Infowars' production equipment and its intellectual property, to be sold at auction to help pay the Sandy Hook legal judgments.",
      "The sale process was derailed when the bankruptcy judge, Christopher Lopez, rejected the outcome of a November auction in which The Onion was named the winning bidder over only one other proposal by a company affiliated with Jones. The auction was by sealed bids only and no live bidding was held.",
      "Lopez had several concerns about the auction, including a lack of transparency and murky details about the actual value of The Onion\u2019s bid and whether it was better than the other offer. Jones called the auction \u201crigged.\" The judge rejected holding another auction and said the families could pursue the liquidation of Jones\u2019 assets in the state courts where the defamation judgments were awarded.",

      "It was not clear Thursday when the order would be served on the company, or when the receiver planned to take over the assets and sell them. The receiver, Gregory Milligan in Austin, did not return an email seeking information about the liquidation plans.",
      "Jones' lawyer, Ben Broocks, also did not return an email seeking comment Thursday.",
      "Jones said on air Thursday that the state court order was not valid because Free Speech Systems' assets are still under the control of the trustee in his bankruptcy case in federal court. He said there was a state court hearing set for Sept. 16. He said Infowars could be closed next week, or it may be able to keep operating pending the hearing. He said he wasn't exactly sure what would be happening next.",
      "Last November after The Onion was named the winning bidder, a bankruptcy court trustee shut down Infowars' Austin studio and its websites for about 24 hours, but then allowed them to resume the next day as disputes over the auction continued in court. During the shutdown, Jones moved to a nearby studio and continued broadcasting.",
      "Jones, who said in 2022 that he believed the Sandy Hook shootings were \u201c100% real,\u201d continues to appeal the Connecticut and Texas state court judgments against him, citing free speech rights and improper actions by judges in the two states.",

      "Drummond has pleaded not guilty to four counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of the parents, grandmother and uncle of an infant found abandoned in a home\u2019s front yard. A weeklong search for Drummond ended Aug. 5 in Jackson, about 70 miles (115 kilometers) southeast of the crime scene in Tiptonville.",
      "Lake County District Attorney Danny Goodman has said prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty if Drummond is convicted of first-degree murder at trial.",
      "Also appearing in court by video feed were Tanaka Brown and Dearrah Sanders, who have been charged with being accessories after the fact. Both have pleaded not guilty. A third person charged with being an accessory after the fact, Giovonte Thomas, did not make a court appearance Thursday. It is not immediately clear if Thomas has entered a plea.",
      "Judge Andrew Cook set a Sept. 4 preliminary hearing for Drummond to determine if there is enough evidence to refer his case to a grand jury. Drummond's lawyer declined comment after the hearing.",
      "Cook also scheduled preliminary hearings for Brown and Sanders on Sept. 12.",
      "After the hearing, the district attorney told reporters that those charged with helping Drummond are suspected of giving him phones, clothes, shelter and rides.",
      "Goodman did not disclose a motive for the killings. In a previous hearing, Drummond told the judge that he wants a speedy trial, but Goodman said it could be a year or more before Drummond could face a jury.",
      "\u201cIt's a serious matter,\u201d Goodman said, adding later that \u201cthere's a lot of evidence in the case to pull together.\u201d",
      "The killings and the ensuing search set rural areas of west Tennessee on edge for days.",

      "Goodman has said Drummond\u2019s girlfriend is the sister of the infant\u2019s grandmother.",
      "Drummond has served prison time for robbing a convenience store and threatening to go after jurors. He was also charged with the attempted murder of a prison guard while behind bars, and was out on bond at the time of the killings, Goodman said.",

      "She\u2019d been living her \u201cGirl Scout life,\u201d she said, saving money and looking for work while homeless. When she got word that the law was on its way, she found herself living the scouting motto: Be prepared.",
      "\u201cLast night was so scary,\u201d she said, recalling when federal law officers, in concert with local police, began fanning out across Washington to uproot homeless encampments. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the one to wait until the last moment and then have to rush out.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump's housecleaning started with official Washington and the denizens of its marbled buildings, back in the bureaucracy-scouring days of the Department of Government Efficiency. Now he is taking on the other side of Washington, having sent some 800 National Guard troops to help local police go after crime, grime and makeshift homeless encampments.",
      "Back in early spring, Trump's efforts upended the U.S. Institute of Peace, among other institutions and departments. On Thursday, authorities brought in an earth mover to clear out an encampment within sight of that hollowed-out institute's handsome Constitution Avenue headquarters.",
      "The mission to clean the capital of criminal elements and ragged edges comes under Trump's Making D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force. Some in D.C. believe a different kind of ugliness is playing out.",
      "\u201cFrom the White House, the president sees a lawless wasteland,\u201d said leaders of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington. \u201cWe see fellow human beings \u2014 neighbors, workers, friends and family \u2014 each made in the image of God.\u201d",
      "For Andrew S., 61, the ugliness came Wednesday when agents he identified as being with the federal government treated him like an eyesore. They asked him to move from his resting place along the route where Trump would be driven to the Kennedy Center.",
      "\u201cYou have to move because you\u2019re in eyesight of the president,\u201d Andrew, originally from Baltimore, said he was told. He added, \u201cI didn\u2019t really take it serious until today, but the president really doesn\u2019t want us here.\u201d",

      "At the encampment near the peace institute, a man named George, 67, walked away Thursday carrying an umbrella in one hand and a garbage bag with some of his belongings in the other. City workers put his mattress and other possessions in a garbage truck idling nearby. He waved goodbye to it.",
      "It was that kind of day for others at the same site, too.",
      "\u201cI have known homelessness for so long that it is part of normal life at this point,\u201d Jesse Wall, 43, said as he cleared his belongings Thursday from the site near the peace institute. \u201cWhat are you trying to prove here?\u201d Wall asked, as if speaking with the law. \u201cThat you\u2019re a bully?\u201d",
      "David Beatty, 67, had been living at that encampment for several months. On Thursday, he watched as parts of it were roped off. Beatty and others were allowed to pack up what they could before the heavy machinery cleared remaining items from the area and dumped them into trucks and receptacles.",

      "Much of the clearing out Thursday was at the hands of local police. D.C. officials knew federal authorities would be dismantling all homeless encampments if local police didn't. Wayne Turnage, a deputy mayor, said the district has a process to do it \u201cthe way it should be done.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Justice Department indictments have been unsealed against three leaders and two high-ranking enforcers of Mexico's United Cartels",
      "WASHINGTON -- The investigation began years ago after two drug dealers got into a car accident in a small Tennessee town. What followed was a series of secret wiretaps, a shootout with police and the discovery of drugs hidden in a tractor trailer that would eventually lead federal investigators back to cartel leaders in Mexico.",
      "The investigation culminated with Justice Department indictments unsealed Thursday against three leaders and two high-ranking enforcers of the United Cartels, a leading rival of Jalisco New Generation Cartel.",
      "The U.S. government is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest of United Cartels' top leader, Juan Jos\u00e9 Far\u00edas \u00c1lvarez \u2014 \u201cEl Abuelo,\u201d or the grandfather \u2014 along with multimillion-dollar rewards for the four others. All five are believed to be in Mexico.",
      "The cases, as outlined in court documents, provide a glimpse into how drugs produced by violent cartels in large labs in Mexico flow across the U.S. border and reach American streets. They also highlight the violent fallout that drug trafficking leaves in its path from the mountains of Mexico to small U.S. towns.",
      "\"These cases in particular serve as a powerful reminder of the insidious impacts that global cartels can have on our local American communities,\" Matthew Galeotti, acting assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's criminal division said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThe chain started with a violent cartel in Mexico and it ended with law enforcement being shot at in a small town.\"",
      "United Cartels is an umbrella organization made up of smaller cartels that have worked for different groups over time. It holds a fierce grip over the western state of Michoacan, Mexico.",
      "United Cartels is not as widely known as Jalisco New Generation, but given its role as a prolific methamphetamine producer, it has become a top tier target for U.S. law enforcement. It was one of eight groups recently named foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration.",
      "The case goes back to 2019, when two dealers got into a car accident in a small town outside Knoxville, Tennessee, according to a search warrant affidavit filed in court. While fleeing the scene of the crash, they threw a hardened protective case filled with meth behind a building before being caught by police, according to court documents.",
      "Authorities began investigating, using wiretaps, search warrants and surveillance to identify a man believed to be leading a major drug ring in the Atlanta area: Eladio Mendoza.",
      "The investigation into Mendoza's suspected drug operation led law enforcement in early 2020 to a hotel near Atlanta. During their surveillance, authorities spotted a man leaving with a large Doritos bag. Troopers tried to stop the man after he drove from Georgia into Tennessee but he fled and fired an AK-style rifle at officers, hitting one in the leg before another trooper shot him. Inside the bag, police found meth and heroin, and identified him as a low-level dealer for Mendoza\u2019s drug ring, court records say.",
      "Weeks later, authorities searched properties linked to Mendoza and seized phones. They discovered messages between Mendoza and a close associate of \u201cEl Abuelo,\u201d the leader of United Cartels, that showed the drugs were coming from Mexico, according to the court records. On one of Mendoza's properties, investigators found a tractor trailer that had crossed from Mexica days earlier. When they searched it, authorities seized 850 kilograms of meth hidden in the floor of the truck and discovered more drugs inside a bus and a home on the property, court papers say.",

      "The case represents the latest effort by the Republican administration to turn up the pressure on cartels through not only indictments of the groups' leaders but sanctions. The Treasury Department is also bringing economic sanctions against the five defendants as well as the United Cartels as a group and another cartel, Los Viagras.",
      "\u201cWe have to pursue these criminals up and down the chain to make sure that the end result doesn\u2019t result in violence and narcotics distribution on our streets,\" Galeotti said.",
      "In addition to \u201cEl Abuelo,\u201d those facing U.S. indictments are Alfonso Fern\u00e1ndez Magall\u00f3n, or Poncho, and Nicol\u00e1s Sierra Santana or \u201cEl Gordo,\u201d who authorities say lead smaller cartels under the United Cartels organization. The two other defendants are Edgar Orozco Cabadas or \u201cEl Kamoni,\u201d who was communicating with Mendoza, and Luis Enrique Barrag\u00e1n Chavaz, or \u201cWicho,\u201d who serves as Magall\u00f3n second-in-command, according to authorities.",

      "Here are more details Swift shared about the upcoming album:",
      "\"The Life of a Showgirl\" release date",
      "The album will be released on Friday, Oct. 3. Fans of Swift know the dates she chooses to announce and release music almost always have meaning and often have a 13, her lucky number, somewhere.",
      "\"Never not annoying,\" she said about herself on the podcast. \"Always going to try to force a 13 into the situation and this one was right there.\"",
      "Swift, Max Martin and Shellback produced the album",
      "Swift made \"The Life of a Showgirl\" with Max Martin and Shellback, producers she has worked with in the past but never for the entirety of an album.",
      "\"The three of us have made some of my favorite songs that I've ever done before,\" Swift said. Those songs include \"22,\" \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" \"Blank Space,\" \"Style,\" \"Shake It Off,\" \"\u2026Ready For It?\" and \"Delicate.\"",
      "The three hadn't produced music together in seven or eight years, but returning to work with them \"felt like catching lightning in a bottle,\" Swift said.",
      "\"By the time we came back together, I feel like we had so much more dexterity to what we do,\" she said. \"This was the time where it felt like all three of us in the room were carrying the same weight as creators and it was really special.\"",
      "Martin and Shellback have also worked with pop artists like Britney Spears, Ariana Grande, P!nk and more.",
      "\"The best ideas we've ever had\"",
      "Swift said she approached Martin, who she described as her mentor, about doing an album at her Eras Tour show in Stockholm in May 2024.",
      "\"I essentially said to him, 'I want to be as proud of an album as I am of the Eras Tour and for the same reasons,' and he was like, 'Do you understand what kind of pressure that is?'\" Swift said.",
      "But Swift is confident in the outcome.",
      "\"We knew that we had to bring the best ideas we've ever had, and I also know the pressure I'm putting on this record by saying that, but I don't care because I love it that much, and I'm so proud of it, and it just comes from like the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life, and so that effervescence has come through on this record,\" she said.",
      "\"The Life of a Showgirl\" theme",
      "Swift described the theme of \"The Life of a Showgirl\" as \"everything that was going on behind the curtain\" during the Eras Tour.",

      "Melodies and lyrics were key goals",
      "Swift opened up about the primary objectives she had making \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"",

      "Martin had made a point to tell Swift he didn't want her to leave behind the type of writing and storytelling she did on \"folklore\" (released in July 2020) even if the sound of this album was different. Swift said she replied, \"I couldn't if I tried.\"",

      "\"This podcast did a lot for me,\" Swift said. \"It gave me a boyfriend!\"",
      "Kelce attended Swift's Eras Tour stop at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, in 2023. At the time, Kelce shared on the podcast, he tried to give her a friendship bracelet with his phone number; however, she never received it.",
      "Swift said Wednesday that the gesture made her feel \"like I was in an '80s John Hughes movie, and he was just like, standing outside of my window with a boom box being like, 'I want to date you.'\"",
      "Swift also spoke about buying back the master recordings from her first six studio albums. Swift described how she had wanted to own all her music after signing a record deal at age 15. She revealed that she sent her mother and brother to Los Angeles to talk with private equity company Shamrock Capital, which owned the masters at the time, about buying them.",
      "\"A couple months after the Super Bowl in Kansas City, I get a call from my mom,\" Swift said. \"She's like, 'You got your music.' I very dramatically hit the floor for real. Bawling my eyes out, weeping, like 'Really!?' I said to myself, 'Go tell Travis in a normal way,' he was playing video games, and he put his headset down. I was like, 'I got my music back!' And I was heaving crying. This changed my life.\"",

      "\"I have parameters. There's do's and dont's,\" Swift said. \"It points to my music... It's something you don't know why I'm saying for a specific reason, but then you'll look back and go, 'Oh my God.'\"",
      "Swift revealed a recent Easter egg on the podcast about the descending orange door that appeared as a visual on the Eras Tour after the finale song, \"Karma.\"",
      "\"I would leave the stage every night going down the elevator, lift,\" Swift said. \"That's how every single Eras show ended \u2014 except for the last one, where I exited through a door, an orange door, to be specific. And that actually was an Easter egg. Basically the reason why I chose to exit that way is because I kind of wanted to give a little subliminal hint to the fans that I may be leaving the Eras Tour era, but I was also entering a new era.\"",
      "Swift said her upcoming album \"was something that I was working on while I was in Europe on the Eras Tour.\"",

      "Swift's last rerecording, \"1989 (Taylor's Version),\" arrived in October 2023, just four months after the release of \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version).\" That was the same year Swift claimed the record for the woman with the most No. 1 albums in history.",

      "Palmieri dabbled in tropical music as a pianist during the 1950s with the Eddie Forrester Orchestra. He later joined Johnny Segu\u00ed's band and Tito Rodr\u00edguez's before forming his own band in 1961, La Perfecta, alongside trombonist Barry Rogers and singer Ismael Quintana.",
      "La Perfecta was the first to feature a trombone section instead of trumpets, something rarely seen in Latin music. With its unique sound, the band quickly joined the ranks of Machito, Tito Rodr\u00edguez, and other Latin orchestras of the time.",
      "Pioneering Grammy winner's career spanned decades and genres",
      "Palmieri produced several albums on the Alegre and Tico Records labels, including the 1971 classic \"V\u00e1monos pa'l monte,\" with his brother, Charlie, as guest organist. Charlie Palmieri died in 1988.",
      "Eddie's unconventional approach would surprise critics and fans again that year with the release of \"Harlem River Drive,\" in which he fused Black and Latin styles to produce a sound that encompassed elements of salsa, funk, soul and jazz.",
      "Later, in 1974, he recorded \"The Sun of Latin Music\" with a young Lalo Rodr\u00edguez. The album became the first Latin production to win a Grammy.",
      "The following year he recorded the album \"Eddie Palmieri & Friends in Concert, Live at the University of Puerto Rico,\" considered by many fans to be a salsa gem.",
      "In the 1980s, he won two more Grammy Awards, for the albums \"Palo pa' rumba\" (1984) and \"Solito\" (1985). A few years later, he introduced the vocalist La India to the salsa world with the production \"Lleg\u00f3 La India v\u00eda Eddie Palmieri.\"",
      "Palmieri released the album \"Masterpiece\" in 2000, which teamed him with the legendary Tito Puente, who died that year. It was a hit with critics and won two Grammy Awards. The album was also chosen as the most outstanding production of the year by the National Foundation for Popular Culture of Puerto Rico.",
      "During his long career, he participated in concerts and recordings with the Fania All-Stars and Tico All-Stars, standing out as a composer, arranger, producer, and orchestra director.",
      "In 1988, the Smithsonian Institute recorded two of Palmieri's concerts for the catalog of the National Museum of American History in Washington.",
      "Yale University in 2002 awarded him the Chubb Fellowship Award, an award usually reserved for international heads of state, in recognition of his work in building communities through music.",
      "In 2005, he made his debut on National Public Radio as the host of the program \"Caliente,\" which was carried by more than 160 radio stations nationwide.",
      "He worked with renowned musicians such as timbalero Nicky Marrero, bassist Israel \"Cachao\" L\u00f3pez, trumpeter Alfredo \"Chocolate\" Armenteros, trombonist Lewis Khan, and Puerto Rican bassist Bobby Valent\u00edn.",
      "In 2010, Palmieri said he felt a bit lonely musically due to the deaths of many of the rumberos with whom he enjoyed playing with.",

      "Asked about these concerns, the Social Security Administration pointed to a Fox News interview Thursday with its commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said he's optimistic about the program's future and that the agency is working on improving its operations.",
      "The White House also took issue with the criticisms, with spokeswoman Liz Huston telling CBS News that the administration is improving customer service and \"preventing illegal aliens from accessing benefits. \"President Trump has made Social Security great again,\" she said.",
      "Funding woes",
      "A major headwind facing Social Security may not be new, but it is fast approaching: The possible insolvency of its trust funds as the gap between its revenue and expenditure grows.",
      "For instance, in 2024, the program cost $1.49 billion, but total income was $1.42 billion, according to the 2025 Social Security Board of Trustees' report.",
      "Because of that trend \u2014 which is expected to continue given the aging population \u2014 the Social Security trust funds are forecast to be\u00a0depleted by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast, according to the most recent trustees' report. This so-called \"go-broke\" date has been a major source of stress for Americans who worry that there won't be enough money left by the time they reach retirement age.",
      "While some workers believe that the trust funds' insolvency means Social Security will cease making payments after that date, that is incorrect. Because the program is funded through payroll taxes, Social Security has a constant stream of income \u2014 although without the trust funds' financial cushion, the program will face a shortfall, leading to a cut in benefits.",
      "Without a fix, monthly benefits could be cut by as much as 23%, the Social Security Board of Trustees warned in its 2025\u00a0annual report.",
      "But there are options for shoring up the trust funds. For one, there's a current cap on the amount of income subject to Social Security taxes, which stands at $176,100 in 2025, meaning any earnings above that amount are exempt from the payroll tax.",
      "One remedy would be to lift the cap on payroll taxes, an option that some Democratic lawmakers prefer. Another idea, floated by some Republican lawmakers, is to raise the retirement age, which currently stands at 67 for people born after 1960.",
      "Changes under President Trump",
      "President Trump has vowed not to cut Social Security, noting in a \"Meet the Press\" interview in December that \"we're not touching Social Security, other than we might make it more efficient.\" Nonetheless, concerns have mounted over the Trump administration's changes to the program, including cuts to its staff and the closure of some field offices.",
      "During a press call Wednesday organized by advocacy groups, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, claimed Mr. Trump and others in his administration are \"working overtime to try to dismantle Social Security.\"",
      "Many Americans also say they're worried about what sort of changes the new administration could make. According to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0from NerdWallet, 61% of Americans believe Social Security benefits will be cut under the current administration.",
      "The White House, however, contends that Social Security has become more efficient under Mr. Trump's leadership. In a statement released Thursday, the White House claimed that the agency is handling 70% more calls than last year and that it has cut down on wait times with the help of technology. It also said the average wait times for customers at field offices have declined by 23%.",
      "\"We have taken steps to reduce wait times, enhance security, and make it easier to navigate our programs,\" SSA commissioner Frank Bisignano wrote in an opinion piece for Fox News on Thursday. \"All the while ensuring we pay benefits accurately to those who are eligible to receive them.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday repeated his\u00a0promises to protect the program.",
      "The program will become \"stronger, bigger and better\" and is \"gonna be around a long time\" with Republicans in charge, he added in remarks from the White House.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 12:59:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's what new data from the producer price index says about where inflation is headed, according to economists.",
    "story": [
      "The producer price index, or PPI, surged last month, far outpacing economists' forecasts and suggesting that President Trump's tariffs are starting to significantly drive up the cost of imported goods.",
      "Wholesale inflation rose 0.9% in July from the prior month, the Labor Department said Thursday, outstripping economists' expectations for a 0.2% increase. The jump marks the largest in more than three years, since June 2022.",
      "The PPI, which measures price changes before they reach consumers, suggests cost hikes are on the way for shoppers, economists said.",
      "So far in 2025, consumer prices\u00a0have been slow to rise despite economists' warnings that Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariff agenda would hike costs for both U.S. businesses and consumers. That's partly because some importers took steps to offset the impact by preordering inventory and absorbing some tariffs to shield consumers in the short term.",
      "But because those were stop-gap measures, economists have warned consumers are unlikely to be insulated from tariff-driven inflation indefinitely. The latest PPI data underscores that higher prices are rippling through the economy, experts say.",
      "\"Tariff-exposed goods are rising at a rapid clip, indicating that the willingness and ability of businesses to absorb tariff costs may be waning,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note Thursday, noting that the wholesale price increases were broad-based.",
      "\"We anticipate broader signs of tariff-driven inflation in the data over time as inventories roll over and firms adjust pricing under margin pressure,\" they said.",
      "The PPI report comes two days after July's Consumer Price Index was slightly cooler than economists had expected, rising 2.7% on an annual basis. The CPI measures changes in prices for goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "The PPI report \"indicates that the new tariffs are continuing to generate cost pressures in the supply chain, which consumers will shoulder soon,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs said in a research note Thursday.",
      "What does the PPI mean for the Fed?",
      "The data complicates the decision the Federal Reserve faces at its Sept. 17 meeting about whether to hold or cut its benchmark interest rate, according to economists.",
      "The central bank has held the rate steady since December 2024, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noting that the economy remains relatively solid and that it wants to take a \"wait and see\" approach to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "The Fed is tasked with keeping inflation low while also promoting full employment \u2014 a two-pronged goal known as its dual mandate.",
      "Because the CPI report came in cooler than expected, the Fed had been seen as more likely to cut rates next month. But the latest PPI data may put that in doubt, given a rate cut would make it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow, thereby potentially further stoking inflation.",
      "\"After a string of data pointing to greater odds of a September rate cut, the large upside surprise in producer prices highlights the dilemma the Federal Reserve faces in judging the risks to its dual mandate,\" Matthew Martin, of Oxford Economics wrote. The group expects the Fed to hold off on rate cuts until December.",
      "The PPI data \"suggests inflation isn't the non-story some people thought it was after Tuesday's CPI print,\" Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at Morgan Stanley's E*TRADE, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "As far as the likelihood of a rate cut goes, the data \"doesn't slam the door on a September rate cut, but based on the market's initial reaction, the opening may be a little smaller than it was a couple of days ago,\" he said.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 11:32:30 -0400",
    "summary": "Americans are reining in their spending at fast-food restaurants as they continue to face economic uncertainty.",
    "story": [
      "The most important meal of the day is also shaping up to be the most skipped meal of the day, at least according to two of the country's largest fast-food chains.",
      "McDonald's and Wendy's last week, during their respective earnings calls, said they're seeing sluggish breakfast sales. The companies attributed the trend to heightened economic uncertainty and pressures facing low-income consumers.",
      "\"There is a lot of anxiety and unease with that low-income consumer,\" McDonald's CEO Christopher Kempczinski said on the company's earnings call on Aug. 6.",
      "Despite wage gains, real incomes are down for low-income consumers, who are facing a lot of financial stress, the CEO said, citing President Trump's tariffs as a potential contributor.",
      "\"So real incomes are down with the low-income consumer, that absolutely is going to put pressure on visits into the [quick-service retail] industry. Second thing is there is a lot of anxiety and unease with that low-income consumer. I think we could all speculate the reasons for that, probably tariffs and the impact that, that might have, questions around employment situation,\" Kempczinski said.",
      "According to Kempczinski, the decline in traffic from low-income consumers \u2014 a core demographic for fast-food restaurants \u2014 is an industrywide trend, with breakfast menus across the quick service industry taking the biggest hit.",
      "Why skip breakfast?",
      "As many Americans rein in discretionary spending, industry analysts and executives say one of the first items on the chopping block is breakfast. Instead of heading to the drive-thru for a breakfast sandwich, more Americans are opting to grab something at home, or skip the meal altogether.",
      "\"When consumer uncertainty increases and consumers choose to eat another meal at home, breakfast is often the first place that they do that with,\" Wendy's interim CEO Ken Cook said on the company's earnings call Aug. 8.",
      "That's a stark contrast to the breakfast boom fast-food chains have enjoyed for nearly a decade, which led many restaurants over the years to expand their early morning offerings. Starbucks, which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12 separate items. Wendy's\u00a0reintroduced\u00a0breakfast in 2020 and offers 10 items with eggs.",
      "The cost of fast food has also skyrocketed over the past decade,\u00a0according\u00a0to 2024 report by FinanceBuzz. The personal finance site found that the price of a McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese meal from McDonald's more than doubled in price from $5.39 in 2014 to $11.99 in 2024.",
      "To be sure, reports of slowing traffic at fast-food chains have preceded the recent decline in breakfast sales. On an earnings call in May 2024, McDonald's CEO Kempczinski expressed \"heightened anxiety\" about how the economy was weighing on lower- and middle-income Americans. During that same time, the CEO of Dine Brands, which owns Applebee's and IHOP,\u00a0told\u00a0CNBC that casual restaurants were also seeing a drop in low-income customers.",
      "Still, not all fast-food chains are experiencing declines in breakfast traffic. Both Starbucks and Dunkin' told CBS MoneyWatch they've seen success with breakfast sales.",
      "Reached for comment by CBS MoneyWatch, both McDonald's and Wendy's pointed to their earnings reports.",
      "What falling breakfast sales say about the economy",
      "Experts say that American consumers' decision to skip out on breakfast points to myriad economic pressures facing low- and middle-income consumers ranging from sky-high credit card interest rates to inflation.",
      "\"The fact that the breakfast day part is slowing now, in our opinion, speaks to heightened economic uncertainty and the lower consumer confidence that we've seen, and that really escalated as tariff rhetoric came into the picture,\" Matthew Todd, a director at S&P Global Ratings, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The consumer is very value focused, discerning and selective about how they're spending. I think we would say we think breakfast is the easiest meal to cut because consumers can eat something quickly,\" Todd said.",
      "Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, told CBS MoneyWatch that low- and middle-income Americans have been spending more cautiously since the end of last year, in part due to a \"weakening\" labor market. \"That's adding to their nervousness and their caution so far this year,\" he said.",
      "The most recent jobs report showed hiring slowed in July. The Labor Department also sharply revised job growth for May and June down by a combined 258,000, a sign that hiring was weaker than previously estimated. With the revisions, the U.S. added 19,000 jobs in May and 14,000 in June.",
      "Experts also told CBS MoneyWatch that low-income consumers' purchasing power is already under pressure due to inflation \u2014 something they said\u00a0tariffs could exacerbate. The Consumer Price Index in July showed inflation held steady at 2.7% on an annual basis. Restaurant prices are up 3.9% since July of last year and 0.3% from June.",
      "\"If they have to spend more to buy a pair of shoes or get their hair cut, they're gonna have less to spend on everything else again, including breakfast at a fast-food restaurant,\" Zandi said.",

      "The SSA did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Each fall, the agency uses inflation data from July, August and September to determine the COLA for the next year.

      "The inflation rate has remained at or below 3% since the start of 2025. However, experts predict it could inch up later in the year as tariffs put more pressure on consumer prices.

      "EWS, which is\u00a0co-owned\u00a0by Bank of America, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo,\u00a0launched\u00a0the Zelle app in 2017. At its debut, Zelle\u00a0said the digital payment network would be a \"faster, safer way\" for people to send and receive payments \"within the security of their financial institution,\" according to the company.",
      "As of 2024, the app has 151 million users, according to Zelle's\u00a0website.",
      "The push to launch Zelle led to design oversights that made the network \"an obvious conduit for fraudulent activity,\" the\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0alleges. Those alleged flaws include Zelle's quick registration process and lack of verification, which James claims made it easy for scammers to infiltrate the service.",
      "The limited information shown to customers during transactions also allowed fraudsters to use false or fraudulent email addresses to trick consumers, she said.",
      "\"EWS knew from the beginning that key features of the Zelle network made it uniquely susceptible to fraud, and yet it failed to adopt basic safeguards to address these glaring flaws or enforce any meaningful anti-fraud rules on its partner banks,\" the New York AG's office claimed in its statement.",
      "The lawsuit also alleges that EWS failed to enforce rules to prevent fraud, even though it knew its partner banks were violating them.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a Zelle spokesperson called the lawsuit a \"political stunt\" and said it was a \"copycat\" of a similar lawsuit the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u00a0filed in December, which was dismissed in March. That lawsuit alleged EWS failed to protect consumers from widespread fraud.",
      "The lawsuit seeks restitution and damages for New Yorkers affected by fraud on Zelle, as well as a court order requiring the company to maintain anti-fraud measures.",

      "Louisville, Kentucky\u00a0\u2014 GE Appliances plans to shift production of refrigerators, gas ranges and water heaters out of China and Mexico as part of a more than $3 billion investment to expand its U.S. operations in Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and South Carolina.",
      "The investment \u2014 the second-largest in the Louisville-based company's history \u2014 is expected to add more than 1,000 jobs while ramping up domestic production and modernizing plants in the next five years.",
      "\"Our long-term strategy is about manufacturing close to our customers,\" said CEO Kevin Nolan. \"With lean manufacturing, upskilling our workforce and automation, the math works for manufacturing in the United States.\"",
      "The majority of GE's appliance production is already in the U.S. and the shift means only that the company will transfer more work to its domestic plants.",
      "GE will relocate production of gas ranges from Mexico to a plant in Georgia, while six refrigerator models now made in China will be manufactured at its Alabama plant, the company said.",
      "In June, the company said it would move production of clothes washers from China to its sprawling manufacturing complex in Louisville. The reshoring announcements come as President Trump tries to lure factories back to the United States by imposing import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on foreign goods.",
      "Lee Lagomarcino, GE Appliances' vice president of clothes care, told CBS MoneyWatch at the time that high levies on\u00a0imports from China\u00a0under Mr. Trump have compelled it to \"accelerate the decision-making.\"",
      "GE Appliances said Wednesday that the first phase of its new investment will begin at plants in five Southern states \u2014 Kentucky, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina.",
      "\"We are defining the future of manufacturing at GE Appliances by investing in our plants, people and communities,\" Nolan said. \"No other appliance company over the last decade has invested more in U.S. manufacturing than we have, and our $3 billion, five-year plan shows that our commitment to U.S. manufacturing will continue into the future.\"",
      "The multiyear plan includes ramping up production of gas ranges that have been made in Mexico but will shift to the company's plant in LaFayette, Georgia, the company said. Production of six refrigerators now made in China will move to its plant in Decatur, Alabama.",
      "GE's plant in Camden, South Carolina, will add production of electric and hybrid heat pump water heaters, doubling the factory's output and employment once the project is complete, the company said. The plant now produces gas water heaters. Production of the company's electric and hybrid water heaters \u2014 now made in China \u2014 will shift to South Carolina.",
      "In Selmer, Tennessee, its plant will produce two new models of air conditioners.",
      "The latest investment includes the June announcement that GE Appliances will pump $490 million into its Kentucky complex to produce a combo washer/dryer and a lineup of front load washers that are now made in China. In all, production of more than 15 models of front load washers will shift to the company's Louisville complex \u2014 known as Appliance Park, it said.",
      "Once its new plan is fully implemented, GE Appliances will have invested $6.5 billion across its 11 U.S. manufacturing plants and nationwide distribution network since 2016, it said.",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday that the investment shows his state's ability to support world-class companies with a skilled workforce and the resources needed to thrive.",
      "\"GE Appliances has established Kentucky as America's destination for advanced manufacturing and job creation, and today's news shows this iconic company's unwavering belief in the commonwealth and the role we play in their success,\" Beshear said.",
      "GE Appliances handles product design and engineering work at its Louisville headquarters but doesn't make all of its products in the U.S. It contracts with other manufacturers, including in China, for some of its production where it doesn't have capacity or needs access to a global supply chain. The company said its core business strategy is to base production in the United States, and investments announced in June and on Wednesday are another step toward achieving that goal.",
      "The company said it's partnering with universities, technical schools and high schools to help ensure that its plants and other facilities have a trained workforce.",
      "\"Infrastructure and tools matter, but they are not enough,\" said Bill Good, vice president of supply chain for GE Appliances. \"America's manufacturing renaissance will be built by people.\"",
      "GE Appliances is a subsidiary of the China-based Haier company.",
      "Overall, GE Appliances says it contributes more than $30 billion annually to the U.S. economy and supports more than 113,000 jobs \u2014 both directly and indirectly \u2014 through its operations, suppliers and distribution network.",

The cautionary report comes just months after Spirit emerged from\u00a0Chapter 11 bankruptcy.",
      "In a quarterly report issued Monday, Spirit pointed to \"adverse market conditions\" that it's continued to face despite recent restructuring and other efforts to revamp offerings.",

By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",

      "Stocks got a lift from hopes that the better-than-expected inflation report will give the Federal Reserve leeway to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September.",
      "Lower rates would give a boost to investment prices and to the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment. President Donald Trump has angrily been calling for cuts to help the economy, often\u00a0insulting\u00a0the Fed's chair personally while doing so.",
      "But the Fed has been hesitant because of the possibility that Trump's tariffs could make inflation much worse. Lowering rates would give inflation more fuel, potentially adding oxygen to a growing fire. That's why Fed officials have said they wanted to see more data come in about inflation before moving.",

      "Some economists warn that more twists and turns in upcoming data could make the Fed's upcoming decisions not so easy. Its twin goals are to get inflation to 2% while keeping the job market healthy, and helping one with interest rates often means hurting the other.",
      "Even Tuesday's better-than-expected inflation report had some discouraging undertones. An underlying measure of inflation, which economists say does a better job of predicting where inflation may be heading, hit its highest point since early this year, noted Gary Schlossberg, market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. That helped cause some up-and-down swings for Treasury yields in the bond market.",

      "Everyday staples that saw significant cost increases in July include coffee, up 2.6% from June and 14.8% from 2024. Ground beef, rose 2.4% from June and 11.5% from 2024. On a positive note, egg prices fell 3.4% from June, but were still 16.4% higher than they were in July of last year.",
      "Eating out continues to grow more costly as restaurant prices in July increased 0.3% from the previous month and 3.9% since 2024. The data comes as fast-food restaurants continue to report declines in traffic, as higher prices drive consumers away. Wendy's, for example, cut its sales outlook\u00a0last week, pointing to heightened competition and economic uncertainty weighing on its customer base.",
      "Fast-food chains like Wendy's are competing for the attention of low-income consumers who have pulled back on eating out over concerns about the economy. According to a May study from\u00a0Bankrate, among households earning less than $50,000 per year, 44% say they expect to spend less on dining out this year than they did last year.",
      "\"The low-income consumer remains under pressure,\" Sara Senatore, a research analyst at Bank of America, recently told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Gasoline prices, meanwhile, fell 0.5% from June and 9.5% from July 2024, the CPI data shows.",
      "What the experts say about the impact of tariffs",
      "Economists have been watching closely to determine how tariffs might trickle through to the CPI data. For the first several months of the year, the impact appeared to be limited, but June's reading indicated that the levies might be starting to drive up prices in certain categories such as apparel, home furnishings and appliances.",
      "Goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union are now subject to a new round of reciprocal tariffs that went into effect on Aug. 7.",
      "The figures from today's CPI report suggest that while the prices of certain imported goods such as shoes and furniture rose from June to July, the cheaper cost of gas is offsetting some of the impact of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.",
      "\"There is some sign of tariff pass through to consumer prices but, at this stage, it is not significant enough to ring alarm bells,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist a Principal Asset Management, said in an email to CBS News after today's CPI report was released.",
      "During a call with media yesterday, Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, said the investment bank expects consumers will start to see the direct effects of the tariffs this year or into early next year.",
      "\"It's possible that these tariff-induced price increases are a one-time price level shock that will start coming down early next year,\" said Detmeister. \"We think they're going to be much more lasting.\"",
      "Detmeister expects both core and headline CPI to peak in the second quarter of 2026, with headline CPI at 3.7% and core CPI at 3.8%.",
      "What the inflation data could mean for a Fed rate cut",
      "With the CPI in July rising to annualized rate of 2.7%, inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target rate, however, most analysts say that the possibility of a Fed rate cut in September is likely still on the table.",
      "\"Although core annual inflation is back to its highest level since February, today's CPI print is not hot enough to derail the Fed from cutting rates in September,\" said Shah.",
      "The latest jobs report showed that hiring slowed in July, which could bolster the case for a Fed rate cut.",
      "The Fed's mandate is to maintain maximum employment, while keeping prices down. Otherwise, the country\u00a0could slip into what's called stagflation\u00a0\u2014 which is when high inflation is coupled with high unemployment.",
      "More economic data \u2014 in the form of another CPI and jobs report \u2014 is expected next month, which will inform the central bank's decision.",
      "FactSet gives an 88% probability of a rate cut at the meeting, which is scheduled for Sept. 16 to 17.",

A so-called going concern warning is an accounting term that signals a risk that a business might cease operations.",
      "Shares of Kodak plunged $1.73, or 26%, to $5.05 in Tuesday morning trading. Reached for comment, a Kodak spokesperson pointed to the statement in its regulatory filing.",
      "The warning is the latest development in the photography company's storied history, which includes introducing one of the first consumer cameras in the 1880s and mass manufacturing film rolls for hobbyists and professionals alike. But Kodak struggled to adapt when digital cameras overtook film starting in the 1990s, leading to a bankruptcy filing in 2012.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Aug 2025 15:41:00 -0400",
    "summary": "E.J. Antoni, an economist nominated by President Trump to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the jobs report is flawed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0is suggesting that the agency suspend its monthly jobs report, an economic staple that is relied upon by the Federal Reserve and U.S. businesses to gauge the health of the economy.",
      "In an interview on Fox News Digital on Monday ahead of his nomination, E.J. Antoni criticized the monthly employment report as flawed and suggested it be replaced with \"more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.\"",
      "Antoni, who is a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, was tapped by Mr. Trump on Monday to run the BLS after the president\u00a0fired the former commissioner\u00a0earlier this month, blaming her for a disappointing July jobs report. Mr. Trump took issue with large revisions made to the previous month's jobs data, although jobs number revisions are commonly issued by the agency as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "\"How on earth are businesses supposed to plan \u2014 or how is the Fed supposed to conduct monetary policy \u2014 when they don't know how many jobs are being added or lost in our economy? It's a serious problem that needs to be fixed immediately,\" Antoni told Fox News Digital.",
      "He added, \"Until it is corrected, the BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports but keep publishing the more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.\"",
      "While some survey recipients immediately respond to the BLS' surveys, others report data later, which leads to the monthly revisions. Despite this, the BLS issues its monthly jobs report in order to report employment information in a timely manner, even though it is subject to revisions \u2014 both up and down \u2014 in later reports.",
      "Asked whether the BLS would continue to release monthly jobs reports, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"I believe that is the plan and that's the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust.\"",
      "Leavitt said \"we need to restore new leadership that we trust\" at the BLS, adding that \"we need to look at the means and the methods of how the United States is acquiring this very important data.\"",
      "\"The goal, of course, is to provide honest and good data for the American people to make very important economic decisions on,\" she said.",
      "Responding to the BLS' employment surveys is voluntary for businesses, while the federal government's Office of Management and Budget directs the BLS to release \"robust\" data on basic economic indicators in a \"timely\" manner. But that's become more challenging as fewer people and institutions respond to surveys, experts say.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Aug 2025 14:17:15 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order that he says will democratize alternative investments for workers saving for retirement.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump says he wants to democratize retirement by allowing 401(k)s to invest in so-called alternative investments, or strategies outside stocks and other traditional investments, such as private equity and cryptocurrencies.",
      "The executive order signed by Mr. Trump on Thursday would open the door to higher-risk investments landing in your 401(k). It could also potentially serve as a game changer for the $5 trillion private equity industry, which for years has wanted to gain access to America's retirement plans.",
      "The move has the potential to shake up the typically staid menu of investment choices provided to workers through their employer-sponsored defined-contribution plans, which include 401(k)s and 403(b)s, with the latter aimed at teachers. The change might appeal to some savers, given that alternative investments can provide protection from market swings while also providing the potential for outsized returns. But there are several catches to be aware of, experts say.",
      "Private equity investments \"have matured into a strong-performing asset class delivering excellent long-term returns, so this is good news for Americans,\" Simon Tang, head of U.S. at Accelex, a private markets specialist, said in an email.",
      "But there are caveats, experts say. For one, some alternative investments carry higher risk profiles than traditional asset classes, and offer less transparency about their performance on a day-to-day basis. It's also unclear whether or not employers will want to offer such investments given the risks.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What does the executive order change about 401(k)s?",
      "The president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under\u00a0401(k) retirement\u00a0rules.",
      "Americans' retirement plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, a law better known as\u00a0ERISA. Under that regulation, employers are required to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street.",
      "Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold.",
      "Workers would still be able to limit their investments to traditional assets like stocks and bonds, and would also be able to opt out of adding new alternative strategies to their portfolios.",
      "When could those changes become effective?",
      "It's unclear, but it's likely going to take months or even longer given the complexity of ERISA.",
      "After the Labor Department provides its new guidance, it will take time for major retirement plan companies such as Fidelity and Vanguard to develop appropriate funds for employers to use.",
      "Employers will also likely need time to revise their retirement plan options, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity become mainstream investments in individual retirement plans. Whether employers and their workers will opt to invest in these asset classes is another question, experts added.",
      "\"While asset managers are salivating over the idea of tapping in to a portion of the $12.5 trillion in defined contribution assets, we believe adoption will be slow due to cost, transparency and complexity,\" said Pitchbook analysts in a report written to provide an analysis of some aspects of Mr. Trump's order.",
      "How risky are these investments?",
      "All investments carry risks, but alternative asset classes come with additional pitfalls that heighten their potential for volatility. For instance, private equity invests in companies that are not publicly traded, which makes it difficult to know on a day-to-day basis whether the investment is up, down or sideways.",
      "\"When it comes to investing in stocks, retail investors are used to instant pricing, clean data and daily performance updates,\" Tang said. \"Private markets are a different ballgame. There's no real-time information, no ticker and no standardization, just fragmented documents and unstructured formats.\"",
      "Cryptocurrencies, for their part, may have more transparency on pricing, but they can also be extremely volatile, with major shifts in valuation from day to day. That said, cryptocurrencies have grown increasingly popular, with about 1 in 4 people investing in crypto, according to Security.org.",
      "Do alternative investments outperform stocks and bonds?",
      "Alternative investments can outperform stocks and bonds, but there's no guarantee.",
      "For instance, bitcoin last year jumped 135% in value, compared with a 24% increase in the S&P 500. But in 2022, it was another story, with bitcoin dropping 65% while the S&P 500 lost 19%, one analysis shows.",
      "Private equity investments, meanwhile, returned 13.5% over a 10-year period, outpacing the 9.7% return for stocks and a 1.9% for bonds over the same period, according to a recent study.",
      "While the potential for outsized gains may appeal to some investors, alternative investments also tend to carry higher costs, such as pricier fees for fund managers, which can eat into returns.",
      "\"Higher costs come from the fact that while you can trade a stock for pennies, it requires travel, negotiations, legal work, and much more, to buy and operate a private company. These costs are typically passed along to fund investors,\" Pitchbook said.",

      "Antoni is a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, and he holds a doctorate in economics from Northern Illinois University. He's defended Mr. Trump's economic policy moves in the past, including the president's tariff strategy. He has also\u00a0criticized the BLS\u00a0for low response rates and questioned the agency's methodology, calling its health insurance figures \"phoney baloney\" last year and at one point joking that \"the 'L' is silent\" in BLS' name.",
      "\"DOGE needs to take a chainsaw to the BLS...,\" he wrote in a November\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"There are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data\u2014that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the last several years,\" he wrote shortly after Mr. Trump fired the former BLS chief.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated Antoni in a Truth Social post, saying he \"will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.\"",
      "Antoni will need to be confirmed by the Senate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is currently led by acting Commissioner William Watrowski, who has worked at the agency for decades.",
      "Mr. Trump ordered his administration to terminate Erika McEntarfer, who had been commissioner of labor statistics, on Aug. 1, hours after the release of the July jobs report data. That report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, along with a steep downward revision to May and June's hiring numbers.",
      "Hours before her firing, Antoni criticized BLS for \"data problems\" and a trend of \"highly problematic\" revisions, though he also touted some figures in the July jobs report, including a jump in employment by native-born Americans and a slowdown in government jobs.",
      "In the wake of McEntarfer's firing, influential ex-Trump strategist Steve Bannon backed Antoni to take over the BLS. Antoni appeared on Bannon's show \"War Room\" on the day the jobs report came out, calling McEntarfer \"incompetent.\" Days later, Bannon said \"we're pushing\" for Antoni to lead the BLS, and called him \"the guy that almost single-handedly took it down by going through their numbers.\"",
      "Announcing McEntarfer's firing in a post on Truth Social, the president claimed \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that she had \"faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala's chances of Victory\" and pledged to replace her \"with someone much more competent and qualified.\"",
      "But Harvard economics professor Jason Furman, a head of the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama, was sharply critical of the selection of Antoni,\u00a0saying on X that, \"I don't think I have ever publicly criticized any Presidential nominee before. But E.J. Antoni is completely unqualified to be BLS Commissioner. He is an extreme partisan and does not have any relevant expertise. He would be a break from decades of nonpartisan technocrats.\"",
      "Jessica Riedl, an economist at the conservative Manhattan Institute,\u00a0said on X that she's \"never met EJ Antoni because he is not seen in many DC policy circles. However, the articles and tweets I've seen him publish are probably the most error-filled of any think tank economist right now. I hope we see better at BLS.\"",
      "The jobs report for October 2024, which was released on Nov. 1, 2024, four days before Election Day, showed just 12,000 jobs were created \u2014 far short of the 100,000 forecast for the month \u2014 following two hurricanes and a major labor dispute. The following month, that figure was revised upward, to 36,000. September's jobs report, however, dramatically exceeded forecasts \u2014 254,000 jobs were created, rather than the 140,000 economic analysts had expected. That figure was later revised down to 223,000.",
      "Mr. Trump continued railing against the ousted commissioner and the BLS more broadly in the days after he fired her, claiming in a post on Truth Social last week that the July jobs report had been \"RIGGED,\" though he provided no evidence to support it. The president said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Tuesday that it's a \"highly political situation.\" And National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the president's decision in an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" citing a series of revisions and patterns that \"could make people wonder.\"",
      "\"What we need is a fresh set of eyes over at the BLS,\" Hassett said, adding that \"the president wants his own people there so that when we see the numbers they're more transparent and more reliable.\"",
      "McEntarfer had been commissioner for a little over a year and a half, after she was confirmed in a broad bipartisan vote of 86 to 8 by the Senate in January 2024.",
      "The latest jobs report showed employers in July adding a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, with a downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June. Mr. Trump, who often touts the job numbers, called the jobs figures a \"shock\" and the revision a \"major mistake.\" The BLS said in its report that monthly revisions \"result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.\"",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer acknowledged in an interview for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" earlier this month that \"there are always revisions,\" but he added that \"sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways.\"",
      "\"The president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch,\" Greer said.",
      "Meanwhile, some economists and lawmakers have expressed concern over the firing, and a group of former BLS leaders warned that the move \"undermines the valuable work and dedication of BLS staff\" and \"escalates the President's unprecedented attacks on the independence and integrity of the federal statistical system.\" The group called on Congress to investigate the firing.",

    "story": [
      "A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers superstar and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island's coveted Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse.",
      "According to the lawsuit filed in Hawaii Circuit Court on Friday, Ohtani's agent, Nez Balelo, increasingly demanded concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto before demanding that their business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, drop them from the deal.",
      "\"Balelo and Otani, who were brought into the venture solely for Otani's promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs' role in the project \u2014 for no reason other than their own financial self-interest,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "The suit accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture.",
      "A spokesman for Balelo's agency, CAA Baseball, declined comment. Attempts to reach Kingsbarn officials for comment were not immediately successful.",
      "\"This case is about abuse of power,\" the lawsuit says. \"Defendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built.",
      "\"Defendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants' misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all \u2014 celebrity or not.\"",
      "Ohtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. A five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract\u00a0with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series.",
      "Investment materials for The Vista at Mauna Kea Resort, which remained online on Monday night, listed Hayes and Matsumoto as part of the management team, along with Kingsbarn. It called Ohtani \"Japan's Babe Ruth\" and the \"1st Resident,\" giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, \"one of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii,\" Hapuna Beach, \"rated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler\" and two golf courses \u2014 one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr.",
      "\"Ohtani will act as the celebrity spokesperson for the project and has committed to purchasing one of the 14 residences within the project,\" the brochure says. \"He also intends to spend significant time at The Vista in the off-season and will construct a small hitting and pitching facility for preseason training.\"",
      "Ohtani touted the project as his upcoming \"winter home\" in April, CBS Honolulu affiliate KGMB-TV reported at the time",
      "The suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and \"as part of a bold marketing strategy\" signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, \"one of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable.\"",
      "\"This partnership with Ohtani will elevate the demand and create buzz within the Japanese luxury vacation home market, which is a primary target audience for the project,\" the investment brochure said. \"We see Shohei Ohtani's homeownership as having a significant impact on the global exposure of the project and expect to accelerate the pace of sales, thereby helping us achieve our pricing objectives.\"",
      "The suit said Balelo \"quickly became a disruptive force,\" threatening to pull Ohtani from the deal if concessions weren't made.",
      "\"Kingsbarn began capitulating to Balelo's every whim,\" the suit said. \"Over time, it became increasingly obvious that Kingsbarn was more concerned about preserving its relationship with Otani than honoring its obligations to its business partners.\"",
      "Last month, in what the suit called \"a coordinated ambush,\" Kingsbarn fired Hayes and Matsumoto.",
      "\"Kingsbarn openly admitted during the call that Balelo had demanded the terminations and that they were being done solely to placate him,\" the suit said. \"Plaintiffs stand to lose millions of dollars in compensation tied to projected homebuilding profit, construction management fees, and broker commissions.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Aug 2025 20:43:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has extended a temporary truce in the U.S.-China trade war, preventing tariffs on China from leaping to at least 80%.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday signed an executive order delaying a set of sky-high tariffs on Chinese goods for at least 90 days, extending a ceasefire in the U.S.-China trade war, the White House announced.",
      "The president's order will keep tariffs at 30% \u2014 the level that was set in mid-May, when both countries agreed to temporarily back off a set of tit-for-tat tariffs that exceeded 100%. That agreement was set to expire Tuesday, and without an extension, levies on some Chinese goods could have leaped to at least 80%, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has said.",
      "The order says the U.S.'s \"reciprocal\" tariff on Chinese goods will remain at 10% until at least Nov. 10. An additional 20% tariff on China that was imposed earlier this year due to fentanyl trafficking is\u00a0also still in place, bringing the total rate to 30%.",
      "China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement it will maintain a 10% tariff on U.S. goods.",
      "\"The United States and China have engaged in multiple rounds of productive negotiations to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns,\" the White House said in a fact sheet announcing the extension.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last week that China and the U.S. were \"likely\" to agree to a 90-day extension as the two countries seek to negotiate a longer-term trade deal. Mr. Trump told reporters earlier Monday those negotiations were going \"quite nicely.\" Representatives from both sides met in Stockholm late last month.",
      "Greer told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" earlier this month that \"I don't think anyone wants to see\" high tariffs on China snap back.",
      "\"We're working on some technical issues, and we're talking to the president about it,\" Greer said. \"I think it's going in a positive direction.\"",
      "A return to high tariffs could have caused U.S. imports of Chinese goods to plummet, disrupting trade between the world's two largest economies. In mid-April, when tariffs on Chinese imports still stood at 145%, the Trump administration planned for possible supply chain disruptions.",
      "China was the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner last year, not counting the European Union. The U.S. imported $438.9 billion in Chinese goods and China imported $143.5 billion in American goods, according to U.S. government data.",
      "Mr. Trump first hit China with 34% tariffs in early April, one of dozens of countries to face hefty \"reciprocal\" levies. The president argues tariffs could boost U.S. manufacturers and correct what he views as unfair trade practices, but many economists warn Mr. Trump's trade strategy could lead to higher consumer prices and more sluggish economic growth.",
      "The president quickly paused his April tariffs for most countries, and reinstated them, often at substantially lower levels, last week. But the China levies remained in place for more than a month and drew retaliation from Beijing, ultimately pushing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% and Chinese tariffs on American goods to 125%.",
      "The two countries agreed to ease the tariffs for at least 90 days in May, buying more time for Mr. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping's teams to negotiate a trade deal. Since then, the U.S. has charged 30% tariffs and China has charged 10%.",
      "The talks have occasionally proven contentious. Earlier this year, the two countries feuded over Beijing's restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, Washington's restrictions on advanced semiconductors and the Trump administration's crackdown on international students from China. Mr. Trump accused China of violating the terms of the May truce \u2014 though both countries reached a deal to ease some of those tensions in June. And on Sunday, Mr. Trump pushed China to quadruple its imports of U.S. soybeans.",

      "The company unveiled its new \"universal EV platform\" at a Monday event, with Ford CEO Jim Farley calling it \"the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T,\" which Ford introduced in 1908.",
      "According to Ford, the new assembly line will be structured more like an \"assembly tree,\" with three different lines that converge into one, rather than a single assembly belt.",
      "\"This way of building a vehicle, we're confident, is the first time anyone's done this anywhere in the world,\" said Doug Field, Ford's EV chief of digital and design, at Monday's event.",
      "The company said the design will lead to a quicker, smoother assembly process and improve ergonomics for employees through a less obstructive layout.",
      "\"Ford's announcement is very ambitious, because it includes both a new production process and a new vehicle,\" said Patrick Anderson, founder of Michigan-based consulting firm Anderson Economic Group, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"If they can actually pull off a production line that has 40% fewer workstations and 20% fewer parts, it will be worthy of the 'Model T moment' claim.",
      "Ford's first EV from the new system",
      "The first product of this new production system will be a four-door midsize truck, which will debut in 2027. Farley said on Monday that the new vehicle will accommodate five people and feature a \"frunk\" \u2014 a front storage compartment \u2014 as well as a pickup truck bed.",
      "The vehicle will start at $30,000. By comparison, the average price for a new electric vehicle in July was about $56,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.",

      "\"Outlets in the back can give you high power and let you plug in anything from tools to a refrigerator, and it can provide backup power for your home,\" he said.",
      "The midsize electric truck could be produced up to 40% faster than other vehicles at the Louisville Assembly Plant due to the new process, Ford said.",
      "In another effort to lower costs, the auto company is also reducing the number of components that go into each car. Vehicles produced on the \"universal EV platform\" will have 20% fewer parts than a traditional vehicle, Ford said.",
      "The company will also use smaller cobalt and nickel-free batteries that will allow it to make \"cost gains,\" according to a video shared by Ford.",
      "Anderson said that Ford has its work cut out for them given that the new truck will need to be competitively priced and economical. According to the auto industry expert, the cost of charging EV trucks currently on the market is often much higher than the price at the pump for gas-powered versions. A report from the Anderson Economic Group shows pickup trucks drivers in New York, California and Michigan face \"significantly higher costs\" if they rely on an EV.",
      "A successfully lower-cost truck model, however, could spur a new chapter for the company in its manufacturing of EVs.",

      "The move amounts to a sweeping reversal of \"sanctuary\" policies in the nation's capital, allowing the Metropolitan Police Department, for the time being, to fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement as President Trump asserts more control over the District of Columbia, citing concerns about crime and disorder. City officials quickly pushed back on the legality of Bondi's order, saying they were not bound by it.",
      "Mr. Trump has cited concerns about criminality and homelessness\u00a0to launch a high-profile anti-crime crackdown in Washington, deploying National Guard troops and hundreds of agents from federal agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, Customs and Border Protection, ICE and the FBI to patrol parts of the city.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 20:27:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As Texas hurtles toward a flashpoint on a GOP effort to redraw congressional districts, California Democrats are answering with a plan of their own.",
    "story": [
      "California Democrats are preparing to counter Republicans' attempt to reshape a series of Texas congressional districts for political advantage in a back and forth that could define next year's midterm elections and with it, the final two years of President Trump's second term.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he is moving forward with a redistricting plan Thursday as national tensions rage over changing congressional lines mid-decade. Districts are usually redrawn after the decennial census, and under California law, the changes would require a special election.",
      "Newsom has vowed his state would respond after Texas Republicans released plans earlier this summer to redraw five seats held by Democrats and make them more favorable to the GOP.",
      "\"California won't stand by and watch Trump burn it all down \u2014 we are calling a special election to redraw our Congressional maps and defend fair representation,\" Newsom said Thursday in a post on X ahead of his remarks.",
      "Newsom, speaking alongside a number of California officials in Los Angeles, said Mr. Trump is \"trying to rig the system,\" adding that \"as a consequence, we need to disabuse ourselves of the way things have been done.\"",
      "\"We have got to recognize the cards that have been dealt,\" Newsom said. \"And we have got to meet fire with fire.\"",
      "The California governor said the effort is happening \"in reaction to a president of the United States that called a sitting governor of the state of Texas and said 'find me five seats.'\"",
      "\"I know they say don't mess with Texas,\" Newsom said. \"Well, don't mess with the great Golden State.\"",
      "Newsom's team participated in a series of conversations with the state's Democratic congressional delegation and the California Legislature as drafts of possible maps were discussed. According to U.S. Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, the conversations were initially centered on the question, \"Is this even conceptually possible?\"",
      "California Democrats concluded that it was possible to gain five Democratic seats to counter Texas' gains, according to Lofgren. \"I'm confident that if we need to move forward, we will do that successfully. There's tremendous unity on the Democratic side.\"",
      "Republicans currently control both chambers of Congress and hold the White House. At the moment, if Democrats were to win back as few as three seats in next year's midterms, they could flip control of the House. That path would be threatened however if Republicans and Mr. Trump succeed in convincing GOP-led states like Texas, Indiana and Missouri to take some of their Democratic-held districts and alter them to favor Republicans instead.",
      "The developments in California Thursday come as Texas Republicans struggle to pass the maps that have become a national issue. Breakaway state House Democrats fled Texas earlier this month, denying the chamber the quorum it needed to take action on the new maps during a special legislative session.",
      "Since then, national Democrats have sought to call attention to what Republicans are trying to do in Texas, even as it's opened the left up to accusations of hypocrisy. During the standoff, some Texas Democrats have spoken out from Illinois, a blue state that was criticized for drawing its congressional maps after the 2020 Census to give Democrats the advantage.",
      "For both sides, the issue of congressional districts has become even more starkly partisan this summer. Various attempts have also been made in court to bring state House Democrats back to Texas, or to create a path that will help Republicans get their way.",
      "During a floor speech \u2014 before the maps passed the Texas Senate earlier this week in what amounted to a moot effort, given the House's obstacles \u2014 Republican Phil King bluntly said an objective of his \"was to support a plan that, simply put, elects more Republicans to the U.S. Congress.\"",
      "With the special session in Texas set to end in just a few days, Republicans have been adamant about eventually passing the maps, even if it takes more time and special sessions. With Democratic power limited in the state, there is a sense that Republicans will eventually be able to get their way.",
      "But the situation has left an opening for Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, to create a new front in the political fight, given that Democrats may have a path to redrawing Republican-held congressional districts in the blue state of California.",
      "A challenging process in California",
      "But California's effort will likely prove to be far more difficult and time intensive than the Republican-led push in Texas.",
      "In California, only nine of the state's 52 U.S. House districts are held by Republicans. Earlier this century, voters in the state signed off on putting in the state's constitution an independent citizens redistricting commission to decide new boundaries following the once a decade census process.",
      "The state-level differences between Democrat-led California and Republican-led Texas essentially make it harder for California Democrats to redraw districts in their state than it currently is for Texas Republicans. In Texas, GOP leaders and Mr. Trump allies just need to go through the normal legislative process to change districts.",
      "Because of California's constitution, changing the redistricting process in the state ahead of the 2026 midterms would likely require a new amendment. To take effect, it would need to be passed by a two-thirds vote in both the Assembly and Senate, and then be approved by California voters in an election. That election could prove costly, with major implications for the country on the line.",
      "Newsom said the difference between what's happening in California and Texas is \"we're working through a very transparent, temporary and public process.\"",
      "\"We're putting the maps on the ballot, and we're giving the power to the people,\" he said, adding that California would affirm its commitment to the state independent redistricting after the 2030 census.",
      "California lawmakers are scheduled to return to Sacramento on Aug. 18 amid the redistricting talk. The Legislature will have five days to conduct public hearings and formalize the process.",

      "A federal judge on Thursday struck down two Trump administration actions aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the nation's schools and universities.",
      "In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland found that the Education Department violated the law when it threatened to cut federal funding from educational institutions that continued with DEI initiatives.",
      "The guidance has been on hold since April when three federal judges blocked various portions of the Education Department's anti-DEI measures.",
      "The ruling Thursday followed a motion for summary judgment from the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association, which challenged the government's actions in a February lawsuit.",
      "The case centers on two Education Department memos ordering schools and universities to end all \"race-based decision-making\" or face penalties up to a total loss of federal funding. It's part of a campaign to end practices the Trump administration frames as discrimination against white and Asian American students.",
      "The new ruling orders the department to scrap the guidance because it runs afoul of procedural requirements, though Gallagher wrote that she took no view on whether the policies were \"good or bad, prudent or foolish, fair or unfair.\"",
      "Gallagher, who was appointed by President Trump, rejected the government's argument that the memos simply served to remind schools that discrimination is illegal.",
      "\"It initiated a sea change in how the Department of Education regulates educational practices and classroom conduct, causing millions of educators to reasonably fear that their lawful, and even beneficial, speech might cause them or their schools to be punished,\" Gallagher wrote.",
      "Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy firm representing the plaintiffs, called it an important victory over the administration's attack on DEI.",
      "\"Threatening teachers and sowing chaos in schools throughout America is part of the administration's war on education, and today the people won,\" said Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO.",
      "The Education Department did not immediately comment on Thursday.",
      "The conflict started with a Feb. 14 memo declaring that any consideration of race in admissions, financial aid, hiring or other aspects of academic and student life would be considered a violation of federal civil rights law.",
      "The memo dramatically expanded the government's interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring colleges from considering race in admissions decisions. The government argued the ruling applied not only to admissions but across all of education, forbidding \"race-based preferences\" of any kind.",
      "\"Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon 'systemic and structural racism' and advanced discriminatory policies and practices,\" wrote Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary of the department's Office for Civil Rights.",
      "A further memo in April asked state education agencies to certify they were not using \"illegal DEI practices.\" Violators risked losing federal money and being prosecuted under the False Claims Act, it said.",
      "In total, the guidance amounted to a full-scale reframing of the government's approach to civil rights in education. It took aim at policies that were created to address longstanding racial disparities, saying those practices were their own form of discrimination.",
      "The memos drew a wave of backlash from states and education groups that called it illegal government censorship.",
      "In its lawsuit, the American Federation of Teachers said the government was imposing \"unclear and highly subjective\" limits on schools across the country. It said teachers and professors had to \"choose between chilling their constitutionally protected speech and association or risk losing federal funds and being subject to prosecution.\"",

      "When the sounds of gunfire reverberated through the hallways of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Wang was in study hall. As panic spread, he moved toward the exit \u2014 not to flee, but to hold the door open, easing the way for his classmates to escape.",
      "He was shot 13 times. Wang was found dead in a third-floor hallway, wearing his Army JROTC uniform.",

      "Some members of the class of 2025 were already familiar with Wang's story and the tragic path that led to his posthumous admission. But for many, the details emerged only when his name was announced as an honorary member of the graduating class. From that moment, classmates say, his story became part of the class's shared identity \u2014 an enduring example of selflessness and sacrifice.",

      "\"Peter demonstrated the characteristics and attributes we seek out of graduates of the Naval Academy or West Point,\" retired Lt. Gen. Robert Caslen told CBS News in May. Caslen, who was the superintendent of West Point in 2018, authorized Wang's entry into the class of 2025.",
      "He added, \"Individuals like Peter are exactly the men and women you want leading America's youth in combat situations, the fact that he demonstrated that at his age says a lot about him which is why we made him an honorary member of the class.\"",

    "summary": "Democrat Abigail Spanberger is trying to win over Latino voters in her bid to be the next governor of Virginia.",
    "story": [
      "Democrat Abigail Spanberger is working to make inroads with Latino voters ahead of the 2025 Virginia gubernatorial election, releasing her first Spanish-language radio ad on Thursday.",
      "The former congresswoman addresses rising costs, telling voters in Spanish, \"I know what it's like for families today. I got things done to lower costs. That's what I'll do as governor, too.\"",
      "Democrats across the country are working to regain the Latino support the party lost in the 2024 elections. President Trump made inroads with Latino voters both nationally and in key battleground states in the last election, outpacing Vice President Kamala Harris among Latino men. CBS News exit polling found the economy was the top issue for these voters, and most said they were worse off financially than they were four years earlier.",
      "But polling since Mr. Trump's inauguration suggests that support among Latinos is now slipping. Unidos US polling of Latino voters on the first 100 days of Mr. Trump's second term suggests that only 19% felt the economy is better, compared to 2024. Looking ahead to 2026, 29% of Latino voters believe the economic policies being implemented will make their own personal finances better. The economy ranks as their No. 1 priority. Sixty percent said Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans are not focusing enough on bringing down the cost of everyday goods.",
      "A spokesperson for Spanberger's campaign said she's \"meeting Latino Virginians where they are \u2014 on the ground and in-language \u2014 and will continue connecting with and listening to Virginians in every community to emphasize her focus on lowering costs for families, keeping communities safe, and preparing the next generation of Virginians for success.\"",
      "Latinos make up almost 11% of Virginia's total population, according to the Census Bureau, and their numbers are expected to continue to rise. Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha thinks Spanberger's focus on Latino voters is strategically smart.",
      "\"We saw in the last few cycles the Latino vote nationally has moved 18 points more Republican,\" Rocha said. \"She's starting early to build a narrative about what she's going to do to make people's lives better, and this affordability issue is the best place to be with Latinos right now.\"",
      "Spanberger has promised to work to lower the costs of health care and prescription drugs, housing and energy, as governor.",
      "Her ad also takes aim at her opponent, GOP Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, for supporting Trump administration policy proposals like shutting down the Department of Education.",
      "\"Sears backs Trump's cuts to education and health care, too,\" the ad says. \"We need a governor who fights for Virginia, not Trump.\"",
      "Earle-Sears is campaigning on her work alongside Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and promising to continue his agenda if she's elected. On Thursday, her campaign announced a six-figure ad buy that highlights her record and labels Spanberger, who represented Virginia in Congress for six years, as a \"Washington insider.\"",
      "She criticizes Spanberger in a TV ad, saying that the former congresswoman \"voted with Pelosi and Biden every single time.\"",
      "\"That kind of Beltway nonsense will only take us backwards,\" Earle-Sears says in the ad. \"Governor Youngkin put us on the right path. Now I'm asking for your vote to keep it that way.\"",
      "Virginia's race for governor is often viewed as a referendum on the administration, since it occurs a year after the presidential election. In an interview with CBS News in June, Spanberger said Virginians like the fact that they're one of two states that will elect a new governor in 2025: \"This November, Virginia gets to be the first to the polls, along with our friends up in New Jersey, to be able to make clear what it is that we want in our state leadership.\""

    "summary": "The trial over President Trump's deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles earlier this summer reached its third and final day Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "The trial over President Trump's deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles earlier this summer reached its third and final day Wednesday, as lawyers for the Justice Department and the state of California argued over the validity of Gov. Gavin Newsom's lawsuit and whether the Posse Comitatus Act \u2014 which generally bars the military from engaging in domestic law enforcement \u2014 applied to the troop deployment.",
      "Mr. Trump in June deployed 4,000 California National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles, saying they were needed to protect federal property and law enforcement agents amid June protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations. Newsom did not approve of the use of his state's Guard forces and responded with a lawsuit\u00a0requesting an injunction limiting the military's role in the city.",
      "In addition to claiming the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act does not apply, Eric Hamilton, a lawyer for the Department of Justice, argued that there is no precedent for the lawsuit, for injunctive relief or money damages under the act, and that Newsom and the state of California have not suffered the harm required to sue.",
      "\"It is, in fact, the federal government who is engaged in unprecedented conduct,\" said Deputy Attorney General Meghan Strong, representing the State of California, explaining that the government has never used the military in this way before.",
      "U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer seemed perplexed by several of the government's assertions, particularly what he called the apparent \"absence of any limits to a national police force.\" He questioned the Justice Department's claim that the 19th century law at the center of this trial is not relevant, and the assertion that his court lacks jurisdiction to issue an injunction against the president.",
      "\"So then what is the remedy?\" Breyer asked Hamilton, raising the issue of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution. \"You're saying there's a criminal remedy? The president can be prosecuted? You say that in light of the Supreme Court decision, the Trump decision. Isn't he immune?\"",
      "\"So that's it. Too bad. So sad. It's over,\" he added emphatically. \"And that's the end of the case.\"",
      "California has asked Breyer for an injunction that would allow the military to protect federal property \u2014 such as courthouses and ICE facilities \u2014 but block it from continuing the support for immigration enforcement operations, which the state's lawyer called an \"unlawful military crusade.\"",
      "\"The constitution and the law and the facts are on Governor Newsom's side,\" said Josh Kastenberg, a professor at the University of New Mexico Law School. \"But that doesn't mean he's going to win. Ever since World War II, the courts have embraced this military deference doctrine, which really is presidential deference in matters of military command and control.\"",
      "Questions over scope",
      "\"We're going to see federal officers everywhere if the president determines that there's some threat to the safety of a federal agent,\" Breyer said to Hamilton. \"And it's his determination. Not mine, it's his. That's what you're saying. That's what the law is.\"",
      "Hamilton said that wasn't \"quite what I'm saying.\" He asserted the troops are not enforcing federal law, but providing protection, and that it is lawful for guardsmen and marines to provide protection for federal buildings \u2014 the one point he agreed with California's attorney on. But, he argued, there is no distinction between protecting federal property and protecting federal law enforcement working out in the field.",
      "Breyer pointed out that federal employees \"are everywhere.\"",
      "The judge further questioned why any National Guard members remain in Los Angeles, and expressed concern about the justification for continued operations. Hamilton testified that 300 guardsmen remain, a 90% reduction in the force. Strong countered that it is still a significant number of soldiers, and certainly enough to violate the law.",
      "\"Thank goodness for the National Guard, but why is the federalized National Guard still in place?\" asked Breyer. \"What's the threat today? What was the threat yesterday?\"",
      "\"I go back to the thing that I'm really troubled by: What limiting factors are there to the use of this force?\" he said, \"Once you have a force in place, and maybe legitimately do so, and the threat that gave rise to the force in that place subsides \u2026 how does one look at this national police force that goes out of where the threat was and starts executing other laws?\"",
      "Does the Posse Comitatus Act apply?",
      "Breyer appeared to take issue with the Justice Department's argument that the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply, noting that a key witness, Major General Scott Sherman \u2014 who was at one point the commanding general of the Guard task force in Los Angeles \u2014 had testified that the troops were trained to act within the bounds of that law.",
      "\"Then why is it the excellent Major General sought assurance that the Posse Comitatus Act was followed?\" said Breyer. \"Why did I spend a day looking at slide after slide, and regulation after regulation, and reports after reports on conduct of the soldiers to ensure that they were in compliance with the Posse Comitatus Act if the Posse Comitatus Act is irrelevant?\"",
      "Strong argued that all of the Department of Defense's leaders agreed that the Posse Comitatus Act applied to the Task Force 51 troops in Los Angeles. She said they substituted the word \"protection\" for \"security\" when describing the troops' activities because they knew that \"security\" would violate the act.",
      "She asserted that the secretary of defense had released a memorandum invoking a constitutional exception to the Posse Comitatus Act, and affirmatively instructing soldiers to engage in activities that violated it \u2014 but the memo was issued after those activities had taken place.",
      "On Tuesday, Sherman testified that he was advised of a \"constitutional exception\" that enabled the troops to conduct certain activities that would normally violate the Posse Comitatus Act.",
      "Strong called this an attempt by the Department of Defense to justify their actions after the fact that \"itself reveals a knowledge and awareness of their violations.\"",
      "The federal government is \"disregarding the law, and so we need show nothing more than that,\" said Strong.",
      "She further argued that the Constitution seeks to make sure the president cannot control a standing army the way the king had in 1776. She said that it would deny the basic principles of federalism for the state to have \"no legal recourse to challenge the conduct of these troops.\"",
      "\"If you look at the plain language of the Posse Comitatus Act, and the fear of standing armies that existed at the time of the Constitution,\" Kastenberg said. \"... One of the biggest issues in the state conventions and in the framing of the Constitution to begin with was to significantly curtail the president's authority over the standing army, and keep the standing army very small.\"",
      "Breyer did not give a timeline for his ruling, stating at the end of the day, \"I will decide the case as soon as I can decide the case.\"",

      "\"I think the Republicans in Congress will approve this pretty much unanimously,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the deployment of members of the National Guard to D.C. on Monday and said the federal government would also take control of the D.C. police. In an executive order Monday, the president directed the D.C. mayor to provide the services of the Metropolitan Police Department for federal use \"for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act.\"",
      "The 1973 law allows the president to require the D.C. mayor to provide \"such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary and appropriate\" for a period of 48 hours, a deadline that can be extended by up to 30 days by notifying Congress, which the president has done. Any extension beyond 30 days requires a joint resolution passed by the House and Senate.",
      "Speaking at the Kennedy Center, Mr. Trump said he expects Congress to extend the federal takeover, saying, \"We think the Republicans will do it almost unanimously.\"",
      "\"We're going to need a crime bill that we're going to be putting in and it's going to pertain initially to D.C.,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to be asking for extensions on that, long-term extensions, because you can't have 30 days.\"",
      "Although Republicans have majorities in both the House and Senate, the extension would require the support of at least seven Democrats to advance, since most legislation functions under a 60-vote threshold in the upper chamber, where Republicans control 53 seats.",
      "The president said he could extend the takeover without Congress' help \"if it's a national emergency,\" but he said, \"I don't want to call a national emergency.\"",
      "\"If I have to, I will,\" Mr. Trump added. \"But I think the Republicans in Congress will approve this pretty much unanimously.\"",
      "According to local police data, violent crime in D.C. has been declining for the last year and a half after spiking in 2023. Robberies have dropped by 28% this year and overall violent crime is down 26%, as of Aug. 11.

    "published": "Wed, 13 Aug 2025 12:19:08 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal judge said he would block the Trump administration from using a Manhattan federal building to hold immigrants facing deportation unless it improves conditions there.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Tuesday said he would block the Trump administration from using a federal building in New York City to hold immigrants facing deportation unless it reduces the number of detainees and improves conditions at the site, including by providing sleeping mats and hygiene products.",
      "U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan issued the temporary restraining order after holding a hearing earlier Tuesday. A government lawyer conceded in court that those detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, at the Manhattan facility did not have access to certain services, including sleeping mats, in-person legal visits, medication and more than two meals per day.",
      "The holding facility in question, located inside the 26 Federal Plaza building in downtown Manhattan, has been at the center of widespread criticism from pro-immigrant advocates, who have denounced conditions faced by detainees there as \"inhumane.\" Video released last month showed detainees at the facility lying on the ground, without mats or beds.",
      "ICE has said the site has fewer services because it is not designed for long-term detention, though government data indicates some detainees have been held for days there.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security denied allegations of substandard conditions in ICE's detention system and vowed to appeal the order.",
      "\"Any claim of subprime conditions at ICE facilities are categorically false,\" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement. \"Federal Plaza operates as a processing center, brief intake for illegal aliens, and then transfer to an ICE detention center meeting national standards for care and custody, which are in most cases better than facilities which detain Americans.\"",
      "Last week, the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocates filed a lawsuit against ICE over the 26 Federal Plaza holding facility, alleging that detainees there were being held in unsafe and unsanitary conditions, without access to basic necessities, including hygiene products. The advocates said detainees only received two \"inedible\" meals daily and were denied access to unrestricted calls with lawyers.",
      "On Tuesday morning, Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey Oestericher said the government did not dispute that detainees at the facility only received blankets, not beds or sleeping mats. He confirmed detainees get two meals each day \u2014 not three \u2014 and that the toilets for detainees are inside the same area where they sleep. Oestericher said the facility does not permit in-person visitations due to its \"layout\" and noted the government did not dispute claims that detainees lack access to medication.",
      "In his order later Tuesday, Kaplan placed restrictions on how many people ICE can hold at the Manhattan site, prohibiting the agency from using holding rooms with a floor area that is less than 50 square feet per detainee.",
      "Kaplan said ICE could only hold people at the facility if it offered them regular calls with lawyers, clean bedding mats, know-your-rights notices, access to medication, soap, towels, toilet paper, toothpaste and feminine hygiene products. He also ordered ICE to ensure the holding areas are cleaned three times each day.",
      "Tuesday's temporary restraining order is set to last for 14 days. The Trump administration has repeatedly denied allegations of subpar conditions at ICE detention centers.",
      "\"Today's order sends a clear message: ICE cannot hold people in abusive conditions and deny them their Constitutional rights to due process and legal representation,\" said Eunice Cho, a senior attorney at the ACLU.",
      "New York City Comptroller Brad Lander called the ruling \"a much-needed rebuke of Trump's cruel immigration policies\" in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Video shows conditions for detainees at 26 Federal Plaza ICE facility",
      "In July, the New York Immigration Coalition released a video, which was verified by CBS News New York, showing conditions on the 10th floor of 26 Federal Plaza.",
      "On the video, it appears over two dozen people are being held together in one room. The person taking the video is heard saying, \"Look how they have us here like dogs.\"",
      "The room does not appear to have any furniture in it. A number of people are seen laying or sitting on towels or foil blankets on the floor. There are two toilets with sinks in the back of the room, only separated by half walls with no doors. One of the two toilets is covered with a foil blanket.",
      "The legal fight over the Manhattan holding facility comes at a time when ICE is detaining record numbers of people facing deportation. On Tuesday morning, ICE was holding nearly 60,000 detainees in detention centers throughout the U.S., according to internal agency data.",
      "As part of President Trump's government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration, ICE has sought to expand its detention system by bringing new facilities online, brokering agreements with states willing to convert local sites into immigration detention centers and using military bases, like Fort Bliss in Texas, as deportation staging hubs.",

    "summary": "Lawyers for President Trump and Gov. Gavin Newsom faced off over the National Guard deployment in Los Angeles \u2014 and debated whether they were subject to a \"constitutional exception.\"",
    "story": [
      "Lawyers for the state of California and the federal government faced off in court Tuesday over President Trump's deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles.",
      "The attorney for the state, Meghan Strong, argued that having what she called a \"standing army\" in Los Angeles is \"unprecedented\" and goes against a \"deep-rooted policy against military involvement in civilian life.\" She said that Mr. Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth \"think that they can disregard that policy on a whim.\"",
      "Californians \"have been forced to endure anxiety and fear caused by the pervasive presence of this standing army,\" said Strong.",
      "Mr. Trump sent in around 700 Marines and 4,000 California National Guard troops to protect federal property and law enforcement agents during a series of protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in early June. The deployment prompted a lawsuit from Gov. Gavin Newsom, who did not approve of the use of his state's Guard forces and called the move an illegal \"power grab.\"",
      "At issue in the three-day bench trial pitting Newsom against the Trump administration is whether the troops violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally prohibits military personnel from carrying out domestic law enforcement.",
      "Strong alleged that the federal government acted in violation of that 1878 law, saying troops were used to provide armed security for federal agents, set roadblocks and perimeters that restricted civilian movement, and detained civilians.",
      "California asked U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer for an injunction that would let the military protect federal property \u2014 like courthouses and ICE facilities \u2014 but block it from continuing the support for immigration enforcement operations, which the state's lawyer called an \"unlawful military crusade.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Eric Hamilton, a lawyer for the Justice Department, argued that the military deployment is legal, with the purpose of protecting federal property and personnel. He said that no violation of the Posse Comitatus Act exists.",
      "The federal government's only witness \u2014 Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, who was at one point commanding general of the Guard task force in Los Angeles \u2014 said he was instructed \"that we were not conducting law enforcement operations and that we were there to serve the United States.\"",
      "\"We took our duty very seriously, and care and professionalism was always exhibited,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump justified the deployment using a law called Title 10, which allows the president to call up Guard forces during a \"rebellion,\" or if he is unable \"with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\" In an early June memo, Mr. Trump said the protests in Los Angeles \"constitute a form of rebellion\" and endangered federal agents.",
      "Breyer had previously ruled that Mr. Trump used Title 10 unlawfully, but he was overruled by an appellate court that said Mr. Trump had discretion to decide if that law applied.",
      "Since then, most of the troops have left Los Angeles, with roughly 300 Guard forces remaining. But the issue has drawn more attention in recent days, as the Trump administration deploys National Guard forces to Washington, D.C.",
      "The administration says that deployment is necessary to support law enforcement and crack down on violent crime, but local leaders have condemned the federal government's intervention.",
      "Strong cautioned that \"Los Angeles is only the beginning,\" citing recent comments from Mr. Trump that she said indicated he may deploy the National Guard to other cities, including Oakland and New York.",
      "A \"constitutional exception?\"",
      "Parts of Tuesday's testimony hinged on an alleged \"constitutional exception\" to the Posse Comitatus Act.",
      "At one point, Sherman referred to a \"constitutional exception.\" He testified that he was advised federal troops were allowed to do \"four things\" that would normally be barred under the law \u2014 security patrols, traffic control, crowd control and riot control \u2014 \"because it was in line with what the President was directing\" and \"what the Secretary of Defense was directing.\"",
      "But Judge Breyer was unaware of such an exception and pressed Sherman on the issue.",
      "\"I'm not a lawyer,\" said Sherman.",
      "\"That may be to your credit,\" responded Breyer.",
      "Breyer later asked if Sherman ever received legal advice that if the Guard task force engaged in certain activities, it would violate the Posse Comitatus Act. Sherman testified that he was told, since Mr. Trump's memo said the Los Angeles protests were a form of rebellion that prevented federal agents from doing their jobs, that triggered the constitutional exception. \"This is all the way from the top of DOD down to Task Force 51,\" he said.",
      "California's attorney, Strong, disputed this \"mysterious constitutional exception,\" arguing that neither the president nor the secretary of defense \"can create an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act.\"",
      "\"That means all the directives we've seen the past two days are wrong and what they told soldiers to do was illegal,\" she said. \"Those directives are based on a constitutional exception that doesn't exist.\"",
      "One exception to the Posse Comitatus Act is the Insurrection Act, which lets the president use the military to enforce the law during an insurrection. Mr. Trump has not invoked that law.",
      "\"If he calls something a rebellion, it is a rebellion?\"",
      "Mr. Trump's description of the Los Angeles protests as a \"rebellion\" was raised again in court on Tuesday, after Sherman testified Monday that he didn't hear the term used to describe the demonstrations.",
      "Sherman clarified on Tuesday that he knew Mr. Trump's memo called the protests a rebellion.",
      "The judge later pushed back against the idea that Mr. Trump has the discretion to decide if a \"rebellion\" is occurring. \"If he calls something a rebellion, it is a rebellion?\" Breyer asked, repeatedly.",
      "The federal government's attorney, Hamilton, said that the president is commander in chief, and he's entitled to deference in that judgment. But when asked by the judge multiple times, he acknowledged that it doesn't make it a rebellion.",
      "Breyer further questioned Mr. Trump's ability to dictate what the law allows, when Hamilton argued that there was no violation of the Posse Comitatus Act because the military was serving a protective function in Los Angeles.",
      "\"Are you saying that because the president says it, therefore it is?\" said Breyer.",
      "\"If the president says you can do X,\" he continued, \"because the president has said it, that's sufficient to take it out of the Posse Comitatus Act?\"",

    "story": [
      "If you think last week's decision by the federal government to halt $500 million in funding\u00a0for vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology will only affect COVID vaccines, think again.",
      "These types of vaccines\u00a0use\u00a0messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the body to make proteins that induce an antibody response to protect against a pathogen. The science behind it is also being studied for a wide range of other uses, from fighting cancer to treating autoimmune conditions and more.",
      "Health experts have criticized the move to defund this research, pointing to the impact it will have on America's ability to develop breakthroughs against deadly or debilitating diseases.",
      "Jeff Coller, professor of RNA biology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins University, called the cuts a \"completely reckless decision from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\" that was \"clearly being made for political motivations and not those that are rested in our science.\"",
      "Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, who served in the first Trump administration, said the technology \"helps us develop vaccines and new treatments,\" and warned that cuts could halt progress in one of the \"most promising areas of modern medicine.\"",
      "\"People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology,\" Adams said in a recent appearance on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "mRNA studied for pancreatic cancer, rare diseases and more",
      "Collier said one of the most exciting avenues for mRNA technology is in the treatment of deadly cancers, including pancreatic cancer, which is fatal for many patients within six months to a year.",
      "In recent years, researchers have been testing the effectiveness of using an mRNA vaccine to target the cancer. A small NIH-funded clinical trial by Sloan Kettering in 2023 used infusions of an mRNA vaccine to help boost T cells in the immune system of pancreatic cancer patients. The results, published in the journal\u00a0Nature, showed improvements among about 50% of participants.",
      "\"It was, in essence, the start of a cure for pancreatic cancer, where half of the patients in that study were surviving,\" Coller said.",
      "The early results encouraged scientists, but the small sample size called for further studies, which led to a\u00a0Phase 2 trial published in Nature earlier this year.",
      "Experimental mRNA-focused treatments have also showed promise in fighting lung,\u00a0colorectal and gastric cancers. For example, a study published online in the journal Gastric Cancer\u00a0found a mRNA-based vaccine led to robust gastric tumor regression in mice.",
      "And earlier this year, the world was was awed by news that an infant named KJ Muldoon became the first patient to undergo personalized gene-editing treatment using a technique known as CRISPR to fix a rare and potentially fatal genetic disorder.",
      "As Coller pointed out, the CRISPR technology had to be delivered via mRNA.",
      "\"This opens a floodgate for rare diseases,\" he said. \"We're now talking about, could we use the same technology to go after all rare diseases?\"",
      "Autoimmune diseases are another area of research, for treating things like multiple sclerosis, Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease.",
      "While all of these are still at the early research stage, Coller urged the importance of investing in this technology now for future progress.",
      "\"We need to do experiments and see where we can get with the next generation of mRNA-based drugs,\" he said.",
      "Like with COVID-19, there has also been continued research on mRNA-based vaccines for infectious diseases like the flu, RSV, Zika virus and cytomegalovirus, known as CMV, an infection that can be harmful to babies exposed during the mother's pregnancy.",
      "\"We're at a point where, if we continue to develop this technology, we'll get more personalized, bespoke medicine that we can use on patients and improve health care outcomes,\" Coller said.",
      "How is mRNA medicine so versatile?",
      "RNA stands for ribonucleic acid, an essential molecule in the body's cells. It is similar to DNA but has different functions. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, carries the information required for making proteins.",
      "As Coller put it: \"If your DNA is a cookbook, your mRNA is an individual recipe that's telling your body what to do.\"",
      "To harness that power for treating disease, \"All we're doing with this technology is giving it new recipes. We're taking advantage of this powerful natural system that exists in your body,\" he said.",
      "The versatility and potential to help such a range of illnesses is what has experts like Coller \u2014 who was not immediately impacted by the funding cuts \u2014 hoping the administration will reinstate funding for mRNA research.",
      "\"We have to keep moving forward,\" he said. \"People wanting to improve their family's lives and their children's lives is a bipartisan issue, it's truly an American issue. So we've got to keep moving.\"",

      "The investment \u2014 the second-largest in the Louisville-based company's history \u2014 is expected to add more than 1,000 jobs while ramping up domestic production and modernizing plants in the next five years.",
      "\"Our long-term strategy is about manufacturing close to our customers,\" said CEO Kevin Nolan. \"With lean manufacturing, upskilling our workforce and automation, the math works for manufacturing in the United States.\"",
      "The majority of GE's appliance production is already in the U.S. and the shift means only that the company will transfer more work to its domestic plants.",
      "GE will relocate production of gas ranges from Mexico to a plant in Georgia, while six refrigerator models now made in China will be manufactured at its Alabama plant, the company said.",
      "In June, the company said it would move production of clothes washers from China to its sprawling manufacturing complex in Louisville. The reshoring announcements come as President Trump tries to lure factories back to the United States by imposing import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on foreign goods.",
      "Lee Lagomarcino, GE Appliances' vice president of clothes care, told CBS MoneyWatch at the time that high levies on\u00a0imports from China\u00a0under Mr. Trump have compelled it to \"accelerate the decision-making.\"",
      "GE Appliances said Wednesday that the first phase of its new investment will begin at plants in five Southern states \u2014 Kentucky, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina.",
      "\"We are defining the future of manufacturing at GE Appliances by investing in our plants, people and communities,\" Nolan said. \"No other appliance company over the last decade has invested more in U.S. manufacturing than we have, and our $3 billion, five-year plan shows that our commitment to U.S. manufacturing will continue into the future.\"",
      "The multiyear plan includes ramping up production of gas ranges that have been made in Mexico but will shift to the company's plant in LaFayette, Georgia, the company said. Production of six refrigerators now made in China will move to its plant in Decatur, Alabama.",
      "GE's plant in Camden, South Carolina, will add production of electric and hybrid heat pump water heaters, doubling the factory's output and employment once the project is complete, the company said. The plant now produces gas water heaters. Production of the company's electric and hybrid water heaters \u2014 now made in China \u2014 will shift to South Carolina.",
      "In Selmer, Tennessee, its plant will produce two new models of air conditioners.",
      "The latest investment includes the June announcement that GE Appliances will pump $490 million into its Kentucky complex to produce a combo washer/dryer and a lineup of front load washers that are now made in China. In all, production of more than 15 models of front load washers will shift to the company's Louisville complex \u2014 known as Appliance Park, it said.",
      "Once its new plan is fully implemented, GE Appliances will have invested $6.5 billion across its 11 U.S. manufacturing plants and nationwide distribution network since 2016, it said.",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday that the investment shows his state's ability to support world-class companies with a skilled workforce and the resources needed to thrive.",
      "\"GE Appliances has established Kentucky as America's destination for advanced manufacturing and job creation, and today's news shows this iconic company's unwavering belief in the commonwealth and the role we play in their success,\" Beshear said.",
      "GE Appliances handles product design and engineering work at its Louisville headquarters but doesn't make all of its products in the U.S. It contracts with other manufacturers, including in China, for some of its production where it doesn't have capacity or needs access to a global supply chain. The company said its core business strategy is to base production in the United States, and investments announced in June and on Wednesday are another step toward achieving that goal.",

      "The National Guard this week was activated under Title 32, which concerns the role of the Guard when it is under the control of its state's governor, or in this case, the president. D.C. Guard members have the authority to make arrests while they're in this status, but defense officials say that for now, the mission is focused on supporting law enforcement.",
      "Hegseth said the Guard was formally mobilized Monday morning and would be \"flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.\" Asked by Fox News' Laura Ingraham later that day whether the Guard troops would be detaining American citizens on U.S. soil, Hegseth replied, \"Under Title 32, which is the authorization they'll be using, they have broad latitude.

      "The Guard troops while in Title 32 status are not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the U.S. military from carrying out domestic law enforcement actions.",
      "Members of the D.C. Guard deployed in Title 32 status in 2020, in response to protests over the killing of George Floyd, when the D.C. government requested additional manpower. They also deployed in Title 32 status in response to the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol, after some delay.",
      "There isn't an end date for how long they can stay deployed this time. According to the executive order the president signed Monday, the deployment \"shall remain in effect\" until the president determines the \"conditions of law and order have been restored in the District of Columbia.\"",

      "What is the president authorized to do with control of the D.C. police?",
      "The Home Rule Act of 1973 created D.C.'s elected government and framework for its interaction with the federal government.",
      "Section 740 of the law says \"whenever the president of the United States determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist which require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for federal purposes, he may direct the mayor to provide him, and the mayor shall provide, such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the president may deem necessary and appropriate.\"",
      "Under the president's order, Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terry Cole is in charge of the daily D.C. Police operations, under the oversight of Attorney General Pam Bondi and Mr. Trump, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Cole has also been directed to work with D.C. police chief Pamela Smith.",
      "The law gives the president 48 hours to notify congressional leaders about his action, which Mr. Trump did on Monday. The president may remain in control of the D.C. police for up to 30 days, unless the House and Senate enact a joint resolution authorizing an extension.",
      "Leavitt said the deployment would be reassessed at the end of the 30-day period.",
      "The D.C. Police Department, which includes roughly 3,100 officers, has over 800 vacancies, according to the D.C. Police Union. The union, which is highly critical of D.C.'s mayor and city council, supports the federal takeover of the force.",
      "Who are the other federal law enforcement officials deployed to the streets of D.C.?",
      "Overnight Monday, about 850 officers and federal agents sent across the city made 23 arrests and seized six illegal handguns off the streets, Leavitt said Tuesday. The suspected offenses included homicide, firearms offenses, reckless driving, and driving under the influence, she said.",
      "\"This is only the beginning,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Participating members of what the White House is calling the Task Force's Law Enforcement Working Group throughout the operation include the U.S. Capitol Police, Homeland Security Investigations, the Federal Protective Service, the DEA, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Department of the Interior, the U.S. Secret Service, and the U.S. Marshals Service. The White House generally isn't specifying which law enforcement entities are performing what responsibilities.",
      "Homeless people being relocated",
      "Leavitt said that the U.S. Park Police would continue to move homeless people off D.C. streets and suggested homeless shelters and mental health and addiction treatment centers are places they can go \u2014 or jail if they refuse.",

      "How D.C. officials are responding to the federal takeover",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi met Tuesday with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, along with the FBI director, head of the U.S. Marshals Service, the DEA's Cole and D.C. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro. The attorney general characterized the meeting as \"productive.\"",
      "But Bowser has called the president's takeover of the D.C. police \"unsettling and unprecedented,\" although her criticism of the Trump administration's move has been largely muted.",
      "The White House and Bowser appear to have conflicting ideas about the chain of command for the D.C. police. Bowser on Tuesday said the president has the authority to request services of the police, but \"our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, how we make changes, none of that has changed.\" That view conflicts with Leavitt's statement that\u00a0 Cole would be in charge of the police force, and would be overseen by the president and attorney general.",
      "D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith said the D.C. Police already work daily with federal law enforcement, and said she thinks an enhanced presence from the federal government may help.",
      "\"We know that we have to get illegal guns off of our street. And if we have this influx or enhanced presence, it's going to make our city even better,\" Smith said.",
      "\"I won't go into the details of our operational plan at this point, but you will see the Metropolitan Police Department working side by side with our federal partners in order to enforce the efforts that we need around the city,\" Smith said.",

      "The meeting will take place at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, on the northern edge of Anchorage, a senior White House official told CBS News on Tuesday.

    "summary": "Federal funding cuts to mRNA technology research doesn't just impact COVID vaccines \u2014 experts say it could stall progress in treatment for cancers, rare disease and more.",
    "story": [
      "If you think last week's decision by the federal government to halt $500 million in funding\u00a0for vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology will only affect COVID vaccines, think again.",
      "These types of vaccines\u00a0use\u00a0messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the body to make proteins that induce an antibody response to protect against a pathogen. The science behind it is also being studied for a wide range of other uses, from fighting cancer to treating autoimmune conditions and more.",
      "Health experts have criticized the move to defund this research, pointing to the impact it will have on America's ability to develop breakthroughs against deadly or debilitating diseases.",
      "Jeff Coller, professor of RNA biology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins University, called the cuts a \"completely reckless decision from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\" that was \"clearly being made for political motivations and not those that are rested in our science.\"",
      "Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, who served in the first Trump administration, said the technology \"helps us develop vaccines and new treatments,\" and warned that cuts could halt progress in one of the \"most promising areas of modern medicine.\"",
      "\"People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology,\" Adams said in a recent appearance on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "mRNA studied for pancreatic cancer, rare diseases and more",
      "Collier said one of the most exciting avenues for mRNA technology is in the treatment of deadly cancers, including pancreatic cancer, which is fatal for many patients within six months to a year.",
      "In recent years, researchers have been testing the effectiveness of using an mRNA vaccine to target the cancer. A small NIH-funded clinical trial by Sloan Kettering in 2023 used infusions of an mRNA vaccine to help boost T cells in the immune system of pancreatic cancer patients. The results, published in the journal\u00a0Nature, showed improvements among about 50% of participants.",
      "\"It was, in essence, the start of a cure for pancreatic cancer, where half of the patients in that study were surviving,\" Coller said.",
      "The early results encouraged scientists, but the small sample size called for further studies, which led to a\u00a0Phase 2 trial published in Nature earlier this year.",
      "Experimental mRNA-focused treatments have also showed promise in fighting lung,\u00a0colorectal and gastric cancers. For example, a study published online in the journal Gastric Cancer\u00a0found a mRNA-based vaccine led to robust gastric tumor regression in mice.",
      "And earlier this year, the world was was awed by news that an infant named KJ Muldoon became the first patient to undergo personalized gene-editing treatment using a technique known as CRISPR to fix a rare and potentially fatal genetic disorder.",
      "As Coller pointed out, the CRISPR technology had to be delivered via mRNA.",
      "\"This opens a floodgate for rare diseases,\" he said. \"We're now talking about, could we use the same technology to go after all rare diseases?\"",
      "Autoimmune diseases are another area of research, for treating things like multiple sclerosis, Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease.",
      "While all of these are still at the early research stage, Coller urged the importance of investing in this technology now for future progress.",
      "\"We need to do experiments and see where we can get with the next generation of mRNA-based drugs,\" he said.",
      "Like with COVID-19, there has also been continued research on mRNA-based vaccines for infectious diseases like the flu, RSV, Zika virus and cytomegalovirus, known as CMV, an infection that can be harmful to babies exposed during the mother's pregnancy.",
      "\"We're at a point where, if we continue to develop this technology, we'll get more personalized, bespoke medicine that we can use on patients and improve health care outcomes,\" Coller said.",
      "How is mRNA medicine so versatile?",
      "RNA stands for ribonucleic acid, an essential molecule in the body's cells. It is similar to DNA but has different functions. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, carries the information required for making proteins.",
      "As Coller put it: \"If your DNA is a cookbook, your mRNA is an individual recipe that's telling your body what to do.\"",
      "To harness that power for treating disease, \"All we're doing with this technology is giving it new recipes. We're taking advantage of this powerful natural system that exists in your body,\" he said.",
      "The versatility and potential to help such a range of illnesses is what has experts like Coller \u2014 who was not immediately impacted by the funding cuts \u2014 hoping the administration will reinstate funding for mRNA research.",
      "\"We have to keep moving forward,\" he said. \"People wanting to improve their family's lives and their children's lives is a bipartisan issue, it's truly an American issue. So we've got to keep moving.\"",

      "The Vulcan is replacing ULA's already-retired Delta family of rockets and the venerable Atlas 5, which is powered by a Russian-built RD-180 first stage engine. Criticism of ULA's use of Russian engines for launches of American military satellites and NASA spacecraft helped fuel congressional pressure for a new all-American launcher.",
      "Thirteen Atlas 5's are left in ULA's inventory, all of them slated for civilian launches as ULA, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, transitions to an all-Vulcan fleet.",
      "In the meantime, SpaceX dominates the world launch market with its partially reusable and highly successful kerosene-fueled Falcon 9 and triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets. So far this year, SpaceX has launched 97 Falcon 9s.",
      "But ULA President and CEO Tory Bruno said the Vulcan's first stage, using high-performance BE-4 engines provided by Blue Origin \u2014 owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 and its high-power Centaur upper stage make the rocket particularly well suited for launching heavy military payloads into hard-to-reach orbits.",
      "\"It is specifically designed for these exotic orbits that are primarily for the government,\" he said. \"And this particular mission is the quintessential example. It is a direct injection to geosynchronous orbit. That means that it is a very, very long-duration mission.\"",
      "He said the first stage is, in effect, delivering the Centaur to space with a full load of propellant \"to go from LEO (low-Earth orbit) to somewhere else, like all the way to the geo belt, which is 20 times higher up. And what that translates to in capability (is) certainly more mass and more accuracy than is easily done by others.\"",
      "While he didn't mention SpaceX or its Falcon Heavy by name, or ULA's retired Delta 4 Heavy, Bruno said \"if you're a typical three-core heavy launch vehicle and ... really derived from a vehicle optimized for that LEO mission, you're going to have to have three cores to get out there, and you're going to have to expend all of them.",
      "\"And here's the really complicated rocket science. You know, one core is cheaper and more efficient than three expendable cores. It's literally that simple.\"",
      "That, coupled with the high-energy Centaur upper stage, gives ULA the capability to launch heavy payloads directly to high orbits without requiring satellites to use their own thrusters \u2014 and limited propellant \u2014 in transit.",
      "ULA is expanding its ground infrastructure and expects to launch nine flights in 2025, reaching a cadence of two per month by the end of the year. The company expects to launch between 20 and 25 flights in 2026.",

A so-called going concern warning is an accounting term that signals a risk that a business might cease operations.",
      "Shares of Kodak plunged $1.73, or 26%, to $5.05 in Tuesday morning trading. Reached for comment, a Kodak spokesperson pointed to the statement in its regulatory filing.",
      "The warning is the latest development in the photography company's storied history, which includes introducing one of the first consumer cameras in the 1880s and mass manufacturing film rolls for hobbyists and professionals alike. But Kodak struggled to adapt when digital cameras overtook film starting in the 1990s, leading to a bankruptcy filing in 2012.",
      "Its current financial crunch is tied to almost $500 million in short-term debt obligations, as well as more than $200 million in pension liabilities. Last year, Kodak had said it would end its pension plan in order to reduce debt, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Kodak should have \"a clear understanding by Aug.15 of how we will satisfy our obligations to all plan participants,\" Chief Financial Officer David Bullwinkle said in a statement, referring to the pension plan.",
      "A Kodak moment",
      "Rochester, New York-based Eastman Kodak, founded by inventor George Eastman in 1892, mass produced the famed Brownie and Instamatic cameras, popularizing photography as a pastime for generations of Americans. Its yellow-and-red film boxes were ubiquitous in photo shops and other retailers.",
      "Eastman said his goal was \"to make the camera as convenient as the pencil,\" according to the Kodak website.",
      "But Kodak faced competition from Japanese companies, including Fujifilm in the 1990s, as well as the shift to digital technology, leading to its filing for\u00a0bankruptcy protection in 2012.",
      "The company wound up selling off many of its businesses and patents, while shutting down the camera manufacturing unit that first made it famous. It received approval for its plan to emerge from court oversight a year later.",
      "At the time, Kodak was looking to recreate itself as a new, much smaller company focused on commercial and packaging printing.",
      "Kodak is now nearing completion on a manufacturing plant to create regulated pharmaceutical products. The company already makes unregulated key starting materials for pharmaceuticals. Production at the retrofitted facility is expected to start later this year.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government 15% of revenue generated by sales of their AI chips in China, a White House official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The Financial Times on Sunday\u00a0reported that the agreement between the tech giants and the U.S. government was reached as a condition for granting export licenses for China, which were provided last week. A U.S. official confirmed the \"broad strokes\" of the report to CBS News.",
      "The arrangement, with companies providing a stream of revenue in exchange for export licenses, is highly unusual as corporations typically do not pay the federal government a share of revenue from their export sales. Export licenses also do not carry any fees,\u00a0according to shipping giant Maersk.",
      "In a Monday press conference, President Trump described the agreement with Nvidia as a deal that would benefit the nation. He described meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to discuss the terms of agreeing to the export license; Mr. Trump didn't mention AMD in his comments.",
      "\"So I said, 'I want 20% if I'm going to approve it for you,'\" Mr. Trump said of his meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to discuss the terms of the export license. \"I don't want it myself, so when I say I want 20%, it's for the country.\"",
      "\"[Huang] said, 'Will you make it 15%?' so we negotiated a little deal,\" the president added.",
      "The revenue-sharing plan comes after the White House\u00a0announced\u00a0in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia's H20 chips and MI308 chips from rival chipmaker AMD to China. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last month said it had won approval from the Trump administration to sell its H20 chips to China.",
      "The H20 chip, which is specialized for artificial intelligence applications, was developed by Nvidia for the Chinese market, while AMD's MI308 chips are also geared for AI.",
      "It is unclear how the Trump administration would use the money generated from the chip sales agreement.",
      "Nvidia declined to comment on the specifics of the deal. In a statement, a spokesperson said, \"We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets. While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.\"",
      "AMD did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Stocks for both companies rose slightly on Monday.",
      "Proponents of restrictions on sales of advanced chips to China say they are necessary to ensure the U.S. maintains a competitive edge as the two countries battle for AI dominance.

      "The company unveiled its new \"universal EV platform\" at a Monday event, with Ford CEO Jim Farley calling it \"the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T,\" which Ford introduced in 1908.",
      "According to Ford, the new assembly line will be structured more like an \"assembly tree,\" with three different lines that converge into one, rather than a single assembly belt.",
      "\"This way of building a vehicle, we're confident, is the first time anyone's done this anywhere in the world,\" said Doug Field, Ford's EV chief of digital and design, at Monday's event.",
      "The company said the design will lead to a quicker, smoother assembly process and improve ergonomics for employees through a less obstructive layout.",
      "\"Ford's announcement is very ambitious, because it includes both a new production process and a new vehicle,\" said Patrick Anderson, founder of Michigan-based consulting firm Anderson Economic Group, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"If they can actually pull off a production line that has 40% fewer workstations and 20% fewer parts, it will be worthy of the 'Model T moment' claim.",
      "Ford's first EV from the new system",
      "The first product of this new production system will be a four-door midsize truck, which will debut in 2027. Farley said on Monday that the new vehicle will accommodate five people and feature a \"frunk\" \u2014 a front storage compartment \u2014 as well as a pickup truck bed.",
      "The vehicle will start at $30,000. By comparison, the average price for a new electric vehicle in July was about $56,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Field touted the new vehicle's charging capabilities, referring to the truck as a \"mobile power plant.\"",
      "\"Outlets in the back can give you high power and let you plug in anything from tools to a refrigerator, and it can provide backup power for your home,\" he said.",
      "The midsize electric truck could be produced up to 40% faster than other vehicles at the Louisville Assembly Plant due to the new process, Ford said.",
      "In another effort to lower costs, the auto company is also reducing the number of components that go into each car. Vehicles produced on the \"universal EV platform\" will have 20% fewer parts than a traditional vehicle, Ford said.",
      "The company will also use smaller cobalt and nickel-free batteries that will allow it to make \"cost gains,\" according to a video shared by Ford.",
      "Anderson said that Ford has its work cut out for them given that the new truck will need to be competitively priced and economical. According to the auto industry expert, the cost of charging EV trucks currently on the market is often much higher than the price at the pump for gas-powered versions. A report from the Anderson Economic Group shows pickup trucks drivers in New York, California and Michigan face \"significantly higher costs\" if they rely on an EV.",
      "A successfully lower-cost truck model, however, could spur a new chapter for the company in its manufacturing of EVs.",
      "\"If Ford shows the industry it can build and sell a reliable compact EV truck for $30,000, it will sell a lot of them, and open the door to making sedans using the new production process,\" Anderson said.",

      "Los Angeles \u2014 With big smiles and colorful backpacks, tens of thousands of students in the Los Angeles Unified School District walked into their first day of class Thursday. But heading into this new academic year, some families say they are living in fear.",
      "Melissa, an undocumented mother of three U.S. citizen children, said her 8-year-old is afraid.",
      "\"When we hear that agents are nearby, we run or hide, and he's scared,\" Melissa told CBS News.",
      "She says she has been forced to make a plan in case she is detained and deported.",
      "\"We've spoken to our eldest,\" Melissa said. \"He'd be in charge of his siblings. It's sad to talk about these plans.\"",
      "Immigration enforcement activity has picked up across the L.A. area over the past four months. In July, federal agents on horseback swarmed MacArthur Park \u2014 which is located near multiple schools in L.A.'s Westlake neighborhood \u2014 flanked by armored vehicles and National Guard troops. Officials did not say if there were any arrests during the operation, but L.A. Mayor Karen Bass blasted the move at the time, calling it part of \"a political agenda of provoking fear and terror.\"",
      "Some undocumented mothers tell CBS News they are unwilling to risk sending their children to school at all.",
      "\"I'm scared because I wouldn't be able to handle getting separated from them,\" said Andrea, an undocumented mother. \"Either if they take me and they stay here, or if they're taken and I stay here.\"",
      "One particular sidewalk near downtown L.A. that children use to walk to school is right outside a Home Depot that has been frequently raided this summer. Federal agents continue to patrol this Latino-majority area surrounding MacArthur Park.",
      "If they do not possess a signed judicial warrant, they do not have access to have a conversation with anyone, staff member or student or parent,\" LAUSD Superintendent Alberto Carvalho told CBS News.",
      "Carvalho says the district has taken measures to protect families, implementing safe zones outside 100 schools in Latino-majority areas where volunteers and officers will watch for federal immigration activity.",
      "On Monday, Nathan Mejia, a 15-year-old student with disabilities, was detained by federal agents outside Arleta High School in the San Fernando Valley.",
      "\"They started pointing guns at us, then at the moment when they opened the door, my mom just told me to not move or anything,\" Mejia told CBS News. \"I stepped out, they put me in handcuffs.\"",
      "His mother told CBS Los Angeles that agents showed her a photo of a person who resembled her son, but that was not him. Mejia was quickly released.",
      "In a social media post Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security denied that it was targeting the high school and said that \"agents were conducting a targeted operation\" on a \"suspected MS-13 pledge with prior criminal convictions in the broader vicinity of Arleta.\"",
      "The Trump administration has stressed schools will not be targeted as part of its ongoing immigration crackdown.",
      "\"This administration wants to ensure that all school children across the country, in every city from Los Angeles to D.C., can go to school safely,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a press briefing Tuesday.",
      "According to Carvalho, in LAUSD \u2014 the second-largest school district in the nation, with more than half a million students \u2014 an estimated one in five students are part of an immigrant family, in which at least one parent is undocumented. He hopes his district's new safe zone measures are enough.",
      "\"Why have immigration enforcement actions so close to schools, where a 16-year-old, a 15-year-old, may actually be misidentified as an adult?\" Carvalho asked. \"Should we not have enough empathy and compassion in our hearts to spare children that type of trauma?\"",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 20:27:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As Texas hurtles toward a flashpoint on a GOP effort to redraw congressional districts, California Democrats are answering with a plan of their own.",
    "story": [
      "California Democrats are preparing to counter Republicans' attempt to reshape a series of Texas congressional districts for political advantage in a back and forth that could define next year's midterm elections and with it, the final two years of President Trump's second term.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he is moving forward with a redistricting plan Thursday as national tensions rage over changing congressional lines mid-decade. Districts are usually redrawn after the decennial census, and under California law, the changes would require a special election.",
      "Newsom has vowed his state would respond after Texas Republicans released plans earlier this summer to redraw five seats held by Democrats and make them more favorable to the GOP.",
      "\"California won't stand by and watch Trump burn it all down \u2014 we are calling a special election to redraw our Congressional maps and defend fair representation,\" Newsom said Thursday in a post on X ahead of his remarks.",
      "Newsom, speaking alongside a number of California officials in Los Angeles, said Mr. Trump is \"trying to rig the system,\" adding that \"as a consequence, we need to disabuse ourselves of the way things have been done.\"",
      "\"We have got to recognize the cards that have been dealt,\" Newsom said. \"And we have got to meet fire with fire.\"",
      "The California governor said the effort is happening \"in reaction to a president of the United States that called a sitting governor of the state of Texas and said 'find me five seats.'\"",
      "\"I know they say don't mess with Texas,\" Newsom said. \"Well, don't mess with the great Golden State.\"",
      "Newsom's team participated in a series of conversations with the state's Democratic congressional delegation and the California Legislature as drafts of possible maps were discussed. According to U.S. Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, the conversations were initially centered on the question, \"Is this even conceptually possible?\"",
      "California Democrats concluded that it was possible to gain five Democratic seats to counter Texas' gains, according to Lofgren. \"I'm confident that if we need to move forward, we will do that successfully. There's tremendous unity on the Democratic side.\"",
      "Republicans currently control both chambers of Congress and hold the White House. At the moment, if Democrats were to win back as few as three seats in next year's midterms, they could flip control of the House. That path would be threatened however if Republicans and Mr. Trump succeed in convincing GOP-led states like Texas, Indiana and Missouri to take some of their Democratic-held districts and alter them to favor Republicans instead.",
      "The developments in California Thursday come as Texas Republicans struggle to pass the maps that have become a national issue. Breakaway state House Democrats fled Texas earlier this month, denying the chamber the quorum it needed to take action on the new maps during a special legislative session.",
      "Since then, national Democrats have sought to call attention to what Republicans are trying to do in Texas, even as it's opened the left up to accusations of hypocrisy. During the standoff, some Texas Democrats have spoken out from Illinois, a blue state that was criticized for drawing its congressional maps after the 2020 Census to give Democrats the advantage.",
      "For both sides, the issue of congressional districts has become even more starkly partisan this summer. Various attempts have also been made in court to bring state House Democrats back to Texas, or to create a path that will help Republicans get their way.",
      "During a floor speech \u2014 before the maps passed the Texas Senate earlier this week in what amounted to a moot effort, given the House's obstacles \u2014 Republican Phil King bluntly said an objective of his \"was to support a plan that, simply put, elects more Republicans to the U.S. Congress.\"",
      "With the special session in Texas set to end in just a few days, Republicans have been adamant about eventually passing the maps, even if it takes more time and special sessions. With Democratic power limited in the state, there is a sense that Republicans will eventually be able to get their way.",
      "But the situation has left an opening for Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, to create a new front in the political fight, given that Democrats may have a path to redrawing Republican-held congressional districts in the blue state of California.",
      "A challenging process in California",
      "But California's effort will likely prove to be far more difficult and time intensive than the Republican-led push in Texas.",
      "In California, only nine of the state's 52 U.S. House districts are held by Republicans. Earlier this century, voters in the state signed off on putting in the state's constitution an independent citizens redistricting commission to decide new boundaries following the once a decade census process.",
      "The state-level differences between Democrat-led California and Republican-led Texas essentially make it harder for California Democrats to redraw districts in their state than it currently is for Texas Republicans. In Texas, GOP leaders and Mr. Trump allies just need to go through the normal legislative process to change districts.",
      "Because of California's constitution, changing the redistricting process in the state ahead of the 2026 midterms would likely require a new amendment. To take effect, it would need to be passed by a two-thirds vote in both the Assembly and Senate, and then be approved by California voters in an election. That election could prove costly, with major implications for the country on the line.",
      "Newsom said the difference between what's happening in California and Texas is \"we're working through a very transparent, temporary and public process.\"",
      "\"We're putting the maps on the ballot, and we're giving the power to the people,\" he said, adding that California would affirm its commitment to the state independent redistricting after the 2030 census.",
      "California lawmakers are scheduled to return to Sacramento on Aug. 18 amid the redistricting talk. The Legislature will have five days to conduct public hearings and formalize the process.",

      "A federal judge on Thursday struck down two Trump administration actions aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the nation's schools and universities.",
      "In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland found that the Education Department violated the law when it threatened to cut federal funding from educational institutions that continued with DEI initiatives.",
      "The guidance has been on hold since April when three federal judges blocked various portions of the Education Department's anti-DEI measures.",
      "The ruling Thursday followed a motion for summary judgment from the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association, which challenged the government's actions in a February lawsuit.",
      "The case centers on two Education Department memos ordering schools and universities to end all \"race-based decision-making\" or face penalties up to a total loss of federal funding. It's part of a campaign to end practices the Trump administration frames as discrimination against white and Asian American students.",
      "The new ruling orders the department to scrap the guidance because it runs afoul of procedural requirements, though Gallagher wrote that she took no view on whether the policies were \"good or bad, prudent or foolish, fair or unfair.\"",
      "Gallagher, who was appointed by President Trump, rejected the government's argument that the memos simply served to remind schools that discrimination is illegal.",
      "\"It initiated a sea change in how the Department of Education regulates educational practices and classroom conduct, causing millions of educators to reasonably fear that their lawful, and even beneficial, speech might cause them or their schools to be punished,\" Gallagher wrote.",
      "Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy firm representing the plaintiffs, called it an important victory over the administration's attack on DEI.",
      "\"Threatening teachers and sowing chaos in schools throughout America is part of the administration's war on education, and today the people won,\" said Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO.",
      "The Education Department did not immediately comment on Thursday.",
      "The conflict started with a Feb. 14 memo declaring that any consideration of race in admissions, financial aid, hiring or other aspects of academic and student life would be considered a violation of federal civil rights law.",
      "The memo dramatically expanded the government's interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring colleges from considering race in admissions decisions. The government argued the ruling applied not only to admissions but across all of education, forbidding \"race-based preferences\" of any kind.",
      "\"Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon 'systemic and structural racism' and advanced discriminatory policies and practices,\" wrote Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary of the department's Office for Civil Rights.",
      "A further memo in April asked state education agencies to certify they were not using \"illegal DEI practices.\" Violators risked losing federal money and being prosecuted under the False Claims Act, it said.",
      "In total, the guidance amounted to a full-scale reframing of the government's approach to civil rights in education. It took aim at policies that were created to address longstanding racial disparities, saying those practices were their own form of discrimination.",
      "The memos drew a wave of backlash from states and education groups that called it illegal government censorship.",
      "In its lawsuit, the American Federation of Teachers said the government was imposing \"unclear and highly subjective\" limits on schools across the country. It said teachers and professors had to \"choose between chilling their constitutionally protected speech and association or risk losing federal funds and being subject to prosecution.\"",

    "summary": "As Social Security celebrates its 90th anniversary today, concerns are growing over its funding and recent staffing cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security celebrates its 90th anniversary today, marking a major milestone for the program that supplies monthly benefit checks to almost 70 million senior citizens, disabled people and surviving family members of deceased workers.",
      "When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law on Aug. 14, 1935, he guaranteed for the first time that workers could rely on continuing income in retirement after they turned 65. As it enters its 10th decade, the program is only growing in importance amid an aging population, with a record number of Americans now collecting benefits.",
      "In the next 10 years, Social Security is expected to swell by an additional 12 million recipients, according to the AARP. But even as it grows in importance, the program is also facing mounting problems and growing questions over its long term viability.",
      "While many policy experts believe the program should be expanded, its outgoings now far outpace its income. Some Democratic lawmakers are also questioning the agency's ability to serve retirees after the Trump administration earlier this year made cuts to its workforce in what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities referred to\u00a0as the \"largest staffing cut in SSA's history.\"",
      "As these challenges have mounted, faith in the program has deteriorated, even as three-quarters of Americans say they believe Social Security is \"one of the most important programs\" the government offers, according to a recent AARP survey. Confidence in the future of Social Security has declined by 7% in the last five years, from 43% in 2020 to 36% in 2025, it found.",
      "Asked about these concerns, the Social Security Administration pointed to a Fox News interview Thursday with its commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said he's optimistic about the program's future and that the agency is working on improving its operations.",
      "The White House also took issue with the criticisms, with spokeswoman Liz Huston telling CBS News that the administration is improving customer service and \"preventing illegal aliens from accessing benefits. \"President Trump has made Social Security great again,\" she said.",
      "Funding woes",
      "A major headwind facing Social Security may not be new, but it is fast approaching: The possible insolvency of its trust funds as the gap between its revenue and expenditure grows.",
      "For instance, in 2024, the program cost $1.49 billion, but total income was $1.42 billion, according to the 2025 Social Security Board of Trustees' report.",
      "Because of that trend \u2014 which is expected to continue given the aging population \u2014 the Social Security trust funds are forecast to be\u00a0depleted by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast, according to the most recent trustees' report. This so-called \"go-broke\" date has been a major source of stress for Americans who worry that there won't be enough money left by the time they reach retirement age.",
      "While some workers believe that the trust funds' insolvency means Social Security will cease making payments after that date, that is incorrect. Because the program is funded through payroll taxes, Social Security has a constant stream of income \u2014 although without the trust funds' financial cushion, the program will face a shortfall, leading to a cut in benefits.",
      "Without a fix, monthly benefits could be cut by as much as 23%, the Social Security Board of Trustees warned in its 2025\u00a0annual report.",
      "But there are options for shoring up the trust funds. For one, there's a current cap on the amount of income subject to Social Security taxes, which stands at $176,100 in 2025, meaning any earnings above that amount are exempt from the payroll tax.",
      "One remedy would be to lift the cap on payroll taxes, an option that some Democratic lawmakers prefer. Another idea, floated by some Republican lawmakers, is to raise the retirement age, which currently stands at 67 for people born after 1960.",
      "Changes under President Trump",
      "President Trump has vowed not to cut Social Security, noting in a \"Meet the Press\" interview in December that \"we're not touching Social Security, other than we might make it more efficient.\" Nonetheless, concerns have mounted over the Trump administration's changes to the program, including cuts to its staff and the closure of some field offices.",
      "During a press call Wednesday organized by advocacy groups, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, claimed Mr. Trump and others in his administration are \"working overtime to try to dismantle Social Security.\"",
      "Many Americans also say they're worried about what sort of changes the new administration could make. According to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0from NerdWallet, 61% of Americans believe Social Security benefits will be cut under the current administration.",
      "The White House, however, contends that Social Security has become more efficient under Mr. Trump's leadership. In a statement released Thursday, the White House claimed that the agency is handling 70% more calls than last year and that it has cut down on wait times with the help of technology. It also said the average wait times for customers at field offices have declined by 23%.",
      "\"We have taken steps to reduce wait times, enhance security, and make it easier to navigate our programs,\" SSA commissioner Frank Bisignano wrote in an opinion piece for Fox News on Thursday. \"All the while ensuring we pay benefits accurately to those who are eligible to receive them.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday repeated his\u00a0promises to protect the program.",

      "\"I like to think about AI and robots as giving people superpowers,\" said Rus, who leads MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab. \"With AI, we get cognitive superpowers.\"",
      "\"So think about getting speed, knowledge, insight, creativity, foresight,\" she said. \"On the physical side, we can use machines to extend our reach, to refine our precision, to amplify our strengths.\"",
      "Sci-fi stories make robots seem capable of anything. But researchers are actually still figuring out the artificial brains that machines need to navigate the physical world.",
      "\"It's not so hard to get the robot to do a task once,\" Rus said. \"But to get that robot to do the task repeatedly in human-centered environments, where things change around the robot all the time, that is very hard.\"",
      "Rus and her students have trained Ruby, a humanoid robot, to do basic tasks like prepare a drink in the kitchen.",
      "\"We collect data from how humans do the tasks,\" Rus said. \"We are then able to teach machines how to do those tasks in a human-like fashion.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Just before the class of 2025 graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and accepted their commissions as officers in the U.S. Army, a group of cadets this past May decided to honor one of their own \u2014 a boy who dreamed of attending West Point but before he could, laid down his life as a hero.",
      "Peter Wang, an Army Junior ROTC cadet, was just 15 years old and among the 17 killed during the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. During the shooting, he held a door open to allow students to escape the merciless gunfire on that day.",
      "In a follow-up story published seven years after the shooting, CBS News reported in May that Wang was posthumously accepted to the West Point class of 2025.",
      "When CBS News reached out to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in the days before graduation this year to ask whether Wang \u2014 who was symbolically accepted into the class \u2014 would be awarded his diploma posthumously, the inquiry appeared to catch both the academy's media relations staff and leadership off guard. Yet among some class members, Wang's story of sacrifice remained vivid, and their determination to see him honored had not faded.",
      "\"When we put out a form asking for classmates to nominate honorary members of our class, I was not expecting Peter Wang's name to be on the list of nominees,\" newly minted Army 2nd Lt. Katherine Metz, the president of the class of 2025 at West Point, told CBS News. \"Most cadets nominated former classmates who were separated from West Point for reasons outside of their control \u2014 mostly medical \u2014 or foreign exchange cadets who made a significant impact on our class or their countries. However, Peter's name appeared countless times within our class's responses.\"",
      "Metz had read the article by CBS News and other news stories from the time of the shooting. She said a number of cadets from the class nominated Wang for the Honorary Graduate Award and would soon be mailing his certificate to his parents.",
      "The award is an honor conferred on those who did not physically graduate with the class but who embody West Point's core values of duty, honor and country.",
      "When the sounds of gunfire reverberated through the hallways of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Wang was in study hall. As panic spread, he moved toward the exit \u2014 not to flee, but to hold the door open, easing the way for his classmates to escape.",
      "He was shot 13 times. Wang was found dead in a third-floor hallway, wearing his Army JROTC uniform.",
      "The Florida National Guard honored Wang with a military funeral, and hundreds assembled to pay their respects.",
      "Metz said one of her classmates wrote about how Wang \"valiantly sacrificed himself to hold the door for his fellow classmates to escape,\" and said it was only fitting \"that we recognize him as an honorary graduate, as he would have been with us.\"",
      "Some members of the class of 2025 were already familiar with Wang's story and the tragic path that led to his posthumous admission. But for many, the details emerged only when his name was announced as an honorary member of the graduating class. From that moment, classmates say, his story became part of the class's shared identity \u2014 an enduring example of selflessness and sacrifice.",
      "\"Now, our whole class knows his story and will take his selfless example of sacrifice with us into our service as commissioned officers in the United States Army,\" said Metz.",
      "For his actions in 2018, Wang was posthumously awarded the Medal of Heroism by the U.S. Army, the highest award given to Army JROTC and ROTC cadets whose performance \"involved the acceptance of danger and extraordinary responsibilities.\" Junior ROTC cadets Alaina Petty and Martin Duque, who were also killed during the shooting, also received the medal.",
      "\"Peter demonstrated the characteristics and attributes we seek out of graduates of the Naval Academy or West Point,\" retired Lt. Gen. Robert Caslen told CBS News in May. Caslen, who was the superintendent of West Point in 2018, authorized Wang's entry into the class of 2025.",
      "He added, \"Individuals like Peter are exactly the men and women you want leading America's youth in combat situations, the fact that he demonstrated that at his age says a lot about him which is why we made him an honorary member of the class.\"",

    "summary": "Here's what new data from the producer price index says about where inflation is headed, according to economists.",
    "story": [
      "The producer price index, or PPI, surged last month, far outpacing economists' forecasts and suggesting that President Trump's tariffs are starting to significantly drive up the cost of imported goods.",
      "Wholesale inflation rose 0.9% in July from the prior month, the Labor Department said Thursday, outstripping economists' expectations for a 0.2% increase. The jump marks the largest in more than three years, since June 2022.",
      "The PPI, which measures price changes before they reach consumers, suggests cost hikes are on the way for shoppers, economists said.",
      "So far in 2025, consumer prices\u00a0have been slow to rise despite economists' warnings that Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariff agenda would hike costs for both U.S. businesses and consumers. That's partly because some importers took steps to offset the impact by preordering inventory and absorbing some tariffs to shield consumers in the short term.",
      "But because those were stop-gap measures, economists have warned consumers are unlikely to be insulated from tariff-driven inflation indefinitely. The latest PPI data underscores that higher prices are rippling through the economy, experts say.",
      "\"Tariff-exposed goods are rising at a rapid clip, indicating that the willingness and ability of businesses to absorb tariff costs may be waning,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note Thursday, noting that the wholesale price increases were broad-based.",
      "\"We anticipate broader signs of tariff-driven inflation in the data over time as inventories roll over and firms adjust pricing under margin pressure,\" they said.",
      "The PPI report comes two days after July's Consumer Price Index was slightly cooler than economists had expected, rising 2.7% on an annual basis. The CPI measures changes in prices for goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "The PPI report \"indicates that the new tariffs are continuing to generate cost pressures in the supply chain, which consumers will shoulder soon,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs said in a research note Thursday.",
      "What does the PPI mean for the Fed?",
      "The data complicates the decision the Federal Reserve faces at its Sept. 17 meeting about whether to hold or cut its benchmark interest rate, according to economists.",
      "The central bank has held the rate steady since December 2024, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noting that the economy remains relatively solid and that it wants to take a \"wait and see\" approach to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "The Fed is tasked with keeping inflation low while also promoting full employment \u2014 a two-pronged goal known as its dual mandate.",
      "Because the CPI report came in cooler than expected, the Fed had been seen as more likely to cut rates next month. But the latest PPI data may put that in doubt, given a rate cut would make it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow, thereby potentially further stoking inflation.",
      "\"After a string of data pointing to greater odds of a September rate cut, the large upside surprise in producer prices highlights the dilemma the Federal Reserve faces in judging the risks to its dual mandate,\" Matthew Martin, of Oxford Economics wrote. The group expects the Fed to hold off on rate cuts until December.",
      "The PPI data \"suggests inflation isn't the non-story some people thought it was after Tuesday's CPI print,\" Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at Morgan Stanley's E*TRADE, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "As far as the likelihood of a rate cut goes, the data \"doesn't slam the door on a September rate cut, but based on the market's initial reaction, the opening may be a little smaller than it was a couple of days ago,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Federal authorities say they've returned a lost page from a 500-year-old manuscript to Mexico, decades after portions of it went missing. Dating back to the 16th century, the document describes an early payment structure established by the Spanish military commander who conquered parts of modern-day Latin America, according to the FBI.",
      "\"This is an original manuscript page that was actually signed by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s on February 20, 1527,\" said FBI special agent Jessica Dittmer, a member of the bureau's art crime team, in a statement. The page \"outlines the payment of pesos of common gold for expenses in preparation for discovery of the spice lands, so it really gives a lot of flavor as to the planning and preparation for unchartered territory back then,\" Dittmer said.",
      "Cort\u00e9s was a conquistador known for his takeover of the Aztec empire, which ruled over what is now Mexico, during the early 1500s. He claimed the region for his native Spain, in a conquest that historians say laid the foundation for an ensuing colonial territory called \"New Spain,\" encompassing vast sections of contemporary Mexico, Central America and the United States, in addition to places in the Caribbean and the Pacific.",
      "According to Dittmer, the manuscript that Cort\u00e9s signed holds historical significance because it includes a detailed account of the conqueror's journey from Europe to the Americas.",
      "\"Pieces like this are considered protected cultural property and represent valuable moments in Mexico's history, so this is something that the Mexicans have in their archives for the purpose of understanding history better,\" the agent said.",
      "The manuscript was initially repatriated to Mexico and held at the country's national archives, where archivists in 1993 discovered that 15 pages of it had disappeared, the FBI said. Decades later, in 2024, the Mexican government requested assistance from the bureau's art crime team in recovering one specific page from the lost group.",
      "Working with authorities in Atlanta and New York, federal investigators eventually found and seized the missing page, from a location within the U.S. that they haven't disclosed. The FBI said that the page was likely stolen from Mexico's national archives at some point between 1985 and 1993, based on the filing system that archivists used in that time frame. Federal officials returned the document to Mexico on Wednesday.",
      "Authorities will not prosecute anyone in connection with the theft because investigators determined that the documents \"changed hands several times over\" since it went missing, the FBI said.",
      "\"We know how important it is for the United States to stay ahead of this, to support our foreign partners, and to try and make an impact as it relates to the trafficking of these artistic works and antiquities,\" said Veh Bezdikian, a supervisory special FBI agent, in a statement.",

    "summary": "The trial over President Trump's deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles earlier this summer reached its third and final day Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "The trial over President Trump's deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles earlier this summer reached its third and final day Wednesday, as lawyers for the Justice Department and the state of California argued over the validity of Gov. Gavin Newsom's lawsuit and whether the Posse Comitatus Act \u2014 which generally bars the military from engaging in domestic law enforcement \u2014 applied to the troop deployment.",
      "Mr. Trump in June deployed 4,000 California National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles, saying they were needed to protect federal property and law enforcement agents amid June protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations. Newsom did not approve of the use of his state's Guard forces and responded with a lawsuit\u00a0requesting an injunction limiting the military's role in the city.",
      "In addition to claiming the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act does not apply, Eric Hamilton, a lawyer for the Department of Justice, argued that there is no precedent for the lawsuit, for injunctive relief or money damages under the act, and that Newsom and the state of California have not suffered the harm required to sue.",
      "\"It is, in fact, the federal government who is engaged in unprecedented conduct,\" said Deputy Attorney General Meghan Strong, representing the State of California, explaining that the government has never used the military in this way before.",
      "U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer seemed perplexed by several of the government's assertions, particularly what he called the apparent \"absence of any limits to a national police force.\" He questioned the Justice Department's claim that the 19th century law at the center of this trial is not relevant, and the assertion that his court lacks jurisdiction to issue an injunction against the president.",
      "\"So then what is the remedy?\" Breyer asked Hamilton, raising the issue of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution. \"You're saying there's a criminal remedy? The president can be prosecuted? You say that in light of the Supreme Court decision, the Trump decision. Isn't he immune?\"",
      "\"So that's it. Too bad. So sad. It's over,\" he added emphatically. \"And that's the end of the case.\"",
      "California has asked Breyer for an injunction that would allow the military to protect federal property \u2014 such as courthouses and ICE facilities \u2014 but block it from continuing the support for immigration enforcement operations, which the state's lawyer called an \"unlawful military crusade.\"",
      "\"The constitution and the law and the facts are on Governor Newsom's side,\" said Josh Kastenberg, a professor at the University of New Mexico Law School. \"But that doesn't mean he's going to win. Ever since World War II, the courts have embraced this military deference doctrine, which really is presidential deference in matters of military command and control.\"",
      "Questions over scope",
      "\"We're going to see federal officers everywhere if the president determines that there's some threat to the safety of a federal agent,\" Breyer said to Hamilton. \"And it's his determination. Not mine, it's his. That's what you're saying. That's what the law is.\"",
      "Hamilton said that wasn't \"quite what I'm saying.\" He asserted the troops are not enforcing federal law, but providing protection, and that it is lawful for guardsmen and marines to provide protection for federal buildings \u2014 the one point he agreed with California's attorney on. But, he argued, there is no distinction between protecting federal property and protecting federal law enforcement working out in the field.",
      "Breyer pointed out that federal employees \"are everywhere.\"",
      "The judge further questioned why any National Guard members remain in Los Angeles, and expressed concern about the justification for continued operations. Hamilton testified that 300 guardsmen remain, a 90% reduction in the force. Strong countered that it is still a significant number of soldiers, and certainly enough to violate the law.",
      "\"Thank goodness for the National Guard, but why is the federalized National Guard still in place?\" asked Breyer. \"What's the threat today? What was the threat yesterday?\"",
      "\"I go back to the thing that I'm really troubled by: What limiting factors are there to the use of this force?\" he said, \"Once you have a force in place, and maybe legitimately do so, and the threat that gave rise to the force in that place subsides \u2026 how does one look at this national police force that goes out of where the threat was and starts executing other laws?\"",
      "Does the Posse Comitatus Act apply?",
      "Breyer appeared to take issue with the Justice Department's argument that the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply, noting that a key witness, Major General Scott Sherman \u2014 who was at one point the commanding general of the Guard task force in Los Angeles \u2014 had testified that the troops were trained to act within the bounds of that law.",
      "\"Then why is it the excellent Major General sought assurance that the Posse Comitatus Act was followed?\" said Breyer. \"Why did I spend a day looking at slide after slide, and regulation after regulation, and reports after reports on conduct of the soldiers to ensure that they were in compliance with the Posse Comitatus Act if the Posse Comitatus Act is irrelevant?\"",
      "Strong argued that all of the Department of Defense's leaders agreed that the Posse Comitatus Act applied to the Task Force 51 troops in Los Angeles. She said they substituted the word \"protection\" for \"security\" when describing the troops' activities because they knew that \"security\" would violate the act.",
      "She asserted that the secretary of defense had released a memorandum invoking a constitutional exception to the Posse Comitatus Act, and affirmatively instructing soldiers to engage in activities that violated it \u2014 but the memo was issued after those activities had taken place.",
      "On Tuesday, Sherman testified that he was advised of a \"constitutional exception\" that enabled the troops to conduct certain activities that would normally violate the Posse Comitatus Act.",
      "Strong called this an attempt by the Department of Defense to justify their actions after the fact that \"itself reveals a knowledge and awareness of their violations.\"",
      "The federal government is \"disregarding the law, and so we need show nothing more than that,\" said Strong.",
      "She further argued that the Constitution seeks to make sure the president cannot control a standing army the way the king had in 1776. She said that it would deny the basic principles of federalism for the state to have \"no legal recourse to challenge the conduct of these troops.\"",
      "\"If you look at the plain language of the Posse Comitatus Act, and the fear of standing armies that existed at the time of the Constitution,\" Kastenberg said. \"... One of the biggest issues in the state conventions and in the framing of the Constitution to begin with was to significantly curtail the president's authority over the standing army, and keep the standing army very small.\"",
      "Breyer did not give a timeline for his ruling, stating at the end of the day, \"I will decide the case as soon as I can decide the case.\"",

    "story": [
      "A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there's no reason to be spooked \u2014 the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.",
      "The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.",
      "Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including \"Frankenstein bunnies,\" \"demon rabbits\" and \"zombie rabbits.\" But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.",
      "The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists' knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.",
      "The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.",
      "News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.",
      "\"It looks like it was black quills or black toothpicks sticking out all around his or her mouth,\" Susan Mansfield, a Fort Collins resident who saw one of the rabbits, told 9News. \"I thought he would die off during the winter, but he didn't. He came back a second year, and it grew.\"",
      "Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency has been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins.",
      "But she said that it's not uncommon to see infected rabbits, especially in the summer, when the fleas and ticks that spread the virus are most active. The virus can spread from rabbit to rabbit but not to other species, including humans and pets, she said.",
      "Rabbit papilloma is similar to human HPV-induced tumors, according to an article in the\u00a0National Library of Medicine, and human papillomavirus has been linked to skin cancer, according to a recent report.",
      "The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer, Van Hoose said. The growths don't harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating. Rabbits' immune systems are able to fight the virus and, once they do, the growths will disappear, she said.",
      "The agency notes that the disease is more severe in domestic rabbits than in wild rabbits and should be treated by a veterinarian.",
      "Colorado is home to three different species of cottontail rabbits \u2014 the mountain cottontail, the desert cottontail and the eastern cottontail. The species differ mostly by color and are \"difficult or impossible to distinguish in the field, except by habitat and geographic location,\" Colorado Parks and Wildlife says.",

    "story": [
      "Fewer Americans are reporting that they drink alcohol amid a growing belief that even moderate alcohol consumption is a health risk, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday.",
      "The survey finds that 54% of U.S. adults say they drink alcoholic beverages such as liquor, wine or beer \u2014 \"the lowest by one percentage point in Gallup's nearly 90-year trend,\" the analytics company says.",
      "And a record high percentage of U.S. adults, 53%, now say moderate drinking is bad for their health, up from 28% in 2015. The uptick in doubt about alcohol's benefits is largely driven by young adults \u2014 the age group that is most likely to believe drinking \"one or two drinks a day\" can cause health hazards \u2014 but older adults are also now increasingly likely to think moderate drinking carries risks.",
      "The findings of the poll, which was conducted in July, indicate that after years of many believing that moderate drinking was harmless \u2014 or even beneficial \u2014 worries about alcohol consumption are taking hold. According to Gallup's data, even those who consume alcohol are drinking less.",
      "The federal government is updating new dietary guidelines, including those around alcohol. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, government data showed U.S. alcohol consumption was trending up. But other government surveys have shown a decline in certain types of drinking, particularly among teenagers and young adults.",
      "This comes alongside a new drumbeat of information about alcohol's risks. While moderate drinking was once thought to have benefits for heart health, health professionals in recent years have pointed to overwhelming evidence that alcohol consumption leads to negative health outcomes and is a leading cause of cancer.",
      "Growing skepticism about alcohol's benefits",
      "Younger adults have been quicker than older Americans to accept that drinking is harmful, but older adults are coming around to the same view.",
      "About two-thirds of 18- to 34-year-olds believe moderate drinking is unhealthy, according to the poll, up from about 4 in 10 in 2015. Older adults are less likely to see alcohol as harmful \u2014 about half of Americans age 55 or older believe this \u2014 but that's a substantial increase, too. In 2015, only about 2 in 10 adults age 55 or older thought alcohol was bad for their health.",
      "In the past, moderate drinking was thought to have some benefits. That idea came from imperfect studies that largely didn't include younger people and couldn't prove cause and effect. Now the scientific consensus has shifted, and several countries recently lowered their alcohol consumption recommendations. Earlier this year, the outgoing U.S. surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, recommended a label on bottles of beer, wine and liquor that would clearly outline the link between alcohol consumption and cancer.",
      "\"Alcohol is a well-established, preventable cause of cancer responsible for about 100,000 cases of cancer and 20,000 cancer deaths annually in the United States \u2014 greater than the 13,500 alcohol-associated traffic crash fatalities per year in the U.S. \u2014 yet the majority of Americans are unaware of this risk,\" Murthy said in a statement in January.",
      "The federal government's current dietary guidelines recommend Americans not drink or, if they do consume alcohol, men should limit themselves to two drinks a day or fewer while women should stick to one or fewer.",
      "Gallup's director of U.S. social research, Lydia Saad, said shifting health advice throughout older Americans' lives may be a reason they have been more gradual than young adults to recognize alcohol as harmful.",
      "\"Older folks may be a little more hardened in terms of the whiplash that they get with recommendations,\" Saad said. \"It may take them a little longer to absorb or accept the information. Whereas, for young folks, this is the environment that they've grown up in ... in many cases, it would be the first thing young adults would have heard as they were coming into adulthood.\"",
      "The government is expected to release new guidelines later this year, under the directive of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has promised big changes. Kennedy has not hinted at how the alcohol recommendations may shift.",
      "Drinking rates fall to decade low",
      "Slightly more than half of Americans, 54%, report that they drink alcohol \u2014 a low in Gallup's data that is especially pronounced among women and young adults. The previous low was 55%, recorded in 1958.",
      "\"Declines in alcohol consumption do not appear to be caused by people shifting to other mood-altering substances \u2014 in particular, recreational marijuana, which is now legal in about half of U.S. states,\" Gallup said in a news release. \"Although marijuana use is higher today than a decade ago, it has been fairly steady over the past four years and thus doesn't appear to be a factor in people choosing not to drink alcohol.\"",
      "Gallup says it has been tracking Americans' drinking behavior since 1939. Since 2001, it has tracked their views on health implications related to moderate drinking.",
      "Young Americans' alcohol consumption has been trending downward for years, accelerating the overall decline in alcohol consumption. In sharp contrast with Gallup's findings two decades ago, when young adults were likeliest to report drinking, young adults' drinking rate is now slightly below middle-aged and older adults.",
      "Americans' reported drinking is among the lowest since the question was first asked in 1939. For most of the last few decades, at least 6 in 10 Americans have reported drinking alcoholic beverages, only dipping below that point a few times in the question's history.",
      "Americans who drink alcohol are consuming less",
      "Even if concerns about health risks aren't causing some adults to give up alcohol entirely, these worries could be influencing how often they drink.",
      "The survey found that adults who think moderate drinking is bad for one's health are just as likely as people who don't share those concerns to report that they drink, but fewer of the people with health worries had consumed alcohol recently.",
      "About half of those who worry moderate drinking is unhealthy said they had a drink in the previous week, compared with about 7 in 10 who did not think drinking was bad for their health.",
      "Overall, only about one-quarter of Americans who drink said they had consumed alcohol in the prior 24 hours, a record low in the survey. Roughly 4 in 10 said that it had been more than a week since they had poured a drink.",

      "Geneva \u2014 Negotiators working on a landmark treaty to address the global crisis of plastic pollution failed to reach an agreement during talks that extended into Friday in Geneva.",
      "Nations were meeting for an 11th day at the United Nations offices there to try to complete a treaty to end the plastic pollution crisis. They remain deadlocked over whether the treaty should reduce exponential growth of plastic production and put global, legally binding controls on toxic chemicals used to make plastics. More than 1,000 delegates took part in the talks.",
      "The negotiations at the U.N. hub were supposed to be the last round and produce the first legally binding treaty on plastic pollution, including in the oceans. But just like at the meeting in South Korea last year, they're leaving without a treaty.",
      "The biggest issue of the talks has been whether the treaty should impose caps on producing new plastic or focus instead on things like better design, recycling and reuse.",
      "Powerful oil- and gas-producing nations and the plastics industry oppose production limits. They want a treaty focused on better waste management and reuse.",
      "Every year, the world makes more than 400 million tons of new plastic, and that could grow by about 70% by 2040 without policy changes. About 100 countries want to limit production. Many have said it's also essential to address toxic chemicals used to make plastics.",
      "Thursday was the last scheduled day of negotiations, but work continued into Friday.",
      "Luis Vayas Valdivieso, the chair of the negotiating committee, wrote and presented two drafts of treaty text in Geneva based on the views expressed by the nations. The representatives from 184 countries didn't agree to use either one as the basis for their negotiations.",
      "Valdivieso said Friday morning as the delegates reconvened in the assembly hall that no further action is being proposed on the latest draft.",
      "After a three-hour session, he banged a gavel made of recycled plastic bottle tops from a Nairobi landfill and said the meeting was adjourned, to be resumed at a later date.",
      "Representatives of Norway, Australia, Tuvalu and others nations said they were deeply disappointed to be leaving Geneva without a treaty.",
      "European Commissioner Jessika Roswall said the European Union and its member states had higher expectations for this meeting and while the latest draft falls short on their demands, it's a good basis for another negotiating session.",
      "\"The Earth is not ours only. We are stewards for those who come after us. Let us fulfill that duty,\" she said.",
      "China's delegation said the fight against plastic pollution is a long marathon and that this temporary setback is a new starting point to forge consensus. It urged nations to work together to offer future generations a blue planet without plastic pollution.",
      "Saudi Arabia said both drafts lacked balance, and Saudi and Kuwaiti negotiators said the latest proposal takes other states' views more into account and addressed plastic production, which they consider outside the scope of the treaty.",
      "That draft, released early Friday, didn't include a limit on plastic production, but recognized that current levels of production and consumption are \"unsustainable\" and global action is needed. New language had been added to say these levels exceed current waste management capacities and are projected to increase further, \"thereby necessitating a coordinated global response to halt and reverse such trends.\"",
      "The objective of the treaty was also revamped to state that the accord would be based on a comprehensive approach that addresses the full lifecycle of plastics.",
      "Science shows what it will take to end pollution and protect human health, said Bethanie Carney Almroth, an ecotoxicology professor at Sweden's University of Gothenburg who coleads the Scientists' Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty. The science supports addressing the full lifecycle of plastics, beginning with extraction and production, and restricting some chemicals to ensure plastics are safer and more sustainable, she added.",
      "\"The science has not changed,\" she said. \"It cannot be down negotiated.\"",
      "Environmentalists, waste pickers and Indigenous leaders and many business executives traveled to the talks to make their voices heard. Some used creative tactics, but are leaving disappointed. Indigenous leaders sought a treaty that recognizes their rights and knowledge.",
      "A report published in the Lancet\u00a0 medical journal the day before the Geneva talks began described plastic pollution \u00a0a \"grave, growing and under-recognized danger\" to health that is costing the world at least $1.5 trillion a year.",

      "The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said that as of 2 a.m. Friday, Erin was packing maximum sustained winds of 70 mph. Once they hit 74 mph, Erin will be classified as a hurricane. Its center was some 665 miles east of the northern Leeward Islands and it was moving west-northwest at 15 mph, the center said.",
      "The storm formed just west of the Cabo Verde islands, off the western coast of Africa, and was moving west, the center said.",
      "Erin is \"forecast to become a large and formidable major hurricane,\" the hurricane center said in an advisory Thursday evening. A major hurricane is defined as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 miles per hour.",
      "Erin wasn't posing an immediate threat to the U.S. but there was uncertainty about its longer-term path.",
      "Maps show Tropical Storm Erin's projected path",
      "The center of the storm is likely to move near or north of the northern Leewards over the weekend, the hurricane center said.",
      "The northern Leewards are a string of islands stretching from the Virgin Islands to Guadeloupe, including Anguilla, St. Martin, St. Barts, Antigua and Barbuda, and several others.",
      "Drone video footage posted to\u00a0social media\u00a0showed the aftermath of flooding from the storm in Cabo Verde, a group of islands about 385 miles off the African coast. Local media reported at least eight people were killed, and officials declared a state of emergency as crews dealt with the damage.",
      "There's uncertainty about where Erin goes after this week, but most models show the storm pivoting to the northwest and north, CBS News Miami meteorologist Shane Hinton reported.",
      "Erin is the fifth named storm to develop during the Atlantic hurricane season, which started just over two months ago. Last week, Tropical Storm Dexter formed in the western Atlantic but didn't pose a threat to land. In early July, Tropical Storm Chantal made landfall on the Carolina coast, bringing deadly flooding to the region.",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season started in June and runs through November, with its peak months being August, September and October.",
      "The Pacific Ocean has already seen six hurricanes this year, including Henriette, which weakened to a tropical storm Tuesday and was not expected to hit land.",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, predicted an above-normal season for the Atlantic basin this year, with an expected number of named storms between 13 and 18, five to nine of which could become hurricanes.",
      "A tropical cyclone becomes a tropical storm when its maximum sustained wind speeds reach at least 39 mph. Hurricanes are more powerful with sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Hurricanes are rated on a scale ranging from Category 1 to Category 5, which is the most severe rating. A storm is considered to be a major hurricane when it reaches Category 3 strength with sustained winds of at least 111 mph.",

      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to London on Thursday, a day before a critical U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska.",
      "\"Yesterday, together with all partners, today in a bilateral format, we discussed expectations from the meeting in Alaska and possible prospects,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media post after the meeting. \"We also discussed in detail security guarantees that can make peace truly sustainable if the United States still manages to pressure Russia to stop the killings and engage in real meaningful diplomacy. It is important that we can all work together within a coalition of those willing to achieve effective formats for security work.\"",
      "Zelenskyy's trip to the British capital came a day after he took part in virtual meetings from Berlin with President Trump and the leaders of several European countries. Those leaders said Mr. Trump had assured them he would make it a priority to try to achieve a ceasefire in Ukraine during his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday in Anchorage.",
      "Putin was holding a meeting in Russia on Thursday with members of Russia's leadership to prepare for the Alaska meeting. As part of that preparatory meeting, he said he wanted to discuss the negotiation process with Ukraine and how it was going.",
      "Putin also said he planned \"to talk about the stage we are at with the current American administration, which, as everyone knows, is making, in my opinion, quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the fighting, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict.\"",
      "Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said Thursday that the Friday meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin in Alaska is expected to begin at around 11:30 a.m. local time on Friday. The main topic will be the war in Ukraine, but there will also be discussions about economic cooperation between Washington and Moscow.",
      "He said the meeting will take place at Elmendorf-Richardson Air Force Base, and that there will first be a one-on-one meeting between the two leaders before their delegations join.",
      "Mr. Trump and Putin will say a few words at the start of the meeting, Ushakov said, and they will hold a joint press conference afterward.",
      "Ushakov said each delegation will have five members. For Russia, those will be Ushakov, as well as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund Kirill Dmitriev, and Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov.",
      "Alaska summit \"hugely important\"",
      "Both Zelenskyy and the Europeans have worried the bilateral U.S.-Russia summit would leave them and their interests sidelined, and that any conclusions reached could favor Moscow and leave Ukraine and Europe's future security in jeopardy.",
      "Yet some of those leaders, like German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron, praised Wednesday's video conference with Mr. Trump as constructive.",
      "Speaking after the meetings to reporters, Mr. Trump warned of \"very severe consequences\" for Russia if Putin does not agree to stop the war against Ukraine after Friday's meeting.",
      "Starmer on Wednesday said the Alaska summit would be \"hugely important,\" and could be a \"viable\" path to a ceasefire in Ukraine. But he also alluded to European concerns that Mr. Trump may strike a deal that forces Ukraine to cede territory to Russia, and warned that Western allies must be prepared to step up pressure on Russia if necessary.",
      "During a call Wednesday among leaders of countries involved in the \"coalition of the willing\" \u2014 those who are prepared to help police any future peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv \u2014 Starmer stressed that any deal reached on bringing the fighting to an end must protect the \"territorial integrity\" of Ukraine.",
      "\"International borders cannot be, and must not be changed by force,'' he said. \"Any talk about borders, diplomacy, ceasefire has to sit alongside a robust and credible security guarantee to ensure that any peace, if there is peace, is lasting peace and Ukraine can defend its territorial integrity as part of any deal.\"",
      "Kyiv has long insisted that safeguards against future Russian attacks provided by its Western allies would be a precondition for achieving a durable end to the fighting in Ukraine. Yet many Western governments have been hesitant to commit to engaging their military personnel.",
      "Countries in the \"coalition of the willing,\" which include France and the U.K., have been trying for months to secure U.S. security backing should it be required. Following Wednesday's virtual meetings, Macron said Mr. Trump told the assembled leaders that while the NATO military alliance must not be part of future security guarantees, the U.S. leader agreed that \"the United States and all the parties involved should take part.\"",
      "\"It's a very important clarification that we have received,\" Macron said.",
      "European Council President Antonio Costa also welcomed \"the readiness of the United States to share with Europe the efforts to reinforce security conditions once we obtain a durable and just peace for Ukraine.\"",
      "\"I don't see any changes coming\"",
      "With another high-level meeting on their country's future on the horizon, some Ukrainians expressed skepticism that any breakthroughs would be achieved during Friday's U.S.-Russia summit.",
      "Oleksandra Kozlova, 39, a department head at a digital agency in Kyiv, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that she believes Ukrainians \"have already lost hope\" that meaningful progress can be made on ending the 3 1/2-year-old war.",
      "\"I don't think this round will be decisive,\" she said. \"There have already been enough meetings and negotiations promising us, ordinary people, that something will be resolved, that things will get better, that the war will end. Unfortunately, this has not happened, so personally I don't see any changes coming.\"",
      "Anton Vyshniak, a car salesman in Kyiv, said Ukraine's priority now should be saving the lives of its military servicepeople, even at the expense of making territorial concessions.",
      "\"At the moment, the most important thing is to preserve the lives of male and female military personnel. After all, there are not many human resources left,\" he said. \"Borders are borders, but human lives are priceless. Therefore, some principles can be disregarded here.\"",
      "Russian strikes in Ukraine's Sumy region overnight Wednesday resulted in numerous injuries, Ukrainian regional officials said.

    "story": [
      "Swiss pilot Raphael Domjan beat the altitude record for a solar-powered electric plane in a flight that took him soaring to 9,521 meters, or 31,237 feet, his team announced Wednesday.",
      "The SolarStratos plane made the landmark flight from Sion airport in southwest Switzerland on Tuesday, taking advantage of warm air thermals to go beyond the record that has stood for 15 years.",
      "The certified altitude record for a solar plane stands at 9,235 meters, or 30,298 feet.",
      "The achievement is \"one of those unforgettable peaks that define great human and technological adventures,\" the SolarStratos mission said in a statement.",
      "At cruising altitude, Domjan actually crossed paths with a commercial airliner, SolarStratos said, calling the moment \"a powerful symbol of what the decarbonized aviation of tomorrow might look like.\"",
      "Domjan's flight lasted five hours and nine minutes.",
      "\"I share this moment of joy with all the people who have been preparing for this achievement for years,\" the 53-year-old said.",
      "The data will be sent to the World Air Sports Federation governing body, which will decide whether to validate the new record.",
      "\"It is the pressure altitude corrected to standard density altitude that is recognized as the official reference for aviation altitude records,\" the SolarStratos team said.",
      "Domjan \u2014 whose company bio describes him as a \"eco-adventurer\" and lecturer who pilots planes, gliders and helicopters \u2014 is aiming to be the first to take a solar-powered plane above 10,000 meters, flying at the same altitude as airliners. If that barrier is broken, the team hopes to go on and make a first manned solar-powered flight into the stratosphere, which at Switzerland's latitude begins at around 12,000 meters.",
      "\"This achievement marks a major milestone on the path toward reaching the stratosphere using only solar power -- and already fulfils the mission's goal: to capture imaginations with emblematic, spectacular challenges that promote solar energy and the protection of our biosphere and planet,\" SolarStratos said.",
      "The front-mounted single propeller plane, registration HB-SXA, is made of carbon fiber to ensure lightness and strength. SolarStratos is 9.6 meters long, and its huge wingspan of 24.8 meters accommodates the 22 square meters of high-spec solar panels topping the wings, and allows for flying at low speeds.",
      "The plane, which SolarStartos calls \"daring and finely engineered,\"\u00a0can take off at low speeds, from 50 kilometers per hour upwards. Its maximum speed is 140 kph, while its cruising speed is around 80 kph.",
      "\"Tomorrow can be better than what we have today\"",
      "In 2012, the pioneering Domjan became the first person to sail around the world in a fully solar-powered boat, a journey that began in Miami in 2010.",
      "\"It's important to demonstrate what we can achieve with solar energy,\" the adventurer told AFP.",
      "\"The dream of flight is probably the oldest dream of mankind,\" he said.",
      "\"My goal is to show to the young generation of today and tomorrow that tomorrow it will still be possible to fly without burning any fossil energies,\" he said.",
      "\"This is what we want to achieve: it's really to show that the world of tomorrow can be better than what we have today,\" he added.",
      "A warm-up flight on July 31 got to 6,589 meters, surpassing the plane's previous best in 2024.",
      "A first attempt on Friday was quickly abandoned when the forecast thermals failed to materialize, saving the batteries for Sunday when the plane got to 8,224 meters.",
      "During the first phase of record attempts, the aircraft has to make maximum use of rising warm air currents to climb to around 4,000-5,000 meters. It then has to recharge its batteries at this altitude before climbing again.",
      "Before takeoff, the batteries must be fully charged using solar energy, and the plane has to land under its own power \u2014 it cannot glide back in on zero charge \u2014 and have at least 16% charge in the batteries.",
      "If the flight is to be certified as a record, all the energy used during the flight must have been produced by the solar cells. The current record was set in 2010 by the Solar Impulse experimental plane, with Swiss pilot Andre Borschberg at the controls.",

      "Israel's far-right finance minister announced approval Thursday of the construction of a contentious settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank that Palestinians and rights groups worry would scuttle plans for a future Palestinian state by effectively cutting the West Bank into two separate parts.",
      "The announcement comes as several major U.S. allies have announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state\u00a0in September.",
      "\"This reality finally buries the idea of a Palestinian state, because there is nothing to recognize and no one to recognize,\" said Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. \"Anyone in the world who tries today to recognize a Palestinian state \u2014 will receive an answer from us on the ground.\"",
      "Development in E1, an open tract of land east of Jerusalem, has been under consideration for more than two decades, but was frozen due to U.S. pressure during previous administrations. On Thursday, Smotrich praised President Trump and U.S. ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee as \"true friends of Israel as we have never had before.\"",
      "The E1 plan hasn't yet received its final approval, which is expected next week. The plan includes around 3,500 apartments to expand the settlement of Maale Adumim, Smotrich said. While some bureaucratic steps remain, if the process moves quickly, infrastructure work could begin in the next few months and construction of homes could start in around a year.",
      "Rights groups swiftly condemned the plan. Peace Now called it \"deadly for the future of Israel and for any chance of achieving a peaceful two-state solution\" that is \"guaranteeing many more years of bloodshed.\"",
      "The Palestinian foreign ministry called the plan an extension of crimes of what it says are genocide, displacement and annexation, the Reuters news agency reports. Israel fiercely denies those characterizations.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear if Netanyahu backs the E1 plan, Reuters said.",
      "Smotrich's popularity has dropped in recent months, Reuters notes, with polls showing his party wouldn't win a single seat if parliamentary elections were held today.",

      "In a scheme dating back to 2012, four cartel associates are accused of defrauding American citizens of their life savings through elaborate rental and resale schemes, according to a Treasury statement. In the span of six months, officials said they were able to document $23.1 million sent from mostly people in the U.S. to scammers in Mexico.",
      "The sanctions imposed by the Trump administration would prohibit Americans from doing business with the alleged cartel associates and block any of their assets in the U.S.",

      "In past years, the administration of then-President Joe Biden also sanctioned associates and accountants related to such schemes.",

      "Violent cartel allegedly behind timeshare scam",
      "The Jalisco cartel, known by its Spanish initials as the CJNG, has reportedly killed call center workers who try to quit. In June 2023, U.S. and Mexican officials confirmed that as many as\u00a0eight young workers\u00a0were confirmed dead after they apparently tried to quit jobs at a call center operated by the Jalisco cartel.",

      "The Department of Justice has called the Jalisco cartel \"one of the five most dangerous transnational criminal organizations in the world.\" The cartel's leader, Nemesio Oseguera, aka \"El Mencho,\" is among the most sought by Mexican and American authorities. The U.S. government has offered a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to \"El Mencho's\" arrest or conviction.",
      "The Wednesday announcement was made amid an ongoing effort by the Trump administration and the Mexican government to crack down on cartels and their diverse sources of income.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department has slapped sanctions on a variety of people from a Mexican rapper who it accused of laundering cartel money to Mexican banks facilitating money transfers in sales of precursor chemicals used to produce fentanyl.",
      "The announcement also came one day after Mexico sent 26 high-ranking cartel figures to the U.S. in the latest major deal with the Trump administration as Mexico tries to avoid threatened tariffs.",
      "\"These transfers are not only a strategic measure to ensure public safety, but also reflect a firm determination to prevent these criminals from continuing to operate from within prisons and to break up their networks of influence,\" Mexican Security Minister Omar Garc\u00eda Harfuch said in a news conference on Wednesday.",

      "The president on Wednesday said he hopes there will be a second meeting after the Alaska meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, but that will depend on how Friday's sitdown goes. Asked by a reporter at an event at the Kennedy Center whether there will be consequences for Putin if he doesn't agree to stop the war after the Friday meeting, Mr. Trump said, \"There will be very severe consequences.\" But he declined to elaborate.",

      "\"U.S. President Trump will start discussions with President Putin in Alaska about bringing the war to an end, and important decisions could be reached,\" Merz, standing alongside Zelenskyy, told journalists in a press conference after meeting with Mr. Trump. \"We as Europeans are doing everything we can to help set the agenda for that meeting. We're hoping that Donald Trump has success in that meeting in Anchorage.\"",
      "Merz said that he and Zelenskyy had spoken with Mr. Trump together.",

      "The German leader said Ukraine would need a seat at the table if peace was to be reached in Ukraine, and that he told Mr. Trump he would speak to him after his Alaska meeting with Putin.",
      "\"We want to make sure that the right chronology happens: that there is a ceasefire and that there is an agreement that is discussed after that,\" he said. \"A legal recognition of Russian ownership of this territory cannot happen. There have to be robust security guarantees. The sovereignty of Ukraine has to be respected. Negotiations have to be part of a larger transatlantic strategy, and has to be part of necessary pressure on Russia.\"",
      "Merz added, \"If there is no movement on the Russian side, we and the U.S. have to put more pressure on Russia. President Trump knows this position and largely agrees with it, and we had a good conversation with each other.\"",
      "\"Everything ... needs to be discussed with Ukraine\"",

Putin cannot fool us. We need to pressure him. Sanctions not only from the U.S., but from the European Union. Together our union of partners can really, really stop Putin's war.\"",

      "Mr. Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace. Mr. Trump said that following Friday's summit, a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders could be arranged, or that it could also be a meeting with \"Putin and Zelenskyy and me.\"",
      "Zelenskyy warned that \"talks about us, without us, will not work.\"",
      "Ukrainian and European concerns",
      "The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia's energy might to try to intimidate the European Union, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them.",
      "The overarching fear of many European countries is that Putin will set his sights on one of them next if he wins in Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that it still controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the leader categorically rejected.",
      "Zelenskyy reiterated that Ukraine would not give up any territory it controls, saying that would be unconstitutional and would serve only as a springboard for a future Russian invasion.",
      "He said diplomatic discussions led by the U.S. focusing on ending the war have not addressed key Ukrainian demands, including security guarantees to prevent future Russian aggression and including Europe in negotiations and rehabilitate Putin.",
      "General Sir Richard Shirreff, former NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe, told CBS News partner network BBC News he didn't believe Friday's meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin could lead to an end of the war between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "\"Russia has to recognize and Putin has to recognize that Zelenskyy is president of Ukraine, recognize the Ukrainian constitution and Ukraine's right to exist as a sovereign state. And that is only going to happen ... when Russia gets a really bloody nose. And for that to happen, we need to see some proper strategic thinking from NATO - from the president of the United States - that recognizes that this is about transatlantic security.\"",
      "Shirreff said an end to the war would require Ukraine becoming a member of NATO.",
      "\"Even if Putin moves on or falls under a bus, we're probably likely to get somebody in place just as hard-line, just as ultra-nationalistic, and just as determined to press on (with Russia's takeover of Ukraine),\" Shirreff said. \"So I think we have to recognize that European security means deterrence - a band of deterrent steel, as I've said many times - from the Baltic to the Black Sea, with Ukraine as a NATO member. Now, however far-fetched that may seem from where we are at the moment, that's the reality. ... Any sort of compromise now, any so-called freezing of conflict, is only going to continue to postpone it.\"",
      "Trump-Putin summit to take place on Alaskan military base",
      "The summit between Mr. Trump and Putin will be the first in-person meeting between Putin and a sitting U.S. president since Russia invaded Ukraine more than three years ago.",
      "The meeting will take place at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, on the northern edge of Anchorage, a senior White House official told CBS News Tuesday. Given that it is peak tourist season in Alaska, there were few viable options to host the talks. Possible venues for the high-stakes meeting also needed to meet security requirements.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Tuesday that the mechanics of the meeting were \"still being ironed out.\"",
      "Leavitt described the meeting as \"a listening exercise for the president.\"",
      "\"Only one party that's involved in this war is going to be present, and so this is for the president to go and to get, again, a more firm and better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end,\" Leavitt said.",
      "\"Trump has obviously not been listening at all because it's very clear \u2014 and Putin continues to make it clear \u2014 what his demands are, and he's not stepped back one iota from his maximalist demands,\" former NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe Shirreff said. \"And those, as we've heard, are simply impossible for Ukraine to accept without capitulation.\"",
      "Asked Wednesday at the Kennedy Center if he believes he can convince Putin to stop targeting Ukrainian civilians, Mr. Trump said no.",
      "\"Well, I'll tell you what,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"I've had that conversation with him. I've had a lot of good conversations with him. Then I go home and I see that a rocket hit a nursing home or a rocket hit an apartment building and people are laying dead in the streets. So I guess the answer to that is no, because I've had this conversation.\"",

      "An American teenager was detained on an Antarctic island while attempting to pilot his small plane to every continent, said Chilean authorities, who have charged him for allegedly submitting a false flight plan. The 19-year-old pilot, Ethan Guo, denies the accusation and says the month-and-a-half-long ordeal is taking a toll on his health.",
      "Guo gained an online following by documenting his trip around the world, which lasted well over 100 days and had already taken him to six continents prior to the Antarctic voyage, according to his website and social media posts.",
      "Guo said he hoped to become the first pilot to complete a solo flight across all seven continents in a small Cessna, a feat that simultaneously aims to raise $1 million for cancer research through St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. On his site, the teen cites his cousin's 2021 cancer diagnosis as his source of inspiration.",
      "Guo's latest Instagram posts chronicled part of his path over southeastern Asia. Authorities in South America say he went on to traverse the Pacific Ocean, ending up in Chile before making his way toward Antarctica.",
      "According to Cristian Cristoso Rifo, the regional prosecutor of Magallanes and Chilean Antarctica, Guo departed from the airport in the city of Punta Arenas, near the southernmost point of Chile, and proceeded to conduct an unauthorized flight to King George Island. Located off the Atlantic coast, the island is claimed by Chile as part of its Atlantic territory.",
      "The young pilot landed his plane at the island's Teniente R. Marsh Airport, where he was detained, Cristoso said in a video statement shared on social media on Monday. He said Guo submitted a flight plan that indicated his plans to fly over Punta Arenas, but not farther than that.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News, attorneys for Guo say those accusations are unfounded. \"Documentary evidence and audio recordings provided to the prosecutor definitively show that Mr. Guo's original destination was Ushuaia, Argentina,\" they write.",
      "But they say due to \"bureaucratic confusion,\" Chilean officials told him to \"circle in darkness over Tierra del Fuego before proceeding to Ushuaia at sunrise\" \u2014 and that's when he ran into dangerous flight conditions.",
      "\"He encountered instrument failures and heavy, unreported icing conditions caused by high cloud cover over the Andes, creating an imminent risk of a crash. To avert disaster, he diverted over the ocean. Once over the ocean, he experienced engine-related issues, likely to due to sudden, weather-related pressure changes.\"",
      "They say he then requested and received permission to land at the Marsh base from a high-ranking Chilean aviation official via WhatsApp.",
      "The prosecutor's office charged Guo for violating two articles of the Chilean Aeronautical Code, including one that calls for either short-term imprisonment or a fine brought down on anyone who lands in Chilean territory without legitimate authorization.",
      "The prosecutor said that in addition to his alleged breaches of the aeronautical code, Guo violated \"multiple national and international\" rules governing access to Antarctica and the routes taken to get there. His unauthorized flight also posed safety risks for air traffic to the frozen continent, Cristoso added.",
      "The statement from Guo's representatives blames prosecutors for refusing to acknowledge \"clear evidence\" exonerating him, \"resulting in his de facto confinement on the island for a month and a half.\"",
      "They say stress of the ordeal has caused \"severe deterioration in his health,\" including loss of more than 40 pounds and a diagnosis with pericarditis, inflammation of tissue around the heart.",
      "\"While he is grateful for efforts to secure him passage on a boat, he is frustrated that there is no plan for his plane, preventinghim from continuing his charitable mission to raise funds for St. Jude,\" they write.",

      "While the species has survived multiple periods of Arctic warming, climate change has already contributed to the loss of nearly two-thirds of the global populations of reindeer in the last three decades, according to the research team, led by the University of Adelaide in Australia and the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.",
      "There are about 9 million reindeer globally, including those that are domesticated, according to the World Population Review.",
      "The North American wild reindeer, also called caribou and estimated at around 3.5 million by the World Population Review, are most at risk from a warming climate, the researchers said. Caribou are found in Alaska and Canada.",

Chile claims ownership of the island, which is about 75 miles off the coast of Antarctica.",
      "Guo was detained at the airport on King George Island. On June 29, he was charged with handing false information to ground control and landing without authorization, both breaches of the Chilean Aeronautical Code.

    "summary": "An ethics complaint has been leveled against NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani over his rent-stabilized apartment while earning $150,000 as state assemblymember.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas has the latest on the escalating war of words between President Donald Trump and the leading New York City mayoral candidate on 'Special Report.'",
      "Criticism against socialist candidate for New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani, over his acquisition of a rent-stabilized apartment as someone who makes close to $150,000 a year, is ramping up after a watchdog issued a complaint to New York's government ethics commission.",
      "The issue came front-and-center earlier this month after Mamdani's opponent, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, began criticizing Mamdani for occupying a rent-stabilized apartment as a New York state assemblyperson who makes around $150,000 per year. Cuomo recently announced plans to pass \"Zohran's Law,\" which he said would \"keep the rich out of New York\u2019s affordable housing.\"",
      "\"It has been\u00a0reported\u00a0that New York State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani resides in a one-bedroom, rent-stabilized apartment in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens. In public statements, Mr. Mamdani has said his monthly rent is approximately $2,300. According to publicly available rental market\u00a0data, the average rent for a comparable one-bedroom in Astoria is about $3,002,\" stated a complaint filed with the New York State Commission on Ethics and Lobbying in Government by American Institute for Economic Research economist Jason Sorens, reviewed by Fox News Digital.",

      "New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani attends the 2025 New York City Pride March on June 29, 2025, in New York City.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "\"Questions have been raised in public discussion about the timeline of his tenancy in relation to when New York State ethics rules apply to elected officials,\" Sorens complaint continued. \"If at the start of Mr. Mamdani\u2019s tenancy, the relevant ethics regulations were applicable to him, then it could be appropriate to investigate whether any assistance he may have received in securing a rent-stabilized apartment qualified as a gift under the law.\"",
      "Mamdani's campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital, but the Democratic Party candidate has argued that he moved into the apartment when he was only making $47,000 and was not even aware of the fact it was rent-stabilized.",
      "\"Right-wing think tanks and MAGA billionaires\u2019 pathetic attempts to distract from Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mission to make NYC more affordable will fail, just as they did in the primary where New Yorkers resoundingly rejected Andrew Cuomo in a humiliating defeat,\" Mamdani spokesperson Dora Pekec said, according to the New York Post.",

      "However, Sorens described Mamdani's defense that he didn't know his apartment was rent-stabilized as \"implausible,\" citing the mayoral candidate's background working as a foreclosure specialist.",
      "\"I've candidly found it implausible that while working as a Tenant Advocate, he would not know that his own apartment was rent stabilized, particularly since it's such a big benefit, not just when you sign the lease, but obviously for every year going forward that you maintain it,\" Sorens said.",
      "\"I don't know about you, but for my family, that would be a significant windfall. We would notice that. So it's curious, maybe he was telling the truth, but it is curious that he insists that he didn't know.\"",

      "Sorens also argued that given the scarcity of affordable apartments in New York City, \"it invites a question about whether someone may have helped him as a politically connected activist.\"",
      "\"The bigger picture here, really, is that, you know, I'm not a political operative. I'm an economist. But I study rent control, and one of the negative side effects of rent control and rent stabilization is that these policies create an artificial skinny of affordable apartments, and it rewards having pull,\" Sorens concluded."

      "President Donald Trump's pick to head the nation's Social Security apparatus, Commissioner Frank Bisignano, told Fox News Digital that criticisms of the Trump administration's approach to Social Security are politically motivated and misleading.",
      "Democrats have expressed a wide range of concerns about Social Security under the current administration, including claims the Trump administration is making it more difficult for seniors and people with disabilities to access their benefits. The Trump administration's critics have also expressed concern that the president is seeking to privatize the program and is exaggerating fraud concerns to justify sweeping reforms. Democrats in Congress have gone as far as launching a \"Social Security War Room\" to coordinate their efforts to fight back.",

      "Bisignano took head-on the accusation that forced staffing cuts at the Social Security Administration will significantly impact beneficiaries and program efficiency. He argued not only that the reports of staff cuts were misleading, but also that the idea of program efficiency being correlated to the ratio of beneficiaries to staff members is a false narrative being pushed by the media and Trump's critics.",
      "\"Somebody would say, 'In 1960 we had one employee for every 480 beneficiaries, and today it's one for every 1,500. They can't have enough staff.' Well, we weren't doing 1.5 million transactions on the web then. We didn't have phone technology then, and, by the way, we delivered everybody a check, and now less than 1% of people are getting checks. So it's a completely different world.\"",
      "Thursday marks the 90th anniversary of Social Security, and over the decades the program has shifted from being one that primarily processed and delivered checks to beneficiaries, but now, as Bisignano points out, the nation's social security program does a lot more than just that. As a result, social security efficiency is about more than just manpower, Bisignano points out.",

      "Single-digit wait times for beneficiaries seeking assistance from the administration was one major statistic Bisignano touted, saying that it was as high as nearly 30-minutes just a year ago. Meanwhile, the program is serving roughly twice as many customers per day in the current fiscal year than it did in the previous one. Part of the success has been due to the administration's embrace of artificial intelligence tools and a move towards better tech.",

      "Bisignano also touted the program's move in eliminating 29 hours a week of scheduled website maintenance for the program's online portal that would force the site to shut down, and highlighted the backlog of disability claims that have been cleared under the new administration.",

      "According to the commissioner, outstanding disability claims have been reduced from around 1.2 million to around 930,00.",

That will change right now.\"",

While most people check their retirement accounts less often than their email, that's exactly what cybercriminals count on. They're hoping you'll let your guard down. The good news? You have more control than you think. By locking down your personal info, checking your account regularly, and setting up the right alerts, you can stay one step ahead. It takes just a few small habits to protect one of your biggest financial assets. Don't wait until something goes wrong. A little attention now could save you everything later.",

      "How these trackable shoes work",
      "Instead of baking in a GPS system, Skechers took a simpler route. The model, officially called Skechers GO RUN Elevate 2.0 - Find My Skechers, features a screw-secured compartment beneath the insole. That's where you can insert your own\u00a0Apple AirTag. Once inside, the AirTag becomes invisible and unnoticeable to the child wearing the shoes. From there, all tracking happens through Apple's Find My app, which works on any iPhone. It updates the tag's location as long as it remains near an Apple device. Since AirTags were made to track objects like keys and bags, slipping one into a shoe was just a matter of time.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The pros: Clever design and smart functionality",
      "Skechers designed these shoes with both practicality and peace of mind in mind. They feature an adaptive closure system with stretch laces and an adjustable instep strap, making it easy for kids to slip them on and off without help. Comfort isn't an afterthought either. Each pair includes a Skechers Air-Cooled Goga Mat insole with high-rebound cushioning, giving growing feet the support they need throughout the day. Plus, they're machine washable, which saves parents time and effort. The standout feature is the hidden AirTag-compatible compartment tucked beneath the heel of the insole. It comes with a screw-tight cover that keeps the tracker secure and discreet. There's no external AirTag branding, so the shoes look like any regular pair of Skechers. With a breathable mesh and synthetic upper, durable rubber outsole, and 1 1/4-inch heel height, the design delivers both style and function. They're available in sizes for boys and girls, and even without an AirTag, they work perfectly as everyday sneakers.",
      "Skechers GO RUN Elevate 2.0 - Find My Skechers. (Skechers)",
      "The cons: Tracking isn't foolproof",
      "Still, parents should be aware: these are not GPS shoes with real-time, all-the-time tracking.\u00a0AirTags\u00a0rely on nearby Apple devices to update their location. If the tag moves out of range or its battery dies, the updates stop. Another issue? Anyone who has access to your Apple account can view the tag's location. While you can manage and revoke access in your iPhone settings, this means privacy depends on your own security habits. And yes, it's possible for someone to remove the battery and disable an AirTag in seconds. That means this shoe-tracking feature won't replace supervision; it's simply a backup.",

      "What this means for you",
      "If you're a parent looking for a low-cost way to track where your child's shoes are, this is a creative solution. It's less intrusive than giving them a phone and more flexible than a built-in GPS system. You control the tracker, you install the battery, and you decide who gets access. But don't confuse shoe tracking with child safety. These trainers can offer location updates, but they can't think, speak, or call for help. Think of them as one extra tool, not your only one.",

The breach occurred on July 16 and involved the compromise of data belonging not just to customers, but also financial professionals and some employees.",

      "According to Allianz, the attacker used a social engineering technique to break in, though the company did not disclose further details. Social engineering attacks typically involve tricking employees into revealing passwords or installing malicious software that gives attackers access to internal systems.",
      "Allianz said it\u00a0\"took immediate action to contain and mitigate the issue\" and has notified federal law enforcement, including the FBI. The company added that there is \"no evidence that the Allianz Life network or other company systems were accessed, including our policy administration system.\"",

      "What personal data was exposed",
      "Allianz did not specify what kind of customer data was taken, but life insurance providers often store highly sensitive information such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth and financial details.",

      "Allianz said its investigation remains ongoing and that it has begun reaching out to those affected, offering support through dedicated resources.",

      "After a data breach, attackers often follow up with phishing emails or phone calls. They pretend to be from your insurance company or a support service. Don't click on links in unsolicited messages and verify any claims through official channels before responding. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

Unlimited Tomorrow is making 3D-printed prosthetics available for under $8,000 and doing it without sacrificing quality, comfort or functionality. Easton LaChappelle founded the company in 2014 at the age of 18.",

      "$5,900 UNITREE R1 ROBOT IS SURPRISINGLY AFFORDABLE",
      "People wearing the TrueLimb, a 3D-printed prosthetic\u00a0 (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "How TrueLimb sets itself apart from other bionic arms",
      "TrueLimb is a full-arm prosthetic solution designed to feel more like an extension of the body than a mechanical device. Each arm is personalized to match the user's opposing limb, down to fingertip size and skin tone. A wide range of color options are available, including natural shades, jet black and metallic silver.",
      "Instead of relying on standard sizes, TrueLimb is custom-built using a remote 3D scanning system. This digital process eliminates the need for in-person fittings and allows for precise, individualized design. The socket is breathable, adjustable and crafted for all-day wear. A built-in BOA dial lets users fine-tune the fit with ease. At just 1.0 to 1.5 pounds from socket to fingertip, the prosthetic remains lightweight and comfortable.",
      "TrueLimb, a 3D-printed prosthetic\u00a0 (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "Smart sensors power intuitive, muscle-based control",
      "TrueLimb features TrueSense technology, which includes over 30 topographical sensors embedded within the socket. These sensors detect subtle muscle movements on the residual limb, delivering accurate and responsive control, even when the limb is covered or sweating.",
      "While often referred to as \"mind-controlled,\" TrueLimb does not read brain signals directly. Instead, it uses advanced sensors to pick up electrical activity from muscles in the residual limb. These signals reflect the user\u2019s intended movements, allowing the prosthetic to respond in real time, creating a seamless, intuitive experience that feels like second nature.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The system adapts automatically by identifying the most active myo sites, deactivating less useful sensors and fine-tuning responsiveness based on the user's signal strength. This ensures consistent performance, even if muscle activity changes over time.",
      "The prosthetic includes six intuitive grip patterns to support a wide range of daily activities. Independent finger joints allow the hand to wrap around objects naturally, offering both strength and flexibility. The device is precise enough to handle delicate tasks, such as lifting an egg without cracking it.",
      "TrueLimb, a 3D-printed prosthetic\u00a0 (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "Feel touch again with haptic feedback technology",
      "Beyond movement, TrueLimb gives the user back a sense of touch. Gentle vibrations provide feedback when the prosthetic hand makes contact with objects. This helps users operate the device without always needing to look down, making actions more fluid and natural. The thumb is manually opposable, giving the user better control over grip force and object handling. Whether opening a bottle or holding a pen, the motion feels smooth and confident.",
      "Built for daily life with durable, lightweight materials",
      "TrueLimb is made with PA12 nylon, a highly durable material used in industrial-grade applications. The entire arm is built to withstand daily life. It's splash-resistant, heat-resistant, stain-resistant and tough enough to handle impact or abrasion. Thanks to its rubberized palm and coated fingertips, the hand maintains a firm grip on smooth or slippery surfaces. And with bionic strength, it can lift objects up to 15 pounds with ease.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Fast charging and multi-day battery life",
      "Power won't hold the user back. TrueLimb uses a USB-C charger, the same kind used for most phones and laptops, so no special adapter is needed. A high-capacity 5600mAh battery provides multi-day life, giving freedom to move without frequent recharges. The device also receives over-the-air software updates, so performance improves over time without needing to return the device. Behind the scenes, analytics tools help optimize each arm's performance based on how it's being used.",
      "How TrueLimb is designed and delivered from home",
      "One of the most innovative parts of the TrueLimb process is how it reaches users. Everything happens remotely. Users receive a 3D scanner in the mail to capture the shape of their limb. The data goes directly to the Unlimited Tomorrow team, which builds the prosthetic in-house. This approach eliminates middlemen and dramatically speeds up delivery. Users typically receive their completed prosthetic within weeks.",
      "TrueLimb is pictured in the box in which it was delivered. (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you or a loved one needs a prosthetic arm, this technology changes everything. You no longer need to wait months, file insurance claims or attend repeated fittings. With TrueLimb, you get a high-tech, customized solution faster and at a lower cost. You also gain full control and comfort. The sensors respond to your muscle signals without any lag. The arm fits your body, looks natural and feels like part of you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Unlimited Tomorrow is revolutionizing prosthetics with TrueLimb. This device combines 3D printing, smart sensors and remote support to deliver a user-friendly solution. It's lightweight, strong, affordable and customizable. Most importantly, it brings freedom and functionality back to people who need it. TrueLimb proves that cutting-edge technology can be both personal and practical.",

      "A man checking his emails on his laptop.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why these retirement scams feel so real",
      "Scammers now buy your personal data from data brokers to craft convincing offers. If you're in your 50s or 60s, you're a prime target. They know your age, homeownership status, estimated net worth and even retirement timeline. They don't guess, they know. Your information is being sold across hundreds of websites, and thousands of people can access it. Curious about how exposed you are?",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "What is a \"pre-qualified\" retirement scam?",
      "These scams mimic real communications from financial institutions. You might get a letter or call claiming you're approved for a new investment or annuity opportunity. Scammers often use financial buzzwords like \"IRA consolidation\" or \"required minimum distribution guidance.\" The goal? To make you feel like you're dealing with a trusted expert. They create fake advisor profiles, complete with headshots, license numbers and U.S. contact info. Many even add logos or branding from familiar banks to boost credibility. But once you respond, they'll ask for private financial info or, worse, get you to transfer funds directly into their accounts.",

You could appear on lists labeled \"Retirees with $250k+ Net Worth\" or \"Homeowners Nearing Retirement.\" It's disturbingly precise. Some brokers scrape public records, while others buy data from loyalty cards, surveys or sweepstakes. Bottom line: this happens quietly, behind your back.",
      "The financial toll of these scams",
      "In 2024, the FBI reported that seniors lost over $4.8 billion to scams, a record high. Retirement-related fraud was a major part of that. Once your money is gone, it's usually gone for good. Even if the scammer misled you, your bank may not cover the loss if you authorized the transaction. These scams drain more than just savings. They create lasting stress, fear and shame.

    "summary": "President Donald Trump has campaigned for a Nobel Peace Prize, pitching himself as a \"peacemaker\" as he heads into a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the Ukraine war.",
    "story": [
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska \u2014 Toward the end of Donald Trump\u2019s first term, his national security adviser turned to him in the Oval Office and said he should win the Nobel Peace Prize for his work normalizing relations between Israel and some Arab states.",
      "Another aide chimed in, saying the last president, Barack Obama, had won the award \u201cfor nothing.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s attitude was, \u2018Whatever,\u2019\u201d recalled the adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, in an interview. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t concerned about the recognition.\u201d",
      "Any whiff of indifference is now gone. Back in office, Trump and his aides are intensifying a public campaign to snag the award, citing a string of peace deals while making a case that snubbing him again would be an injustice.",
      "Day by day, the White House is amplifying Trump's role in curbing hostilities and putting out the message that this most combative of presidents is at heart a \"peacemaker.\"",
      "Aides have highlighted his role in settling disputes between Israel and Iran, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Cambodia and Thailand, and Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, promoting \"worldwide calls\" from the heads of several of those nations for Trump to win the peace prize.",
      "Trump is also touting his efforts to end a worrying conflict between two nuclear-armed combatants, India and Pakistan. He suggested he used trade as an inducement to stop the fighting, though an Indian official has denied that Trump's mediation made any difference.",
      "Speaking last month, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the president has \u201cbrokered, on average, about one peace deal or ceasefire per month during his six months in office. It\u2019s well past time that President Trump was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d she added.",
      "A difference between this term and the last is that now, \u201che actually wants it,\" a senior official in Trump\u2019s first term said about the Nobel Peace Prize, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t just want to talk about it.\u201d",
      "Now comes his best shot. On Friday, Trump will fly to Alaska for a sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin aimed at ending a war with Ukraine that has produced close to 1.5 million casualties on both sides.",
      "The odds of a breakthrough are tough, but if Trump brokers a truce on terms that are fair to Ukraine, that would be a diplomatic triumph that eluded both Obama and President Joe Biden.",
      "In the run-up to the summit, the Nobel prize has appeared to be top of mind in Trump's circle. Without prompting, Leavitt  portrayed Trump as deserving of the prize in three out of her four press briefings in July. In prior months, she hadn\u2019t brought up the award.",
      "Trump has posted about the prize a total of seven times on his social media site since his second term began, six of them in June and July. A theme of his is that while he\u2019s earned the accolade, he won\u2019t win it.",
      "\u201cThe president feels that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, but does not think he will get it,\u201d a White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe has remarked that it will go to someone who writes a book about how Donald Trump thinks rather than Donald Trump himself.\u201d",
      "In a visit to the White House in April, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re was asked about Trump\u2019s prospects of winning the award, announced annually in Oslo.",
      "He didn\u2019t bite.",
      "\u201cOn that prize, that is a committee taking care of that which is completely working on its own terms and I cannot comment on that,\u201d St\u00f8re said.",
      "Trump smiled and looked across the Cabinet Room table at the prime minister: \u201cI like that question,\u201d he said.",
      "The award is solely in the hands of the Nobel selection committee; politicians don\u2019t pick the winner. But Trump has reportedly raised the issue with Norway before. Last month, he called the country\u2019s finance minister, former NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, to talk tariffs and brought up the peace prize, a Norwegian news outlet wrote Thursday.",
      "The White House official said that the president and Stoltenberg did speak, but could not say that the conversation was focused on the prize. Stoltenberg\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump is surrounded by reminders of past presidents who\u2019ve won what is arguably humanity\u2019s most prestigious award. Obama, whose portrait hangs in the White House, won it less than a year into his presidency and even he acknowledged at the time that his accomplishments were \u201cslight\u201d in contrast to other Nobel laureates.",
      "Just a few paces from the Oval Office, Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s Nobel Prize is on display, signifying both the challenge and opportunity that Trump faces. Roosevelt won in 1906 for bringing an end to another Russian conflict: a war with Japan.",
      "As much as he aligns himself politically with working Americans, Trump has long been attuned to elite opinion. He takes pride in recounting that his late uncle, John Trump, taught at the acclaimed Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has described his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, as \u201cthe hardest school to get into, the best school in the world.\u201d",
      "In announcing the Kennedy Center honorees on Wednesday, Trump said that he had long wanted one for himself. The president now plans to host the Kennedy Center Honors this year, teasing to reporters, \"maybe ... next year we\u2019ll honor Trump.\"",
      "A Nobel Peace Prize would be the ultimate validation.",
      "\"If the Israel-Hamas/Iran and Russia-Ukraine conflicts get resolved, there\u2019s no way that they can\u2019t give President Trump the Nobel Peace Prize,\" O'Brien said.",
      "\u201cThe Nobel committee may not like Trump,\" he added. \"They may not like his personality. They may not like his populism, but if the award has any meaning, they have to give it to him.\u201d",
      "Of course, the Nobel selection committee has its own ideas about what it takes to win. The five-member body appointed by the Norwegian parliament may be weighing other criteria apart from the peace deals the White House has tallied.",
      "In his will, Alfred Nobel stated that the prize should go to those \u201cwho shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations.\u201d",
      "Since Trump took office, some longtime U.S. allies have seen fraternal bonds fray. Trump has rolled out stiff tariffs in pursuit of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda meant to create more jobs at home. He stunned various world capitals with his calls for acquiring Greenland, Canada and the Panama Canal.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize has become something of a joke in foreign capitals,\u201d a former British diplomat said. \u201cHis claims to Canada, Panama, Greenland, etc., as well as tariff wars and the assaults on America\u2019s democratic institutions, incline governments in the opposite direction.\u201d",
      "What happens in the Nobel committee\u2019s closed-door deliberations is a closely guarded secret. The panel accepts nominations through the end of January and announces the winner in October. It waits 50 years before revealing even a list of nominees.",
      "Handicapping possible winners of the 2025 prize, a Norwegian think tank didn\u2019t mention Trump\u2019s name. The handful of front-runners the group cited included \u201cSudan\u2019s Emergency Response Rooms,\u201d the prime minister of Qatar, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, and the Women\u2019s International League for Peace & Freedom.",
      "It\u2019s far from clear that the Nobel committee is susceptible to persuasion. Pressure, publicity and coalition-building work in politics, the arena Trump knows well. But the Nobel committee is insulated from that world.",
      "The prize \u201cis not something you campaign for,\u201d a Western diplomat said. \u201cThis is a decision made by people who are independent and have their own point of view. You can\u2019t buy it. Norway doesn\u2019t need the money.\u201d",
      "Last week, Trump held a meeting at the White House with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan to mark a rapprochement between the two countries. Questioned by a reporter, both leaders plumped for Trump\u2019s Nobel candidacy.",
      "Nikol Pashinyan, prime minister of Armenia, said, \u201cWe will promote for that.\u201d",
      "Turning to Trump, he said, \u201cHopefully you will invite us\u201d to the award ceremony.",
      "\u201cFront row,\u201d Trump said."

    "story": [
      "What does a donut tell us about the state of the economy?",
      "Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee thought about that Wednesday as he toured Mel-O-Cream Donuts in Springfield, Illinois.",
      "Even inside a donut shop, the effects of tariffs on the economy can be seen. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of surprising, because donuts seem like a very local product, and yet they get some ingredients like palm oil that are coming from Indonesia,\u201d Goolsbee said. The Trump administration set tariffs on Indonesia at 19%.",
      "\u201cThey have to now figure out what are the tariff rates, and the tariffs went up a significant amount. If that happens, that could have a multi-thousand-dollar impact on their operation,\u201d he continued. But, he added, \u201cI hope it\u2019s not a sign of something more extended or broader in the way that the Covid inflation ... generated its own snowballing, in which it was supposed to go away and it didn\u2019t go away.\u201d",
      "That tariff will cost Chris Larson, a co-owner of Mel-O-Cream, \u201cabout $4,000 per shipment per week,\u201d he said. And that used to be somewhere \u201ccloser to $2,000 to $2,100 weekly. Now it\u2019s going to move up to $4,200 ... for the exact same product.\u201d",
      "Goolsbee\u2019s visit matters because he\u2019s one of just 12 people in the country who get to decide what to do with interest rates. The Fed\u2019s rate-setting committee will next decide whether to cut or hold on Sept. 17, and the perspectives of businesses like Mel-O-Cream are instrumental in helping him determine his next vote.",
      "Larson\u2019s hope? That the Fed will cut interest rates, which would help Mel-O-Cream finance new equipment to cut costs in labor and blunt the impact of tariffs.",
      "\u201cWhat is the cost of money in order to expand, to upgrade, to update? What do those things look like?\u201d Larson said. \u201cThose things do concern us, and we would love to see, as everyone would, the interest rates would come down.\u201d",
      "Goolsbee said he wasn\u2019t yet ready to tie his hands to an interest rate cut in September.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s get a few months of data before we make any conclusions. The hardest thing that the Fed ever has to do is get the timing right at moments of transition,\u201d he said Wednesday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cHere\u2019s the Scoop\u201d podcast. \u201cI think as we go through this fall, September, November, December, all of those are live moments that we could be cutting rates.\u201d",
      "Government data Thursday showed that wholesale prices paid by U.S. companies rose much more than expected. Another measure, the consumer price index, showed Tuesday that inflation remained stubbornly high in July.",
      "The Fed\u2019s target for inflation is 2%, lower than the most recent consumer inflation reading of 2.7% and producer inflation reading of 3.3%. Even with those numbers, the market still anticipates a cut next month.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs on hundreds of trading partners around the world could affect the cost of most of the imports that businesses buy from overseas. With a myriad of rates as high as 50%, businesses may be faced with a new maze of rates and tariff bills, as well as the uncertainty that comes with the on-again, off-again tariff rollout.",
      "\u201cThe Fed, by law, is supposed to maximize employment and stabilize prices. So it\u2019s inflation and employment that are really the twin towers of how we think about setting of rates,\u201d Goolsbee said, underscoring the Federal Reserve\u2019s role in the broader economy.",
      "\u201cThere are parts of the job market where there\u2019s still basically labor shortages. It\u2019s very hard for people to find workers. And that\u2019s what you kind of saw here at the donut factory,\u201d he said.",
      "Goolsbee oversees the Seventh Federal Reserve District, which includes Iowa, much of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin.",
      "Some of his colleagues, including Jeffrey Schmid, of the Kansas City Fed; Alberto Musalem, of the St. Louis Fed; and Beth Hammack, of the Cleveland Fed, are sounding similarly cautious tones about the economy. All three current Federal Open Market Committee voters have said in recent days that it\u2019s either too early to decide or that keeping rates steady for now would be their preference.",
      "The futures market predicts the Fed will cut by 0.25% at its next meeting. But some, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, think the Fed should make a more dramatic cut, by up to a half-point.",
      "Musalem said Wednesday on CNBC that a cut that large would be \u201cunsupported by the current state of the economy.\u201d",
      "Amid unrelenting attacks from Trump and his administration against the FOMC and Chair Jerome Powell, Goolsbee, who was an economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said economic indicators should drive monetary policymaking, not politics.",
      "\u201cThe FOMC and my own thinking are that what should drive interest rate decisions should be the economic conditions and the economic outlook,\u201d he said. \u201cI invite anybody to look at the minutes or read the transcripts of the FOMC \u2014 the people on that body take extremely seriously that it is the economy that should drive the decisions. And that is what drives the decisions.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a committee made up of people from a lot of different perspectives. And as I say, they keep track of, word for word, what everyone says at the meetings. And you can look at it yourself.\u201d"

      "A rush of glacial floodwater swept down Alaska\u2019s Mendenhall River on Wednesday morning, prompting evacuation warnings in parts of Juneau, seeping through flood barriers and flowing into a few neighborhoods.",
      "The floodwaters, which broke through a dam of glacial ice, are an example of how gradual shifts to the climate are sometimes punctuated by sudden drama that can rapidly reshape a landscape.",
      "Last year, hundreds of homes were flooded in Juneau when the river released a glacial outburst flood.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t know it was coming,\u201d said Elizabeth Startz, a Juneau resident whose home was flooded last year. \u201cIt did it overnight and neighbors were knocking on our windows and saying \u2018Get out.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cWe came from Texas, and we moved here to be away from hurricanes and flooding,\u201d Startz said Tuesday, before floodwaters crested. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to do this year after year after year.\u201d",
      "Historically, glacial outburst floods are not infrequent in Alaska, and most take place far away from communities like Juneau or critical infrastructure in the vast, sparsely populated state.",
      "As the climate warms and destabilizes systems in parts of Alaska, experts said the threat from this type of flooding is not becoming more common, in part because glaciers are retreating. Instead, areas under threat are shifting, catching at least one community by surprise so far.",
      "\u201cFor every one that has started forming, there\u2019s one that has disappeared because the glacier no longer dams at that location,\u201d Mauri Pelto, a glaciologist and professor of environmental science at Nichols College, said of glacier-dammed lakes.",
      "The Mendenhall Glacier has produced yearly glacial outburst events since 2011, but most have been less significant than this year or last.",

      "In an interview on Fox News, Bondi previewed an order by the Justice Department naming DEA head Terry Cole as \"emergency police commissioner\" of the Metropolitan Police Department, days after President Donald Trump directed the federal government to take control of the local police and deployed the National Guard in an effort to mitigate crime in the nation's capital.",
      "\"Effective immediately, Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terrence C. Cole shall serve as MPD\u2019s Emergency Police Commissioner for the duration of the emergency declared by the President. Commissioner Cole shall assume all of the powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police,\" the order from the attorney general's office read.",

      "Adults can pose as children, according to the suit, and kids can bypass controls meant for users under 13.",
      "Launched in 2006, Roblox has a sprawling catalogue of games and \"experiences,\" many of which are designed by users and include real-time messaging. According to the company's 2024-25 annual report, 20% of the platform's 82 million active users were under age 9, the lawsuit says.",

      "The suit, which alleges unfair trade practices, negligence and unjust enrichment, does not specify damages but seeks a permanent order barring Roblox from violating the state\u2019s unfair trade practices act or promoting its safety features as adequate, which the suit says it routinely does.",
      "A spokesperson for Roblox declined to comment on the allegations, citing pending litigation, but said it dedicates \"substantial resources\" to help \"detect and prevent inappropriate content and behavior, including attempts to direct users off platform, where safety standards and moderation may be less stringent than ours.\"",
      "\"While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous technology and enforcement safeguards, including restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing,\" the spokesperson said. \"The safety of our community is a top priority.\"",
      "In November, the platform announced a series of safety measures that barred users under age 13 from sending direct messages and included new content categories to help determine what is age-appropriate for users.",
      "Those measures were rolled out the month after New York-based analyst Hindenburg Research called Roblox an \u201cX-rated pedophile hellscape, exposing children to grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech.\u201d",
      "Roblox denied the claim, saying in a statement that the analyst\u2019s report was misleading and citing what it described as significant investment in trust and safety measures.",
      "Thursday's lawsuit described the company's recent safety measures as \u201ctoo little, too late, and woefully inadequate.\u201d"

      "A long-shuttered federal task force on childhood vaccine safety is being revived, the Department of Health and Human Services announced Thursday.",
      "HHS said in a statement that it is reinstating the Task Force on Safer Childhood Vaccines, which disbanded in 1998, \u201cto improve the safety, quality, and oversight of vaccines administered to American children.\u201d",
      "Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, will be chairman. Other members of the task force will include Susan Monarez, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Marty Makary, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson. Nixon said additional members will be announced in the future.",
      "Dr. Howard Koh, a public health professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said: \u201cEveryone wants childhood vaccines to be as safe as possible. But reviving this panel now must be put in the context of recent HHS actions.\u201d",
      "Many public health experts have accused HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of pursuing an aggressive anti-vaccine agenda as health secretary. Since he assumed office in February, he has cut $2 billion from a program that supports vaccines for vulnerable children, downplayed the importance of measles vaccines amid a record-breaking outbreak and cut $500 million in contracts for mRNA vaccine research.",
      "In June, Kennedy fired members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) \u2014 medical and public health experts who make recommendations to the CDC about who should get certain vaccines \u2014 and replaced them with well-known vaccine skeptics or critics of Covid vaccines. The new committee chair, Martin Kulldorff, said the committee will form two work groups, one to scrutinize the childhood vaccination schedule and another to re-evaluate vaccines that haven\u2019t been reviewed in more than seven years.",
      "The Task Force on Safer Childhood Vaccines was formed in 1986 as part of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which aimed to compensate the small number of children who had adverse reactions to vaccines and address growing threats of litigation over vaccine injuries.",
      "A lawsuit filed in May claims Kennedy violated the 1986 act by failing to establish a task force dedicated to making childhood vaccines safer. The suit is funded by Children\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group Kennedy founded. Mary Holland, the group\u2019s CEO, praised Kennedy on Thursday for fulfilling his obligation.",
      "\u201cAt last the Secretary is following the law on this critical issue. We are grateful,\u201d Holland said in a statement on X.",
      "The task force will work closely with the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, which provides recommendations to the HHS secretary about how to implement a national compensation program for childhood vaccine injuries. According to HHS, the groups will give regular advice about how to improve adverse reaction reporting and develop childhood vaccines that result in fewer and less serious adverse reactions.",
      "Vaccine injuries are extremely rare, and the United States has robust systems for detecting adverse reactions, including the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, Vaccine Safety Datalink and V-safe. Before vaccines ever reach the market, clinical trials look for safety concerns and pause if any major issues arise. Then independent advisory committees to the FDA and the CDC evaluate the safety data and issue recommendations about which vaccines to approve and who should get them.",
      "But Kennedy has repeatedly said the federal government isn\u2019t doing enough to monitor for vaccine side effects.",
      "\u201cAt least once a week, he comes up with a new zinger seeking to discredit vaccines, and it\u2019s very dangerous,\u201d said Dr. Peter Hotez, a co-director of the Texas Children\u2019s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development.",
      "Hotez said it\u2019s unclear why Kennedy would revive a task force on childhood vaccine safety, given that the current system has a proven track record of picking up on rare adverse events.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s the point now, other than he\u2019ll use it as a bully pulpit to push his MAHA, anti-vaccine agenda? That\u2019s the worry,\u201d Hotez said.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s he going to put on this committee?\u201d he added. \u201cWill it be like ACIP, where he starts to stack it with anti-vaccine activists?\u201d"

    "summary": "The FDA warned about unapproved thyroid pills made from pig tissue, but then said it would ensure access to animal-derived thyroid medications.",
    "story": [
      "An unusual about-face that played out at the Food and Drug Administration over the last week illustrated the power of the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, particularly with its focus on \u201cnatural\u201d drugs.",
      "Last Thursday, the agency published a statement saying it had concerns about the safety and effectiveness of unapproved thyroid medications made from animal tissue after it received complaints from patients and reports of adverse events. As a result, the FDA said it had notified drugmakers of its \u201cintent to take action\u201d against the products, but added that it wouldn't do so immediately to give patients time to switch medications.",
      "\u201cThe agency urges patients taking these unapproved animal-derived thyroid medications to treat hypothyroidism to talk to their doctor,\u201d it wrote.",
      "The statement in and of itself was nothing surprising. Warnings about unapproved drugs are standard fare for the FDA. What followed also wasn\u2019t unheard of: social media backlash.",
      "But on Wednesday evening, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary seemingly reversed course, writing in a post on X that the FDA was committed to pursuing the first-ever approval of desiccated thyroid extract, pending results of the ongoing clinical trials. \u201cIn the mean time, we will ensure access for all Americans,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Five minutes later, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. responded. \u201cLove your approach of using gold standard science and common sense, @DrMarkaryFDA,\u201d Kennedy wrote.",
      "So, what was this all about?",
      "Animal-derived thyroid pills",
      "The thyroid \u2014 a small, butterfly-shaped gland located at the front of the neck \u2014 helps regulate how the body uses energy by producing thyroid hormones. When it doesn\u2019t produce enough, it can lead to hypothyroidism, which can cause symptoms including unexplained weight gain, tiredness, sensitivity to cold, changes in menstrual cycles and symptoms of depression and anxiety, according to the Mayo Clinic. The condition is more common in women than men.",
      "The standard treatment is prescription thyroid hormone replacement therapy \u2014 basically, taking pills that contain the needed thyroid hormones. Typically one of two synthetic hormones, levothyroxine or liothyronine, or a combination of both, are prescribed.",
      "Some patients, however, turn to animal-derived thyroid pills either because they don\u2019t respond well to the synthetic versions or want to take something marketed as natural, said Dr. Michael Weintraub, an endocrinologist at \u200b\u200bNYU Langone Health in New York City.",
      "The pills \u2014 which aren\u2019t FDA-approved \u2014 are made from dried thyroid glands, usually from pigs, and are sold under brand names like Armour Thyroid, NP Thyroid, Nature-Thyroid and Natural Thyroid, according to the agency.",
      "About 1.5 million people in the U.S. were prescribed animal-derived thyroid pills in 2024, the FDA said.",
      "In the FDA statement warning against the animal-derived drugs, the agency said they may contain impurities that could result in infections and could also contain inconsistent levels of thyroid hormones, another risk for patients. Taking too much can cause unwanted effects, the FDA said, and too little could not be effective.",
      "The backlash",
      "In the days that followed the FDA\u2019s statement, patients and doctors took to social media to voice their opposition.",
      "\u201cBREAKING FDA set to BAN natural desiccated thyroid medications. Millions rely on these for hypothyroidism who don\u2019t respond well to synthetic thyroid pharmaceuticals,\u201d read one post from Will Cole, a functional medicine doctor. \u201cLet your voice be heard. The FDA needs to change course on this one.\u201d",
      "Dave Asprey, the founder of Bulletproof Coffee, a coffee and supplement brand, wrote: \u201cI found out I had very low thyroid levels in my mid-20s, and Hashimoto\u2019s. Normal synthetic thyroid drugs did not work. Natural thyroid extract worked very well and I have been taking it for more than 25 years without a problem.\u201d",
      "Dr. Robert Malone \u2014 an anti-vaccine activist who was recently appointed by Kennedy to a vaccine advisory panel \u2014 called the decision \u201cterrible news \u2014 particularly for postmenopausal women.\u201d He called on doctors and patients to contact the FDA in response.",
      "Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, did not respond to a question about whether Makary\u2019s post on Wednesday was in response to social media backlash.",
      "When asked about whether the FDA would still take action against unapproved thyroid products, Nixon referred NBC News to the agency\u2019s statement last week, which said, \u201cFDA is not taking immediate action against manufacturers who make unapproved animal-derived thyroid medication to give patients time to transition to an FDA-approved medication to treat their hypothyroidism.\u201d",
      "Nixon added that the agency \u201cwill share additional information as it becomes available and as clinical trial results are released.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unclear which ongoing trials Makary and Nixon were referring to. ClinicalTrials.gov lists a trial initiated by Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in 2012, but the trial\u2019s status is currently marked as \u201cunknown.\u201d Allergan, the maker of Armour Thyroid, completed a trial in 2021 comparing its product to levothyroxine, a synthetic thyroid hormone.",
      "So, are these pills safe?",
      "Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said the FDA was correct to issue its initial warning about the thyroid pills, noting that the animal-derived pills aren\u2019t regulated by the agency and can pose significant risks.",
      "The FDA-approved synthetic versions usually replace one of two thyroid hormones: T4, the main hormone the thyroid produces, or T3, the active form of T4 that helps regulate energy and metabolism. Companies that make FDA-approved drugs must follow certain regulations, including consistent dosing.",
      "The animal-derived versions also contain the thyroid hormones, just like prescription medications, Cohen said, but because they\u2019re unregulated, the amount they contain can be all over the place.",
      "\u201cGetting too much or too little thyroid hormone has long-term health risks,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you take too much, it can damage your bones, it can damage your heart. If you take too little, if you\u2019re not getting enough, a number of problems can occur too, including mood problems, like depression.\u201d",
      "Weintraub, of \u200b\u200bNYU Langone Health, said that tiny changes in thyroid hormone levels can have a big impact, so it\u2019s important to get the dosage right. He noted that pigs naturally have much higher levels of T3 than humans.",
      "\u201cIt can lead to heart rhythm disturbances, which can be life-threatening. It can lead to bone degradation, which can lead to broken bones,\u201d he said.",
      "Weintraub said he\u2019s had patients who took animal-derived thyroid pills who\u2019ve had issues with sleeping, had sensitivity to heat or developed osteoporosis.",
      "Dr. Susan Spratt, an endocrinologist and senior medical director for the Population Health Management Office at Duke Health in North Carolina, however, said that it would be unfair for the FDA to \u201csuddenly yank\u201d the animal-derived versions from the market \u201cwithout dedicated reasons that they are harmful.\u201d",
      "Spratt said that the animal-derived pills have been around for decades as a prescribable drug. (Weintraub said the animal-derived drugs were \u201cgrandfathered in,\u201d meaning they were already on the market before current FDA standards for safety were put into place.)",
      "While Spratt said she prefers to prescribe the FDA-approved synthetic versions, the animal-derived versions offer an option for people who don\u2019t respond well to the synthetic ones.",
      "\u201cI would welcome NIH funding on why some patients don\u2019t feel as good on T4-only products,\u201d she said.",
      "Weintraub said the synthetic versions don\u2019t \u201cnecessarily help everyone\u2019s symptoms, but there\u2019s a more precise and safer way of treating that than resorting to a pig or cow thyroids.\u201d",
      "He said patients who don\u2019t respond well to T4- or T3-only medications often do better on a combination of the two."

      "What does a donut tell us about the state of the economy?",
      "Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee thought about that Wednesday as he toured Mel-O-Cream Donuts in Springfield, Illinois.",
      "Even inside a donut shop, the effects of tariffs on the economy can be seen. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of surprising, because donuts seem like a very local product, and yet they get some ingredients like palm oil that are coming from Indonesia,\u201d Goolsbee said. The Trump administration set tariffs on Indonesia at 19%.",
      "\u201cThey have to now figure out what are the tariff rates, and the tariffs went up a significant amount. If that happens, that could have a multi-thousand-dollar impact on their operation,\u201d he continued. But, he added, \u201cI hope it\u2019s not a sign of something more extended or broader in the way that the Covid inflation ... generated its own snowballing, in which it was supposed to go away and it didn\u2019t go away.\u201d",
      "That tariff will cost Chris Larson, a co-owner of Mel-O-Cream, \u201cabout $4,000 per shipment per week,\u201d he said. And that used to be somewhere \u201ccloser to $2,000 to $2,100 weekly. Now it\u2019s going to move up to $4,200 ... for the exact same product.\u201d",
      "Goolsbee\u2019s visit matters because he\u2019s one of just 12 people in the country who get to decide what to do with interest rates. The Fed\u2019s rate-setting committee will next decide whether to cut or hold on Sept. 17, and the perspectives of businesses like Mel-O-Cream are instrumental in helping him determine his next vote.",
      "Larson\u2019s hope? That the Fed will cut interest rates, which would help Mel-O-Cream finance new equipment to cut costs in labor and blunt the impact of tariffs.",
      "\u201cWhat is the cost of money in order to expand, to upgrade, to update? What do those things look like?\u201d Larson said. \u201cThose things do concern us, and we would love to see, as everyone would, the interest rates would come down.\u201d",
      "Goolsbee said he wasn\u2019t yet ready to tie his hands to an interest rate cut in September.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s get a few months of data before we make any conclusions. The hardest thing that the Fed ever has to do is get the timing right at moments of transition,\u201d he said Wednesday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cHere\u2019s the Scoop\u201d podcast. \u201cI think as we go through this fall, September, November, December, all of those are live moments that we could be cutting rates.\u201d",
      "Government data Thursday showed that wholesale prices paid by U.S. companies rose much more than expected. Another measure, the consumer price index, showed Tuesday that inflation remained stubbornly high in July.",
      "The Fed\u2019s target for inflation is 2%, lower than the most recent consumer inflation reading of 2.7% and producer inflation reading of 3.3%. Even with those numbers, the market still anticipates a cut next month.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs on hundreds of trading partners around the world could affect the cost of most of the imports that businesses buy from overseas. With a myriad of rates as high as 50%, businesses may be faced with a new maze of rates and tariff bills, as well as the uncertainty that comes with the on-again, off-again tariff rollout.",
      "\u201cThe Fed, by law, is supposed to maximize employment and stabilize prices. So it\u2019s inflation and employment that are really the twin towers of how we think about setting of rates,\u201d Goolsbee said, underscoring the Federal Reserve\u2019s role in the broader economy.",
      "\u201cThere are parts of the job market where there\u2019s still basically labor shortages. It\u2019s very hard for people to find workers. And that\u2019s what you kind of saw here at the donut factory,\u201d he said.",
      "Goolsbee oversees the Seventh Federal Reserve District, which includes Iowa, much of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin.",
      "Some of his colleagues, including Jeffrey Schmid, of the Kansas City Fed; Alberto Musalem, of the St. Louis Fed; and Beth Hammack, of the Cleveland Fed, are sounding similarly cautious tones about the economy. All three current Federal Open Market Committee voters have said in recent days that it\u2019s either too early to decide or that keeping rates steady for now would be their preference.",
      "The futures market predicts the Fed will cut by 0.25% at its next meeting. But some, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, think the Fed should make a more dramatic cut, by up to a half-point.",
      "Musalem said Wednesday on CNBC that a cut that large would be \u201cunsupported by the current state of the economy.\u201d",
      "Amid unrelenting attacks from Trump and his administration against the FOMC and Chair Jerome Powell, Goolsbee, who was an economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said economic indicators should drive monetary policymaking, not politics.",
      "\u201cThe FOMC and my own thinking are that what should drive interest rate decisions should be the economic conditions and the economic outlook,\u201d he said. \u201cI invite anybody to look at the minutes or read the transcripts of the FOMC \u2014 the people on that body take extremely seriously that it is the economy that should drive the decisions. And that is what drives the decisions.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a committee made up of people from a lot of different perspectives. And as I say, they keep track of, word for word, what everyone says at the meetings. And you can look at it yourself.\u201d"

      "Day by day, the White House is amplifying Trump\u2019s role in curbing hostilities and putting out the message that this most combative of presidents is at heart a \u201cpeacemaker.\u201d",
      "Aides have highlighted his role in settling disputes between Israel and Iran, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Cambodia and Thailand, and Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, promoting \u201cworldwide calls\u201d from the heads of several of those countries for Trump to win the peace prize.",
      "Trump is also touting his efforts to end a worrying conflict between two nuclear-armed combatants, India and Pakistan. He suggested he used trade as an inducement to stop the fighting, though an Indian official has denied that Trump\u2019s mediation made any difference.",
      "Now comes his best shot. Tomorrow, Trump will fly to Alaska for a sit-down with Putin aimed at ending the war with Ukraine. The odds of a breakthrough are tough, but if Trump brokers a truce on terms that are fair to Ukraine, it would be a diplomatic triumph that eluded Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.",
      "In the run-up to the summit, the Nobel Prize has appeared to be top of mind in Trump\u2019s circle.

    "summary": "The Marlins spend only $69 million on its roster in 2025, the lowest in MLB. Yet since June, they are outplaying big spenders like the Yankees and Mets.",
    "story": [
      "After a loss to the Atlanta Braves on June 21, the Miami Marlins were 30-45, in last place in the National League East and 11 games behind the Milwaukee Brewers for the third and final wild card spot in the NL.",
      "Entering Thursday, the Marlins are 58-62, now in third place in their division and only six games out of a wild card spot with 52 games left in their season.",
      "That in and of itself is not remarkable, as teams get hot seemingly every summer in the majors. The Milwaukee Brewers, for example, have gone 51-16 since they were three games under .500 on May 24. But Miami was expected to be terrible this season.",
      "The Marlins won 62 games last season, and FanDuel Sportsbook set their over-under win total before the season at 63.5 games. On top of all that, Miami is by far the cheapest team in MLB, spending only $69 million on its roster in 2025, the only team under $70 million. (The Marlins\u2019 payroll is between one-fifth and one-sixth of what the Los Angeles Dodgers are paying their team this year and only $10 million more than the Golden State Warriors will pay Stephen Curry next season in the NBA.)",
      "Despite the team\u2019s paltry payroll, Miami outperformed many of the league\u2019s highest spenders during its midseason turnaround.",
      "From June 22 through Wednesday, the Marlins went 28-17 \u2014 recording more wins in that time frame than the Dodgers, the New York Mets, the New York Yankees and the Philadelphia Phillies, the four teams with the highest payrolls in MLB.",
      "Among the reasons for Miami\u2019s resurgence has been a better-than-expected offense. The Marlins rank sixth in the NL in batting average and seventh in both slugging and OPS.",
      "The biggest surprise has been left fielder Kyle Stowers, who has hit .286 with 25 home runs and 72 runs batted in. Stowers ranks eighth among all major leaguers in OPS, and his 3.5 wins above replacement are higher than those of players such as Mookie Betts, Bryce Harper and Rafael Devers.",
      "\u201cI am proud of how well we are competing day in and day out,\u201d Miami\u2019s president of baseball operations, Peter Bendix, told MLB.com in late June. \u201cWe are in every game. We\u2019re playing well against good teams, and we\u2019re showing improvement and progress in individual players at the same time.\u201d",
      "Marlins manager Clayton McCullough echoed that sentiment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been on a steady climb, slow climb, at times, but I think we just got so hyperfocused on what we needed to do to win games,\u201d McCullough said after the Marlins completed a three-game sweep of the Yankees on Aug. 3.",
      "The win that day gave Miami a 55-55 record, making them the first team to go from 16 games under .500 to .500 in the same season in more than 10 years, according to MLB.com.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fun,\u201d rookie outfielder Jakob Marsee said after he recorded seven RBIs in a 13-4 win over the Cleveland Guardians on Wednesday.",
      "Marsee, who was called up to the team at the beginning of the month, has been one of the Marlins\u2019 hottest hitters since he made his MLB debut.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been more than I could ask for, and I just want to keep going and keep playing with these guys and just keep winning,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I really care about.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "When John Karadell was admitted to the hospital after a stroke, his doctors quickly pushed for him to begin an intensive form of rehabilitation \u2014 the sooner the better.",
      "\u201cAlmost immediately they started telling me that the No. 1 most important thing now is to as quickly as possible get me into what they call acute rehab,\u201d said Karadell, 58, of Howell, Michigan. \u201cThey used words like, \u2018This is crucial. This is essential to your recovery.\u2019\u201d",
      "But after 11 days in a hospital bed with no word on when he\u2019d be transferred to the facility, Karadell said he learned his health insurer, Aetna, had denied coverage for what\u2019s known as acute post-stroke rehabilitation.",
      "What followed was a weekslong back-and-forth between Aetna and the hospital, University Hospital in Ann Arbor \u2014 including phone calls, bureaucratic delays and miscommunication, according to a Michigan Medicine spokesperson, an Aetna spokesperson and hospital case notes reviewed by NBC News.",
      "More than a month after Karadell\u2019s stroke, he said he essentially gave up and left the hospital to go to a less-intensive rehab program, a downgrade from what his care team consistently recommended throughout his hospital stay.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m left with what I believe is permanent damage,\u201d Karadell said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m left to wonder: Could it have been different if they would have approved what they should have done?\u201d",
      "In a statement, an Aetna spokesperson said the circumstances surrounding Karadell\u2019s denied claim are \u201ccomplex\u201d and the insurer\u2019s ability to process claims and appeals is \u201cdependent on the timeliness and comprehensiveness of the information we receive from the provider.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe understand the frustration whenever there is a health care process that is complicated or does not meet a member\u2019s expectations,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cEven though the vast majority of experiences are managed smoothly, our company strives to partner with healthcare providers to make sure each member receives what\u2019s expected every time.\u201d",
      "The spokesperson added, \u201cas we are not in the hospital with this patient, we expect our providers to partner with us and play an active role in conveying important clinical information to us that we would not otherwise have.\u201d",
      "Karadell\u2019s experience, however, is far from unique: A nationwide survey of more than 1,300 insured adults found over a third \u2014 36% \u2014 had had at least one claim denial, said Miranda Yaver, an assistant professor in the department of health policy and management at the University of Pittsburgh who conducted the survey. Almost 60% of those patients, she said, went on to have the same claim denied multiple times. Half of the people who were denied ended up postponing their care.",
      "If you are dealing with bills that seem to be out of line or a denial of coverage, care or repairs, whether for health, home or auto, please email us at Costofdenial@nbcuni.com.",
      "What appears to have happened to Karadell can be best described as \u201crationing care by inconvenience,\u201d said Yaver, who wasn\u2019t involved with Karadell\u2019s case.",
      "It\u2019s a tactic, she believes, that health insurers use to limit spending. By making the process of getting coverage difficult \u2014 either through paperwork, repeated denials or a complex appeal process \u2014 they count on doctors and patients giving up.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that you\u2019re never going to get the approval, but it ends up being this endurance contest and administrative burden,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really overwhelming, especially because when we\u2019re navigating these things, it\u2019s not on our best day, it\u2019s on our worst.\u201d",
      "\u2018Discharge has been delayed\u2019",
      "Some form of rehab is recommended for all patients after a stroke, according to the American Stroke Association.",
      "The program recommended for Karadell \u2014 known as acute post-stroke rehabilitation \u2014 is typically for patients who still have significant difficulties, such as trouble walking, feeding themselves or bathing but are medically stable enough to tolerate therapy, said Dr. Nneka Ifejika, chief scientific officer at Ochsner Health System in New Orleans and an ASA national volunteer expert. Ifejika was not involved in Karadell\u2019s care.",
      "In a hospital note dated June 8, 2024, two days after he was admitted, Karadell was described as still having significant difficulty getting dressed, bathing, brushing his teeth and using the bathroom on his own. He also required some help eating meals. He had dizziness and intense pain in his neck. His wife, Emily Steiner, also said he had vision and speech problems. The note said he was doing well with the therapy he was getting at the hospital but recommended a more intensive program.",
      "\u201cProgressing well in therapy, will greatly benefit from multidisciplinary rehab at IPR [inpatient post-acute rehabilitation] to facilitate maximal independence in ADLs [activities of daily living] and functional mobility prior to return home,\u201d the note said.",
      "Ifejika said that it\u2019s critically important for stroke patients to start rehab as early as possible because delays can lead to worse health outcomes, including long-term disability.",
      "The longer a stroke patient is bedridden, the more their physical ability and mobility decline, she said. Extensive stays in the hospital can also lead to increased risk of falls or getting an infection, she said. (In Karadell\u2019s case, his wife said, it also took a mental toll, as he had trouble sleeping due to noise and patients sharing the room.)",
      "Ifejika said she typically starts patients in rehab within two to three days of a stroke. \u201cThey go directly from the hospital to the rehab facility, whether it be a freestanding rehab facility or a hospital-based rehab facility,\u201d she said.",
      "The hospital spokesperson said the hospital\u2019s admissions coordination submitted a prior authorization request for Karadell\u2019s intensive rehab on June 12.",
      "On June 17, Aetna denied the coverage, saying that clinical documentation hadn\u2019t been submitted, the hospital spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that the insurer did not offer an opportunity for a hospital physician to speak to a doctor from the insurance company about the request, a process known as a peer-to-peer review. An Aetna spokesperson said it would have provided a peer-to-peer review if the hospital had requested it.",
      "The hospital submitted an expedited appeal that day, the hospital spokesperson and Steiner said. An Aetna spokesperson said the hospital\u2019s appeal was not submitted as \u201cexpedited.\u201d",
      "That same day, a hospital note said that Karadell was \u201csignificantly below baseline of function,\u201d adding: \u201cRecommend IPR to progress independence in ADLs.\u201d In a second note also dated June 17, a doctor wrote: \u201cToday, discussed with patient will continue to work on IPR admission. He states he is frustrated with how long it has taken but hoping to begin therapies soon.\u201d",
      "One week later, however, Karadell was still in the hospital. \u201cDischarge has been delayed by rejected insurance authorization despite our strong medical recommendation for discharge to IPR,\u201d a doctor wrote in a June 24 note.",
      "Two days later, on June 26, a hospital note said: \u201cHe and wife continue to voice their frustration regarding the insurance-related delays.\u201d",
      "In the days that followed, the hospital said Aetna denied the approval for a second time.",
      "Subacute care",
      "On June 30, nearly 30 days after Karadell\u2019s stroke,  Aetna said it approved the intensive rehab, but the hospital spokesperson said they didn\u2019t receive the approval until July 5, a Friday. That Monday, the hospital said it contacted Aetna to confirm the approval but learned it had expired the day before. At that point, Karadell gave up and opted to get less intensive rehab closer to home \u2014 an option that his care team had been considering as a backup and had already been authorized.  (Aetna said it had canceled the intensive rehab approval because of the hospital\u2019s request to send Karadell to a less-intensive program, as the two requests were mutually exclusive.)",
      "Ifejika said that so-called subacute care, which is often provided at an outside facility, such as a nursing home or assisted living facility, is easier to get insurance approval for because it\u2019s less expensive.",
      "However, she added, studies show it comes with a higher risk of hospital readmission compared to acute rehab.",
      "\u201cSending them to a skilled nursing facility is actually doing them a disservice,\u201d she said.",
      "Steiner said the assisted living facility Karadell went to only had a part-time physical therapist, and he was doing less rehab than he had been doing at the hospital.",
      "At one point, he said, he needed help getting up to use the bathroom but couldn\u2019t get assistance and ended up falling.",
      "\u201cThat was quite frankly awful,\u201d Steiner said. \u201cNone of this I knew at the time, really how significant of a difference it was going to be.\u201d",
      "Karadell left the facility after about two weeks. Though he could have stayed longer, \u201cI wanted to go home so desperately,\u201d he said.",
      "Karadell was also left with a bill for more than $150,000 marked \u201cpending\u201d in his hospital file, the result of his extended stay. When NBC News recently asked the hospital about the bill, a spokesperson said it had been going back and forth with Aetna over how much would be covered. Aetna paid around $37,000 and the hospital wrote off the rest.",
      "Prior authorization",
      "Health insurers have pledged to take steps to streamline the often-criticized prior authorization process for approving claims.",
      "In June, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the country\u2019s largest health insurers had promised to take steps to reform prior authorization, including quicker approvals and reducing the number of medical services subject to the rule.",
      "Health insurers have made similar commitments in the past, including in 2018 and again in 2023. Many failed to implement such reforms.",
      "Dr. Adam Gaffney, a critical care physician and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, said more fundamental reform, likely from Congress, will be needed to address the health care barriers imposed by insurance companies.",
      "Yaver, of the University of Pittsburgh, said many doctors \u2014 and patients \u2014 agree that reform is needed.",
      "In more than 100 interviews with doctors, Yaver said many had stated that the prior authorization process had gotten more difficult over the years, not easier.",
      "\u201cOn the physician side, this requires a lot of time and staffing,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of them attribute this to contributing to burnout.\u201d",
      "On the patient side it \u201cdestabilizes their health and economic lives,\u201d she added.",
      "Karadell \u2014 who says he still has numbness in his legs, back, face and feet and struggles with simple tasks, like climbing stairs and reaching for the remote \u2014 said the experience \u201cchanged my life forever.\u201d",
      "\u201cI always have to watch my step,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I leave the house and I go to the store or to go get something to eat, I have to watch the ground because I\u2019m scared of falling.\u201d"

    "summary": "Mousse sunscreen may feel nice going on, but the FDA says the formula doesn\u2019t comply with federal laws",
    "story": [
      "Wearing sunscreen is non-negotiable. Experts have told us over and over that applying it daily can lower your risk of developing skin cancer and prevent early signs of aging. And while there are some rules around the type of sunscreens that are best \u2014 like you should opt for a SPF 30 or higher \u2014 other things are generally thought to be dependent on personal preference. For example, some people may prefer a mineral option, while others like a chemical sunscreen. Formula consistency is another thing that has always been thought to be up to preference \u2014 silky serum, creamy lotion, whatever.",
      "But the US Food and Drug Administration just issued warnings to several popular sunscreen brands, suggesting that there is one type of sunscreen that is better left on the shelf. These brands all sell trendy mousse sunscreens (also called whipped sunscreen), and the FDA says this specific type of formulation may not be safe. Below, everything you need to know about this warning.",
      "Why is the FDA issuing warnings about mousse sunscreen?",
      "Whipped sunscreens from brands like Supergoop! and Vacation Inc. have been one of the trendier beauty products of the summer. But the FDA is letting consumers know that they should proceed with caution. On August 12, they posted a message on X that said, \u201cBeware of sunscreen products in mousse form because they might not be effective. The FDA issued five warning letters to companies marketing sunscreen products in mousse form.\u201d",
      "The FDA explained that regulations allow brands to market sunscreens as creams, lotions, sticks, sprays and a few other formulations \u2014 but they do not allow for mousse or whipped formulations. They also said that certain companies have created bottles that look like cans of whipped cream, which can put consumers at risk if ingested.",
      "The brands that received warning letters are Supergoop!, Vacation Inc., Kalani Sunwear, Fallian Cosmeceuticals (TiZo brand) and K & Care Organics. These letters don\u2019t necessarily mean the mousse sunscreens produced by these brands are unsafe. The FDA just requires that any new form is required to have sufficient data proving they are safe and effective \u2014 and those things haven\u2019t been submitted.",
      "The brands have 15 working days to respond. If they fail to comply, it is possible that the products could be pulled from the market.",
      "Other sunscreens we love",
      "The coming weeks will be very telling when it comes to mousse sunscreens and whether or not these companies address the concerns raised by the FDA. Until then, it may be a smarter move to stick to formulations not under attack by the FDA. Below, a few sunscreen options that have been recommended to us previously by experts or NBC Select staffers.",

      "During the activity, someone ran onto the 210 Freeway, he said. Shortly afterward, the fire department and emergency workers responded to a call of a vehicle hitting a pedestrian.",

      "The Department of Homeland Security denied its agents chased the person and said they do not know the person\u2019s legal status.",
      "\"This individual was not being pursued by any DHS law enforcement,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"We were not aware of this incident or notified by California Highway Patrol until hours after operations in the area had concluded.\"",
      "Feik said that the city did not have any additional information about the operation, including about any possible detentions, and that Monrovia has not received any communication from ICE.",
      "Palmira Figueroa, spokesperson for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said 13 workers were detained during the raid. \u201cIt was a violent, aggressive bust,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of them were chasing workers in cars while they were running away.\u201d",
      "Network organizers are trying to reach family members, as well as the other men who were detained, Figueroa said.",

      "The announcement of \u201cAJLT\u2019s\u201d exit came only a few weeks ago, when renewal buzz was still in the air. As showrunner Michael Patrick King (who developed the follow-up series with \u201cSATC\u201d creator Darren Starr) wrote on Instagram Aug. 1, \u201cWhile I was writing the last episode of \u2018And Just Like That\u2019 season three, it became clear to me that this might be a wonderful place to stop.\u201d He noted that the last two episodes of the series were structured as more of a two-part finale (focusing around Miranda\u2019s challenging Thanksgiving party), but held off on calling it a finale.",
      "So how did things ultimately wrap up? Where do our leading ladies and men leave us? And just how did we go from Cosmos in clubs in the 1990s to pie in the kitchen in 2025? Let\u2019s examine the final episode, appropriately called \u201cParty of One.\u201d",
      "Are Carrie and Aidan Broken Up Forever?",
      "Considering that \u201cCadian\u201d broke up several episodes ago, that the first of the two-part finale was called \u201cForgot About the Boy,\u201d and the episode directly post-breakup skipped ahead to the fall without a reunion \u2014 yeah, it\u2019s safe to say that Aidan (John Corbett) sealed his fate when he declared he still couldn\u2019t trust Carrie.",
      "Who\u2019s next for Carrie, then?",
      "Maybe no one.",
      "The final episode of \u201cAJLT\u201d focuses on Carrie coming up with a new perspective on what it means to be not just out of a relationship, not just with none on the horizon, but what it might mean to not necessarily want one.",
      "\u201cSeriously though, who will I be alone?\u201d she asks Charlotte. \u201cI\u2019ve never lived alone without the thought that I wouldn\u2019t be alone for long.\u201d She confesses that after Big\u2019s death, she thought that Aidan might be her natural next step. Then she\u2019d considered Duncan as a possibility \u2014 but he left New York City, and it\u2019s hard to imagine Carrie picking up and following him.",
      "Then Carrie had her big revelation: \u201cI have to quit thinking, \u2018Maybe a man?\u2019 and start accepting maybe just me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a tragedy, it\u2019s a fact, and I just have to start accepting it full stop.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a throwback to her new novel, whose original ending of a woman being happy being alone triggered her editor, leading to Carrie writing an epilogue in which love is a possibility for the single woman in the future. But in the end, post-Thanksgiving, Carrie returns to her apartment with leftover pie and rewrites the epilogue to read, \u201cThe woman realized she was not alone \u2014 she was on her own.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a solid period on the end of a sentence. The fact is, after many years of the story of Carrie, her friends and lovers, our heroine\u2019s longest-lasting relationship has not been with men. Or fashion. Or even her friends. Carrie\u2019s real love affair has been with herself, and her writing. It is the thing that gives her purpose and sets her apart from nearly everyone else she knows.",
      "What Happens to All the Other Characters?",
      "So where does that leave everyone else?",
      "With their loved ones, actually. As ever, the \u201cSex\u201d-iverse leaves everyone else as ancillary satellites circling Carrie\u2019s world, but we do get some insights as to where everyone else\u2019s mostly-happily-ever-after lives are heading next.",
      "Lisa (Nicole Ari Parker) avoids her affair with her editor and comes home to a still-mourning Herbert (Christopher Jackson) and they promise to get through his political defeat together.",
      "Miranda and Joy (Dolly Wells) undergo a dog surgery and a particularly disgusting post-Thanksgiving bathroom disaster and end up embracing.",
      "Seema (Sarita Choudhury) and Adam (Logan Marshall-Green) work around their differences in tradition and gluten, and have a pie-eating Thursday instead of a traditional Thanksgiving. But not before Carrie determines that the free spirit is in for the long haul with Seema.",
      "Brady (Niall Cunningham) and baby mama-to-be Mia (Ella Stiller, daughter of Ben) are far from reconciled, but Mia and her friends do make Miranda\u2019s Thanksgiving interesting, and Mia decides that Miranda is kind of cool after all.",
      "Charlotte and Harry (Evan Handler) discover there is life after prostate cancer surgery, and celebrate Thanksgiving with their children.",
      "Anthony (Mario Cantone) and Giuseppe (Sebastiano Pigazzi) discuss Giuseppe\u2019s real intentions with Anthony. Guess they really are going to get married.",
      "Aidan is nowhere in sight.",
      "Is 'And Just Like That' Really Over?",
      "Was this a true finale \u2014 or will we see more of Carrie & Co. in the future?",
      "Too soon to tell. There are enough loose threads to create another spin-off. There\u2019s always a scenario where Carrie abandons her newfound sense of self and races off to the UK to chase Duncan. But let\u2019s face it, the end credits roll with a replay of the theme music to \u201cSex and the City.\u201d We think this is probably the end \u2014 for now.",
      "After all, Carrie has reached a point of acceptance of being alone, but not lonely. She has her friends and their offspring. She likes her home, even if it is a little too big. It\u2019s kind of nice to leave her in her beautiful red frock, dancing to Barry White\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re the First, the Last, My Everything,\u201d eating pie direct from the pan with a spoon.",
      "It\u2019s as if the show is saying: This is not a tragedy. This is a victory.",

      "Justice, a former baseball player who was married to Berry from 1993 to 1997, made headlines last week for listing some of the \u201cissues\u201d in their relationship that led to their breakup on the \u201cAll the Smoke\u201d podcast. The 59-year-old said that at the time he was looking for a \u201ctraditional wife.\u201d",
      "\u201cThen I\u2019m thinking, \u2018OK, if we have kids, is this the woman I want to have kids with and build a family with?\u2019\u201d Justice said. \u201cAt that time, as a young guy \u2014 she don\u2019t cook, don\u2019t clean, don\u2019t really seem, like, motherly. And then we start having issues.\u201d",

      "In the slideshow, Berry smiled wide while posing in a yellow bikini, lounged with Hunt on a daybed, enjoyed a glass of wine by the sea, sipped from a coconut and ate some chocolate cake. One photo also showed her holding a birthday card that said \u201cMom\u201d and had a heart drawn on it.",
      "She seemed to address Justice\u2019s criticisms by captioning the post, \u201cPhew\u2026! cooking, cleaning and mothering.\u201d",

      "Berry explained that she hasn\u2019t replied yet because she has been married three times and Hunt was previously married as well. She said that they don\u2019t need to tie the knot to \u201cvalidate\u201d their love.",
      "\u201cBut I think we will get married just because, out of the people I\u2019ve been married to, this is the person I should have married,\u201d she shared. \u201cAnd I feel like I should, we should get married, but it\u2019s not because we feel like we have to. I think it\u2019s something that we would like to do just because we want that expression.\u201d"

      "But the pop superstar left fans with more questions than answers, specifically: When will the album actually drop?",
      "Swifties had to wait until Aug. 13 for the answer. After teasing her appearance on \u201cNew Heights\u201d earlier in the week, the pop star set up a countdown on her website to 7 p.m. ET \u2014 the same time the podcast episode was supposed to drop.",
      "At 7 p.m. ET on the dot, Swift\u2019s website reset to reveal the cover art for \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d as well as a release date: Oct. 3, 2025.",

      "Some fans believe they spotted hints for \u201cShowgirl\u201d as far back as 10 months ago, when Swift posted an Instagram video of herself walking through Miami's Hard Rock Stadium ahead of another \u201cEras Tour\u201d show. As she walks, her cat in her arms, she briefly passes a sign reading \"A12,\" potentially hinting at her Aug. 12 announcement.",
      "Fans are also claiming that she teased \"Life of a Showgirl\" in her \"The Eras Tour\" book. The final chapter of this book is called \"Behind the Scenes,\" and is a similar orange hue as all of the new album art teasers that have been revealed so far.",
      "Swift released several past album in the month of October:",
      "Oct. 21, 2022: \"Midnights\"",

      "Oct. 25, 2010: \"Speak Now\"",
      "Oct. 27, 2014: \"1989\"",
      "Another TikToker used Swift's well-documented love of the number 13 and red hue symbolism in her music. The theory hinges on track two from her fourth album (\"Red\" from Red) and tenth album (\"Maroon\" from Midnights) both related to shades of red."

      "I was also worried about people online and them coming at me and stuff like that. So I honestly didn't really want to do it.",

      "\"For me, the vocals weren't great, Tom. I'm going to be honest with you,\" Cowell told the reality TV star.",

      "\"I could always be improving,\" he says.",

      "Beyond advancing to the competition's quarterfinal live shows, has Sandoval thought about what it would be like if his band won \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\"?",
      "\"We're just taking it one performance at a time,\" he says of not thinking that way ahead. \"I mean, there's still a long way to go with so many incredibly talented acts going up there. So to me, like I said before, winning it seems so far off to me.\"",

      "He addressed the controversy during his audition on \"America's Got Talent\" in June 2025, where he explained to the judges that he made some \"really bad choices\" during the cheating scandal that \"pretty much destroyed\" his life.",

She would have spinal and neurological problems that would require multiple surgeries in the years afterward.",
      "Born in Trenton, New Jersey, and raised in New York, Spencer began acting when she was about 9. \"What's Happening!!\" would be her first credited role.",
      "\"Imagine being plucked from obscurity to star in a TV show,\" she told Jet magazine in 2014. \"I had never seen any young Black girl in that type of spotlight, so I didn't have a reference point in the media as to how to deal with this opportunity. I was from the Bronx.\"",
      "Haywood Nelson, who played Dwayne on the show, paid tribute Tuesday to \"Dr. Dee, our brilliant, loving, positive, pragmatic warrior.\"",
      "\"We have lost a daughter, sister, family member, 'What's Happening' cast member, veterinarian animal rights proponent and healer, and cancer heroine. Our Shero,\" Nelson said on Instagram. \"Danielle is loved.\"",
      "Spencer also appeared on a mid-1980s reboot of the show, \"What's Happening Now!!,\" which ran for three seasons.",
      "In 2018, she had emergency surgery for a bleeding hematoma, which stemmed from that 1977 car crash. In the immediate aftermath, a family spokesperson said she could only speak slightly and had to use crutches to walk. She had been suffering symptoms from at least 2004, when she had to use a wheelchair and relearn how to walk. In 2014, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a double mastectomy.",
      "She went on to become a veterinarian and advocate for animals. She attended the University of California, Davis, and UCLA, and got a doctorate in veterinary medicine from Tuskegee University in 1993.",
      "Spencer continued to dabble in acting in her later years, including an appearance as a veterinarian in the 1997 Jack Nicholson film \"As Good as it Gets.\"",
      "She is survived by her brother, musician Jeremy Pelt, and her mother, Cheryl Pelt."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump has campaigned for a Nobel Peace Prize, pitching himself as a \"peacemaker\" as he heads into a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the Ukraine war.",
    "story": [
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska \u2014 Toward the end of Donald Trump\u2019s first term, his national security adviser turned to him in the Oval Office and said he should win the Nobel Peace Prize for his work normalizing relations between Israel and some Arab states.",
      "Another aide chimed in, saying the last president, Barack Obama, had won the award \u201cfor nothing.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s attitude was, \u2018Whatever,\u2019\u201d recalled the adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, in an interview. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t concerned about the recognition.\u201d",
      "Any whiff of indifference is now gone. Back in office, Trump and his aides are intensifying a public campaign to snag the award, citing a string of peace deals while making a case that snubbing him again would be an injustice.",
      "Day by day, the White House is amplifying Trump's role in curbing hostilities and putting out the message that this most combative of presidents is at heart a \"peacemaker.\"",
      "Aides have highlighted his role in settling disputes between Israel and Iran, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Cambodia and Thailand, and Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, promoting \"worldwide calls\" from the heads of several of those nations for Trump to win the peace prize.",
      "Trump is also touting his efforts to end a worrying conflict between two nuclear-armed combatants, India and Pakistan. He suggested he used trade as an inducement to stop the fighting, though an Indian official has denied that Trump's mediation made any difference.",
      "Speaking last month, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the president has \u201cbrokered, on average, about one peace deal or ceasefire per month during his six months in office. It\u2019s well past time that President Trump was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d she added.",
      "A difference between this term and the last is that now, \u201che actually wants it,\" a senior official in Trump\u2019s first term said about the Nobel Peace Prize, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t just want to talk about it.\u201d",
      "Now comes his best shot. On Friday, Trump will fly to Alaska for a sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin aimed at ending a war with Ukraine that has produced close to 1.5 million casualties on both sides.",
      "The odds of a breakthrough are tough, but if Trump brokers a truce on terms that are fair to Ukraine, that would be a diplomatic triumph that eluded both Obama and President Joe Biden.",
      "In the run-up to the summit, the Nobel prize has appeared to be top of mind in Trump's circle. Without prompting, Leavitt  portrayed Trump as deserving of the prize in three out of her four press briefings in July. In prior months, she hadn\u2019t brought up the award.",
      "Trump has posted about the prize a total of seven times on his social media site since his second term began, six of them in June and July. A theme of his is that while he\u2019s earned the accolade, he won\u2019t win it.",
      "\u201cThe president feels that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, but does not think he will get it,\u201d a White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe has remarked that it will go to someone who writes a book about how Donald Trump thinks rather than Donald Trump himself.\u201d",
      "In a visit to the White House in April, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re was asked about Trump\u2019s prospects of winning the award, announced annually in Oslo.",
      "He didn\u2019t bite.",
      "\u201cOn that prize, that is a committee taking care of that which is completely working on its own terms and I cannot comment on that,\u201d St\u00f8re said.",
      "Trump smiled and looked across the Cabinet Room table at the prime minister: \u201cI like that question,\u201d he said.",
      "The award is solely in the hands of the Nobel selection committee; politicians don\u2019t pick the winner. But Trump has reportedly raised the issue with Norway before. Last month, he called the country\u2019s finance minister, former NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, to talk tariffs and brought up the peace prize, a Norwegian news outlet wrote Thursday.",
      "The White House official said that the president and Stoltenberg did speak, but could not say that the conversation was focused on the prize. Stoltenberg\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump is surrounded by reminders of past presidents who\u2019ve won what is arguably humanity\u2019s most prestigious award. Obama, whose portrait hangs in the White House, won it less than a year into his presidency and even he acknowledged at the time that his accomplishments were \u201cslight\u201d in contrast to other Nobel laureates.",
      "Just a few paces from the Oval Office, Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s Nobel Prize is on display, signifying both the challenge and opportunity that Trump faces. Roosevelt won in 1906 for bringing an end to another Russian conflict: a war with Japan.",
      "As much as he aligns himself politically with working Americans, Trump has long been attuned to elite opinion. He takes pride in recounting that his late uncle, John Trump, taught at the acclaimed Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has described his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, as \u201cthe hardest school to get into, the best school in the world.\u201d",
      "In announcing the Kennedy Center honorees on Wednesday, Trump said that he had long wanted one for himself. The president now plans to host the Kennedy Center Honors this year, teasing to reporters, \"maybe ... next year we\u2019ll honor Trump.\"",
      "A Nobel Peace Prize would be the ultimate validation.",
      "\"If the Israel-Hamas/Iran and Russia-Ukraine conflicts get resolved, there\u2019s no way that they can\u2019t give President Trump the Nobel Peace Prize,\" O'Brien said.",
      "\u201cThe Nobel committee may not like Trump,\" he added. \"They may not like his personality. They may not like his populism, but if the award has any meaning, they have to give it to him.\u201d",
      "Of course, the Nobel selection committee has its own ideas about what it takes to win. The five-member body appointed by the Norwegian parliament may be weighing other criteria apart from the peace deals the White House has tallied.",
      "In his will, Alfred Nobel stated that the prize should go to those \u201cwho shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations.\u201d",
      "Since Trump took office, some longtime U.S. allies have seen fraternal bonds fray. Trump has rolled out stiff tariffs in pursuit of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda meant to create more jobs at home. He stunned various world capitals with his calls for acquiring Greenland, Canada and the Panama Canal.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize has become something of a joke in foreign capitals,\u201d a former British diplomat said. \u201cHis claims to Canada, Panama, Greenland, etc., as well as tariff wars and the assaults on America\u2019s democratic institutions, incline governments in the opposite direction.\u201d",
      "What happens in the Nobel committee\u2019s closed-door deliberations is a closely guarded secret. The panel accepts nominations through the end of January and announces the winner in October. It waits 50 years before revealing even a list of nominees.",
      "Handicapping possible winners of the 2025 prize, a Norwegian think tank didn\u2019t mention Trump\u2019s name. The handful of front-runners the group cited included \u201cSudan\u2019s Emergency Response Rooms,\u201d the prime minister of Qatar, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, and the Women\u2019s International League for Peace & Freedom.",
      "It\u2019s far from clear that the Nobel committee is susceptible to persuasion. Pressure, publicity and coalition-building work in politics, the arena Trump knows well. But the Nobel committee is insulated from that world.",
      "The prize \u201cis not something you campaign for,\u201d a Western diplomat said. \u201cThis is a decision made by people who are independent and have their own point of view. You can\u2019t buy it. Norway doesn\u2019t need the money.\u201d",
      "Last week, Trump held a meeting at the White House with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan to mark a rapprochement between the two countries. Questioned by a reporter, both leaders plumped for Trump\u2019s Nobel candidacy.",
      "Nikol Pashinyan, prime minister of Armenia, said, \u201cWe will promote for that.\u201d",
      "Turning to Trump, he said, \u201cHopefully you will invite us\u201d to the award ceremony.",
      "\u201cFront row,\u201d Trump said."

      "LONDON \u2014 A new book touting explosive revelations about the life of Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew has left the embattled duke facing a renewed wave of damaging headlines.",
      "The unauthorized biography, \"Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York\" by Andrew Lownie, was published Thursday.",
      "It centers on Andrew\u2019s relationship with his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, and covers his finances and dealings with foreign governments, as well as the timeline of his ties with Jeffrey Epstein \u2014 the late financier and convicted sex offender who has been the subject of fervent attention in both Britain and the United States in recent weeks.",
      "NBC royal contributor Daisy McAndrew said Thursday that the good news for Andrew and the royal family may be that the impact of this renewed focus will be blunted by the reality that his reputation is already at \u201crock bottom.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s possible other people might well be taking some of the heat off Andrew,\u201d she said, referring to politicians in the U.S.",
      "Publisher HarperCollins says Lownie, a historian, drew on four years of research and interviews with more than 100 people who haven\u2019t spoken before in writing the 448-page book. The majority spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Excerpts have been splashed across Britain's Daily Mail newspaper, and a poll released this week found that two-thirds of Britons want the disgraced younger brother of King Charles III to be stripped of his remaining royal titles.",
      "An earlier YouGov survey found Andrew remains by far the most unpopular royal, with just 5% of respondents saying they held a positive view of him.",
      "Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, formerly known as Meghan Markle, was one place above Andrew, at 20%, with heir to the throne Prince William topping the rankings on 74%.",
      "A representative for Andrew and Buckingham Palace did not immediately respond to a request for comment about both the book and the polling.",
      "Andrew returned his military affiliations and royal patronages in January 2022 after his lawyers failed to persuade a U.S. judge to dismiss a lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse.",
      "He later paid a substantial sum to Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew sexually abused her when she was 17. Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegation.",
      "Giuffre died by suicide in April this year, with her family saying in a statement that \u201cthe toll of abuse is so heavy that it became unbearable for Virginia to handle its weight.\u201d",
      "In December 2024, Andrew was caught up in an alleged spying case after cultivating an \u201cunusual degree of trust\u201d with a Chinese man who was barred from the U.K. on national security grounds.",
      "Britain\u2019s High Court ruled that Andrew had been \u201cprepared to enter into business activities\u201d with Yang Tengbo as it lifted an anonymity order protecting Tengbo's identity. Tengbo had been subjected to the highest levels of national security investigation in the U.K.",
      "Other royals have rarely appeared in public with Andrew since his fall from grace.",
      "His public standing has remained little changed since a disastrous interview about his ties to Epstein on the BBC\u2019s \u201cNewsnight\u201d program in November 2019.",
      "Despite this simmering anger and growing pressure, McAndrew said she doesn't think the king will take the drastic step of removing Andrew's royal titles. But, she said, William might act differently when he ascends the throne.",
      "\"He\u2019s much less sentimental as a personality. And the royal family (and future monarch peculiarly) ultimately must exist to protect the monarchy,\" she said.",
      "The royal family will have to consider whether taking new action against Andrew could run the risk of him retaliating publicly. They may feel it is better, McAndrew said, \"to let sleeping dogs lie.\""

    "story": [
      "Arab governments that for decades have been fierce advocates for the Palestinian cause are now facing criticism for their timid response to the extreme suffering in Gaza caused by Israel's war, risking a dangerous rift with their increasingly restive citizens.",
      "As deaths from starvation and Israeli bombardment have mounted, Palestinians, their supporters and some analysts have directed their anger toward Arab rulers in the region whom they perceive as being too passive and quiet. They point to countries outside the Middle East who have publicly criticized Israel and tried to stop it from expanding its military operations in Gaza.",
      "\u201cWhere are the Arabs? The Arabs are napping. The Arabs are nowhere to be seen. The Arabs, and I\u2019m talking about the Arab rulers, have buried their heads in the sand,\u201d said Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics.",
      "The situation in Gaza has become even more dire as Palestinians risk their lives to get food. An aid distribution system implemented by the U.S. and the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has led to hundreds more Palestinians being killed, often by Israeli soldiers.",
      "Wafaa Eeed, a Palestinian woman in Gaza, told NBC News last month that she had walked several miles to a GHF aid distribution site on July 24, a day set aside only for women. She and two other witnesses said they were shot at, pepper-sprayed and tear-gassed.",
      "\u201cArab states, why don\u2019t you help us? We don\u2019t want the Americans,\u201d Eeed said.",
      "Two women were killed on their way to the site, a Gaza health official said. The GHF said at the time that there were \u201cno incidents\u201d at the site itself.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said that \"troops operating in the Rafah area identified suspects who approached them, posing a threat to the troops\" and fired warning shots.",
      "It was not aware of casualties, and the shots were fired \"hundreds of meters away\" from the GHF site before its opening hours, it said.",
      "Israel also denies there is starvation in Gaza, contradicting medics in the Palestinian enclave, global aid groups and even a close ally, President Donald Trump.",
      "Some Arab leaders dependent on American aid and security guarantees are wary of angering the U.S. and Israel and see little strategic advantage in helping Palestinians, whom they may even see as a threat, experts say.",
      "Arab states have participated in airdrops of aid and food convoys into Gaza, but Palestinians and aid groups say it\u2019s nowhere near enough to ward off a looming famine. Egypt and Qatar have also mediated talks among Israel, the U.S. and Hamas, but they have not led to an end to the conflict.",
      "Several Latin American states, along with Spain, Ireland and Norway, have blasted Israel for its conduct in Gaza and threatened sanctions or a downgrade of diplomatic ties.",
      "And in recent weeks, longtime Israeli allies like France and Australia have pledged to officially recognize Palestine \u2014 a move decried by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government. In late 2023, South Africa filed a case with the United Nations\u2019 top court alleging that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.",
      "Arab states have been much less vocal, with Egypt and Jordan even cracking down on pro-Palestinian protests and activism, fearing they could turn against the country\u2019s leaders, experts say.",
      "\u201cPalestine resonates deeply in the Arab imagination,\" Gerges said. \"Palestine reminds Arabs of the subservience of their governments. Palestine reminds Arabs of the hegemony and domination and the continuing colonialism and imperialism of the West.\"",
      "He added, \u201cI would say that Gaza, the tragedy of Gaza, the destruction of Gaza, could really serve as a time bomb that implodes the Arab political order from within.\u201d",
      "Polling before Oct. 7, 2023, showed that most Arab citizens rejected normalizing ties with Israel, a sentiment subsequent surveys show has only deepened since.",
      "A survey published in June by pollster Arab Barometer found that support for such a move has collapsed, not exceeding 13 percent in the seven countries surveyed.",
      "The Egyptian and Jordanian embassies in the U.S., along with the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this story.",
      "Egypt and Jordan, even with the crackdown, have allowed limited protests, though hundreds of activists have also been arrested, according to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.",
      "The Gulf states rarely allow protests, but they have largely maintained diplomatic and trade links with Israel throughout its devastating offensive in the Gaza strip that began after the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, in which some 1,200 were killed and 250 taken hostage.",
      "Health officials in Gaza say that more than 61,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed in the ensuing war.",
      "Many academics, including Israeli scholars, have in recent months joined rights groups in condemning Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza as genocide, a charge Israel vehemently denies.",
      "\u201cDespite the genocide, in the middle of the genocide, this extraordinary depravity that we see in Gaza, not a single Arab state that has relations with Israel has cut relations with Israel, although other states in other parts of the world have,\u201d said Ussama Makdisi, professor of history and chancellor\u2019s chair at the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were among the Arab states that signed the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020, paving the way for economic and diplomatic ties with Israel. Saudi Arabia had been set to follow, but the Gaza conflict put those plans on hold.",
      "For Gulf Arab states, better ties with Israel have little to do with public attitudes and more to do with realpolitik, experts say. The Gulf states host several U.S. military bases that analysts say help shield them from regional rival Iran and also help maintain Western access to the region\u2019s vast energy supplies.",
      "Access to Israel\u2019s vibrant tech sector has also been a draw for some Arab states, who have used its surveillance technology to stifle dissent, experts and rights groups say.",
      "\u201cThose regimes in the Arab world that depend on the U.S. for their security, they don\u2019t depend on their legitimacy vis a vis their own people. They depend on U.S. protection, U.S. military bases,\u201d Makdisi said.",
      "Houthi rebels, who control large parts of Yemen, have fired missiles and drones at Israel and ships in the region in what they say is an attempt to end Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, but Yemen is alone among Arab states in pressuring Israel militarily. Arab countries could apply economic pressure through oil embargoes or restricting access to the Suez Canal and Arab airspace, but experts say such moves are unlikely.",
      "Arab countries once supplied Palestinian militant groups with weapons, funding and bases from which to attack Israel, but such solidarity proved costly and dangerous.",
      "In Jordan, tensions between Palestinian militant groups and the ruling monarchy exploded into the \u201cBlack September\u201d civil war in 1970, leading to the militants\u2019 eventual expulsion and relocation to Lebanon.",
      "The presence of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon in the 1970s exacerbated the country\u2019s civil war and triggered an Israeli invasion in 1982 to target \u201cPalestinian terrorists.\u201d",
      "More recently, Israel invaded Lebanon last year, heavily bombing southern Beirut in an offensive against the Hezbollah militant group, which had been firing rockets at Israel in solidarity with Hamas.",
      "Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran, which has led some Arab states to distance themselves from both groups.",
      "For Ryan Crocker, former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Lebanon and Kuwait, lukewarm Arab support for the Palestinian cause is less about U.S. and Israeli pressure and more about self-preservation.",
      "\u201cThe Palestinians, both the cause, the PLO and the population, in the Jordanian and Lebanese examples, have both been seen as a threat to the rule of these Arab regimes,\u201d Crocker told NBC News.",
      "The U.S. and Israel had floated plans for Arab countries to accept tens of thousands of Gaza refugees, but the idea was flatly rejected, with those Arab countries fearing both renewed Palestinian militancy and accusations of aiding ethnic cleansing, experts say.",
      "Crocker compared Palestinians to the Kurds, another stateless group in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a saying among the Kurds, who are scattered between Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, that they have no friends but the mountains,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, the Palestinians don\u2019t even have the mountains.\u201d"

      "A second sign declared that Vance \u201cclaps when the plane lands,\u201d referring to a practice mocked by some Britons who see it as very un-British overenthusiasm. Others held placards quoting Vance when he said he \u201cnever liked\u201d President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cCotswolds childless cat ladies say go home,\u201d another read, referring to comments Vance made to former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in 2021 about senior Democrats in Congress that resurfaced during last year\u2019s presidential race.",
      "In the nearby town of Chipping Norton, some locals said they were unprepared for the level of security disruption as some of the already tight roads in the area were closed for Vance\u2019s motorcade.",

      "DAKAR, Senegal \u2014 It\u2019s the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth \u2014 a 54-pound (25-kilogram) meteorite that fetched more than $5 million at a New York auction last month, setting a world record.",
      "But in the West African nation of Niger, where the rusty-red rock was unearthed in the Sahara Desert, officials have launched an investigation into what they call possible \u201cillicit international trafficking,\u201d claiming it may have been smuggled out of the country.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the meteorite and the legal dispute:",
      "How it was found",
      "Sotheby\u2019s said the rock, named NWA 16788, was blown off the surface of Mars by a massive asteroid strike and traveled 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) to Earth.",
      "It was discovered in the Sahara in northwestern Niger by a meteorite hunter in November 2023, according to the auction house. His identity was not disclosed. Nor was the identity of the buyer last month.",
      "Meteorite hunting is growing in arid Saharan countries like Niger. Though meteorites can fall anywhere on Earth, the Sahara has become a prime spot for their discovery in part due to the favorable climate for their preservation.",
      "Hunters often search for space rocks that can be sold to collectors or scientists. The rarest and most precious are from Mars and the moon.",
      "According to the Heritage academic journal, the rock was sold to an international dealer before it ended up in a private galley in Italy. A team of scientists from the University of Florence examined the rock last year to learn more about its structure and where it came from before falling to Earth, the publication said.",
      "The meteorite was also briefly on display in Rome before it was next seen in public in New York last month during the auction.",
      "Why Niger is investigating",
      "Following the sale, Niger raised questions about how the meteorite came to be sold at auction.",
      "Niger\u2019s government announced an investigation last month to determine the circumstances of the meteorite\u2019s discovery and sale, saying in a statement it was \u201cakin to illicit international trafficking.\u201d",
      "Last week, President Abdourahamane Tiani suspended the export of \u201cprecious stones, semiprecious stones and meteorites nationwide\u201d in an effort to ensure their traceability.",
      "Sotheby\u2019s said in a statement sent to The Associated Press the meteorite was exported from Niger and transported in line with all relevant international procedures.",
      "\u201cAs with everything we sell, all necessary documentation was in order at each stage of its journey, in accordance with best practice and the requirements of the countries involved.\u201d the statement read.",
      "Authorities in Niger did not respond to AP questions.",
      "What international law says",
      "Patty Gerstenblith, a cultural heritage lawyer and expert on illicit trade, said that under the UNESCO convention on cultural property \u2014 which Niger and the U.S. have ratified \u2014 rare minerals, like meteorites, can qualify as cultural property.",
      "However, Gerstenblith said Niger needs to be able to prove it owned the meteorite and that it was stolen, as illegal export from the country does not make the meteorite illegal in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf the meteorite was not stolen and if it was properly declared upon import into the U.S., then it would not seem that Niger can recover the meteorite,\u201d she told the AP.",
      "Paul Sereno, a paleontologist who has spent years uncovering dinosaur fossils in Niger\u2019s Sahara, is campaigning to return the country\u2019s cultural and natural heritage \u2014 including meteorites.",
      "\u201cWhen you have laws that clearly say rare minerals like meteorites are cultural artifacts, you cannot simply come in an take something that is so unique and valuable to a country,\u201d he told the AP.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just not in the colonial area anymore,\u201d he added.",
      "Some countries, like Morocco, one of the leading sources of meteorites on the international market, require restitution if the objects are discovered on their territory. But enforcement has been challenging due to the vast desert areas and informal trading networks."

      "A growing number of U.S. politicians are condemning a new British law that requires some websites and apps \u2014 including some based in the United States \u2014 to check the ages of users across the pond.",
      "A bipartisan group of members of Congress visited London recently to meet counterparts and air their concerns about the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act, which went into effect July 25. Vice President JD Vance has been criticizing the law for months, as have privacy advocates who argue that the law infringes on free expression and disproportionately hurts vulnerable groups.",
      "Vance criticized the U.K. again on Friday, this time in person at the start of a visit to the country. Sitting alongside British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and speaking to reporters, Vance warned the U.K. against going down a \u201cvery dark path\u201d of online \u201ccensorship\u201d that he said was trod earlier by the Biden administration.",
      "The U.K. Online Safety Act is aimed at preventing children from accessing potentially harmful material online, and internet companies are now asking British users to verify their ages in a variety of ways, including with photos of their IDs, through a credit card provider or with selfies analyzed via age-check software.",
      "But the sweeping nature of the law has caught some Britons by surprise. They\u2019re being asked to prove their age not only for pornography websites but also before they can listen to songs with explicit lyrics or access message boards to discuss sensitive subjects. Reddit, for example, is restricting access to various pages including r/stopsmoking, r/STD and r/aljazeera.",
      "Reddit said in a post about its enforcement of the law that for people in the U.K., it was now verifying ages before they can \u201cview certain mature content.\u201d A spokesperson for the company said r/STD \u2014 a message board focused on questions of sexual health \u2014 is restricted because of explicit images. They said r/stopsmoking is restricted because it deals with harmful substances and that r/aljazeera \u2014 which is not affiliated with the news organization of the same name but deals with similar topics \u2014 is restricted because it depicts serious injury or violence.",
      "To get around the new law, the use of virtual private network software that can mask a person\u2019s location, also known as VPNs, has surged in the U.K.",
      "The primary argument of U.S. politicians who oppose the law is that they don\u2019t want American tech companies to have to comply, even if they\u2019re serving British customers.",
      "House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said he raised his objections with U.K. government officials during meetings in London at the end of July. In a statement after his return, he said the law and other European regulations \u201ccreate a serious chilling effect on free expression and threaten the First Amendment rights of American citizens and companies.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe absolutely need to protect children and keep harmful, illegal content off these platforms \u2014 but when governments or bureaucracies suppress speech in the name of safety or regulation, it sets a dangerous precedent that threatens the core of Western democratic values,\u201d Jordan said.",
      "The issue may come to a head in a couple of different venues. That could be the courts if any tech companies file lawsuits over the law, or it could come up in trade negotiations if President Donald Trump decides to press the issue with British politicians, although they say it\u2019s not open to debate in trade talks.",
      "Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist and Meta board member with close ties to the Trump administration, recently called U.K. leaders to complain about the law, the Financial Times reported Friday. A spokesperson for Andreessen said the report was not true.",
      "The U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act is one of the most comprehensive national laws that any democracy has ever passed to try to curtail potentially harmful content online in the name of children. Parliament passed the law in 2023, and the government went through two years of writing detailed rules before putting the law into effect last month.",
      "The law is notable for a combination of reasons: the variety of content it applies to, the potential fines and the possible international reach.",
      "A wide array of content is at issue. While the \u201cprimary\u201d focus of the law is online material such as pornography and suicide, it also requires websites to age-gate content with bullying, serious violence, \u201cdangerous stunts\u201d and \u201cexposure to harmful substances.\u201d That has covered relatively mainstream services such as Spotify and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox gaming system.",
      "Companies that don\u2019t comply face potential fines of up to 10% of their global revenue, which for the biggest companies could be billions of dollars. The British regulator Ofcom, short for Office of Communications, says companies must use \u201chighly effective age assurance\u201d to restrict the riskiest types of content.",
      "And the U.K. has not been adamant that it won\u2019t allow international borders to stymie enforcement. Ofcom says it plans to apply the law to services with \u201ca significant number\u201d of U.K. users, services where U.K. users \u201care a target market\u201d and services that are \u201ccapable of being accessed\u201d by U.K. users with a \u201cmaterial risk of significant harm\u201d to such users.",
      "The law appears to retain strong support among the British public. About 69% said they supported the new rules in a YouGov poll taken after implementation began, and 46% said they supported it \u201cstrongly.\u201d But 52% said they do not think the law will be very effective at preventing minors from accessing pornography.",
      "The law was passed during a previous, Conservative-led government and took effect under the current, Labour-led government.",
      "But the far-right party Reform U.K. is pushing for a repeal of the law. Party leader Nigel Farage, a former member of Parliament, has called it \u201cstate suppression of genuine free speech,\u201d and his party is running high in polls.",
      "\u201cMillions of people have noticed that what they\u2019re getting on their feeds is different to what it was,\u201d Farage said at a recent news conference.",
      "Farage also met with visiting members of Congress last week, and the talks turned heated with Farage and Democrats exchanging insults, according to Politico, although the dispute appeared to be more about Trump\u2019s free speech restrictions than about the U.K. law.",
      "Most U.S.-based tech companies say they are complying with the new law. Microsoft said in a blog post that Xbox users in the U.K. would begin seeing notifications \u201cencouraging them to verify their age\u201d as a \u201cone-time process,\u201d with actual enforcement starting next year. If users don\u2019t comply, Microsoft warned, they\u2019ll lose access to social features of Xbox but will still be able to play games.",
      "Discord said it was implementing new default settings for all U.K. users, in effect treating everyone like a minor with heavy content filtering unless they verify that they\u2019re adults. Discord says users can choose to verify their age either with a face scan or an ID upload.",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s X has also restricted posts, including information about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, according to the BBC. X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "But a few services are not complying. The far-right social media site Gab, which allows white supremacist views and other extremist content, said in a notice on its website that it had received notices from Ofcom and, rather than comply, decided to block the entire U.K. from accessing its site. The company said in the notice: \u201cWe refuse to comply with this tyranny.\u201d",
      "Preston Byrne, a U.S. lawyer who specializes in technology issues, has said on X that he plans to file a lawsuit soon on behalf of an unnamed client seeking to quash possible enforcement of the British law within the United States.",
      "The subject has been simmering for months ahead of the law\u2019s implementation, and it came up in February when British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the White House.",
      "In an Oval Office meeting, a reporter asked Trump what he thought of the U.K. approach to free speech, and Trump tossed the question to Vance, who expressed concern.",
      "\u201cWe do have, of course, a special relationship with our friends in the U.K. and also with some of our European allies. But we also know that there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British \u2014 of course, what the British do in their own country is up to them \u2014 but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer defended his government\u2019s approach.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom, and it will last for a very, very long time. Certainly, we wouldn\u2019t want to reach across U.S. systems and we don\u2019t, and that\u2019s absolutely right,\u201d he said.",
      "British Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy later said the U.K. would not make any changes to the Online Safety Act as part of trade negotiations with the Trump administration.",
      "American privacy advocates are watching the debate play out with alarm, concerned that similar age verification laws \u2014 like new state laws targeting the Apple and Google app stores \u2014 would upend the internet closer to home.",
      "\u201cYoung people should be able to access information, speak to each other and to the world, play games, and express themselves online without the government making decisions about what speech is permissible,\u201d wrote Paige Collings, a senior speech and privacy activist at the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, in a blog post Tuesday."

      "Trump said on the call, which also included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that he is going into the meeting with Putin with the goal of securing a ceasefire in Ukraine, those sources said.",
      "Trump and European leaders agreed that a ceasefire in Ukraine has to be implemented before peace negotiations can begin, the European officials and two other people briefed on the call said. Some of the European leaders were left with the impression from the call that Trump is not optimistic about the results of his meeting with Putin, they added.",
      "The call on Wednesday took place just days ahead of Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin, which is planned for Friday. European and Ukrainian officials have been nervous about the president\u2019s meeting with the Russian leader since he announced it last week. Among their concerns is that Trump and Putin might agree to the parameters of a peace deal, including territorial divisions, and then try to pressure Ukraine to agree to it. Trump\u2019s comments last week that there would \"be some land swapping\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, in particular, put Zelenskyy and European leaders on edge.",
      "But the two European officials and three other people briefed on Wednesday\u2019s call said all the leaders agreed that Ukraine must be included in negotiations and should be the one to decide what territorial concessions it might be willing to make. They also said the leaders were united in their belief that if Putin does not agree to a ceasefire, Trump will likely levy new sanctions on Russia.",
      "Two additional people familiar with Wednesday\u2019s call said European leaders left feeling positive about Trump\u2019s plans for his meeting with Putin. One of them said achieving a ceasefire is expected to be the priority for Trump in the meeting. The other person expressed confidence that Ukrainian territory would not be negotiated without Ukraine.",
      "A European official said there was still concern that the president could shift his position yet again once he is in the room with Putin, especially as he has so far proven reluctant to put concrete pressure on Russia and follow through on threats of additional sanctions.",
      "\u201cSometimes these positions change and get revised in a matter of hours,\u201d one European official said.",
      "European governments and Ukraine are also anxious about how the aftermath of the meeting would be handled, that European official said, and whether the details of what was discussed or agreed would be clearly explained or addressed in a joint statement.",
      "In response to a request for comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement: \"The White House does not discuss details of the President\u2019s private diplomatic conversations. However, President Trump has been clear that he wants to end this war and stop the killing, and Friday\u2019s meeting with President Putin will serve as an important moment in this process.\u201d",
      "Trump said Wednesday after the call that it was \u201cvery good\u201d and suggested that another meeting involving Zelenskyy could quickly follow his sit-down with Putin.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a very good chance that we\u2019re going to have a second meeting, which will be more productive than the first, because the first is I\u2019m going to find out where we are and what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cI would like to do it almost immediately, and we\u2019ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy and myself, if they\u2019d like to have me there.\u201d",
      "The president also said Russia will face \u201csevere consequences\u201d if Putin doesn\u2019t agree to end the war.",
      "Vice President JD Vance assured Zelenskyy and European allies on the call that the U.S. would not negotiate with Russia about a solution for the war in Ukraine without Ukraine or without Europe, according to two German government officials involved.",

It took courage and bravery to take the stand and confront her attacker to hold him accountable.\"",

    "summary": "The IDF said it killed a man in Gaza posing as an Al Jazeera journalist, but the network said Anas al-Sharif was a journalist and that he and four other staff members were killed in a targeted Israeli airstrike.",
    "story": [
      "One of Gaza's most prominent journalists was killed along with four others in a targeted Israeli airstrike on Sunday, the network said.",
      "Anas al-Sharif's death has been condemned by the United Nations, rights organizations and journalism advocacy groups, one of which warned last month that he was being targeted with a smear campaign by the Israeli military after he cried on air over starvation in Gaza.",
      "Qatari-owned pan-Arab Al Jazeera reported that al-Sharif; another journalist, Mohammed Qreiqeh; and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa were killed \u201cin a targeted Israeli strike on a tent housing journalists in Gaza City.\u201d",
      "In a separate statement, the Al Jazeera Media Network said al-Sharif and his colleagues were stationed opposite the Al-Shifa Hospital complex.",
      "Calling it \u201canother blatant and premeditated attack on press freedom\u201d by Israel, the statement said it was \u201ca desperate attempt to silence the voices exposing the impending seizure and occupation of Gaza.\u201d It added that it held both Israel\u2019s military and government \u201cresponsible for deliberately targeting and assassinating its journalists.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that al-Sharif was \u201cthe head of a terrorist cell in the Hamas terrorist organization and was responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops.\u201d",
      "It added that it had \u201cpreviously disclosed intelligence information and many documents found in the Gaza Strip\u201d that it said confirm that al-Sharif was a member of Hamas.",
      "On Monday, the Israeli military did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for evidence that he was a terrorist.",
      "Both al-Sharif and Al Jazeera have previously denied accusations that he was a terrorist.",
      "In October 2024, the IDF shared a photo on X of al-Sharif and five other Al Jazeera journalists it claimed were \u201cHamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists.\u201d The Al Jazeera Media Network called the claims \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cfabricated accusations.\u201d",
      "\u201cAl Jazeera fear these allegations may serve as a pretext for further violence against the journalists, mirroring the tragic fates of other media professionals targeted and killed by Israeli occupation forces,\u201d the media network said at the time.",
      "In a July 24 video, Israel\u2019s army spokesperson Avichay Adraee attacked Al Jazeera and accused al-Sharif of being part of Hamas\u2019 military wing, The Associated Press reported.",
      "This prompted the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists to warn that it was \u201cgravely worried\u201d about al-Sharif. In a statement it said he was \u201cbeing targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign, which he believes is a precursor to his assassination.\u201d",
      "Condemning the death of al-Sharif and his colleagues on Monday, CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah, accused Israel of \"murdering the messengers,\" adding that it \"made no claims that any of the other journalists were terrorists. That\u2019s murder. Plain and simple.\u201d",
      "The Committee to Protect Journalists says that at least 186 journalists have been killed in the conflict since the start of the war.",
      "In a separate statement the Foreign Press Association also said it was \"outraged.\"",
      "The U.N. human rights office also called a \"grave breach of international humanitarian law,\u201d while Philippe Lazzarini of the United Nations refugees agency said he was \"horrified\" by their deaths.",
      "Al Jazeera, a network funded by Qatar\u2019s government, said that 10 of its staff have been killed by Israel since Israel launched the war in Gaza in 2023.",
      "Among the dead was 27-year-old correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul and cameraman Rami al-Rifi, who were killed last summer. Freelancer Hossam Shabat was killed in an Israeli airstrike in March.",
      "Like al-Sharif, Shabat was among the six that Israel accused of being members of militant groups last October.",
      "Blocked in Israel, the country's forces raided Al Jazeera's offices in the occupied West Bank last year, ordering them closed.",
      "And in May 2024, Israel\u2019s government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voted to shut down the channel\u2019s local offices. Netanyahu at the time called it an incitement channel.",
      "Al Jazeera has repeatedly denied the allegations of incitement made by Israel.",
      "Israel launched the offensive in Gaza, targeting Hamas, after the Hamas-led terror attacks against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 251 people were taken hostage. Many of the targets of those attacks were civilians, including people attending a music festival.",
      "Over 61,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the offensive began, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run enclave."

    "published": "Wed, 13 Aug 2025 15:33:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Alternative for Germany has joined France's National Rally and Reform U.K. in becoming the most popular party in its country, according to polls.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 For the first time in modern history, far-right and populist parties are simultaneously topping the polls in Europe\u2019s three main economies of Germany, France and Britain.",
      "A poll Tuesday showed Alternative for Germany \u2014 which is under surveillance by the country\u2019s intelligence services over suspected extremism \u2014 is now the most favored by voters. The survey by broadcaster RTL put the AfD at 26%, ahead of the ruling Christian Democrats at 24%.",
      "This is a high watermark for the European far right, a once fringe movement whose virulently anti-immigration, anti-Islam and culture-war politics were shunned by the mainstream just a decade ago. Today, these parties have developed deep ties with President Donald Trump and his Republican allies, who openly cite nationalists such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n as inspirations on policy and tactics.",
      "For years, France\u2019s National Rally has consistently led polls ahead of the country\u2019s next presidential election in 2027. And Britain\u2019s Reform U.K., led by Trump ally and friend Nigel Farage, has since April topped most polls there.",
      "Far-right parties have been elected over the past few years into the governments of Italy, Hungary and elsewhere. The center right and the center left have hemorrhaged votes amid high inflation, fears over immigration and collapsing faith in institutions \u2014 all familiar issues in America, too.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s polling milestone is \u201ca sign of the power of populism, disinformation and the failure of established parties to understand what is happening,\u201d said Nic Cheeseman, a professor of democracy and international development at England\u2019s University of Birmingham.",
      "Though the far right has been making gains for the past decade, Cheeseman believes the polls showing the far right leading Europe\u2019s top three economies is \u201ca first \u2014 at least in modern times.\u201d",
      "There is no guarantee that London, Berlin and Paris will be ruled by far-right parties; these countries\u2019 next elections are not until 2029, 2029 and 2027 respectively. These groups are all polling in the 20s and 30s percentage-wise, enough to lead polls in Europe\u2019s multiparty systems but not enough to govern alone outside of a coalition.",
      "Most of Europe\u2019s politicians on this former fringe reject the \u201cfar right\u201d label, with its historical connotations of the Nazism that marauded the continent 80 years ago. Many scholars say these parties nevertheless fit the academic model, defined by nativism \u2014 the idea that perceived \u201cnon-native\u201d groups threaten their social fabric \u2014 and harsh punishments for criminality.",
      "The roots of the far-right surge lie in the world financial crisis of 2008, which prompted government to cut budgets for public services and lowered living standards, some experts say, compounded by the Arab Spring of 2011 that birthed civil war in Syria and a mass refugee crisis in Europe four years later.",
      "More recent societal stressors such as the coronavirus pandemic and war in Ukraine have further increased the allure of populism, according to Hans-Jakob Schindler, the senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit international group. But populist parties in Europe have also harnessed social media more powerfully than their more centrist opponents, he said.",
      "\u201cThey are masters of using social media much better than any of the more established parties,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have easy solutions to complex problems\u201d \u2014 as he says populist parties do \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s easier to communicate than complex political issues that the actual parties, who do politics rather than just doing populism, will have to deal with.\u201d"

      "U.N.-backed investigators say they have found significant evidence of \u201csystematic torture\u201d at Myanmar detention centers, where the military government is holding children as young as 2 years old as proxies for their parents.",
      "The Southeast Asian nation of about 54 million people has been mired in turmoil since 2021, when democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi was overthrown by the military. The coup set off mass protests across the country that were violently suppressed, followed by a nationwide armed resistance movement that has displaced millions of people.",
      "Investigators said Tuesday there was evidence of \u201ca continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities\u201d across Myanmar, with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by government security forces and affiliated militias as well as armed opposition groups.",
      "That includes an increase in crimes committed against those in detention, many of whom are being held without due process, said Nicholas Koumjian, head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve documented torture against those in detention, including beatings and electric shocks, strangulations, pulling out fingernails, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,\u201d he told reporters in Geneva as his team released its annual report.",
      "Koumjian said investigators had seen evidence that children as young as 2 years old were being detained, often in place of their parents if they are accused of being associated with the opposition and cannot be found.",
      "\u201cSome of the detained children have been subjected to torture, ill-treatment or sexual and gender-based crimes,\u201d the report says.",
      "Myanmar\u2019s military government has detained about 30,000 people in the past four years, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group that tracks arrests in the country.",
      "The Myanmar military could not be reached for comment. It has denied any atrocities are taking place and blamed \u201cterrorists\u201d for unrest.",
      "The 16-page report, which covers a one-year period up to June 30, draws on more than 1,300 sources, including nearly 600 eyewitness testimonies, photographs, videos, documents, maps and forensic evidence.",
      "Koumjian said the Myanmar military appeared to be increasing its use of airstrikes as it loses control of more territory. They continued even after a devastating earthquake in March, he said, often against \u201cblatantly civilian targets\u201d such as schools, hospitals and places of worship.",
      "\u201cOften there\u2019s no military target that we can identify anywhere in the area that could have been the intent of the airstrike,\u201d he said.",
      "Koumjian said investigators were working to determine how the airstrikes were ordered, who was in the chain of command and who flew the planes.",
      "In addition, he said, there is growing evidence of crimes committed by opposition forces, including summary executions of captured fighters from other armed groups.",
      "The team is also still investigating the 2017 Rohingya refugee crisis, during which more than 700,000 people from the mostly Muslim ethnic minority fled a military crackdown in Buddhist-majority Myanmar for neighboring Bangladesh. Along with other ethnic groups, the remaining Rohingya population is again in danger as they are persecuted by the Arakan Army rebel group that now has effective control of Rakhine state, their ancestral home.",
      "Koumjian said investigators had made progress in identifying some of the people responsible for crimes in Myanmar, including commanders overseeing detention facilities, and that \u201cwe stand ready to support any jurisdictions willing and able to prosecute these crimes.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law,\u201d he said in a news release.",
      "The work of Myanmar investigators is already being used in cases before the International Criminal Court (ICC), the International Court of Justice and in Argentina. In November, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of Myanmar\u2019s military government, for crimes committed against the Rohingya.",
      "Min Aung Hlaing tightened his grip on power last month in an administrative restructuring as the junta said it was ending the state of emergency it declared in 2021. A general election is planned for December but faces a widespread boycott by critics who say it will be neither free nor fair."

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration released its new, drastically scaled-down version of the State Department\u2019s annual human rights report after months of delay Tuesday. The administration\u2019s assessment of human rights abuses in some countries, which is one-tenth as long as last year\u2019s report, reaches notably different conclusions and dedicates no sections to abuses against women or LGBTQ people.",
      "The report also places a new focus on restrictions of freedom of expression by U.S. adversaries and allies alike.",
      "Amanda Klasing, Amnesty International USA\u2019s national director of government relations and advocacy, said the Trump administration had engaged in highly selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries.",
      "\u201cWe have criticized past reports when warranted, but have never seen reports quite like this,\u201d Klasing said in a statement. \u201cNever before have the reports gone this far in prioritizing an administration\u2019s political agenda over a consistent and truthful accounting of human rights violations around the world \u2014 softening criticism in some countries while ignoring violations in others.\u201d",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce defended the administration\u2019s version of the report, which U.S. diplomats have compiled for nearly 50 years under a congressional mandate to measure countries\u2019 adherence to internationally recognized human rights.",
      "\u201cThe Human Rights Report has been restructured in a way that removes redundancy, increases report readability, and is responsive to the legislative mandates that underpin the report, rather than an expansive list of politically biased demands and assertions,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cIndividual reports are more readable, objective, true to their statutory origins, and more useful than ever before.\u201d",
      "Criticism of Europe",
      "In the United Kingdom, France, Germany and other European countries, the Trump administration concluded that the human rights situation \u201cworsened during the year.\u201d The report cited restrictions on freedom of expression, as well as reports of \u201ccrimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.\u201d",
      "In Germany, the report found \u201climits on the speech of groups it deemed extremist.\u201d In France, the State Department found \u201csome limitations on freedom of speech.\u201d And the assessment listed restrictions on political speech in the U.K. it deemed \u201chateful\u201d or \u201coffensive.\u201d",
      "The concerns were similar to those Vice President JD Vance expressed in a speech to the Munich Security Conference in February. Vance accused European Union leaders of suppressing free speech, particularly that off far-right groups.",
      "Asked by reporters about the Trump administration\u2019s review of visa applicants\u2019 social media accounts, Bruce said: \u201cWe consider freedom of expression to be a foundational component of a functioning democracy. Societies are strengthened by free expression of opinion and government censorship is intolerable in a free society.\u201d",
      "Support for Brazil's former president",
      "The human rights situation also declined in Brazil last year, the Trump administration concluded, citing court rulings that it called \u201cbroad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe government undermined democratic debate by restricting access to online content deemed to \u2018undermine democracy,\u2019 disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro as well as journalists and elected politicians, often in secret proceedings that lacked due process guarantees,\u201d the report says.",
      "Bolsonaro is currently on trial for allegedly plotting to assassinate his rivals to remain in office despite his loss in the 2022 election.",
      "The report also criticizes Supreme Federal Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who has overseen Bolsonaro\u2019s court case, saying he \u201cpersonally ordered the suspension of more than 100 user profiles on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), disproportionately suppressing the speech of advocates of former president Jair Bolsonaro.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently sanctioned de Moraes, revoking U.S. visas for him and members of his family.",
      "Questioning a South African law",
      "The report found the human rights situation had \u201csignificantly worsened\u201d in South Africa, which Trump has repeatedly criticized since he returned to office. That was in sharp contrast with the State Department human rights report the Biden administration issued last year, which found no significant changes in human rights in South Africa.",
      "The report called the Expropriation Act, a law that attempts to address the disparity in land ownership between white and Black South Africans, \u201ca substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has publicly decried the law, which allows the South African government to expropriate land \u2014 in some cases without compensation \u2014 in instances where it is unused or there is a public interest in its redistribution. Earlier this year, the administration resettled 59 white South Africans as refugees in the United States as it blocked refugee admissions from almost all other countries.",
      "\u201cThe government did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,\u201d the report said, \u201cincluding inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.\u201d",
      "No 'significant' abuses in El Salvador",
      "The report said that in El Salvador, which imprisoned hundreds of migrants from the United States at the request of the Trump administration, there were \u201cno credible reports of significant human rights abuses.\u201d",
      "But several Venezuelan migrants who had been imprisoned in El Salvador\u2019s notorious CECOT prison told NBC News they had experienced physical and psychological torture. One man said he was sexually assaulted.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s human rights report on El Salvador last year was four times longer than the Trump administration\u2019s. It listed several significant human rights issues in the country, including credible reports of \u201cunlawful or arbitrary killings; enforced disappearance; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by security forces and harsh and life-threatening prison conditions.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s report also removed the section on Indigenous peoples and made no mention of elections or political participation in El Salvador.",
      "Shorter passages on Israel, the West Bank and Gaza",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s reports on Israel, the West Bank and Gaza were also dramatically shorter and had significantly less documentation of abuses by the Israeli government, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas than the Biden administration reports did last year.",
      "In assessing Israel, the Trump administration cited reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, enforced disappearance and degrading treatment of Palestinians by Israeli officials but emphasized that they resulted from the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas. The State Department\u2019s findings also concluded that the Israeli government \u201ctook several credible steps to identify officials who committed human rights abuses, with multiple trials pending at year\u2019s end.\u201d",
      "The report listed significant human rights abuses by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, including \u201carbitrary or unlawful killings; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; arbitrary arrest or detention; serious restrictions on freedom of expression and trafficking in persons, including forced labor; and existence of the worst forms of child labor.\u201d",
      "The report also included a detailed description of abuses by Hamas in Gaza, including, \u201cunlawful killings, severe physical abuses and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d",
      "Regarding human rights abuses by Israeli security forces in the West Bank and Gaza, the report said simply that \u201cthere have been reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings; and serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom.\u201d But it again added that \u201cIsraeli authorities took steps to identify and punish officials or civilians accused of committing human rights abuses.\u201d And it did point out that human rights groups \u201cfrequently criticized authorities for not adequately pursuing investigations and disciplinary actions.\u201d",
      "The report made no direct mention of the Israeli government\u2019s restrictions on humanitarian aid into Gaza or documented reports of starvation among some Palestinians this year. But it did highlight that in the West Bank, incidents of Israeli violence against Palestinians and their property reached their highest daily average figure since the United Nations started recording data in 2005.",
      "War crimes allegations against Russia",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s assessment of human rights in Russia is less than half as long as the same assessment in the Biden administration\u2019s report. Both reports cited allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity and abuses by Russian forces and officials in the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "The assessment also pointed to human rights groups\u2019 concerns domestically, among them that Russian officials used new laws to punish dissent and limit independent expression. It did not dedicate a section to Russian government corruption as the Biden administration did.",
      "The new report said that \u201cRussia\u2019s occupation and purported annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and four oblasts in eastern Ukraine affected significantly and negatively the human rights situation there.\u201d It also described \u201ccredible reports of politically motivated arrests, detentions, and trials of Ukrainian citizens in Russia, many of whom claimed to have been tortured.\u201d",
      "It also called the deportation of thousands of civilians to Russia, including children, a crime against humanity."

      "The foundation's executive director, Johnnie Moore, said Hamas is largely responsible for the killings and dismissed news reports about people dying by Israeli gunfire.",
      "\u201cWe have not seen the Israeli military do anything that remotely aligns with some of these accusations,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt is a quite evident fact that Hamas has killed intentionally probably hundreds of people in proximity not to just our sites, to U.N. distribution sites, as a means of sort of misattributing those attacks either to the IDF or to being in proximity to GHF,\u201d he added, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "To address escalating concerns over the humanitarian crisis, synagogues across Jewish movements in the United States have organized roundtables with the executive director of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "At an event with GHF hosted last month by Sinai Temple in Los Angeles, reactions were mixed, according to Sherman, the rabbi, who led the discussion.",
      "Some people were shocked that an organization that has come under so much criticism was allowed to present its case. Others appreciated hearing directly from people on the ground.",
      "\u201cHow do you block evil from your midst while also feeding the hungry and supporting the orphan and widow?\u201d Sherman said after the roundtable, referring to Psalm 146. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s an impossible task, and I give credit to somebody who is at least trying to do that.\u201d",
      "Polling suggests Jewish Americans are divided over Netanyahu\u2019s handling of the war. According to a Pew Research Center report, 53% of Jewish Americans say they lack confidence in his leadership, while 45% say they have confidence. About 6 million Jews live in the United States, or 2% of the population, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "The poll was conducted in April, before GHF began its operations in Gaza.",
      "Supporters of Netanyahu\u2019s government, including several Jewish American organizations, have said Hamas is spreading misleading information about who is to blame for ongoing violence at aid sites, a claim Hamas has repeatedly denied. They have also criticized detractors for losing focus on the remaining Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas.",
      "\u201cAll of this can just be stopped anytime if Hamas puts down its weapons,\u201d said Orthodox Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization that supports Netanyahu\u2019s government.",
      "An emerging concern echoed by several organizations and rabbis is that Netanyahu\u2019s position is not creating a safer Israel or global environment for Jewish people. Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of nonprofit advocacy organization J Street, said the ongoing violence is exposing Israelis and Palestinians to unnecessary bloodshed.",
      "J Street, which supports a two-state solution, opposed Netanyahu years before the war.",
      "\u201cIf you say to people you must be pro-Palestinian or pro-Israel, then we\u2019re condemning ourselves and our kids to a never-ending conflict,\u201d Ben-Ami said Monday.",
      "But according to Rabbi Ari Lev Fornari of Kol Tzedek, a Reconstructionist synagogue in Philadelphia, the war is creating an \u201cexistential rupture\u201d that is pitting friends and family members against one another.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s catastrophic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re wrestling with the very question \u2018Do we belong to each other?\u2019\u201d",
      "Fornari was among more than 40 people arrested outside Trump Tower in a rally organized by IfNotNow, a group that opposes the war in Gaza Strip, in New York City earlier this month as they shouted for the United States to stop arming Israel and feed Gaza. He was arrested for investigation of blocking traffic and obstruction, his third arrest since the war started on Oct. 7, 2023, he said.",
      "Some posters and signs displayed outside Trump Tower referred to an ancient maxim about the moral obligation to speak out against injustice, Fornari said.",
      "\u201cIt says anyone who has the power to speak out and chooses not to do so is responsible for it,\u201d he said.",
      "Rabbi Jill Jacobs, the CEO of T\u2019ruah, a rabbinic human rights organization, said she supported Israel\u2019s military response to Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack in 2023, which killed 1,200 people and led to the taking of 250 hostages. The strike, the worst one-day attack on Jews since the Holocaust, shocked the world.",
      "Since then, more than 61,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, and much of the territory has been destroyed.",
      "Jacobs began questioning Netanyahu\u2019s strategy as more and more civilians in Gaza were killed, she said. In July, she denounced American Jewish leaders who had not spoken out against the humanitarian crisis unfolding thousands of miles away.",
      "\u201cPrivately, Jewish lay leaders are anguished over Gaza. Publicly, they fear being labeled antisemitic,\u201d she wrote in an opinion column in The Forward, a Jewish American newspaper.",
      "Jacobs has been called antisemitic by other Jewish people who support Netanyahu and shunned by legacy Jewish organizations, she said. Some of it, she said, comes from a legitimate fear of prejudice.",
      "In May, two Israeli Embassy staffers were killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., and a Colorado pro-Israeli hostages group was attacked with two Molotov cocktails in June. There have also been reports of anti-Jewish slurs and signs at college campuses and pro-Palestinian protests across the country.",
      "The cultural fallout has been playing out in living rooms and across kitchen tables. Sonya Meyerson-Knox, a spokesperson for the anti-Zionist group Jewish Voice for Peace, which has opposed the war since 2023, said a member was uninvited to Shabbat family dinners because of differing opinions about the war.",
      "The group was suspended from several campuses, including Columbia University\u2019s, over allegations it intimidated Jewish students and made them feel unsafe during pro-Palestinian protests last year. Jewish Voice for Peace maintains that its views are not antisemitic.",
      "\u201cIt is not unique in Jewish history for Jews to be in fierce disagreement with each other,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is unique is that there seems to be an effort to weaponize one-half of our community against the other.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Russian forces may have punched a small but significant hole through Ukraine\u2019s front lines, Kyiv-supporting military analysts warned Tuesday, a development that could give Vladimir Putin a boost ahead of his Alaska summit with President Donald Trump.",
      "Advanced units have pushed farther into Ukrainian-held territory in the Donetsk region, creating two narrow, 10-mile prongs near the battlefield hot spot town of Pokrovsk, according to watchdogs including Ukraine's Deep State and Washington's Institute for the Study of War, two of the top open-source teams tracking the war's battlefield developments.",
      "Expert observers supportive or at least sympathetic to Kyiv are deeply worried that these forays could expand into a full-scale breakthrough for the Kremlin. Already claiming he is winning this war, and refusing to stop fighting unless Ukraine surrenders, Putin could use such a development to lobby for an even more favorable peace deal in Alaska.",
      "\u201cGuys. We are in trouble here,\u201d Rima Ziuraitis, an American enlisted as a medic in the Ukrainian armed forces, posted to X. \u201cWhile Putin and Trump keep everyone distracted, Russia has broken through our lines in Pokrovsk. The situation is critical.\u201d",
      "Though small, the Russian breakthroughs represent a far quicker land grab than either side has managed in months. The concern for Ukraine is that Russia would be able to expand outward into poorly defended parts of Donetsk. The advance may have also cut off a crucial resupply highway to Ukraine\u2019s \u201cfortress\u201d city of Kramatorsk, according to those watching the troop movements.",
      "Pasi Paroinen, an analyst with Finland\u2019s Black Bird Group, which tracks the conflict, told NBC News that if the Russians do break through and consolidate, \u201cit could be very bad for the Ukrainians.\u201d",
      "This push may have been timed ahead of the Putin-Trump summit, he added.",
      "\u201cThe Russians have had a tendency to intensify military operations in support of ongoing negotiations so the current events would fit into that picture quite well,\u201d Paroinen said, adding that \u201cwe don\u2019t have enough information yet\u201d to be sure.",
      "The next 24-48 hours will likely be \u201ccrucial\u201d in whether Ukraine is able to stanch the Russian advance before Moscow reinforces these advanced units, he posted to X earlier. \u201cClearly the Ukrainians have a crisis on their hands,\u201d he wrote.",
      "A Ukrainian military spokesperson told NBC News that breakthroughs were being made only by small groups of Russian \u201cinfiltrators\u201d \u2014 who are being quickly found and \u201cdestroyed\u201d \u2014 rather than larger units capable of taking and controlling territory.",
      "Viktor Tregubov, spokesperson of Ukraine\u2019s \u201cDnipro\u201d strategic group of troops, downplayed the severity of the maneuvers.",
      "\u201cOf course, the situation there is and remains difficult, and the fighting in this region is the most intense compared to other sections of the front line,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cHowever, the Ukrainian troops are making every effort to ensure that even those groups of Russians who managed to infiltrate through the first line are destroyed as soon as possible \u2014 which is what happens.\u201d",
      "The severity of the situation was made clear by the 1st Azov Corps \u2014 seen as among the most adept fighters Ukraine has \u2014 announcing Tuesday it had been deployed to the region.",
      "All eyes on Alaska",
      "The question of who is winning the war will be a key point in Trump\u2019s summit with Putin on Friday.",
      "The American leader told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday that he would know probably within the \u201cfirst two minutes\u201d whether his Russian counterpart wanted peace or not.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has not been invited \u2014 \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a part of it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s been there for 3 1/2 years \u2014 nothing happened\u201d \u2014 creating Europe-wide panic that its and Kyiv\u2019s interests will be disregarded by Washington and Moscow."

      "The man, Wei Qiang Lin, \u201clabeled the boxes as containing \u2018plastic animal toys,\u2019 among other things,\u201d the DOJ said Monday in a statement. \u201cLaw enforcement intercepted the turtles during a border inspection and observed them bound and taped inside knotted socks within the shipping boxes,\u201d it added.",

      "The animals Lin smuggled from mid-2023 to late 2024 were valued at $1.4 million, the Department of Justice said.",
      "Lin faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a fine up to $250,000 or twice the gain or loss from the illegal activity when he is sentenced on Dec. 23, according to the DOJ.",
      "\u201cAs part of his plea, Lin also agreed to abandon any property interest in the reptiles seized during the investigation,\u201d the department said.",
      "In a similar case in March, another Chinese national, Sai Keung Tin, also known as Ricky Tin, was sentenced to 30 months in prison for smuggling more than 2,100 eastern box turtles, the DOJ said at the time.",
      "The animals were also hidden in socks and packed in boxes labeled as almonds and chocolate cookies. Authorities estimated at the time that each turtle could have been sold for $2,000, bringing the total value of the smuggled reptiles to $4.2 million."

      "The Trump administration has agreed to once again delay the deadline when tariffs on Chinese imports would rise as discussions between the two sides continue.",
      "The new deadline would be Nov. 10.",
      "\u201cAll other elements of the Agreement will remain the same,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "In a statement accompanying an executive order, the White House said the administration would be holding \u201congoing negotiations\u201d with China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, to \u201cresolve trade disputes and strengthen economic ties.\u201d",
      "\u201cEach round of negotiations with the Chinese has built on each other, further strengthening economic cooperation,\u201d the White House added.",
      "A joint government statement carried by Chinese state media said China would adopt and maintain all necessary measures to suspend or remove non-tariff measures.",
      "For companies and consumers, another pause means continued uncertainty as President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff regime enters its fifth month.",
      "Last week, import taxes went into effect for dozens of countries. Prices have ticked up in the United States while existing tariffs on imports from China and others work their way into the economy, with companies eating much of the higher costs and consumers absorbing some. Trump has downplayed inflation concerns and lauded the tens of billions of dollars in federal revenue from the levies.",
      "This is the second time the Trump administration has delayed imposing even higher tariffs on China, which is one of America\u2019s largest trading partners. In 2024, the United States imported more than $438 billion worth of Chinese goods, including everything from clothing to electronics to toys.",
      "While there is no deal in hand, there has been movement on a few fronts. Just days ago, Trump authorized American tech companies Nvidia and AMD to resume selling some of their artificial intelligence semiconductors to China. China has also reportedly eased some restrictions on exports of rare earth metals. Those were key issues for both sides.",
      "Trump\u2019s back-and-forth with China over tariffs started just days after he re-entered office. In early February, he imposed a 10% tariff on all imports from China, which quickly retaliated with higher tariffs of its own. Then, on April 2, Trump said he would slap a 34% tariff on China.",
      "A week later, after China hiked its tariffs on U.S. goods to 84%, Trump said on Truth Social: \u201cBased on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World\u2019s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately.\u201d That brought U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to a total of 145% versus 125% in Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods, amounting to a mutual trade embargo.",
      "Seeking to defuse the tension, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with their Chinese counterparts in Geneva in early May. Following those talks, both countries lowered their tariffs by 115 percentage points for 90 days, to 30% on Chinese goods and 10% on U.S. goods.",
      "Just weeks later, Trump said on Truth Social that \u201cChina, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US.\u201d U.S. officials later said that China was \u201cslow rolling\u201d the delivery of rare earths.",
      "Bessent and Greer met again with their counterparts, namely Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, in London in mid-June. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also joined those talks, which yielded positive language.",
      "\u201cThe two largest economies in the world have reached a handshake for a framework,\u201d Lutnick said at the conclusion of the London talks. Since that meeting, the details of that framework agreement have not been released or published by either government.",
      "A full-fledged trade deal with China remains elusive despite at least seven days of face-to-face talks this year between high- ranking officials on both sides.",
      "\u201cBeijing will be happy to keep the U.S.-China negotiation going, but it is unlikely to make concessions,\u201d said William Yang, a senior Northeast Asia analyst for the International Crisis Group who is based in Taiwan.",
      "\u201cChina believes momentum is on its side because Trump has a stronger desire to sign a deal with Beijing so that he can claim victory and secure a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the fall,\u201d Yang said.",
      "Such a summit could take place around the Oct. 31-Nov. 1 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea, which both leaders might attend."
