      "A judge has ordered a man who authorities say crashed his car through the front gate of Jennifer Aniston\u2019s home to face a competency review",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A judge on Thursday ordered that a man who authorities say crashed his car through the front gate of Jennifer Aniston's home must go through mental-health court to determine whether he is competent to face felony stalking and vandalism charges.",
      "Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, 48, appeared shirtless and wrapped in a blanket when he appeared behind glass in a custody area of a Los Angeles courtroom. Carwyle did not speak during the proceedings; his attorney entered a not guilty plea on his behalf.",
      "Prosecutors say the Mississippi man had been harassing Aniston with a flood of voicemail, email and social media messages for two years before driving into her gate on Monday.",
      "Judge Keith L. Schwartz doubted whether Carwyle would understand him when a prosecutor requested that the defendant, who will remain in jail, be ordered not to get near Aniston.",
      "Carwyle's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Toral Malik, said \u201cI don\u2019t believe him staying away from Ms. Aniston will be an issue at this time.\"",
      "But at a prosecutors' insistence, Schwartz issued the order anyway.",
      "\u201cYou are not to have any contact with Jennifer Aniston under any conditions,\u201d the judge said.",
      "Authorities say Aniston was home when Carwyle crashed his Chrysler PT Cruiser through the gate of her home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood, causing major damage, prosecutors said. A security guard stopped him in her driveway before police arrived and arrested him.",
      "There were no reports of anyone being injured.",
      "An Aniston attorney who attended Thursday's hearing declined comment, and other representatives of the \u201cFriends\u201d star have not responded to comment requests.",
      "Carwyle also faces an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm. If convicted he could get up to three years in prison.",
      "Malik not speak to reporters outside court.",
      "Aniston bought the midcentury mansion on a 3.4-acre lot for about $21 million in 2012, according to reporting by Architectural Digest.",
      "She became one of the biggest stars in television in her 10 years on NBC's \u201cFriends.\u201d Aniston won an Emmy Award for best lead actress in a comedy for the role, and she has been nominated for nine more. She currently stars in \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Apple TV+.",

      "A former model has testified that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her when she was 16 years old, calling it the most \u201chorrifying thing I ever experienced\u201d to that point",
      "NEW YORK -- A former model tearfully testified Thursday that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her when she was 16 years old, calling it the most \u201chorrifying thing I ever experienced\u201d to that point.",
      "Kaja (KEYE\u2019-ah) Sokola, an aspiring actor at the time, told jurors at Weinstein\u2019s #MeToo retrial that the onetime movie honcho put his hand inside her underwear and made her touch his genitals at a Manhattan apartment in 2002.",
      "Sokola said she saw Weinstein\u2019s eyes \u2014 \u201cblack and scary\u201d \u2014 staring at her in a bathroom mirror as it happened.",
      "Afterward, she said, he told her to keep quiet about what had happened, touting that he'd made the careers of A-listers like Gwyneth Paltrow and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and that he could help her Hollywood dreams come true.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d never been in a situation like this,\u201d Sokola testified, as riveted jurors scribbled notes. \u201cI felt stupid and ashamed and like it\u2019s my fault for putting myself in this position.\u201d",
      "Weinstein is not charged with any crime in connection with the alleged assault, which Sokola first detailed in a lawsuit a few years ago. The timing put it outside the statute of limitations for criminal charges.",
      "Sokola is testifying because Weinstein is charged with forcibly performing oral sex on her at a Manhattan hotel four years later, around the time of her 20th birthday. Prosecutors say it happened after Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra in the film \u201cThe Nanny Diaries.\u201d",
      "Sokola reported the allegation to authorities a few days into Weinstein\u2019s first trial in 2020, but was not a part of that case. Prosecutors added her to the retrial, joining two women who testified in the first case, after his conviction was overturned last year.",
      "Weinstein, now 73, looked down and away from Sokola as she recounted the earlier allegation, pressing his left thumb and index finger against his face like a shield.",
      "Sokola testified that she first met the then-studio boss at a Manhattan restaurant in 2002, three or four days before the alleged assault. During the short chat, she said, Weinstein asked her if she wanted to be an actress.",
      "A few days later, she said, he invited her to lunch \u2014 ostensibly to talk about acting \u2014 but instead took her to an apartment, where led her into a bedroom and then a bathroom, instructed her to take her top off and assaulted her.",
      "\u201cHe told me to talk my clothes off and I didn\u2019t want to do that. I was panicking,\u201d Sokola testified. \u201cAnd then he said that if I want to be an actress, that\u2019s what actors do in films, so I should get used to it. If a director says you have you take your clothes off, you have to take your clothes off. I was scared. I was scared of him.\u201d",
      "Sokola avoided looking at Weinstein as she walked to the witness stand \u2014 testifying for a second day after detailing on Wednesday her upbringing in Poland, entr\u00e9e into modeling and her professional career as a psychotherapist and author who recently launched a film production company. She peered briefly at Weinstein when asked Thursday to point him out in court.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "His lawyers contend that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting movie and TV opportunities, and the defense has emphasized that the women stayed in contact with him for a while after the alleged assaults. The women, meanwhile, say the then-producer used the prospect of show business work to prey on them.",
      "Sokola sued Weinstein after industry whispers about his behavior toward women became a chorus of public accusations in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. Prosecutors have said Sokola eventually received $3.5 million in compensation.",
      "Prosecutors have said they began investigating Sokola\u2019s claims in 2020 but set the inquiry aside after Weinstein was convicted. They revived the investigation after New York\u2019s highest court reversed his conviction.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers fought unsuccessfully to keep Sokola out of the retrial, accusing prosecutors of \u201csmuggling an additional charge into the case\u201d to try to bolster other accusers\u2019 credibility.",
      "One of the others, Miriam Haley, testified last week that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser in the case, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify later.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name sexual assault accusers without their permission, which Haley, Mann and Sokola have given.",

      "The band, which by the 1970s had become one of the world\u2019s biggest touring bands, easily filling the largest U.S. stadiums, will play their first gig in Florida on Aug. 16, with further dates in cities including New York, Toronto, Los Angeles and Vancouver, before a final date in Las Vegas on Sept. 28.",
      "\u201cEvery musician\u2019s dream in the early '60s was to make it big in the U.S. charts,\" Daltrey said. \u201cFor The Who, that dream came true in 1967 and our lives were changed forever.\u201d",
      "The band went from performing club shows to headlining the Woodstock festival in the U.S. and becoming one of the biggest box-office draw in the world. The band were inducted into the Rock n\u2019 Roll Hall Of Fame in 1990.",
      "Daltrey, 81, and Townshend, two years his junior, have been one of rock's most prolific double acts, surviving the deaths of drummer Keith Moon in 1978 and bass guitarist John Entwistle in 2002.",
      "\u201cToday, Roger and I still carry the banner for the late Keith Moon and John Entwistle, and, of course, all of our long-time Who fans,\" Townshend said. \u201cI must say that although the road has not always been enjoyable for me, it is usually easy: the best job I could ever have had. I keep coming back.\u201d",
      "Though Daltrey didn\u2019t write songs, he was able to channel Townsend\u2019s many and complicated moods \u2014 defiance and rage, vulnerability and desperation.",
      "Together, they forged some of rock\u2019s most defining sounds: the stuttering, sneering delivery of \u201cMy Generation,\u201d the anguished cry of \u201cThey\u2019re all wasted!\u201d from \u201cBaba O\u2019Reilly,\u201d and the all-time scream from \u201cWon\u2019t Get Fooled Again.\u201d",
      "Pre-sales will run from May 13 ahead of the general sale beginning May 16.",
      "\u201cWell, all good things must come to an end. It is a poignant time,\" Townshend said. \u201cFor me, playing to American audiences and those in Canada has always been incredible.\u201d",

      "Kali Uchis wrote the album that she knew her future self would need to listen to",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Kali Uchis wrote the album she knew her future self would need to listen to. The Grammy-winning artist unknowingly was crafting her own audible remedy.",
      "\u201cI really did make the music that I needed for my grieving process, for just the place that I\u2019m at in my life right now,\u201d she says of the album out Friday.",
      "\u201cSincerely,\u201d (yes, the title includes the comma) began as a collection of letters to herself, friends and loved ones but took on a deeper meaning as the Colombian American songwriter gave birth to her first child and processed her mother's recent death. The first single, \u201cSunshine & Rain...,\u201d includes a clip of Uchis' mother saying, \u201cGood morning, sunshine.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wanted to immortalize her in the project,\u201d said Uchis. \u201cI thought it was just a beautiful way to open the album.\u201d",
      "The 14-track album finds Uchis proudly wearing her heart on her sleeve with songs like \u201cDaggers!,\u201d where Uchis encourages a close friend to lean into self-love, or \u201cILYSMIH,\u201d which includes baby coos at the beginning and was written as she lay in her hospital bed with her newborn.",
      "Uchis hopes that after listening to her fifth full album, fans will feel more connected to themselves and more in touch with their emotions: \u201cI hope it will give them some type of solace.\"",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "UCHIS: I\u2019m a very deep feeler. I\u2019m very empathetic. I feel a lot. And I wanted to make a body of work that fully showed that vulnerability and that actually really dug deep into my heart in a way that none of my other albums ever had.",
      "I felt like I was ready to do that because I\u2019ve been making music long enough that I felt that it was that time for me, and then it just so happened that, shortly after working on the album, I became pregnant, which was such a big part of being able to feel even deeper than I ever have.",
      "UCHIS: It\u2019s crazy because a lot of times I feel, and especially with this album in particular, I felt that I really made music that my future self would need, that I didn\u2019t realize I was going to need at that time.",
      "The album is actually dedicated to my mom. My mom later ended up getting diagnosed, and she\u2019s no longer here. ... And so pretty much all of the songs ended up taking on a deeper meaning to me because of that and because of it being dedicated to her. ... At the time, I might not have even realized subconsciously that I was making all of this to heal myself.",
      "UCHIS: At one point, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna make sure each of these songs is like, this is my letter to the world, this is my letter to this person, this my letter to that, this one to myself.\u201d I tried to really conceptualize in a different way that I never have when making any other album. And then ... when my mom passed, a lot of what I had left from her is letters that she wrote to me, and so it ended up, like I said, just more and more reasons for me to realize that it was the correct title for the project.",
      "UCHIS: I never stick to one process, but one particular process that stuck out to me on a lot of the songs was that most of them were written with no music, just songs that came to me.",
      "For instance, \u201cILYSMIH\u201d \u2014 that one literally I was just recovering from labor, my son was sleeping next to me; I was still in my hospital bed when I got this idea for this song and started it, started recording it on my phone, started writing some lyrics down. ... There\u2019s one called \u201cAll I Can Say.\u201d I wrote that whole song in the car on the way to the studio. ... I try to just make beauty out of all of my experiences.",
      "UCHIS: Thematically, nature is kind of a reoccurring theme in my music because I am so inspired by nature and I feel nature is where God exists and nature is where a lot of my creativity just thrives.",
      "I feel like it just happened. Afterwards, I even thought, \u201cIs this too similar to what I\u2019ve already done?\u201d But \u2026 I just love the things that I love, and I just returned back to those nostalgic elements. I may branch out and try what people think is different sounds. Like on \u201cOrqu\u00eddeas,\u201d I did a lot of different genre-bending on \u201cSin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios)\" as well, but to me, that\u2019s still nostalgic because it\u2019s still music I grew up listening to.",
      "I return a lot to things that are core memories for me. It\u2019s soothing to my nervous system. I\u2019m the person who watches the same episodes of my favorite TV shows over and over again, ... I think that\u2019s what makes it beautiful too, is to see the evolution and know that it\u2019s still true to me. It's still true to my roots in music and where I started, but an evolved version.",
      "UCHIS: After she passed, one of the first things I did was go through all of the audio messages that she had ever sent me and I was just listening to all her messages over and over, wanting to hear her voice. When I heard that one I just thought of, \u201cOh how perfect is this that the song is called \u2018Sunshine &Rain...,\u2019 and she had said, \u201cGood morning, sunshine.\u201d It was for my son that she sent that message. I thought it was just a beautiful way to open the album, considering that it\u2019s dedicated to her.",
      "I struggled a lot with whether or not I wanted to share because I\u2019m a very, very private person. So I struggled a lot with if I even wanted to share that my mom was no longer here, but I felt I just had to not be afraid of that vulnerability and not pretend like it didn\u2019t affect me or didn\u2019t have some type of impact on me when it had such a big impact on me and still does. And I wanted to also honor her and honor her life in a way through art that I know that she would have loved and that she would have been proud of.",

      "A scrappy opera company that started 11 years ago in New York City is thriving by staying small",
      "NEW YORK -- Dan Schlosberg remembers the day 11 years ago when his upstart opera company put on its first performance \u2014 in a yoga studio before an audience of 30 people.",
      "\u201cWe did Kurt Weill\u2019s \u2018The Seven Deadly Sins\u2019 accompanied by an upright piano that we got for free on Craigslist and a violin,\u201d recalled Schlosberg, the company\u2019s music director and one of its founders.",
      "They named their company Heartbeat Opera, \u201cfrom the idea that singers would be feet away from you,\u201d Schlosberg said. \u201cAnd so you would be experiencing their voices at arm\u2019s length and that would make a resonance in your heart.\u201d",
      "Today, in an era when many opera companies are struggling financially, Heartbeat appears to be thriving, with an annual budget that just passed $1 million.",
      "But true to its initial vision, the company still performs in small venues, most with a seating capacity of about 200.",
      "\u201cVery few small companies take up the ambition to do the fullness of opera on a small scale,\u201d said Jacob Ashworth, another founding member and Heartbeat\u2019s artistic director. \u201cWe don\u2019t do small opera. We do big opera in a small space.\u201d",
      "And despite its success with critics and audiences \u2014 performances regularly sell out \u2014 the company has deliberately maintained a modest schedule.",
      "There\u2019s typically an opera-themed drag show around Halloween and then two operas staged in New York City performance spaces in the winter and spring. Each work is condensed to 90-100 intermission-less minutes with new orchestrations that require just a few musicians.",
      "Marc Scorca, president and CEO of Opera America, thinks Heartbeat is smart not to expand too quickly \u2014 a mistake that has caused some small companies to collapse.",
      "\u201cGrowth itself shouldn\u2019t be a goal. Excellence should be a goal,\u201d he said. \u201cI always prefer companies to plan their trajectory as slow as possible so they don\u2019t overstretch and overstep.\u201d",
      "Unlike some small companies, Heartbeat doesn\u2019t focus on new work or on bringing to light neglected old rarities. Instead, its website promises \u201cincisive adaptations and revelatory arrangements of classics, reimagining them for the here and now.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s that reimagining that attracted Sara Holdren, a director, writer and teacher who first worked with the company on Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen\u201d in 2017.",
      "\u201cTheir approaches to the storytelling feel extremely of our world and about our world,\u201d she said, \u201cwithout falling across that line into a sort of trite topicality where you say, \u2018Oh yes, I understand a relevant-with-a-capital-R political point is being made here\u2019.\u201d",
      "For Beethoven\u2019s \u201cFidelio,\u201d Heartbeat went to prisons and recorded the voices of incarcerated people, who appeared on video singing the Prisoners Chorus. For Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cEugene Onegin,\u201d the two main male characters became lovers, reflecting the composer\u2019s own sexuality.",
      "And for Richard Strauss\u2019 \u201cSalome\u201d this season, the teenage title character was dressed in a frilly pink skirt and sneakers; John the Baptist was imprisoned on stage in a cage with transparent sides instead of in an underground cistern; and during the Dance of the Seven Veils, it was a lascivious Herod who stripped off his clothes, not Salome.",
      "Heartbeat\u2019s casting for \u201cSalome\u201d reflected the premium it places on theatrical values in addition to vocal ability.",
      "Baritone Nathaniel Sullivan, who portrayed John the Baptist, recalled that \u201ca big part of the audition was just straight acting. And in the rehearsals, there was a real focus on the storytelling.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t experienced that in a lot of other opera companies to that extent,\u201d he said.",
      "Soprano Summer Hassan, who was cast as Salome, admits she was nervous at first \u201cbecause I had never done a role like this where I am the title character.",
      "\u201cI was really doubting myself, thinking how do I make this girl look so young?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they said, your physicality will do that on your own. Make her look confident and you will make her look like a confident child. They gave me the tools to figure out it was within me.\u201d",
      "Perhaps the most striking aspect of this \u201cSalome\u201d was the re-orchestration by Schlosberg. Instead of more than 100 players as called for in the original, he took a cue from the opening notes on a clarinet and scored the piece for eight clarinetists (who also played other instruments) and two percussionists.",
      "Heartbeat\u2019s final local offering of the season will be Gounod\u2019s \u201cFaust,\u201d to run at the Baruch Performing Arts Center from May 13-25.",
      "\u201cI had mentioned to Jacob that I really love devil stories,\u201d said Holdren, who is directing the production. \u201cAnd I was fascinated with the idea of taking something so big and so weighed down with history and assumptions and seeing how much we could crack it open and blow the dust off.\u201d",
      "She sees Mephistopheles less as a \u201dmustache-twirling villain\u201d and more as \u201ca figure of hunger and loneliness slipping into the vacuums that human beings create when they are so desperate or disgusted with life that there\u2019s an opening for him.\u201d",
      "Her production will be set in contemporary times, sung in French but with new English-language dialogue, and it will make heavy use of shadow puppetry. It\u2019s the first Heartbeat offering for which Schlosberg has not done the re-orchestration.",
      "That task fell to Francisco Ladr\u00f3n de Guevara, a Mexican violinist and composer who has scored the opera for seven musicians, most of whom play two instruments, including Ashworth, who will play violin and mandolin and also conduct.",
      "Schlosberg will be back doing the arranging for a rare Heartbeat foray outside the city this summer. The company has been invited to stage a revised version of Samuel Barber\u2019s \u201cVanessa\u201d at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really excited by what they\u2019ve been doing, particularly in reimagining the classics for contemporary times,\" said Raphael Picciarelli, co-managing director of the festival.",
      "For Heartbeat\u2019s debut in Williamstown, the festival is setting up a new performance space that should make the company feel right at home. It\u2019s in an abandoned grocery store, and there will be seats for just over 200 people.",

      "Smokey Robinson\u2019s lawyer says allegations of rape and sexual assault against him in a lawsuit from four former housekeepers are \u201cvile\u201d and \u201cfalse.\u201d",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Smokey Robinson's lawyer said allegations of rape and sexual assault against him in a lawsuit from four former housekeepers are \u201cvile\" and \u201cfalse.\u201d",
      "Attorney Christopher Frost said in a statement Wednesday that the evidence \u201cwill show that this is simply an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon.\u201d",
      "The suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday against the Motown music luminary seeks at least $50 million in damages over the alleged assaults, which the women say took place between 2007 and 2024. Robinson's wife, Frances Robinson, is also named as a defendant for allegedly enabling his behavior and creating an abusive work environment.",
      "\u201cWe will be addressing the numerous aspects of the complaint that defy credulity as well as issues relating to purported timelines, inconsistencies, and relationships between the plaintiffs and others,\u201d Frost's statement said.",
      "The four women each allege that Smokey Robinson would wait until he was alone with them in his Los Angeles house and then sexually assault and rape them over their objections, in some cases for many years.",
      "\u201cWe believe that Mr. Robinson is a serial and sick rapist, and must be stopped,\u201d the women\u2019s attorney John Harris said at a news conference Tuesday.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they publicly identify themselves. The women, whose names are withheld in the lawsuit, appeared with their lawyers at the news conference. They didn't speak, and they covered their faces with masks.",
      "Frost called the news conference \u201cbizarre theatrics,\u201d and an attempt to \u201cenlist the public as an unwitting participant in the media circus they are trying to create. We ask anyone following this case to reserve judgment as the evidence comes to light and all the actual facts of the case unfold.\u201d",
      "One woman said that she worked for Robinson from 2012 until 2024, and was assaulted at least 20 times in that span. Another said that she worked for him from 2014 until 2020, and was assaulted at least 23 times.",
      "All of the accusers said they eventually quit over the assaults, though in some cases it took several years. And all said they feared coming forward over fears of retaliation, public shame and possible effects on their immigration status. The same fears have kept the women from going to police to report Robinson, their lawyers said, though they also said they believe criminal investigation is warranted.",
      "The suit seeks damages based on sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, gender violence and other allegations.",
      "Frost said that Robinson would soon address the allegations himself, and that they would be asking the court to dismiss the lawsuit.",
      "Robinson, a member of both the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, was among the biggest hitmakers of the 1960s as a central part of the Motown Records machine \u2014 both with his group the Miracles and as a solo artist, with songs including \u201cTears of a Clown\" and \u201cThe Tracks of My Tears.\"",

    "story": [
      "A former model who alleges that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her almost 20 years ago has taken the stand at his retrial",
      "NEW YORK -- Days into Harvey Weinstein 's first sexual assault trial in 2020, prosecutors privately spoke for the first time with a former model who alleged that he had forced oral sex on her.",
      "But that jury was never told about Kaja (KEYE\u2019-ah) Sokola's claim. Prosecutors have said they still were investigating the allegation when Weinstein, a onetime movie tycoon-turned- #MeToo pariah, was convicted in February 2020 of charges based on other women's accusations.",
      "On Wednesday, Sokola began to tell a new jury her story.",
      "Sokola didn't look at Weinstein as she walked past him and onto the witness stand in a Manhattan courtroom where he's on trial again. An appeals court overturned his 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction, sending those charges back for retrial, and prosecutors subsequently added another sexual assault charge based on Sokola's allegations.",
      "As she began testifying about her life before the alleged 2006 assault, Weinstein looked toward her, with his right hand across his mouth.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. His lawyers contend that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting movie and TV opportunities, and the defense has emphasized that the women stayed in contact with him for a while after the alleged assaults.",
      "The women, meanwhile, say the Oscar-winning producer used the prospect of show business work to prey on them.",
      "The Polish-born Sokola, 39, sued Weinstein after industry whispers about his behavior toward women became a chorus of public accusations in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement and its calls for accountability for sexual misconduct. Prosecutors have said Sokola eventually received $3.5 million in compensation.",
      "She was introduced to Weinstein while on a modeling trip to New York in 2002, when she was 16, according to prosecutors.",
      "In her lawsuits, Sokola said that shortly after she met Weinstein, he invited her to lunch to discuss her career but then sexually assaulted her. The lawsuits alleged he sexually harassed and emotionally abused her for years afterward.",
      "The criminal charge stems from one instance when Sokola maintains that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in a Manhattan hotel in May 2006.",
      "Prosecutors have said it happened after Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra in the film \u201cThe Nanny Diaries\u201d and met her visiting older sister, whom she was trying to impress.",
      "\u201cShe was proud of knowing him,\u201d her sister, cardiologist Dr. Ewa (pronounced EH\u2019-vah) Sokola, told jurors Wednesday.",
      "She said the three of them met in a hotel lobby, chatted for about an hour about Italian movies and the heavyset Weinstein's heart health, and then he and the model left the table together.",
      "Kaja Sokola was tense when she returned about a half-hour later \u2014 \u201clike somebody waiting for the result of an exam\u201d or the Oscars \u2014 but didn't say anything about the alleged sexual assault, Dr. Sokola told jurors.",
      "She said she was shocked to learn about the claim over a decade later, when she read about it in a magazine article.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers will get a chance to question Kaja Sokola in the coming days. In an opening statement last month, defense attorney Arthur Aidala questioned why she waited years to come forward. Prosecutors have argued that accusers were reluctant to speak up because of Weinstein's wealth and influence.",
      "Prosecutors have said Sokola's attorneys contacted them on the eve of Weinstein's first trial to say she was willing to be interviewed. Prosecutors have said they soon spoke with her and began investigating, but didn't initially pursue charges because Weinstein was convicted and the coronavirus pandemic loomed.",
      "They revived the Sokola investigation after New York's highest court reversed Weinstein's conviction.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers fought unsuccessfully to keep Sokola's allegation out of the retrial. They accused prosecutors of \u201csmuggling an additional charge into the case for the improper purpose of bolstering the credibility\u201d of other accusers.",
      "One of the others, Miriam Haley, testified last week that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser in the case, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify later.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name sexual assault accusers without their permission, which Haley, Mann and Sokola have given.",

Looking for any tips you can give me \u2014 especially on my backswing and follow-through.\"",
      "Kelce said the early feedback was \u201ccrazy.\"",
      "\u201cSome of this stuff is like stuff other pros have put out and it's kind of generic stuff that everybody can use,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cBut there's been some stuff so far that's been like, \u2018Holy cow, I never thought about it like that.' So I'm excited about that.\u201d",
      "Kelce \u2014 who retired following the 2023 season after a 13-year career spent entirely with the Eagles, played his role as man of the people to perfection during a pro-am ahead of the Truist Championship. He took time to answer questions from 14-year-old Benji Panzer, a middle school student who had credentials as part of an area sports broadcasting camp. Panzer asked Kelce about his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast that he tapes with his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.",
      "\u201cThe ability of players to connect with fans directly has never been greater,\u201d Kelce told Panzer.",
      "Kelce connected with plenty of Eagles fans, signing everything from aluminum beer bottles, T-shirts, golf balls and all types of Eagles memorabilia. He accepted gifts, too, including a Kelly green Eagles beer koozie. One fan who called himself T-Shirt Phil \u2014 did we mention the tourney was near Philly? \u2014 said he wanted to introduce Kelce to Phillies slugger Nick Castellanos.",

      "\u201cThe course is in great shape,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous. All the guys we played with agreed.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe guys\u201d included PGA pros Stephan Jager and Shane Lowry.",
      "One unspecified member of the group sliced a ball into the crowd and struck the left hand of 25-year-old spectator Hudson Mokrejs, of Elverson, Pennsylvania, who needed an ice pack on his reddened wrist.",
      "\u201cWe were talking beforehand like, \u2018Man, wouldn\u2019t it be great to get hit by Jason Kelce's ball?' And then he shot it over the green,\u201d Mokrejs said. \u201cI was talking and all of a sudden I hear, \u2018Look out!\u2019 I turned and it just smacked me in the hand. I covered my hand. I didn't spill my drink. I had a Transfusion. Classic golf drink, you know what I mean? Chugged that real quick to get me healthy.\u201d",
      "Kelce noted the serene golf atmosphere made for more \u201cGo Birds\u201d chants more than the popular \u201cE-A-G-L-E-S\u201d chant that punctuates the Eagles\u2019 fight song.",

      "NEW YORK -- Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, the hip-hop entrepreneur whose wildly successful career has been dotted by allegations of violence, will be brought to a New York courthouse Monday to be tried on charges that he used the influence and resources of his business empire to sexually abuse women. Jury selection is scheduled to begin in the morning and potentially take several days. Opening statements by the lawyers and the start of testimony is expected next week.",
      "The 17-page indictment against Combs reads like a charging document filed against a Mafia leader or the head of a drug gang, accusing him of engaging in sex trafficking and presiding over a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "The indictment says that with the help of people in his entourage and employees from his network of businesses, Combs engaged in a two-decade pattern of abusive behavior against women and others.",
      "Women were manipulated into participating in drug-fueled sexual performances with male sex workers that Combs called \u201cFreak Offs,\u201d prosecutors say.",
      "To keep women in line, prosecutors say Combs used a mix of influence and violence: He offered to boost their entertainment careers if they did what he asked \u2014 or cut them off if they didn't.",
      "And when he wasn't getting what he wanted, the indictment says Combs and his associates resorted to violent acts including beatings, kidnapping and arson. Once, the indictment alleges, he even dangled someone from a balcony.",
      "Combs and his lawyers say he is innocent.",
      "Any group sex was consensual, they say. There was no effort to coerce people into things they didn't want to do, and nothing that happened amounted to a criminal racket, they said.",
      "The trial is expected to take at least eight weeks.",
      "Combs, 55, has acknowledged one episode of violence that is likely to be featured in the trial. In 2016, a security camera recorded him beating up his former girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie, in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel. Cassie filed a lawsuit in late 2023 saying Combs had subjected her to years of abuse, including beatings and rape.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, did.",
      "Combs\u2019 attorney, Marc Agnifilo has said Combs was \u201cnot a perfect person\u201d and that there had been drug use and toxic relationships, but said that all sexual activity between Combs, Cassie and other people was consensual.",
      "The trial is the latest and most serious in a long string of legal problems for Combs.",
      "In 1999 he was charged with bursting into the offices of an Interscope Records executive with his bodyguards and beating him with a champagne bottle and a chair. The executive, Steve Stoute, later asked prosecutors to go easy on Combs, who pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and took an anger management class.",
      "Later that same year, Combs was stopped by police after he and his then-girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez, fled a nightclub where three people were wounded by gunfire. Combs was acquitted of all charges related to the incident at a 2001 trial, but a rapper in his entourage, Jamal \u201cShyne\u201d Barrow, was convicted in the shooting and served nearly nine years in prison.",

      "Jacques Agbobly has only been in the fashion business for five years",
      "NEW YORK -- When the email came from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Jacques Agbobly at first didn\u2019t quite believe it.",
      "The Brooklyn-based fashion designer had only been in the business for five years. Now, one of the world\u2019s top museums was asking for two of his designs to be shown in \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,\u201d the exhibit launched by the starry Met Gala.",
      "\u201cI was just floored with excitement,\u201d Agbobly said in an interview. \u201cI had to check to make sure it was from an official email. And then the excitement came, and I was like \u2026 am I allowed to say anything to anyone about it?\u201d",
      "Agbobly grew up in Togo, watching seamstresses and tailors create beautiful garments in part of the family home that they rented out. Studying fashion later in New York, the aspiring designer watched the Met Gala carpet from afar and dreamed of one day somehow being part of it.",
      "\u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\u201d is the first Costume Institute exhibit to focus exclusively on Black designers, and the first in more than 20 years devoted to menswear. Unlike past shows that highlighted the work of very famous designers like Karl Lagerfeld or Charles James, this exhibit includes a number of up-and-coming designers like Agbobly.",
      "\u201cThe range is phenomenal,\u201d says guest curator Monica L. Miller, a Barnard College professor whose book, \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,\u201d is a foundation for the show.",
      "\u201cIt's super exciting to showcase the designs of these younger and emerging designers,\u201d says Miller, who took The Associated Press through the show over the weekend before its unveiling at Monday\u2019s Met Gala, \u201cand to see the way they've been thinking about Black representation across time and across geography.\u201d",
      "The exhibit covers Black style over several centuries, but the unifying theme is dandyism, and how designers have expressed that ethos through history.",
      "For Agbobly, dandyism is \u201cabout taking space. As a Black designer, as a queer person, a lot of it is rooted in people telling us who we should be or how we should act \u2026 dandyism really goes against that. It\u2019s about showing up and looking your best self and taking up space and announcing that you're here.\u201d",
      "The exhibit, which opens to the public May 10, begins with its own definition: someone who \u201cstudies above everything else to dress elegantly and fashionably.\u201d",
      "Miller has organized it into 12 conceptual sections: Ownership, presence, distinction, disguise, freedom, champion, respectability, jook, heritage, beauty, cool and cosmopolitanism.",
      "The \u201cownership\u201d section begins with two livery coats worn by enslaved people.",
      "One of them, from Maryland, looks lavish and elaborate, in purple velvet trimmed with gold metallic threading. The garments were intended to show the wealth of their owners. In other words, Miller says, the enslaved themselves were items of conspicuous consumption.",
      "The other is a livery coat of tan broadcloth, likely manufactured by Brooks Brothers and worn by an enslaved child or adolescent boy in Louisiana just before the Civil War.",
      "Elsewhere, there's a contemporary, glittering ensemble by British designer Grace Wales Bonner, made of crushed silk velvet and embroidered with crystals and the cowrie shells historically used as currency in Africa.",
      "There's also a so-called \u201cdollar bill suit\u201d by the label 3.Paradis \u2014 the jacket sporting a laminated one-dollar bill stitched to the breast pocket, meant to suggest the absence of wealth.",
      "The \u201cdisguise\u201d section includes a collection of 19th-century newspaper ads announcing rewards for catching runaway enslaved people.",
      "The ads, Miller notes, would often describe someone who was \u201cparticularly fond of dress\u201d \u2014 or note that the person had taken large wardrobes. The reason was twofold: The fancy clothes made it possible for an enslaved person to cloak their identity. But also, when they finally made it to freedom, they could sell the clothing to help fund their new lives, Miller says.",
      "\u201cSo dressing above one\u2019s station sometimes was a matter of life and death,\u201d the curator says, \u201cand also enabled people to transition from being enslaved to being liberated.\u201d",
      "The contemporary part of this section includes striking embroidered jackets by the label Off-White that purposely play with gender roles \u2014 like displaying an ostensibly \u201cmale\u201d jacket on a female mannequin.",
      "Stopping by a set of portraits from the early 19th century, as abolitionism was happening in the North, Miller explains that the subjects are Black men who were successful, well off enough to commission or sit for portraits, and dressed \u201cin the finest fashions of the day.\u201d Like William Whipper, an abolitionist and wealthy lumber merchant who also founded a literary society.",
      "They represent the beginnings of a Black middle and upper middle class in America, Miller says. But she points out a group of racist caricatures in a case right across from the portraits.",
      "\u201cAlmost as soon as they are able to do this,\u201d she says, referring to the portraits, \u201cthey are stereotyped and degraded.\u201d",
      "W.E.B. Du Bois, Miller points out, was not only a civil rights activist but also one of the best-dressed men in turn-of-the-century America. He traveled extensively overseas, which meant he needed \u201cclothing befitting his status as a representative of Black America to the world.\u201d",
      "Objects in the display include receipts for tailors in London, and suit orders from Brooks Brothers or his Harlem tailor. There is also a laundry receipt from 1933 for cleaning of shirts, collars, and handkerchiefs.",
      "Also highlighted in this section: Frederick Douglass, the abolitionist, writer, and statesman and also \u201cthe most photographed man of the 19th century.\u201d",
      "The show includes his tailcoat of brushed wool, as well as a shirt embroidered with a \u201cD\u201d monogram, a top hat, a cane and a pair of sunglasses.",
      "One of Miller\u2019s favorite items in the heritage section is Agbobly\u2019s bright-colored ensemble based on the hues of bags that West African migrants used to transport their belongings.",
      "Also displayed is Agbobly\u2019s denim suit embellished with crystals and beads. It's a tribute not only to the hairbraiding salons where the designer spent time as a child, but also the earrings his grandmother or aunts would wear when they went to church.",
      "Speaking of family, Agbobly says that he ultimately did tell them \u2014 and everyone \u2014 about his \u201cpinch-me moment.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone knows about it,\u201d the designer says. \u201cI keep screaming. If I can scream on top of a hill, I will.\u201d",

      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 Lady Gaga gave a free concert Saturday night in front of 2 million fans who poured onto Copacabana Beach for the biggest show of her career.",
      "\u201cTonight, we're making history. (...) Thank you for making history with me,\u201d Lady Gaga told a screaming crowd.",
      "The Mother Monster, as she is known, kicked off the show at around 22:10 p.m. local time with her 2011 song \u201cBloody Mary.\u201d Cries of joy rose from the tightly-packed fans who sang and danced shoulder-to-shoulder on the vast stretch of sand.",
      "Concert organizers said 2.1 million people attended the show.",
      "Lady Gaga performed her classic hits, including \u201cPoker Face\u201d and \u201cAlejandro,\u201d switching between an array of dresses including one with the colors of the Brazilian flag.",
      "Some fans - many of them young - arrived on the beach at the crack of dawn to secure a good spot, armed with snacks and drinks. They spent the day under a blazing sun, while others perched in trees, determined to get a panoramic view.",
      "\u201cToday is the best day of my life,\u201d said Manoela Dobes, a 27-year-old designer who was wearing a dress plastered with a photograph from when she met Lady Gaga in the United States in 2019. \u201cIt's surreal to be here.\u201d",

      "Lady Gaga arrived in Rio in the early hours of Tuesday. The city has been alive with Gaga-mania since, as it geared up to welcome the pop star for her first show in the country since 2012. Rio\u2019s metro employees danced to Lady Gaga\u2019s 2008 hit song \u201cLoveGame\u201d and gave instructions for Saturday in a video. A free exhibition celebrating her career sold out.",
      "While the vast majority of attendees were from Rio, the event also attracted Brazilians from across the country and international visitors.",

      "Ingrid Serrano, a 30-year-old engineer, made a cross-continent trip from Colombia to Brazil to attend the show.",

Madonna\u2019s show drew an estimated 1.6 million fans last year, while 4 million people flooded onto the beach for a 1994 New Year\u2019s Eve show by Rod Stewart in 1994. According to Guinness World Records, that was the biggest free rock concert in history.",
      "To ensure fans could hear the songs, sixteen sound towers were spread along the beach.",
      "Rio state\u2019s security plan included the presence of 3,300 military and 1,500 police officers, and 400 military firefighters.",
      "Among those present were Lady Gaga admirers who remember their disappointment in 2017, when the artist canceled a performance scheduled in Rio at the last minute due to health issues.",

      "He said that the U.S. investigation into the theft also found that medications and supplies for Zambia paid for by the Global Fund and other international donors were also being sold in pharmacies.",
      "Gonzales said he had recommended to officials in Washington that the U.S. start cutting the aid from January next year to give Zambia time to plan new procurements of the life-saving drugs.",

      "Of 33 cancer types, 14 cancers had increasing rates in at least one younger age group. About 63% of the early-onset cancers were among women.",
      "\u201cThese kinds of patterns generally reflect something profound going on,\u201d said Tim Rebbeck of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who studies cancer risk and was not involved in the research. \u201cWe need to fund research that will help us understand.\"",

      "In a social media post, Prasad likened Marks to \u201ca bobblehead doll that just stamps approval.\"",
      "Last year, he told former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy that Americans would probably be better off without the FDA in its current form.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about FDA 2024, I think they\u2019d probably be better off as a result of not having the FDA\u201d Prasad said during an appearance on Ramaswamy's podcast.",
      "A professor at the University of California San Francisco, Prasad's medical training is in cancer and blood disorders. He first came to prominence among academics for a series of papers scrutinizing the evidence behind new cancer therapies.",
      "Research by Prasad and his colleagues showed that many cancer drugs fast-tracked by the FDA have never been shown to improve or extend patient lives. Instead, the drugs are often approved based on alternate measures, such as the ability to shrink tumors, which are thought to predict their long-term benefits.",
      "The FDA has long defended this practice as a way of accelerating approval of medicines for desperately ill patients.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Prasad reached a much broader audience as a critic of mask mandates, lockdowns and moves to speed the availability of vaccine boosters from Pfizer and Moderna. Many of his views mirror those of other Trump appointees, including Makary and National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya.",
      "In 2022, Prasad and Makary were co-authors on a paper attacking the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. Those patients received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild.",
      "The paper concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit. None of the authors specialized in studying infectious diseases or vaccine reactions, prompting pushback from many health experts.",
      "In recent years, Prasad become a regular on podcasts associated with Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, which often portrays the FDA as beholden to the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "Prasad's appointment is likely to alarm drug and vaccine makers, who depend on the predictability of FDA standards and procedures to guide drug development plans that can span years or even decades.",

      "Columbia University and New York-Presbyterian Hospital have agreed to a $750 million settlement of hundreds of sexual abuse claims by patients of imprisoned former gynecologist Robert Hadden",
      "Columbia University and New York-Presbyterian Hospital have agreed to a $750 million settlement of hundreds of sexual abuse claims by patients of disgraced and imprisoned former gynecologist Robert Hadden, bringing total legal payouts in civil cases involving the ex-doctor to over $1 billion, according to the plaintiffs' lawyer.",
      "Hadden, now 66, was accused of molesting patients during a decades-long career at prestigious New York City hospitals including Columbia University Irving Medical Center and New York-Presbyterian. He was convicted by a jury in 2023 of federal sex crime charges and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.",
      "The new settlements, approved by a Manhattan judge Monday, come in 576 legal cases against the Ivy League school, the hospital and others over the abuse by Hadden, plaintiffs' attorney Anthony T. DiPietro said.",
      "\u201cThis victory is not just for the victims and survivors of Columbia University and The New York-Presbyterian Hospital\u2019s cover-up who bravely came forward, but for all of us who entrust medical institutions with our health care,\u201d DiPietro said in statement.",
      "\u201cFor far too long, Columbia and New York-Presbyterian have prioritized protecting their reputations over protecting their patients,\" he said. \"This settlement sends a powerful message that we\u2019re here to ensure that institutions covering up exploitation and abuse will be held fully accountable for their crimes.\u201d",
      "DiPietro said the average payout to plaintiffs from the new settlement will be about $1.3 million. Columbia previously agreed to $277 million in settlements with more than 200 other plaintiffs over Hadden's sexual abuse, he said.",
      "Columbia confirmed the settlement but not the amount Tuesday. Lawyers for the school and New York-Presbyterian did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "\u201cAs previously announced, Columbia is implementing a multi-pronged plan, including an external investigation, a survivors\u2019 settlement fund, and a series of new and updated patient safety policies and programs to address the abuses of Robert Hadden,\" the university said in statement responding to an Associated Press message specifically asking about the $750 million deal.",
      "\u201cWe deeply regret the pain that his patients suffered, and this settlement is another step forward in our ongoing work and commitment to repair harm and support survivors,\u201d it said. \"We commend the survivors for their bravery in coming forward.\u201d",
      "New York-Presbyterian referred questions about the settlement to Columbia, saying the school employed Hadden.",
      "One of the plaintiffs in the lawsuits, Laurie Maldonado, who sued Columbia, New York-Presbyterian, Hadden and others, said her case was not about money.",
      "\u201cIt's about accountability,\u201d she said in a statement provided by DiPietro. \"Columbia University enabled sadistic abuse, and now, they\u2019ve been forced to face the truth. We hope this sends a clear message to every institution: survivors will not be silenced, and those who protect abusers will be held responsible.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name victims of sexual assault unless they come forward publicly, like Maldonado has.",
      "Hadden\u2019s accusers also included Evelyn Yang, the wife of former presidential candidate and New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang, who said Hadden abused her when she was pregnant with her first child.",
      "During Hadden's criminal trial, nine victims testified about how Hadden molested them during gynecology treatments, starting in the late 1980s, at prominent hospitals.",
      "Allegations of misconduct during examinations first surfaced in 2012. Hadden was indicted on state charges in 2014 as women kept coming forward. But in 2016, the office of the Manhattan district attorney at the time, Cyrus Vance Jr., allowed Hadden to plead guilty to two low-level felonies and a misdemeanor in a deal that required him to give up his medical license but did not require jail time and kept him out of the state\u2019s sex offender registry.",
      "Some of the women who had gone to state prosecutors were outraged, but their stories did not start receiving public attention until the #MeToo movement began gaining steam in 2017.",
      "Federal prosecutors in Manhattan got a grand jury indictment against Hadden in 2020, charges based on the fact that some patients at his New York offices had come into the city from other states.",
      "In November 2023, Columbia and Columbia University Irving Medical Center announced they would be notifying 6,500 former patients of Hadden of his federal sex crime convictions and giving victims the opportunity to apply for compensation from a $100 million settlement fund. The deadline to apply has been extended to May 15.",

    "story": [
      "Utah dentists say they\u2019re bracing for an increase in tooth decay among the state\u2019s most vulnerable people",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- With Utah's first-in-the-nation ban on fluoride in public drinking water set to take effect Wednesday, dentists who treat children and low-income patients say they're bracing for an increase in tooth decay among the state's most vulnerable people.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed the law against the recommendation of many dentists and national health experts who warn removing fluoride will harm tooth development, especially in young patients without regular access to dental care.",
      "The bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican Rep. Stephanie Gricius, said she does not dispute that fluoride can have some benefits but thinks people should not be given it by the government without their informed consent.",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. applauded Utah for being the first state to enact a ban and said he plans to direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation nationwide.",
      "Florida could soon become the second state to ban fluoride under a bill awaiting Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 signature. The Ohio and South Carolina legislatures are considering similar measures.",
      "A majority of Utah water systems already did not add fluoride. The state ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents receiving fluoridated water, with about 2 in 5 receiving it in 2022, according to CDC data. The law will impact about 1.6 million people in Salt Lake City and elsewhere in northern Utah who are losing fluoridation, state officials say.",
      "Dentists in Salt Lake City over the past week said many patients were unaware of the upcoming ban, and most did not realize the city had been adding fluoride to their drinking water for nearly two decades.",
      "\u201cI did not know about a ban,\u201d said Noe Figueroa, a patient at Salt Lake Donated Dental Services, a clinic that provides free or heavily discounted dental treatment to low-income residents. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not good. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good at all.\u201d",
      "At Donated Dental, providers expect their monthslong waitlist for children's procedures to grow significantly and their need for volunteer dentists to skyrocket. The effects of the ban in children\u2019s teeth will likely be visible within the next year, said Sasha Harvey, the clinic\u2019s executive director.",
      "\u201cRight now, we\u2019re scheduling into August and September for some 2-, 3-, 4-year-olds that are in so much pain that they can\u2019t eat properly, and there\u2019s nothing we can do but tell parents, \u2018You\u2019re gonna have to wait.\u2019 It\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d Harvey said, adding that it's likely to get much worse.",
      "The fluoridation process involves supplementing the low levels of naturally occurring fluoride in most water to reach the 0.7 milligrams per liter recommended by the CDC for cavity prevention. Water treatment plants dump fluoride into the water in liquid or powder form and often use dosing pumps to adjust the levels.",
      "Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population receives fluoridated drinking water, according to health officials. It was long considered among the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Fluoride fortifies teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. It\u2019s especially important to children whose teeth are still developing. For some low-income families, public drinking water containing fluoride may be their only source of preventative dental care.",
      "Some supporters of the Utah law pointed to studies linking high levels of fluoride exposure to illness and low IQ in kids. The National Institutes of Health says it\u2019s \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to get a toxic dose from fluoride added to water or toothpaste at standard levels.",
      "The governor said that, like many people in Utah, he grew up and raised his children in a community without fluoridated water. Before signing the bill, Cox said there is no difference in health outcomes between communities with and without fluoride \u2014 a statement Utah dentists say is false.",
      "\u201cAny dentist can look in someone\u2019s mouth in Utah and tell exactly where they grew up. Did you grow up in a fluoridated area or a non-fluoridated area? We can tell by the level of decay,\u201d said Dr. James Bekker, a pediatric dentist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.",
      "The law shifts responsibility to individuals, meaning all Utah residents will need to be proactive about their oral health, Harvey said. Most patients at her clinic only come in when a toothache becomes unbearable, and many cannot spare the few dollars a month needed to buy fluoride supplements to add to their drinking water at home.",
      "Figueroa, the free dental clinic patient, said other expenses take priority.",
      "Fluoride toothpaste alone is insufficient for children because it doesn't penetrate the tooth's outer layer, Bekker said. When a person regularly ingests fluoridated water, their saliva bathes the teeth in fluoride throughout the day and makes them stronger.",
      "Bekker said he recommends Utah parents add fluoride supplements to their children\u2019s drinking water. But for families who don\u2019t visit doctors regularly, that may prove difficult.",
      "Fluoride tablets require a prescription from a doctor or dentist. Utah providers are working to make the supplement accessible over the counter, but Bekker said that change may be months or years away.",

      "Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is running for governor in 2026 and sharing new anecdotes in her upcoming political memoir, \u201cThe Purposeful Warrior,\u201d including her experience with miscarriage",
      "LANSING, Mich. -- Ahead of a nationally watched bid to become Michigan\u2019s next governor, Democrat Jocelyn Benson is releasing a memoir this month that includes her first public discussion of a miscarriage she had about eight years ago \u2014 an experience she says will shape her commitment to increasing access to reproductive healthcare in the swing state.",
      "Benson, Michigan\u2019s secretary of state, is part of a crowded field seeking to succeed Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and she\u2019s the only woman in the running so far.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press ahead of Tuesday's release of her political memoir entitled, \u201cThe Purposeful Warrior,\u201d Benson said miscarrying made her value easy access to reproductive health care in an emotional and difficult situation, something she wants to deliver for the state if elected.",
      "\u201cIt opened my eyes to the need to not just protect reproductive freedom and rights, but actually make sure they\u2019re real,\u201d said Benson.",
      "In a chapter entitled \u201cGrit and Grace,\u201d Benson describes finding out she was pregnant shortly after her son\u2019s first birthday and shortly before she launched her bid for secretary of state in 2017. Waves of worry over the timing and elation over becoming a mother of two ensued. But just a day later, she began to miscarry.",
      "She writes about the doctor\u2019s appointment during her eighth week of pregnancy where she learned about her options: surgery, medication or stillbirth and what to expect as her miscarriage continued. By the following morning, she had miscarried on her own.",
      "\u201cThe emotional impact of that stays with you for your whole life,\u201d she told AP.",
      "Benson said she struggled with shame and guilt, emotions she has learned many women experience.",
      "\u201cI want to tell my story to say it\u2019s OK to tell yours as well,\u201d she said.",
      "In the years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, women seeking public office have shared personal stories of miscarriages and abortions. Democrats and Republicans alike have spoken about their pregnancies as reproductive and maternal health care became a central concern for Americans.",
      "In Michigan, voters approved a ballot measure in 2022 to protect abortion access, in an election that also saw Democrats sweep statewide and legislative elections. But Benson said that protection isn\u2019t enough.",
      "Step one is to incentivize talented physicians to work in Michigan, she said. Step two is to bolster reproductive health care in rural Michigan, she said, suggesting mobile clinics that can reach remote areas.",
      "She noted the recent closure of three Planned Parenthood locations in Michigan, including its only location in the Upper Peninsula. Some Planned Parenthood locations provide abortions in addition to services such as birth control, disease screenings and miscarriage management.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Michigan leaders cited financial challenges exacerbated by a freeze of federal dollars for the closures. Federal law already prohibited taxpayer dollars from paying for most abortions.",
      "Centering reproductive rights in the 2026 primary will be another test of the issue\u2019s importance to Democratic voters. Benson will face Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson in the gubernatorial primary. Whitmer, who is term limited, has said she does not plan to endorse in the race.",
      "On the Republican side, U.S. Rep. John James, state Senate Minority Leader Aaric Nesbitt and former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox are vying for the nomination and likely also the endorsement of President Donald Trump.",
      "And the twist \u2014 Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a longtime Democrat, is pursuing the office as an independent. The move comes as Democrats lost considerable ground in the 2024 election. The state swung back to Trump in the 2024 election and Republicans gained a majority in the state House of Representatives, splitting control of the legislature.",
      "Among anecdotes from her memoir that include her tenure as the state's chief election official during the 2020 election and her law career before, Benson took a swing at Duggan over his handling of the 2018 primary election for governor. She criticized him for not supporting Whitmer early in the race and encouraging other Democrats, who are men, to pursue a run, citing reporting in the New Yorker years later.",
      "\u201cI will never forget the message those efforts sent to women across our state,\u201d Benson wrote. She noted that her own primary campaign became tied to Whitmer\u2019s by gender.",
      "\u201cThe argument went something like, surely we can\u2019t have more than one woman on the ticket at the same time,\u201d Benson wrote.",
      "Benson\u2019s memoir comments on Duggan were first reported by the Detroit News. A spokesperson for Duggan\u2019s campaign told the publication that the Detroit mayor endorsed Whitmer in the Democratic primary over two men.",

      "Attorneys general in 19 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging cuts to the U.S. Health and Human Services agency, saying the Trump administration's massive restructuring has destroyed life-saving programs and left states to pick up the bill for mounting health crises.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Rhode Island on Monday, New York Attorney General Letitia James said. The attorneys general from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia signed onto the complaint.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. restructured the agency in March, eliminating more than 10,000 employees and collapsing 28 agencies under the sprawling HHS umbrella into 15, the attorneys general said. An additional 10,000 employees had already been let go by President Donald Trump's administration, according to the lawsuit, and combined the cuts stripped 25% of the HHS workforce.",
      "\u201cIn its first three months, Secretary Kennedy and this administration deprived HHS of the resources necessary to do its job,\u201d the attorneys general wrote.",
      "Kennedy has said he is seeking to streamline the nation's public health agencies and reduce redundancies across them with the layoffs. The cuts were made as part of a directive the administration has dubbed, \u201c Make America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "HHS is one of the government's costliest federal agencies, with an annual budget of about $1.7 trillion that is mostly spent on health care coverage for millions of people enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "James, who is leading the lawsuit, called the restructuring a \u201csweeping and unlawful assault\u201d that would endanger lives.",
      "\u201cThis is not government reform. This is not efficiency,\u201d James said during a press conference Monday.",
      "The cuts have resulted in laboratories having limited testing for some infectious diseases, the federal government not tracking cancer risks among U.S. firefighters, early childhood learning programs left unsure of future funds and programs aimed at monitoring cancer and maternal health closing, the attorneys general say. Cuts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also have hampered states' ability to respond to one of the largest measles outbreaks in recent years, the lawsuit says.",
      "\u201cThis chaos and abandonment of the Department\u2019s core functions was not an unintended side effect, but rather the intended result,\u201d of the \u201cMAHA Directive,\u201d they said. They want a judge to vacate the directive because they say the administration can't unilaterally eliminate programs and funding that have been created by Congress.",
      "The restructuring eliminated the entire team of people who maintain the federal poverty guidelines used by states to determine whether residents are eligible for Medicaid, nutrition assistance and other programs. A tobacco prevention agency was gutted. Staff losses also were significant at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",
      "The Trump administration is already facing other legal challenges over cuts to public health agencies and research organizations.

      "More than a dozen data-gathering programs that track deaths and disease appear to have been eliminated in the tornado of layoffs and proposed budget cuts rolled out in the Trump administration's first 100 days.",
      "The Associated Press examined draft and final budget proposals and spoke to more than a dozen current and former federal employees to determine the scope of the cuts to programs tracking basic facts about Americans' health.",
      "Among those terminated at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were experts tracking abortions, pregnancies, job-related injuries, lead poisonings, sexual violence and youth smoking, the AP found.",
      "\"If you don\u2019t have staff, the program is gone,\u201d said Patrick Breysse, who used to oversee the CDC\u2019s environmental health programs.",
      "Federal officials have not given a public accounting of specific surveillance programs that are being eliminated.",
      "Instead, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman pointed the AP to a Trump administration budget proposal released Friday. It lacked specifics, but proposes to cut the CDC's core budget by more than half and vows to focus CDC surveillance only on emerging and infectious diseases.",
      "Kennedy has said some of the CDC's other work will be moved to a yet-to-be-created agency, the Administration for a Healthy America. He also has said that the cuts are designed to get rid of waste at a department that has seen its budget grow in recent years.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, this extra spending and staff has not improved our nation\u2019s health as a country,\" Kennedy wrote last month in The New York Post. \"Instead, it has only created more waste, administrative bloat and duplication.\"",
      "Yet some health experts say the eliminated programs are not duplicative, and erasing them will leave Americans in the dark.",
      "\u201cIf the U.S. is interested in making itself healthier again, how is it going to know, if it cancels the programs that helps us understand these diseases?\u201d said Graham Mooney, a Johns Hopkins University public health historian.",
      "The core of the nation\u2019s health surveillance is done by the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics. Relying on birth and death certificates, it generates information on birth rates, death trends and life expectancy. It also operates longstanding health surveys that provide basic data on obesity, asthma and other health issues.",
      "The center has been barely touched in layoffs, and seems intact under current budget plans.",
      "But many other efforts were targeted by the cuts, the AP found. Some examples:",
      "The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, which surveys women across the country, lost its entire staff \u2014 about 20 people.",
      "It\u2019s the most comprehensive collection of data on the health behaviors and outcomes before, during and after childbirth. Researchers have been using its data to investigate the nation's maternal mortality problem.",
      "Recent layoffs also wiped out the staffs collecting data on in vitro fertilizations and abortions.",
      "Those cuts are especially surprising given that President Donald Trump said he wants to expand IVF access and that the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 playbook for his administration called for more abortion surveillance.",
      "The CDC eliminated its program on lead poisoning in children, which helped local health departments \u2014 through funding and expertise \u2014 investigate lead poisoning clusters and find where risk is greatest.",
      "Lead poisoning in kids typically stems from exposure to bits of old paint, contaminated dust or drinking water that passes through lead pipes. But the program's staff also played an important role in the investigation of lead-tainted applesauce that affected 500 kids.",
      "Last year, Milwaukee health officials became aware that peeling paint in aging local elementary schools was endangering kids. The city health department began working with CDC to test tens of thousands of students. That assistance stopped last month when the CDC\u2019s lead program staff was terminated.",
      "City officials are particularly concerned about losing expertise to help them track the long-term effects.",
      "\"We don't know what we don't know,\" said Mike Totoraitis, the city\u2019s health commissioner.",
      "Also gone is the staff for the 23-year-old Environmental Public Health Tracking Program, which had information on concerns including possible cancer clusters and weather-related illnesses.",
      "\u201cThe loss of that program is going to greatly diminish the ability to make linkages between what might be in the environment and what health might be affected by that,\u201d Breysse said.",
      "In some cases, it\u2019s not a matter of staffers leaving, but rather the end of specific types of data collection.",
      "Transgender status is no longer being recorded in health-tracking systems, including ones focused on violent deaths and on risky behaviors by kids.",
      "Experts know transgender people are more likely to be victims of violence, but now \u201cit\u2019s going to be much more challenging to quantify the extent to which they are at higher risk,\u201d said Thomas Simon, the recently retired senior director for scientific programs at the CDC's Division of Violence Prevention.",
      "The staff and funding seems to have remained intact for a CDC data collection that provides insights into homicides, suicides and accidental deaths involving weapons.",
      "But CDC violence-prevention programs that acted on that information were halted. So, too, was work on a system that collects hospital data on nonfatal injuries from causes such as shootings, crashes and drownings.",
      "Also going away, apparently, is the CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey. The system is designed to pick up information that's not found in law enforcement statistics. Health officials see that work as important, because not all sexual violence victims go to police.",
      "The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which tracks job-related illnesses and deaths and makes recommendations on how to prevent them, was gutted by the cuts.",
      "Kennedy has said that 20% of the people laid off might be reinstated as the agency tries to correct mistakes.",
      "That appeared to happen last month, when the American Federation of Government Employees said that NIOSH workers involved in a black lung disease program for coal miners had been temporarily called back.",
      "But HHS officials did not answer questions about the reinstatement. The AFGE's Micah Niemeier-Walsh later said the workers continued to have June termination dates and \u201cwe are concerned this is to give the appearance that the programs are still functioning, when effectively they are not.\u201d",
      "There's been no talk of salvaging some other NIOSH programs, including one focused on workplace deaths in the oil and gas industries or a research project into how common hearing loss is in that industry.",
      "The HHS cuts eliminated the 17-member team responsible for the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, one of the main ways the government measures drug use.",
      "Also axed were the CDC staff working on the National Youth Tobacco Survey.",
      "There are other surveys that look at youth smoking and drug use, including the University of Michigan's federally funded \u201cMonitoring the Future\u201d survey of schoolkids.",
      "But the federal studies looked at both adults and adolescents, and provided insights into drug use by high school dropouts. The CDC also delved into specific vaping and tobacco products in the ways that other surveys don't, and was a driver in the federal push to better regulate electronic cigarettes.",
      "\"There was overlap among the surveys, but each one had its own specific focus that the other ones didn\u2019t cover,\u201c said Richard Miech, who leads the Michigan study.",
      "Work to modernize data collection has been derailed. That includes an upgrade to a 22-year-old system that helps local public health departments track diseases and allows CDC to put together a national picture.",
      "Another casualty was the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which tries to predict disease trends.",
      "The center, created during the COVID-19 pandemic, was working on forecasting the current multi-state measles outbreak. That forecast hasn't been published partly because of the layoffs, according to two CDC officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss it and fear retribution for speaking to the press.",
      "Trump hasn't always supported widespread testing of health problems.",
      "In the spring of 2020, when COVID-19 diagnoses were exploding, the president groused that the nation\u2019s ability to do more testing was making the U.S. look like it had a worse problem than other countries. He called testing \u201ca double-edged sword.\u201d",
      "Mooney, the Johns Hopkins historian, wonders how interested the new administration is in reporting on health problems.",
      "\u201cYou could think it\u2019s deliberate,\" he said. \u201cIf you keep people from knowing, they\u2019re less likely to be concerned.\u201d",

      "It was an unusual study about trust, vaccines in a historically Black community.",
      "WASHINGTON -- Some Denver parents got texts during this winter\u2019s brutal flu season with videos sharing why people in their neighborhoods chose flu shots for their kids, an unusual study about trust and vaccines in a historically Black community.",
      "But no one will know how it worked out: The Trump administration canceled the project before the data could be analyzed -- and researchers aren\u2019t the only ones upset.",
      "\u201cFor someone like me, from the Black community who income-wise is on the lower end, we don\u2019t often have a voice,\u201d said Denver mom Chantyl Busby, one of the study\u2019s community advisers. \u201cHaving this funding taken away from this project sends a horrible, horrible message. It\u2019s almost like telling us all over again that our opinions don\u2019t matter.\u201d",
      "How to talk about vaccines with parents \u2013 or anyone \u2013 is taking on new urgency: At least 216 U.S. children died of flu this season, the worst pediatric toll in 15 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Unvaccinated children are fueling one of the country's largest measles outbreaks in decades, and another vaccine-preventable disease \u2014 whooping cough \u2014 is soaring, too.",
      "At the same time Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. questions vaccines long proven to be safe and effective. Moves by the Trump administration are making it increasingly uncertain that COVID-19 vaccines will be available this fall. And the administration has slashed funding for public health and medical research, including abruptly stopping studies of vaccine hesitancy.",
      "\u201cWe need to understand what it is that is creating this challenge to vaccines and why,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, who directs the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy and worries the country is entering \u201cscientific dark ages.\"",
      "At Denver Health, Dr. Joshua Williams is a pediatrician who every day has vaccine conversations with confused or worried parents. Some even ask if they\u2019ll get kicked out of his practice for refusing immunizations.",
      "Nope, Williams says: Building trust takes time.",
      "\u201cThe most satisfying vaccine-related encounters I have are the ones in families who had significant concerns for a long time, came to trust me over the years as I cared for broken arms and ear infections \u2013 and ultimately vaccinated their child,\u201d he said.",
      "But in the TikTok age, Williams wondered if digital storytelling \u2013 seeing and hearing what led other families to choose vaccination \u2013 might help those decisions. He chose flu shots as the test case \u2014 just under half of U.S. children got one this season. And Black children are among those most at risk of getting seriously ill from influenza.",
      "With a grant from the National Institutes of Health, Williams partnered with Denver\u2019s nonprofit Center for African American Health to host workshops bringing volunteers together to discuss how influenza and the flu vaccine had impacted their lives. Professionals helped those who wanted to go the extra step turn them into 2- to 3-minute polished videos.",
      "After two years of community engagement, five of those videos were part of the pilot study sending text messages to 200 families who get care at two Denver Health clinics.",
      "In one video, a mother described getting her first flu vaccination along with her young daughter, making her own health decisions after leaving a controlling relationship.",
      "In another, a grandmother explained how she\u2019ll never again miss a vaccine appointment after her grandson spent his 4th birthday hospitalized with the flu.",
      "Seeing \u201cpeople that they look like, that they sound like, who have experiences they\u2019ve been through that can go, \u2018Hey, I felt like you felt but this changed my life,\u2019\u201d is powerful, said Busby, who OK'd her kids' flu vaccinations after questioning Williams during multiple family checkups.",
      "The study's sudden cancellation means Williams can\u2019t assess if the texted videos influenced families' vaccine decisions \u2013 lost data from more than two years of work and already-spent NIH dollars. It also jeopardizes the researchers' careers. While considering next steps, Williams has asked permission of community members to use some of the videos in his own practice as he discusses vaccination.",
      "Williams gets personal, too, telling families that his kids are vaccinated and how his 95-year-old grandmother reminisces about the terror of polio during her own childhood before those vaccinations were developed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve lost the collective memory about what it\u2019s like to have these diseases in our community,\u201d Williams said, ruefully noting the ongoing measles outbreak. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to take a collective voice from the community saying this is important, to remind those in power that we need to be allocating resources to infection prevention and vaccine hesitancy research.\u201d",

      "Trabelsi, who is Jewish and served as Tunisia\u2019s tourism minister from 2018 to 2020, said little was known about the attacker, adding he did not assume it had to do with religion or the holiday, but would await findings from Tunisian authorities about potential motives.",

      "Leo, standing on the balcony of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica for the first time as pope, addressed in Spanish the people of Chiclayo, which sits just 9 miles (14 kilometers) from Peru\u2019s northern Pacific coast and is among the country\u2019s most populous cities.",
      "\u201cGreetings... to all of you, and in particular, to my beloved diocese of Chiclayo in Peru, where a faithful people have accompanied their bishop, shared their faith,\u201d he said.",
      "Thomas Nicolini, a Peruvian who studies economics in Rome, said he went to St. Peter\u2019s Square as soon as he heard Prevost was the new pope.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful area, but one of the regions that needs lots of hope,\" he said referring to Chiclayo. \"So, now I\u2019m expecting that the new pope helps as many people as possible, and tries to reignite, let\u2019s say, the faith young people have lost.\u201d",
      "Diana Celis, who attended several Masses officiated by Prevost in Chiclayo, told The Associated Press that he would often repeat that he had \u201ccome from Chicago to Chiclayo, the only difference is a few letters.\u201d",
      "Born in Chicago in 1955, Prevost has held Peruvian nationality since 2015, Peru's national register agency confirmed Thursday. In 2014, he served as the administrator and later archbishop of Chiclayo and remained in that position until Francis summoned him to Rome in 2023 to serve as the powerful head of the office that vets bishop nominations from around the world, one of the most important jobs in the Catholic Church.",

She said he did just that in 2022, when torrential rains affected Chiclayo and nearby villages.",
      "He also delivered food and blankets to the remote Andean villages, driving a white pickup truck and sleeping on a thin mattress on the floor. In those villages, Sesa said, Prevost ate whatever was offered to him, including the peasant diet consisting of potatoes, cheese and sweet corn. But, if the opportunity came up, he would enjoy carne asada \u2013 one of his favorite dishes \u2013 accompanied by a glass of Coca-Cola.",

      "Prevost was twice elected prior general, or top leader, of the Augustinians, the 13th century religious order founded by St. Augustine. Francis clearly had an eye on him for years, moving him from the Augustinian leadership back to Peru in 2014 to serve as the administrator and later archbishop of Chiclayo.",

In early 2025, Francis again showed his esteem by appointing Prevost to the most senior rank of cardinals.",
      "The selection of a U.S.-born pope could have profound impact on the future of the U.S. Catholic Church, which has been sharply divided between conservatives and progressives. Francis, with Prevost\u2019s help at the help of the bishop vetting office, had embarked on a 12-year project to rein in the traditionalist tendencies in the United States.",

Erdogan\u2019s office said that Turkish and Iraqi officials will ink a series of cooperation agreements during the visit.",
      "Relations between Turkey and Iraq were often strained over Turkish military incursions into northern Iraq for operations against the banned Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, and the establishment of Turkish military bases there. Baghdad frequently condemned the incursions as a violation of its sovereignty.",

      "Also last year, Iraq announced that the Iraqi National Security Council had issued a ban on the PKK, although it stopped short of designating it as a terrorist organization.",
      "The visit comes after the PKK\u2019s jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, called on his group to dissolve and disarm as part of a new peace initiative with Turkey. The group declared a unilateral ceasefire in March and is now expected to hold a congress in northern Iraq, during which it would announce its dissolution, Turkish officials have said.",

      "The mayor of Nagasaki said the city will invite representatives of \u2018all countries\u2019 and regions to this year's atomic bombing anniversary",
      "TOKYO -- The mayor of Nagasaki on Thursday announced that the city will invite representatives \u201cof all countries\u201d and regions to the peace memorial marking the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing of the city.",
      "The invitation to the 157 countries and regions that have diplomatic missions in Japan will include Russia, Belarus and Israel, who were excluded last year.",
      "Mayor Shiro Suzuki said he wants all representatives to see the brutal consequences of atomic weapons use as a lesson at a time of growing divisions and conflicts.",
      "The United States dropped its second atomic bomb on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, three days after the first bombing of Hiroshima, together killing more than 210,000 people. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, ending World War II and its nearly half-century of aggression across Asia.",
      "Suzuki said his city is returning to its \u201cfundamental purpose\u201d of the ceremony \u2014 to mourn the atomic bomb victims and pray for lasting world peace. \"We want to go beyond national borders, overcome ideological differences and any other divisions to have global representatives gather in Nagasaki.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cAt a time of worsening divisions of the international society, I feel more strongly than ever about the importance for representatives of all countries to participate in the Nagasaki peace memorial and learn the atrocious and inhumane outcomes of the nuclear weapons use through their own eyes, ears and hearts.\u201d",
      "Suzuki did not invite Israel to the 2024 anniversary, citing concern of \u201cunforeseeable situations\u201d such as violent protests over the war in Gaza disrupting the memorial. But Israel's exclusion drew criticisms and boycot by ambassadors from the U.S. and five other Group of Seven nations \u2014 Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the U.K. \u2014 and the European Union.",
      "Russia and its ally Belarus have not been invited to the Nagasaki memorial event since 2022 following Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Japan, despite being the world\u2019s only country to have suffered nuclear attacks, relies on the U.S. nuclear umbrella and its \u201cextended deterrence\u201d amid growing tension in the region and supports atomic weapons possession for deterrence.",

      "As Europe celebrates the 80th anniversary of its triumph over fascism and the end of World War II, Algeria is remembering a darker anniversary: the colonial-era massacres that unfolded on the same day",
      "ALGIERS, Algeria -- As Europe celebrates the 80th anniversary of its triumph over fascism and the end of World War II, Algeria is remembering a darker anniversary: the colonial-era massacres that erupted the same day.",
      "In a message this week, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune framed commemoration as a matter of national pride and called the event a prelude to Algeria\u2019s fight for independence.",
      "\u201cThe commemoration of May 8 reflects the Algerians\u2019 commitment to freedom and dignity, for which they took to the streets with bare hands to confront an enemy,\u201d Tebboune said, calling French colonialism \u201cgenocidal\u201d and a crime against humanity.",
      "More than 500,000 tirailleurs from North Africa, West Africa and Madagascar fought for France during WWII. Some volunteered, others were forcibly conscripted. Many lost their lives. Across the board, they were generally paid less than European soldiers.",
      "Many Algerian veterans believed their service would lead to greater rights. But when the war ended, Algerians who dared to demand them were met with repression and violence, even as French leader Gen. Charles De Gaulle exalted how \u201cthe cause of liberty and justice\u201d had prevailed in a radio broadcast throughout France and its colonies, including Algeria.",
      "On May 8, 1945, Algerians filled city streets in Ain Temouchent, Guelma, Kherrata and Setif, waving flags and reviving pre-war calls for independence. After demonstrators faced police fire, anti-French riots broke out, killing more than 100. France subsequently launched an air and ground offensive that killed thousands of Algerians \u2014 45,000, according to Algerian authorities, and around 3,000, according to French statistics.",
      "The war's ending sparked similar disenchantment in Britain\u2019s colonies in East and West Africa, where more than 375,000 men enlisted. Soldiers who returned home expecting to be rewarded for their service instead faced racism and a continued lack of political representation. Both helped fuel the subsequent Mau Mau rebellion against British rule in Kenya, during which tens of thousands were killed.",
      "In recent years, memorials there as well as in South Africa have honored the service of African veterans. Elsewhere, including in Senegal, they\u2019ve commemorated injustice and violence that many endured post-war.",
      "For many in Algeria, the May 8 massacres awakened the anger and resolve that later fueled Algeria\u2019s war for independence.",
      "\u201cThey understood that the only possible and unique path to independence was armed struggle,\u201d historian Mohamed Ferrad said in an interview this week.",
      "V-E Day events have been going all week in Europe, where leaders have focused on the plight of Ukraine in its fight against Russia and values such as freedom and democracy. French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to speak on similar topics on Thursday evening.",
      "Meanwhile, Algeria\u2019s Ministry of War Veterans is marking the anniversary with a series of nationwide events and panels featuring firsthand accounts from veterans and lectures from historians on the battle for independence after 132 years of French colonialism.",
      "The massacres have been debated in popular books and films in Algeria and France and are a recurring theme when tensions flare between the two countries.",
      "Tebboune and Macron announced a truth commission-style \u201cdossier de memoire\u201d in 2022, led by a committee of historians from both countries. However its activities have stalled as relations deteriorated over issues such as immigration and how France\u2019s juggles ties between Algeria and its regional rival Morocco.",
      "French leaders, including Macron, have called for truth and recognition but stopped short of fulfilling Algeria\u2019s demands for a formal state apology for the massacres.",
      "\u201cAlgeria will never allow the memory issue to be forgotten or used as a bargaining chip, out of loyalty to our martyrs,\u201d Tebboune wrote in his Wednesday letter.",
      "A delegation of around 30 French lawmakers from leftist and centrist parties arrived in Algiers on Wednesday to participate in the commemorations of the massacres.",

      "Lawmakers in Europe voted have voted to downgrade protections for wolves across the European Union in a victory for farmers over environmentalists",
      "BARCELONA -- Lawmakers in Europe voted Thursday to downgrade protections for wolves across the European Union's 27 states in a victory for farmers over environmentalists.",
      "Nearly two-thirds of the European Parliament meeting in Strasbourg, France voted to change wolves' status from \u2018strictly protected\u2019 to \u2019protected' in a vote of 371 to 162, with 37 abstentions.",
      "Centrist and right-wing groups celebrated the vote.",
      "\u201cFarmers can now breathe a sigh of relief,\" said Herbert Dorfmann, a spokesperson for the European People\u2019s Party, a coalition of center-right groups in the EU. Right-wing Dutch politician Sander Smit said on Twitter: \u201cThis is fantastic news.\"",
      "Environmental groups criticized the decision as politically motivated rather than scientifically grounded.",
      "\u201cThis is a sad day for biodiversity and wild animals,\u201d said L\u00e9a Badoz at the Eurogroup for Animals. Joanna Swabe, a spokesperson for Humane World for Animals, called for individual governments to increase national protection for wolves.",
      "Politician Jutta Paulus from the parliament's Greens party said the campaign to reduce the wolves' protection \u201cborrows from the Donald Trump playbook\u201d and \u201cignores scientific evidence and attacks legislation which has been proven to work for decades for no clear gain other than the scoring of cheap populistic points.\"",
      "Tuesday's vote was the final real hurdle before the measure becomes EU law. The change to the central Habitats Directive law will now likely be passed swiftly by the European Council and enter into force across the 27 member states.",
      "Once deemed necessary to combat threats to the apex predator, restrictions on hunting wolves have over the past few years lost public support as many EU environmental rules and regulations have come under pressure in recent years. Populist and extreme-right parties have criticized the measures as being thought up by urban elites with little knowledge of rural life.",
      "Farmers in many member states have been increasingly angered by attacks on livestock by packs of wolves that have thrived in woods and fields close to agricultural land.",
      "The political movement to ease rules on killing wolves was given top-level support by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. An ardent fan of horses, von der Leyen had a pony Dolly that was killed by a wolf three years ago.",
      "Last year, more than 50 European nations from Turkey to Iceland voted to change the biodiversity treaty known as the Bern Convention to curtail protections for wolves.",
      "Experts and environmental groups estimate there could be up to 19,000 wolves across Europe, with large populations thought to roam in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Poland, Romania and Spain. After nearly being wiped out in the 20th century, their numbers are estimated to have grown by at least 25% over the last decade.",
      "Programs around the world to protect wolves have been shown to benefit local ecosystems. Yellowstone National Park in the United States said reintroducing wolves in 1995 had led to a better regulated food chain that helped drive a bump in forest cover and animal populations. Yet American states like Wyoming and Montana have passed similar bills allowing for more killing of wolves, driven as in Europe by politics mixing agitated farmers and safety concerns.",
      "\u201cWolves are vital to healthy ecosystems, but today\u2019s vote treats them as a political problem, not an ecological asset\u201d, said Ilaria Di Silvestre, Director of Policy and Advocacy for Europe at International Fund for Animal Welfare. \u201cThe EU was once proud to lead on nature protection. Now we are seeing vital species like the wolf sacrificed for short-term political interests that will benefit no one.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- Jurors began deliberating Thursday in the case of two men charged with cutting down the Sycamore Gap tree that once stood along the ancient Hadrian's Wall in northern England.",
      "Daniel Graham, 39, and Adam Carruthers, 32, have pleaded not guilty to two counts each of criminal damage. The former friends each testified that they were at their separate homes that night and not involved.",
      "Justice Christina Lambert told jurors in Newcastle Crown Court to take as long as they need to reach unanimous verdicts in the trial that began April 28.",
      "The tree was not Britain\u2019s biggest or oldest, but it was prized for its picturesque setting along the ancient wall built by Emperor Hadrian in A.D. 122 to protect the northwest frontier of the Roman Empire.",
      "The tree was long known to locals but achieved international fame in Kevin Costner\u2019s 1991 film \u201cRobin Hood: Prince Of Thieves.\u201d It sat symmetrically between two hills along the historic wall and was a draw for tourists, landscape photographers and those taking selfies for social media.",
      "Prosecutors said the tree's value exceeded 620,000 pounds ($830,000) and damage to the wall, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was assessed at 1,100 pounds.",
      "Prosecutor Richard Wright told jurors in his closing argument that the men cut the tree down for \u201ca bit of a laugh\u201d in the dark of night during a blustery storm on Sept. 28, 2023, but had failed to realize the outrage they would spark in the \"arboreal equivalent of mindless thuggery.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey woke up the morning after and soon realized \u2014 as the news media rolled in, as the outrage of the public became clear \u2014 it must have dawned on them that they couldn\u2019t see anyone else smiling,\u201d Wright said. \u201cFar from being the big men they thought they were, everyone else thought that they were rather pathetic.\u201d",
      "The two men had once been best friends. But during the trial Graham blamed Carruthers and another man for cutting down the tree, saying they tried to frame him by taking his car to the scene of the crime and using his phone to shoot video of the tree being cut down.",
      "Andrew Gurney, a lawyer for Carruthers, said Graham\u2019s story didn\u2019t add up and he was projecting his guilt on his former friend.",
      "\u201cIs that a plausible chain of events or is that the desperate story of a man caught out?\u201d Gurney said.",
      "Wright mocked the duo's defense, saying common sense and a trail of evidence should lead jurors to convict them for their \u201cmoronic mission.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors showed grainy video from Graham\u2019s phone of the tree being cut down \u2014 a video sent shortly afterward to Carruthers' phone. Metadata showed it was taken at the tree's location in Northumberland National Park. Data showed Graham's Range Rover had traveled there.",
      "Wright said he couldn't say who cut the tree and who held the phone, but the two were the only people in the world who had the video on their devices.",
      "Text and voice messages exchanged the following day between Carruthers and Graham captured their excitement as the story went viral.",

      "A leading aid group says that Israel\u2019s ongoing blockade of humanitarian assistance for Gaza has forced it to shut down its community soup kitchens",
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza -- Israel\u2019s ongoing blockade of humanitarian assistance for Gaza forced a leading aid group on Thursday to shut its community soup kitchens, faced empty warehouses and no replenishment of supplies in the war-battered enclave.",
      "World Central Kitchen was serving 133,000 meals per day and baking 80,000 loaves of bread over the past weeks, but said it was forced to suspend operations since there is almost no food left in Gaza for the organization to cook.",
      "The lack of food is threatening Gaza's population, already battered by 19 months of war. In April, the World Food Program said its food stocks in Gaza have run out under Israel's blockade, ending a main source of sustenance for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the territory.",
      "Malnutrition and hunger are becoming increasingly prevalent in the Gaza Strip as Israel\u2019s total blockade enters its third month. Aid agencies say a shortage of food and supplies has driven the territory toward starvation and supplies to treat and prevent malnutrition are depleted and quickly running out.",
      "Israel imposed the blockade on March 2, then shattered a two-month ceasefire by resuming military operations in the territory on March 18. It said both steps aim to pressure the militant Hamas group to release hostages the extremists still hold. Rights groups call the blockade a \u201cstarvation tactic\u201d that endangers the entire population and a potential war crime.",
      "Community kitchens such as the ones run by World Central Kitchen are a lifeline for hundreds of thousands for their daily meal, but many are shutting down due to lack of supplies.",
      "At those still open, chaotic scenes of desperate men, women and children fighting to get meager rations are common. Bakeries have closed, while water distribution is grinding to a halt due to lack of fuel.",
      "Since the start of the war, World Central Kitchen said it has served more than 130 million meals and baked 80 million loaves of bread. The organization also said on Thursday there was no flour left in their mobile bakery.",
      "\u201cOur trucks\u2014loaded with food and supplies\u2014are waiting in Egypt, Jordan and Israel, ready to enter Gaza,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, the celebrity chef who founded the organization. \u201cBut they cannot move without permission. Humanitarian aid must be allowed to flow.\u201d",
      "COGAT, the Israeli defense body overseeing aid to Gaza, said the blockade would continue unless the Israeli government changed its policy.",
      "Since the start of the year, more than 10,000 children have been admitted or treated for acute malnutrition, according to the World Health Organization. The increase was particularly dramatic in March, with 3,600 cases \u2014 an 80% increase, compared to the 2,000 children in February, UNICEF reported.",
      "Nearly half the 200 nutrition centers around Gaza have shut down because of displacement and bombardment.",
      "World Central Kitchen had previously suspended operations in April of last year after seven aid workers were killed in Israeli strikes on their convoy, before resuming weeks later.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Russia and Ukraine both reported attacks on their forces on the first day of a 72-hour ceasefire called by President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha accused Russia of violating its own ceasefire 734 times between midnight and midday Thursday. He called the ceasefire a \u201cfarce\u201d on the social media platform X.",
      "His comments came as Ukraine\u2019s parliament unanimously approved a landmark minerals deal with the U.S. Ratification is a key step in setting in motion a deal which will allow Washington access to Ukraine\u2019s largely untapped minerals, deepen strategic ties and create a joint investment fund with the U.S. for the reconstruction of Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThis document is not merely a legal construct, it is the foundation of a new model of interaction with a key strategic partner,\u201d Ukraine's Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko wrote on X.",
      "Russian bombs struck northeast Ukraine in the opening hours of Moscow's unilateral ceasefire, killing at least one civilian, Ukrainian officials said. Artillery assaults took place across the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, although with less intensity than in the previous 24 hours, officials said.",
      "The ceasefire coincides with Russia\u2019s biggest secular holiday, the 80th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany. Kyiv has pressed for a longer-term ceasefire.",
      "Putin on Thursday welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping in the Kremlin. Xi, who Putin earlier described as \u201cour main guest\u201d at Friday\u2019s Victory Day festivities, arrived in Russia on Wednesday for a four-day visit.",
      "Sybiha said Russia carried out 63 assault operations along the front line, 23 of which were still ongoing as of midday. Ukraine \u201cresponds appropriately\u201d and is actively sharing information about the attacks with the U.S, the European Union and others. \u201cWe will not let Putin fool anyone when he does not even keep his own word,\u201d Sybiha said.",
      "Russian attacks also took place near Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region on Thursday morning, Oleh Petrasiuk, a spokesman with Ukraine's 24th Mechanised Brigade, told The Associated Press via phone.",
      "One person died and two were wounded when Russian forces dropped guided air bombs on residential areas near the border in the northeast Sumy region, the regional prosecutor's office said.",
      "Large-scale missile and drone attacks, which have been a near-daily occurrence in Ukraine in recent weeks, were not recorded since 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, Ukraine's air force said.",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously cast doubt on the ceasefire, calling it \u201cmanipulation\u201d as U.S.-led peace efforts stalled. \u201cFor some reason, everyone is supposed to wait until May 8 before ceasing fire \u2014 just to provide Putin with silence for his parade,\u201d Zelenskyy said.",
      "In March, the United States proposed a 30-day truce in the war, which Ukraine accepted, but the Kremlin has held out for ceasefire terms more to its liking.",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry meanwhile accused Ukrainian forces of attacking its positions and said its forces would continue to \u201cmirror\u201d Ukraine\u2019s actions during the Kremlin\u2019s ceasefire.",
      "The regions of Belgorod, Lipetsk, Orenburg, Ryazan and Tambov came under a drone threat alert overnight, but there were no reports of any drones being shot down or intercepted. Russia's civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia also briefly imposed restrictions on flights to and from the airport in Nizhny Novgorod.",
      "Ukraine's parliament approved the minerals agreement with 338 members voting in favor out of the required 226 votes, Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zheleznyak wrote on his Telegram account. No lawmaker voted against it or abstained.",
      "With the ratification concluded, two more technical agreements will have to be developed and signed by both sides, said Svyrydenko. These include \u201ca limited partnership agreement and an agreement that essentially determines how the fund will function,\" she told reporters ahead of the vote.",
      "She said that the U.S. expects the work on the documents to take \u201cweeks, not months.\u201d",
      "In welcoming Xi, Putin said that \"the brotherhood of arms between our peoples, which developed during the harsh war years, is one of the fundamental foundations of modern Russian-Chinese relations of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation.\u201d",
      "He added that Moscow and Beijing were developing ties \u201cfor the benefit of the peoples of both countries and not against anyone.\u201d",
      "Xi, in turn, said that \u201chistory and reality have fully proved that the continuous development and deepening of China-Russia relations is a necessity for the friendship between the two peoples from generation to generation.\" He also called for safeguarding \u201cinternational fairness and justice.\u201d",
      "Putin and Xi have met over 40 times and developed strong personal ties that bolstered the countries' \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d as both face tensions with the West.",
      "China has offered robust diplomatic support to Moscow after its 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine and has emerged as a top market for Russian oil and gas, helping fill the Kremlin\u2019s war coffers.

      "Imamoglu, seen as the main opposition challenger to Erdogan\u2019s 22-year rule, was arrested on March 19 and jailed on corruption charges. He was nominated as his Republican People's Party, or CHP's presidential candidate while in custody.",
      "His arrest has been widely viewed as politically motivated although the government insists Turkey\u2019s judiciary is independent and free of political influence. It triggered widespread demonstrations calling for his release and an end to Turkey\u2019s democratic backsliding under Erdogan.",
      "Despite his detention, Imamoglu had remained active on social media. His lawyers are expected to appeal the legal restriction.",
      "Opposition politicians criticized the restriction as an assault attack on free speech in Turkey.",

      "New Zealand is still one of a few countries in the world where sheep outnumber people",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- The vast number of sheep in New Zealand relative to the country\u2019s scant human population has long been the subject of jokes aimed at New Zealanders abroad. It\u2019s true: The country is one of a handful in the world that\u2019s still home to more sheep than people.",
      "But humans are catching up, according to new figures released Tuesday. With a population of 23.6 million sheep and 5.3 million people, there are about 4.5 sheep for each New Zealander, government statistics agency data showed.",
      "That\u2019s down from 22 sheep per person in 1982, when farming sheep for meat and wool was New Zealand\u2019s biggest earner. Now, years of falling wool prices prompted by a global shift to synthetic fibers have led farmers to change what they do with their land, the sector\u2019s biggest lobby group said.",
      "By land area, New Zealand is about the size of the United Kingdom, but it has a human population 13 times smaller than the U.K. That means there\u2019s plenty of room for sheep.",
      "For close to 150 years, the sheep industry was the backbone of New Zealand\u2019s economy and numbers boomed \u2014 peaking in 1982 when there were more than 70 million sheep and just 3.2 million people. Before \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d brought waves of tourists to the country, images of green fields filled with placid sheep against backdrops of snow-capped mountains dominated the country\u2019s marketing abroad.",
      "But over years of decline for global wool prices since \u2014 and despite recent rallies \u2014 the national flock has steadily diminished. Now dairy holds the biggest share of New Zealand\u2019s agriculture and horticulture-dominant export market.",
      "In 2023, Stats NZ, a government agency, said New Zealand in 2022 dipped below five sheep per person for the first time. The national flock had lost a million more sheep in Tuesday\u2019s figures, which recorded livestock numbers as of June 2024.",
      "Toby Williams, a spokesperson for sector lobby group Federated Farmers, said sheep farmers have switched to more lucrative pursuits \u2014 dairy, or the conversion of land from farming to pine forestry in order to sell carbon offsets.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m really honest, the wool industry is almost at that tipping point, if not already there, of not having a wool industry anymore,\u201d he said.",
      "The government has drawn up measures intended to slow the decline, including an announcement in 2024 that they will place limits on the scale of farmland that can be converted to carbon forestry.",
      "New government procurement guidelines launched in April urge the use of New Zealand wool products \u2014 such as carpets and insulation \u2014 in newly constructed or refurbished public buildings. But those measures are not expected to halt declining sheep numbers.",
      "Some sheep-farming countries are recording similar trends. New Zealand\u2019s closest neighbor Australia \u2014 the source of most of the sheep jokes about New Zealanders \u2014 is also home to more sheep than people, but the national flock is shrinking there too.",
      "The gap is slimmer: There are about three sheep per Australian.",

      "A large TV screen displayed images from St. Peter\u2019s Square and the chimney atop the Sistine Chapel, where 133 cardinals were casting the first votes for pope, as locals in the Veneto town of Schiavon, near Vicenza, quaffed glasses of wine.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re waiting, and we\u2019re rooting for him,\u2019\u2019 said Giacomo Bonora, raising a glass of the local favorite, a red wine spritz, and using the local nickname for Parolin, \u201cDon Piero.\"",
      "Bonora said that when Parolin returns to the town of 2,600, he asks to be called \u201cDon Piero,\" the way a parish priest would be addressed, using the Veneto dialect for Pietro, rather than \u201ceminence,'' a cardinal's honorific.",
      "Parolin, 70, is a veteran diplomat who was Francis\u2019 secretary of state, essentially the Holy See\u2019s prime minister and No. 2 to the pope.",
      "Outside, a city worker stopped to show the parish sacristan a photo of Parolin when the town celebrated his elevation to secretary of state 12 years ago. Everyone is hopeful, but officials have been instructed not to speak to the media until a new pope is elected.",
      "Angelo Cisalto, the sacristan at the town's St. Margherita parish church, was heading home to keep an eye on the smoke coming out of the chimney.",
      "If it is white, it is his job to go and ring the church bells. Cisalto, 84, remembers Parolin as a child, 14 years his junior, and always devout. \u201cHe used to dress up as an altar boy, and at home, in his garage, he had a little altar,\u2019\u2019 where he would play saying Mass, Cisalto recalled. \u201cHe is a very good, very humble person.\"",
      "Back at Caff\u00e8 Centrale, clients ordered plates of cold cuts as the closed meeting of cardinals dragged on long past the expected hour. TV reporters whose air times had passed headed out for the night. Finally, black smoke emerged.",
      "\u201cTomorrow, we'll do it again,\u201d Bonora said.",
      "Locals recalled that Parolin came regularly to Schiavon before his mother died last summer. His father died when he was 10, and he entered the seminary in nearby Vicenza at 14. For a period, he was a parish priest in the foothills town of Schio before joining the Vatican's diplomatic corps.",
      "While closely associated with Francis\u2019 pontificate, Parolin is much more demure in personality and diplomatic in his approach to leading than the Argentine Jesuit he served \u2014 and he knows where the Catholic Church might need a course correction. Many see him as embodying Francis' pastoral message while being more open to conservative points of view. While his career has been spent in Italy, his job as a Vatican diplomat has seen him travel the world, giving him a global perspective.",
      "If he were elected, he would return an Italian to the papacy after three successive outsiders: St. John Paul II (Poland), Pope Benedict XVI (Germany) and Francis (Argentina).",

      "Commemorations have been going all week through Europe, and Britain has taken a lead. Here too, the current-day plight of Ukraine in its fight against Russia took center stage.",
      "\u201cThe idea that this was all just history and it doesn\u2019t matter now somehow, is completely wrong,\u201d U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. \"Those values of freedom and democracy matter today.\u201d",

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taiwan marked the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day on Thursday by making broad comparisons to threats from China, whose leader Xi Jinping was in Russia for commemorations as Moscow continues its invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\u201cPeace is priceless, and war has no winners. History has taught us that no matter the driving reason or ideology, military aggression against another country is an unjust crime that is bound to fail,\" Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te told diplomats in Taipei.",
      "\u201cAuthoritarianism and aggression lead only to slaughter, tragedy, and greater inequality,\u201d he added.",
      "Turning more directly to China's threats, Lai said that both Taiwan and Europe were \u201cnow facing the threat of a new authoritarian bloc.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are seeing our decades-old undersea cables, crucial for communications and cybersecurity, being sabotaged. We are seeing external interference in our elections, crucial for healthy democratic development, through the spread of misinformation and disinformation, sowing intentional division in society. We are seeing our fair, free and open international rules-based markets being tested by all manner of gray-zone activities, dumping, pressures and intrusions,\u201d Lai said.",
      "Lai's remarks came during Taiwan's first-ever official commemoration of VE Day and at a time when Taiwan is making a diplomatic push for closer ties with fellow democracies that nevertheless have no formal ties with the island in deference to Beijing. Former President Tsai Ing-wen is visiting Lithuania and Denmark from Friday, while Foreign Affairs Minister Lin Chia-lung is visiting Texas.",
      "China fought alongside the Allies in Asia during World War II and received some military assistance from the then-USSR.",
      "China claims Taiwan as part of its territory to be annexed by force if necessary and says it has no right to international recognition. Just 12 countries, mostly small island nations in the South Pacific and Caribbean, have official diplomatic ties with Taiwan.",
      "Lai said that those who cherish peace \u201ccannot sit idly by and allow aggression. The outbreak of the war in Europe certainly had much to do with an authoritarian regime seeking to satisfy its expansionary ambitions, but its wider spread throughout Europe had much more to do with a lack of vigilance toward acts of aggression.\u201d",
      "China's Xi, who has said Taiwan's absorption by his authoritarian Communist regime is inevitable, was meanwhile being lauded by Russian President Vladimir Putin as \u201cour main guest\u201d at the Victory Day festivities. The Russian leader noted that he and Xi would discuss bilateral and global issues at their summit in Moscow.",
      "Xi is visiting for four days at a time when fighting with Ukraine, which Russia invaded more than three years ago, has closed airports in the Moscow region. The two leaders will also discuss Russia\u2019s supply of oil and gas to China, as well as cooperation within BRICS \u2014 the bloc of developing economies that initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa but has since expanded to more countries.",
      "Putin and Xi have met over 40 times as their governments align their foreign policies to challenge the Western-led liberal democratic world order.",
      "China has offered strong diplomatic support to Moscow since the 2022 invasion and has emerged as a top market for Russian oil and gas, helping fill the Kremlin\u2019s war chest. Russia also has relied on China as the main source of machinery and electronics to keep its drones and other parts of its military machine running after Western sanctions curtailed high-tech supplies.",
      "Beijing hasn\u2019t provided weapons to use in Ukraine, but has backed the Kremlin diplomatically, blaming Western threats against Russia\u2019s security for sparking the war. China also has strongly condemned Western sanctions against Moscow, while Russia has consistently voiced support for Beijing on issues related to Taiwan.",
      "Taiwan's government is the inheritor to the Nationalist regime of Chiang Kai-shek, which battled Japanese invaders throughout the 1930s and up to the war's end in 1945. It was ultimately driven from China by Mao Zedong's Communist forces in 1949 and has since transitioned to a full democracy with strong but unofficial ties to the U.S., the EU, Japan and other industrialized democracies.",
      "Chiang's regime also provided visa-free entry for thousands of European Jews, who settled in Shanghai during the war years, saving them from the Holocaust.",

      "Albania\u2019s main opposition leader has hired Trump-linked campaign consultants and a lobbying firm to help him in the country's May 11 parliamentary election",
      "TIRANA, Albania -- Some of the architects of Donald Trump's presidential campaigns have reunited in Albania as they try to help a Trumpian candidate prevail in this weekend's elections.",
      "They include Chris LaCivita, who served as co-campaign manager of Trump\u2019s successful 2024 effort, Trump\u2019s longtime pollster Tony Fabrizio, and Paul Manafort, who served as chairman of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign before he was convicted in 2018 of crimes that included secretly lobbying for Ukraine\u2019s former pro-Russian president.",
      "The trio is working for former prime minister and president Sali Berisha, the head of Albania\u2019s opposition Democratic Party, who is challenging Prime Minister Edi Rama to return the Democrats to power, even as he awaits trial on corruption charges.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the only Democrat Party I would ever consider working for,\u201d quipped LaCivita as he headed to the country for his third trip before Sunday's election.",
      "Berisha, who is hoping the new administration will reverse sanctions barring him from entering the U.S., has also signed a two-year, $6 million contract with Continental Strategy, a Republican consulting and lobbying firm. Its staff includes Katie Wiles, the daughter of White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, who along with LaCivita, led Trump\u2019s campaign. Katie Wiles is not involved with the client.",
      "Foreign consulting has long been a popular way for U.S. strategists from both parties to rake in cash between election cycles. But Berisha\u2019s decision to lean on Trump hands \u2014 and to highlight their involvement \u2014 makes clear how valuable they can be to candidates trying to harness populist sentiment and replicate Trump\u2019s rise. In Albania, like many other countries, being seen as having close ties to the U.S. and its leaders is also considered a major asset.",
      "Rama has his own connections with Trump allies. In December, Rama\u2019s Cabinet approved entering into negotiations with Atlantic Incubation Partners LLC, owned by Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, for development of a $1.6 billion luxury resort on the small island of Sazan.",
      "The Strategic Investment Committee awarded Kushner's company the status of strategic investor for 10 years.",
      "Throughout the campaign, Berisha has cast himself as a Trump-like figure and the victim of a politically motivated scheme that he blames in part on the U.S. billionaire George Soros, a booster of liberal causes around the world and longtime foil of conservatives.",
      "He launched his campaign with a promise to \u201cMake Albania Great Again,\u201d but later had to change the slogan amid concerns that it could be misinterpreted as a reference to \u201cgreater Albania\u201d and spark confrontation in the western Balkans over fears some in neighboring countries have about Albanian expansionism.",
      "The campaign now vows to make Albania \u201cgrandiose\": \u201cmadheshtore\u201d instead of \u201ce madhe.\"",
      "Like Trump, Berisha also has his own signature campaign hat \u2014 a blue one that features the No. 1, the Democrats' ranking on the ballot.",
      "While recent elections in Canada and Australia have demonstrated the power of backlash against candidates deemed too aligned with Trump, in other countries those ties have been a major boon. In Argentina, Javier Milei swept to power with a \u201cMake Argentina Great Again\u201d slogan and Trumpian flair.",
      "And in El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele has become one of Trump's strongest allies, agreeing to detain U.S. deportees in his country's notorious terrorism megaprison.",
      "Berisha's party presents its hiring of Trump campaign staffers as a major coup. The Americans, they say, have been working on all aspects of the campaign, from strategy to messaging and public communication.",
      "LaCivita \u201cmanaged one of the most spectacular campaigns in the political history, making president a politician who had all against him, media companies, exit poll companies, NGOs, etc, to a certain extent the same situation with the opposition and its leader here in Albania,\" the party said in a written response to questions from The Associated Press.",
      "Albania\u2019s Democratic Party and U.S. Republicans are \u201cnatural allies,\u201d they added, since both are \u201cagainst the woke culture and support family and free market too.\u201d",
      "LaCivita has been featured in Democratic social media posts and appeared at a series of events in the country and abroad, including a rally where he took the stage to the Village People's \u201cYMCA,\u201d Trump's signature walk-off song.",
      "\u201cWho is ready to make Albania great again?\u201d he boomed as he opened his speech \u2014 notwithstanding the concerns about referencing \u201cgreater Albania.\u201d (Other times, he goes with \u201cMake Albania magnificent.\")",
      "Rama, the Socialist Party leader, derisively calls Berisha a \u201cswamp owl\u201d and frequently criticizes the Americans' involvement, with LaCivita even featured in a negative ad.",
      "The Democrats have not disclosed how much LaCivita is paid, but said \u201chis payment was done in line with the law and the election rules, here in Albania and in America\u201d and that the contract would eventually be made public.",
      "LaCivita has stressed he is being paid solely to advise the party and that he is not lobbying officials in the U.S.",
      "Manafort, they said, is part of LaCivita\u2019s team as \u201ca friend and collaborator, and he has been in Tirana at that capacity.\"",
      "Manafort was charged in 2017 by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team with, among other things, concealing from the U.S. government lucrative political lobbying work he\u2019d performed on behalf of a pro-Russia party in Ukraine. He was convicted of multiple financial crimes and sentenced to prison but ultimately pardoned by Trump.",
      "In addition to the campaign help, in late April the Democrats signed a $250,000-a-month lobbying contract with U.S.-based Continental Strategy to help them establish relationships in the executive and legislative branches, and to promote democracy, anti-corruption initiatives and governmental reforms, according to the company\u2019s filing with the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.",
      "The firm is led by Carlos Trujillo, a longtime Trump ally who served as U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States during Trump's first term and whom Albania's Democratic Party has touted as \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s lawyer and as a staunch anti-communist in his stand!\u201d Trujillo is working on the contract with the firm's managing partner, Alberto Martinez, who served as now-Secretary of State Marco Rubio's Senate chief of staff.",
      "The arrangement has raised eyebrows in Albania and triggered an investigation by Albania\u2019s SPAK, the Special Structure Against Corruption and Organized Crime.",
      "The firm is being paid by the \u201cMake Albania Great Again Foundation,\" a newly created nonprofit founded by Nuredin Seci, an Albanian American contractor from New Jersey, with what is supposed to be money collected from the Albanian-American community.",
      "Seci did not respond to questions about the foundation and where the funding had come from sent to his Facebook account. Numbers and an email address associated with Seci appear to have been disconnected.",
      "Melissa Stone, a spokesperson for Continental, said, \u201cOur work is being funded by an American-Albanian businessman and active leader in the Albanian-America diaspora who loves America and loves Albania.\u201d",
      "That includes trying to lift the sanctions on Berisha, who was barred from campaigning in the U.S., where many Albanians ex-pats live.",
      "\u201cAs part of our work to improve bilateral relations between Albania and the United States, we are actively petitioning the Trump Administration to launch a full-scale review and reversal of the Biden-era weaponization of Section 7031(c) against conservative, pro-American leaders, including President Sali Berisha,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "In May 2021, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken sanctioned Berisha for alleged \u201csignificant corruption\u201d and barred him and his wife and children from entering the U.S.",
      "Britain did the same a year later.",
      "Blinken said that during Berisha\u2019s 2005-2013 tenure as prime minister, the politician \u201cwas involved in corrupt acts, such as misappropriation of public funds and interfering with public processes, including using his power for his own benefit and to enrich his political allies and his family members,\" which Berisha denies.",
      "Last year, Berisha was charged with corruption for an alleged scheme in which he helped his son-in-law privatize public land to build apartment buildings in the capital, Tirana. The trial has yet to start.",
      "Berisha told Albanian media in January that he considered Trump\u2019s election \u201ca miracle for humanity\u201d and said that he would ask the new administration to review his designation as a \u201cpersona non grata\" and demand that it be changed.",
      "LaCivita has called Berisha \u201ca true friend of the United States.\" And he has drawn parallels between Trump and Berisha, casting both as having been \u201cunfairly prosecuted and persecuted by a government that has no regard for Democracy.\u201d",
      "LaCivita has acknowledged Berisha's decision to promote his involvement is different from other foreign clients who prefer more discretion.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one place where you know, America meddling in their elections is encouraged, right? Everywhere else, not so much,\u201d LaCivita said in a conversation with journalists posing as potential clients that was published by The Guardian.",

      "Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said the group\u2019s movements were negotiated with the government and further alleged that one of the six people who entered the Argentine ambassador\u2019s residence in March left the compound in August, contradicting earlier statements from the opposition.",
      "Cabello\u2019s statements came roughly 24 hours after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on social media that the opposition members were on U.S. soil after a \u201csuccessful rescue.\u201d",
      "The government of Argentine President Javier Milei allowed the six people into the ambassador\u2019s residence when authorities loyal to Venezuela\u2019s ruling party issued warrants for their arrest, accusing them of promoting acts of violence to destabilize the country. The group included the campaign manager and communications director of opposition leader Maria Corina Machado as well as Fernando Martinez, a cabinet minister in the 1990s.",
      "Martinez abandoned the compound in mid-December and, according to Venezuelan authorities, appeared before prosecutors. He died in February.",
      "After Rubio\u2019s announcement Tuesday, Machado thanked people involved in what she called an \u201cimpeccable and epic operation for the Freedom of five heroes of Venezuela.\u201d But Cabello alleged that only four people remained at the embassy after Martinez\u2019s departure.",
      "Since late November, the group had denounced the constant presence of intelligence service agents and police outside the residence. It had also accused the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of cutting electricity and water services to the compound. The government denied the allegations.",
      "\u201cThey put on their show, and in the end, they ended up negotiating,\u201d Cabello said Wednesday during his weekly show on state television.",
      "Cabello did not offer details of the group's movements to reach the U.S. But he alleged that Machado negotiated with the government to allow her mother to leave the country, which he said she did so Monday via a commercial airplane headed to Colombia's capital, Bogota.",
      "Machado, who was last seen in public in January, did not immediately respond to Cabello's allegations.",
      "Maduro\u2019s government routinely targeted its real or perceived opponents ahead of last year\u2019s presidential election, and its crackdown on dissent only increased after the country\u2019s National Electoral Council, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, declared him the winner despite credible evidence to the contrary.",
      "The election results announced by the Electoral Council sparked protests across the country to which the government responded with force and ended with more than 20 people dead. They also prompted an end to diplomatic relations between Venezuela and various foreign countries, including Argentina.",
      "As Cabello's TV show aired, Machado's campaign manager, Magalli Meda, said on X that her home was being raided and shared timestamped photos showing men dressed in black, some with their faces covered and wearing bullet-proof vests, in a living room.",

      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- An asbestos screening clinic in a small Montana town where thousands have been sickened by toxic dust from a nearby mine has been abruptly shuttered by authorities following a court order to seize the clinic\u2019s assets to pay off a judgment to the railroad BNSF.",
      "The Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Office closed on Wednesday the Center for Asbestos Related Disease in Libby, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the U.S.-Canada border. The town of about 3,000 people is near a mine that produced asbestos dust for decades, and the clinic has been at the forefront of efforts to help victims.",
      "Courts in Montana have said BNSF contributed to the pollution when it brought contaminated material from the mine through town, and the railway separately faces numerous lawsuits from asbestos victims in Libby and surrounding communities.",
      "But the Texas-based railway prevailed in a 2023 lawsuit alleging the clinic fraudulently made some patients eligible for government benefits when it knew they were not sick. The railway challenged the validity of over 2,000 diagnoses by the clinic and 337 were ruled false.",
      "The railway brought the lawsuit on behalf of the federal government, which provides specialized Medicare services to Libby\u2019s asbestos victims. BNSF was entitled to a share of the $6 million judgment against the clinic, and after adding in attorney fees, court costs and interest, the railway says it\u2019s now owed $3.1 million.",
      "\u201cThe judge determined the amount of damages to be repaid, and the process for recovery is set by law,\" BNSF spokesperson Kendall Kirkham Sloan said in a statement.",
      "Clinic Executive Director Tracy McNew said the closure would have a broad impact on public health in the Libby area as fewer people are screened for asbestos-related health problems.",
      "\u201cCARD remains committed to its patients and the Libby community and will fight to reopen as soon as possible,\u201d McNew said in a statement.",
      "The clinic for more than 20 years has provided health screenings, monitoring and treatment of patients with problems caused by asbestos exposure. It declared bankruptcy after the judgment in the fraud case was handed down. It kept operating and didn\u2019t pay the money under a settlement reached in bankruptcy court with the federal government that included BNSF.",
      "CARD bankruptcy attorney James \u201cAndy\u201d Patten said the railway's attempts to collect on the fraud judgment violated the bankruptcy settlement, which was approved by a federal court.",

      "Long-threatened tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump have plunged the country into trade wars abroad \u2014 all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014",
      "Long-threatened tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump have plunged the country into trade wars abroad \u2014 all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty.",
      "Trump is no stranger to tariffs. He launched a trade war during his first term, taking particular aim at China by putting taxes on most of its goods. Beijing responded with its own retaliatory tariffs on a range of U.S. products. Meanwhile, Trump also used the threat of more tariffs to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate a North American trade pact, called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, in 2020.",
      "When President Joe Biden took office, he preserved most of the tariffs Trump previously enacted against China, in addition to imposing some new restrictions. But his administration claimed to take a more targeted approach.",
      "Fast-forward to today, and economists stress there could be greater consequences on businesses and economies worldwide under Trump's more sweeping tariffs this time around \u2014 and that higher prices will likely leave consumers footing the bill. There's also been a sense of whiplash from Trump's back-and-forth tariff threats and responding retaliation seen over the last few months.",
      "Here's a timeline of how we got here:",
      "Trump is sworn into office. In his inaugural address, he again promises to \u201ctariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.\" And he reiterates plans to create an agency called the External Revenue Service, which has yet to be established.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump also says he expects to put 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico starting on Feb. 1, while declining to immediately flesh out plans for taxing Chinese imports.",
      "Trump threatens 25% tariffs on all Colombia imports and other retaliatory measures after President Gustavo Petro\u2019s rejects two U.S. military aircraft carrying migrants to the country, accusing Trump of not treating immigrants with dignity during deportation.",
      "In response, Petro also announces a retaliatory 25% increase in Colombian tariffs on U.S. goods. But Colombia later reversed its decision and accepted the flights carrying migrants. The two countries soon signaled a halt in the trade dispute.",
      "Trump signs an executive order to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 4. Trump invoked this power by declaring a national emergency \u2014 ostensibly over undocumented immigration and drug trafficking.",
      "The action prompts swift outrage from all three countries, with promises of retaliatory measures.",
      "Trump agrees to a 30-day pause on his tariff threats against Mexico and Canada, as both trading partners take steps to appease Trump's concerns about border security and drug trafficking.",
      "Trump's new 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports to the U.S. still go into effect. China retaliates the same day by announcing a flurry of countermeasures, including new duties on a variety of American goods and an anti-monopoly investigation into Google.",
      "China's 15% tariffs on coal and liquefied natural gas products, and a 10% levy on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S., take effect Feb. 10.",
      "Trump announces plans to hike steel and aluminum tariffs starting March 12. He removes the exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on steel, meaning that all steel imports will be taxed at a minimum of 25%, and also raises his 2018 aluminum tariffs from 10% to 25%.",
      "Trump announces a plan for \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs \u2014 promising to increase U.S. tariffs to match the tax rates that countries worldwide charge on imports \u201cfor purposes of fairness.\u201d Economists warn that the reciprocal tariffs, set to overturn decades of trade policy, could create chaos for global businesses.",
      "Trump signs an executive order instructing the Commerce Department to consider whether a tariff on imported copper is needed to protect national security. He cites the material's use in U.S. defense, infrastructure and emerging technologies.",
      "Trump signs an additional executive order instructing the Commerce Department to consider whether tariffs on lumber and timber are also needed to protect national security, arguing that the construction industry and military depend on a strong supply of wooden products in the U.S.",
      "Trump\u2019s 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico go into effect, though he limits the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. He also doubles the tariff on all Chinese imports to 20%.",
      "All three countries promise retaliatory measures. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days. And Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says her country would respond with its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods without specifying the targeted products immediately, signaling hopes to de-escalate.",
      "China, meanwhile, imposes tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of key U.S. farm exports, set to take effect March 10. It also expands the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen.",
      "Trump grants a one-month exemption on his new tariffs impacting goods from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers. The pause arrives after the president spoke with leaders of the \u201cBig 3\u201d automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.",
      "In a wider extension, Trump postpones 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada for a month.",
      "Trump credited Sheinbaum with making progress on border security and drug smuggling as a reason for again pausing tariffs. His actions also thaw relations with Canada somewhat, although outrage and uncertainty remains. Still, after its initial retaliatory tariffs of $30 billion Canadian (US$21 billion) on U.S. goods, the government says it's suspended a second wave of retaliatory tariffs worth $125 billion Canadian (US$87 billion).",
      "China's retaliatory 15% tariffs on key American farm products \u2014 including chicken, pork, soybeans and beef \u2014 take effect. Goods already in transit are set to be exempt through April 12, per China\u2019s Commerce Ministry previous announcement.",
      "Trump's new tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports go into effect. Both metals are now taxed at 25% across the board \u2014 with Trump\u2019s order to remove steel exemptions and raise aluminum\u2019s levy from his previously-imposed 2018 import taxes.",
      "The European Union takes retaliatory trade action promising new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products. The measures will cover goods from the United States worth some 26 billion euros ($28 billion), and not just steel and aluminum products, but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. Motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans will be hit, as they were during Trump\u2019s first term. The 27-member bloc later says it will delay this retaliatory action until mid-April.",
      "Canada, meanwhile, announces plans to impose more retaliatory tariffs worth Canadian $29.8 billion ($20.7 billion) on U.S. imports, set to go into effect March 13.",
      "Trump threatens a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne and spirits if the European Union goes forward with its previously-announced plans for a 50% tariff on American whiskey.",
      "Trump says he will place a 25% tariff on all imports from any country that buys oil or gas from Venezuela, in addition to imposing new tariffs on the South American country itself, starting April 2.",
      "The tariffs would most likely add to the taxes facing China, which in 2023 bought 68% of the oil exported by Venezuela, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But a number of countries also receive oil from Venezuela \u2014 including the United States itself.",
      "Trump says he is placing 25% tariffs on auto imports. These auto imports will start being collected April 3 \u2014 beginning with taxes on fully-imported cars. The tariffs are set to then expand to applicable auto parts in the following weeks, through May 3.",
      "Trump announces his long-promised \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs \u2014 declaring a 10% baseline tax on imports across the board starting April 5, as well as higher rates for dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the U.S. to take effect April 9.",
      "Among those steeper levies, Trump says the U.S. will now charge a 34% tax on imports from China, a 20% tax on imports from the European Union, 25% on South Korea, 24% on Japan and 32% on Taiwan. The new tariffs come on top of previously-imposed levies, including the 20% tax Trump announced on all Chinese imports earlier this year.",
      "Meanwhile, for Canada and Mexico, the White House says USMCA-compliant imports can continue to enter the U.S. duty-free. Once the two countries have satisfied Trump\u2019s demands on immigration and drug trafficking, the White House adds, the tariff on the rest of their imports may drop from 25% to 12%.",
      "Trump's previously-announced auto tariffs begin. Prime Minister Mark Carney says that Canada will match the 25% levies with a tariff on vehicles imported from the U.S.",
      "China announces plans to impose a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10, matching Trump's new \"reciprocal\u201d tariff on Chinese goods, as part of a flurry of retaliatory measures.",
      "The Commerce Ministry in Beijing says it will also impose more export controls on rare earths, which are materials used in high-tech products like computer chips and electric vehicle batteries. And the government adds 27 firms to lists of companies subject to trade sanctions or export controls.",
      "Trump's 10% minimum tariff on nearly all countries and territories takes effect.",
      "Trump's higher \u201creciprocal\u201d rates go into effect, hiking taxes on imports from dozens of countries just after midnight. But hours later, his administration says it will suspend most of these higher rates for 90 days, while maintaining the recently-imposed 10% levy on nearly all global imports.",
      "China is the exception. After following through on a threat to raise levies against China to a total of 104%, Trump says he will now raise those import taxes to 125% \u201ceffective immediately\u201d \u2014 escalating tit-for-tat duties that have piled up between the two countries. The White House later clarifies that total tariffs against China are actually now 145%, once his previous 20% fentanyl tariffs are accounted for.",
      "China upped its retaliation prior to this announcement \u2014 vowing to tax American goods at 84% starting April 10. Also earlier, EU member states vote to approve their own retaliatory levies on 20.9 billion euros ($23 billion) of U.S. goods in response to Trump\u2019s previously-imposed steel and aluminum tariffs. The EU\u2019s executive commission doesn\u2019t immediately specify which imports it will tax, but notes its counter tariffs will come in stages \u2014 with some set to arrive on April 15, and others May 15 and Dec. 1.",
      "Separately, Canada's counter tariffs on auto imports take effect. The country implements a 25% levy on auto imports from the U.S. that do not comply with the 2020 USMCA pact.",
      "The EU puts its steel and aluminum tariff retaliation on hold for 90 days, to match Trump's pause on steeper \u201creciprocal\u201d levies. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says the commission wants to give negotiations with the U.S. a chance \u2014 but warns countermeasures will kick in if talks \u201care not satisfactory.\u201d",
      "China says it will raise tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125%, in response to Trump's heightened levies. The new rate is set to begin April 12.",
      "Later, the Trump administration unveils that electronics, including smartphones and laptops, will be exempt from so-called \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs. But in the days following, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick signals that this is only a temporary reprieve, saying that sector-specific levies on semiconductors will arrive in \u201cprobably a month or two.\u201d And other, non-\"reciprocal\" tariffs that tax some electronics, notably from China, remain.",
      "Trump says he might temporarily exempt the auto industry from tariffs he previously imposed on the sector, to give carmakers time to adjust their supply chains.",
      "The Trump administration also launches investigations into imports of computer chips, chipmaking equipment and pharmaceuticals \u2014 signaling next steps toward imposing tariffs on these sectors. The U.S. Commerce Department posts notices about these probes, seeking public comment within the next three weeks.",
      "Separately, the Commerce Department says it's withdrawing from a 2019 agreement that had suspended an antidumping investigation into fresh tomato imports from Mexico. That termination, set to take effect July 14, means most tomatoes from Mexico will be subject to a 20.91% tariff.",
      "Trump signs executive orders to relax some of his 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts \u2014 aimed at easing import taxes for vehicles that are made with foreign parts, but assembled in the U.S.",
      "For one year, the administration says it will provide a rebate of 3.75% relative to the sales prices of a domestically-assembled car \u2014 a figure reached by putting the previously-imposed 25% import tax on parts that make up 15% of that price. And for the second year, the rebate would equal 2.5% of the sales price, applying to a smaller share of the vehicle\u2019s parts.",
      "The latest round of Trump's auto tariffs takes effect. The previously-announced 25% levies now apply to a range of imported auto parts.",
      "Trump threatens a 100% tariff on foreign-made films, while claiming that the movie industry in the U.S. is dying. It isn't immediately clear how such a tariff on international productions could be implemented, but Trump says he's authorized the Commerce Department and the U.S. Trade Representative to \u201cimmediately begin the process.\u201d",
      "The U.S. trade deficit soared to a record $140.5 billion in March as consumers and businesses tried to get ahead of Trump\u2019stariffs. Federal data showed an enormous stockpiling of pharmaceutical products. The deficit \u2014 which measures the gap between the value of goods and services the U.S. sells abroad against what it buys \u2014 has roughly doubled during the past year.",
      "Also, the U.S. government announced that top officials are set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation over the weekend in Switzerland in the first major talks between the two nations since President Trump sparked a trade war. No country has been hit harder by Trump\u2019s trade war than China, the world\u2019s biggest exporter and second largest economy. U.S. tariffs against China are set at 145% and China tariffs on the U.S. at 125%.",
      "The Federal Reserve left its key interest rate unchanged at 4.3%, saying that the risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen due to uncertainty about how and when Trump\u2019s tariffs might impact the U.S. economy. Chair Jerome Powell underscored that the tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment and that there\u2019s currently too many unknowns to be able to predict how the Fed might adjust its monetary policy going forward.",
      "The United States and Britain announced a trade deal, potentially lowering the financial burden from tariffs while creating greater access abroad for American goods. The president said the agreement would lead to more beef and ethanol exports to the U.K., which would also streamline the processing of U.S. goods though customs. Trump said final details were being written up. \u201cIn the coming weeks, we\u2019ll have it all very conclusive,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Britain said the deal will cut tariffs on U.K. cars from 27.5% to 10%, with a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles that can be imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff. It also eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum.",
      "Separately, the European Union published a list of U.S. imports that it would target with retaliatory duties if no solution is found to end U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war. The EU\u2019s executive branch, the European Commission, also said it would begin legal action at the World Trade Organization over the \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d that Trump imposed on countries around the world a month ago.",

      "The rate stood at 6.76% for the second week in a row, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 7.09%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, eased. The average rate dropped to 5.89% from 5.92% last week. It\u2019s down from 6.38% a year ago, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including global demand for U.S. Treasurys, the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions and bond market investors\u2019 expectations about the economy and inflation.",
      "After climbing to a just above 7% in mid-January, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained above 6.62%, where it was just four weeks ago. It then spiked above 6.8% in the following two weeks and eased last week to 6.76%.",
      "The recent swings in mortgage rates reflect volatility in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The yield, which had mostly fallen after climbing to around 4.8% in mid-January, surged last month to 4.5% amid a sell-off in government bonds triggered by investor anxiety over the Trump administration\u2019s trade war.",
      "The 10-year Treasury yield was at 4.33% in midday trading Thursday, up from 4.26% late Wednesday.",
      "Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices remain affordability hurdles for many would-be homebuyers. It\u2019s why the spring homebuying season is off to a lackluster start. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in March, posting the largest monthly drop since November 2022.",

      "The construction of a road is drawing attention in the run-up to the annual U.N. climate conference in Brazil",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- In the run-up to the annual U.N. climate conference, set to take place in Brazil\u2019s Amazon in November, the construction of a road is drawing attention, with critics arguing it will lead to environmental degradation.",
      "Before the talks, called COP30, the state government of Para is building a 13-kilometer (8-mile) avenue designed to ease traffic on a major highway that runs parallel.",
      "The road was planned long before Belem, a metropolitan area of 2.5 million people that sits on the edge of the Amazon, was chosen as conference host. That hasn't spared it sharp criticism, however, because the road is expected to cut across the last remnants of rainforest in Belem.",
      "Road building in the Amazon, which historically has often led to deforestation and development of surrounding areas, also stands in stark contrast to a central aim of climate conferences, and in particular this one: conservation of biodiversity.",
      "Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who has made the slowing of deforestation a central focus of his administration, has frequently boasted that this will be the first such conference in the Amazon rainforest.",
      "The Amazon is key to regulating the climate, because trees absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that heats the planet when released into the atmosphere.",
      "\u201cWe will hold the best COP in history because the topic of all the ones held in other countries was the Amazon,\" Lula said while visiting Belem worksites in February. \u201cThis one will be in the Amazon.\u201d",
      "An official project map shows a straight line dividing a green area through the city\u2019s outskirts. This protected area is slightly larger than Manhattan. It was designated in 1993 to protect two lakes, a river basin and to restore a degraded rainforest. However, its rules allow private properties, government-approved deforestation and public works. Two university campuses are located within its limits.",
      "\u201cEven with measures to reduce the damage, there are tough issues to address,\u201d said Roberta Rodrigues, a professor of architecture at the Federal University of Para. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a road being built along the banks of the Guama River without it leading to illegal development. It may lead to the end of this protected area.\"",
      "The project dates back to 2020. Construction began in mid-2024, despite criticism over its impact on one of the city\u2019s few remaining green areas. The project drew wider attention in March, when the BBC reported that the avenue was \"being built for COP30.\u201d As the story was picked up by news outlets around the world, Brazil\u2019s government issued a statement saying the avenue wasn't among the 33 infrastructure projects planned for COP30.",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, the state government of Para said that the avenue, named Liberdade, or Freedom, will be an expressway and development around it won't be permitted.",
      "The chaotic growth of Brazilian cities, however, suggests it's a promise that will be hard to keep. Countless public areas have been occupied for the irregular construction of housing \u2014 from modest structures to luxury condos \u2014 with the expectation that they will eventually be legalized, which often ends up happening.",
      "Belem is the capital of Para, which is run by Gov. Helder Barbalho, a politician from a traditional family who is an ally of Lula. Both support oil drilling in the nearby mouth of the Amazon River, likely a point of contention during COP30.",
      "The road is scheduled to be inaugurated just before the conference kicking off on Nov. 10.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week despite heightened uncertainty about how President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs will impact the U.S. and global economies.",
      "Jobless claim applications fell by 13,000 to 228,000 for the week ending May 3, the Labor Department said Thursday. That\u2019s in line with the 229,000 new applications analysts forecast.",
      "Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs, and have mostly bounced around a healthy range between 200,000 and 250,000 since COVID-19 decimated the economy and wiped out millions of jobs.",
      "Even though Trump has paused or pulled back on many of his tariff threats, concerns remain about a global economic slowdown that could upend the U.S. labor market, which has been a pillar of the American economy for years.",
      "On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve held its benchmark lending rate at 4.3% for the third straight meeting, after cutting it three times in a row at the end of last year.",
      "Fed chair Jerome Powell said the risks of both higher unemployment and inflation have risen, an unusual combination that complicates the central bank\u2019s dual mandate of controlling prices and keeping unemployment low.",
      "Powell said that tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment but that data has not yet shown significant harm to the economy.",
      "A contraction has already begun in the U.S., where the economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace from January through March as Trump\u2019s trade wars disrupted business. First-quarter growth was slowed by a surge in imports as companies in the United States tried to bring in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s massive tariffs went into effect.",
      "It was the first quarterly GDP decline in three years.",
      "Like his pledge to institute tariffs, Trump\u2019s promise to drastically downsize the federal government workforce has occupied much of the early weeks of his presidency and is still in motion.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when the job cuts ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 or \u201cDOGE,\u201d spearheaded by Elon Musk \u2014 will surface in the weekly layoffs data. However, the federal government staff reductions are already being felt, even outside of the Washington, D.C. area.",
      "Despite showing some signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains robust with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs.",
      "Last week the government reported that U.S. employers added a surprisingly strong 177,000 jobs in April. The unemployment rate held at a historically healthy 4.2%, however, many economists anticipate that a negative impact from trade wars will materialize this year for American workers.",
      "Companies that have announced job cuts this year include Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines and Facebook parent company Meta.",
      "The Labor Department reported that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week gyrations, inched up by 1,000 to 227,000.",
      "The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of April 26 fell to 1.88 million, a decrease of 29,000.",

      "She petitioned heads of state and convened other billionaires. Along with Gates, she won the trust of one of America's most admired investors, Warren Buffett, who has given more than $43 billion to the former couple's foundation.",
      "French Gates, who studied computer science and worked at Microsoft, the company Gates created, exited the Gates Foundation last year to pursue philanthropy and investment through her own organization, Pivotal Ventures, which she started in 2015. The foundation changed its name from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation after her departure.",
      "At an ELLE Women of Impact event in New York in April, which also launched her new memoir, French Gates said she left, in part, to respond to the U.S. rollback of women\u2019s rights.",
      "\u201cI thought, I want to be much more nimble than this, and I want to be able to set the agenda by myself without having to ask anybody else, and do it with my partners,\u201d she said.",
      "French Gates offered written responses to The Associated Press' questions about the foundation\u2019s 25th anniversary and its decision to close in 2045. She said the former couple had always intended to spend down their resources.",
      "\u201cUltimately, though,\" she wrote, \u201cthe timeline was Bill\u2019s decision to make with the board of trustees.\u201d",
      "The following responses have been edited for length.",
      "A: To me, the greatest measure of success would be if long after the foundation closed, someone, somewhere, was living a life that looked different because we existed. We talked a lot there about unlocking virtuous cycles. I like to think that right now, the foundation\u2019s work is contributing to a child getting a vaccine or a woman opening her first bank account \u2014 and that decades from now, their families and communities are going to continue to look different, because of what that child and that woman unlocked for the people around them.",
      "A: I was excited for us to launch the Giving Pledge because I believe that the most responsible thing to do with great wealth is give it away \u2014 and that you have an obligation to society to give it away as effectively as possible. I think it\u2019s important for people in that position to set norms around giving generously and to learn as much as possible from each other about how to be effective in their philanthropy.",
      "(As for gender), for too long, global health and development efforts treated women and girls as secondary \u2014 if they were considered at all. Data wasn\u2019t collected on their experiences. Their specific health needs were often ignored.",
      "There were so many questions that needed to be asked: What is the cost of all the unpaid labor women do at home? Will mobile banking make a difference if women don\u2019t have equal access to cellphones? Why are so many infectious diseases especially dangerous for women?",
      "We opened a gender equality division, but not just that \u2014 we made gender equality a priority across all of our work. And we put a lot of resources into expanding access to contraception, starting with a big commitment we made in 2012.",
      "A: When you\u2019re doing this kind of work, it doesn\u2019t take long to see that solutions that seem great on paper may not work in reality. We funded community toilets in India that people \u2014 especially women \u2014wouldn\u2019t use because they were dangerous to go to at night. We funded vaccines in Vietnam that had to be kept cold, but came in packaging that didn\u2019t fit into the small refrigerators most people had there. We funded a simple pump to help East African farmers irrigate their land, but women \u2014 who account for half of all smallholder farmers \u2014 wouldn\u2019t buy it, because they didn\u2019t want to be seen swaying their hips in the way the pump required.",
      "There are many ways to learn about the cultural norms and logistical issues that determine whether a solution is feasible \u2014 and they all boil down to engaging people with local knowledge and lived experience, and trusting what they tell you.",
      "A: It\u2019s easy for people to forget \u2014 or maybe they didn\u2019t ever know \u2014 how hopeless the situation seemed around the year 2000, when malaria, tuberculosis and HIV were totally out of control. Since then, efforts funded, in large part, by development aid have saved more than 65 million lives from those diseases alone.",
      "No doubt the work has just gotten a lot harder, but we never thought it was going to be easy. And we still have the key ingredients of success. The pipeline of innovations has never been stronger. More lower-income countries are taking a leading role. As some donors announce cuts, others are stepping up.",

      "INDIAN WELLS, Ca. -- Bill Gates is pledging 99% of his remaining fortune to the Gates Foundation, which will spend it all within 20 years. The funds will be delivered over time and will allow the foundation to spend another $200 billion by the time it closes in 2045.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s still a little bit more that goes to the kids and some portion that, you know, I won\u2019t be wanting for anything for my consumption,\u201d Gates said. Even his climate-related investments, \u201call of the profits that come from that work go into the Gates Foundation.\u201d",
      "In interviews with The Associated Press, Gates spoke about the foundation\u2019s past work and future goals. His responses have been edited for length.",
      "\u201cI hope other people wallop me. Even today, there\u2019s probably a dozen people richer than I am, because I don\u2019t count the money that I\u2019ve already got in the foundation. I have just a bit over $100 billion outside of the foundation. I\u2019d love to be beat in all of this work. Somebody should try and pay more taxes than I did, and save more lives than I did, and give more money than I did, and be smarter than I\u2019ve been.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think 20 years is the right balance between giving as much as we can to make progress on these things and giving people a lot of notice that now this money will be gone. It will be spent. Hopefully, many of these diseases are eradicated, so nobody even knows, \u2018What was malaria? What was polio?\u2019 in the years ahead. You know, some foundations, if they\u2019ve been around 50 or 60 years, who knows how their work relates to the intent of the person who started that foundation? And I do think there\u2019ll be more rich people in the future than there are today. So yes, it will create a vacuum in 20 years, and we\u2019re letting people know way in advance that\u2019s what this will look like.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s by some measures the most generous gift ever given and a real vote of confidence from Warren, who\u2019s a great friend and has always given me phenomenal advice and is very driven by these inequity issues. And that was in 2006, and so it\u2019s two years later that I give up my full-time work at Microsoft, and I move over. And I\u2019ve been full time at the foundation since 2008 for the rest of my life. It\u2019s my final, second career. You know, Warren, it\u2019s hard to overstate the impact he\u2019s had on me.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat was a big hope, that the societal expectation for anybody who has a lot of money would be that they give the majority of it away, and that basically everyone would join into that. Now, we\u2019re not at that level, but I think year by year, people are saying, \u2018Hey, the fairness of this system, the legitimacy of this system really benefits if those who both through skill and luck, the system has rewarded them, that they put a lot of their resources and even, some of their time and energy into improving society.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cMany things now are making it less clear how much progress we\u2019ll make in these 20 years we have remaining. The donors are being somewhat less generous as they feel squeezed by an aging population and demands for Ukraine, both refugee costs, defense costs, a lot of things. And so telling the story of the success and the moral and geopolitical value of taking 1% of rich country budgets and saying, \u2018No, this is to save lives for very, very, very little money.\u2019 We\u2019re going to have to renew people\u2019s understanding and prioritization of these things in order to keep that piece. We have a lot of things we\u2019re optimistic about because we have new tools, new ways of protecting women from getting HIV, new ways of killing mosquitoes... And so it\u2019s incredible to come up with these low-cost things and tragic if we can\u2019t get them out to everyone who needs them. So, it\u2019s going to require renewing that commitment of those who are well off to help those who are in the greatest need.\u201d",
      "\u201cMelinda has made a phenomenal contribution to the foundation, helping us pick the right people and being in partnerships, traveling the world, bringing her perspective to things. I can\u2019t say enough good things about how she got us off on the right track. When we divorced, we hoped \u2014 I hoped \u2014 that she would choose to stay. She stayed for a period of time, continued to do great work, and then chose to do the philanthropy on her own.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur work is for saving children\u2019s lives. So it\u2019s true, if they have other priorities, it\u2019s hard to influence my commitment to not having mothers bleed to death or kids not dying from malaria. To be honest, the number of civil society actors that are in here trying to influence the work we do is so tiny. It\u2019s unbelievable. I mean, I could almost list their names on one piece of paper. Where are these people? We want more people second-guessing our work, criticizing our work. I mean, what\u2019s their idea about malnutrition? What\u2019s their idea on how to deal with these funding cuts? What do they want us to do?\u201d",

      "In its first 25 years, the Gates Foundation became one of the world\u2019s largest charitable foundations and one of the most powerful institutions in global health",
      "SEATTLE -- In its first 25 years, the Gates Foundation became one of the world\u2019s largest charitable foundations and one of the most powerful institutions in global health \u2014 an accomplishment that carried both accolades and controversy.",
      "Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates had grand ambitions for their foundation, but little experience in global health or philanthropy. They were moved by stories like those written by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof about children dying from diseases caused by a lack of sanitation. In characteristic Gates style, they tackled these problems with rigor, data and close oversight.",
      "As a result, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 formed in 2000 by the merger of two family foundations and funded by Gates\u2019 Microsoft wealth and later, by tens of billions from investor Warren Buffett \u2014 inserted itself into the architecture of global health.",
      "Along the way, the foundation\u2019s leaders redefined what it means to be philanthropists.",
      "\u201cAs I was learning about what children die of, you know, HIV and diarrhea and pneumonia, were all things that I was stunned how little was going into helping the poor countries,\u201d Gates said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "He responded in a way few others could, by pouring billions into the foundation, which spent $100 billion in its first 25 years, with about half going toward global health.",
      "Thanks to its largesse, as well as the expertise of its employees, its connections to governments and companies, and the profile of its founders, the Gates Foundation now garners at least the same influence, if not more, in almost any global health forum as many countries.",
      "That era now has an end date. Gates announced Thursday that the foundation will close in 2045, pledging that he plans to donate 99% of his remaining fortune, which would be $107 billion today, to the nonprofit by then. Gates said the foundation can maintain its culture and workforce over that time.",
      "\"We\u2019ll be showing that we\u2019re doing the most we can and give a lot of predictability to the field by (saying,) \u2018We\u2019ll be here all of those 20 years, but not thereafter,\u2019\" he said.",
      "The foundation's influence over global health policy and its partnerships with companies and other private sector actors have long drawn questions.",
      "Researcher Linsey McGoey, a professor of sociology at the University of Essex, who wrote the book \u201cNo Such Thing as a Free Gift \u201d about the foundation, asks how charitable it is to \u201cgive away\u201d money to a foundation the donor controls.",
      "Others like Anuj Kapilashrami, global health professor at the University of Essex, argue the foundation's preference for low-cost treatments and interventions does not inherently help build the capacity of health systems.",
      "\u201cWe do not tackle the causes, the underlying drivers of what is producing ill-health, but we choose areas and health issues where we can just push these magic bullets: commodities, drugs (and) bed nets,\u201d she said.",
      "Mark Suzman, who has been with the foundation for 18 years and CEO since 2020, said close supervision of grantees and the foundation\u2019s data-driven processes are key to its success.",
      "\u201cWe are not a 'write the check, call us in three years and let us know what it looks like,\u2019\u201d kind of funder, Suzman said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be calling you up probably every week, and we\u2019ll have some opinions. But we want your opinions back.\u201d",
      "The foundation is proud of the many vaccines, medical devices and treatment protocols it has helped develop. It is optimistic about a pipeline of innovations, including potential vaccines for malaria and HIV, as possible accomplishments in its remaining 20 years.",
      "David McCoy, a physician who was then at the University College London, argued back in 2009 that only a small portion of the foundation\u2019s spending went directly to organizations located in the countries where they work, with most going to international organizations like the World Health Organization or to groups located in the U.S. and Europe.",
      "Suzman said he has been an internal champion of shifting more of the foundation's work from Seattle to in-country offices.",
      "The foundation\u2019s flagship issue, and the main way it measures its success, is in reducing preventable childhood deaths.",
      "The Gates Foundation helped establish two major public-private partnerships: Gavi, the vaccine alliance that funds and distributes vaccines for children, and the Global Fund, which, along with governments, funds the treatment and control of HIV, tuberculosis and malaria.",
      "The foundation says the two organizations have saved tens of millions of lives and are some of the most important examples of its impact.",
      "However, Amy Patterson, politics professor at The University of the South, Sewanee, says public-private partnerships like Gavi and the Global Fund diminish the power of civil society groups and citizens compared to public health systems.",
      "\u201cIt certainly has moved us from thinking about health as a state responsibility, which raises questions about accountability and participation,\u201d said Patterson, who has researched the management of AIDS in African countries, including the role of civic groups.",
      "\u201cThat is not to discount the millions of lives saved, or children immunized, or women who have access to reproductive health, or the innovations that have brought efficiency,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cBut if you think about the social contract between states taking care of their people, how do we have that same kind of accountability in this type of a system?\u201d",
      "A huge moment in the early history of the foundation came in 2006 when Buffett pledged to donate a percentage of his Berkshire Hathaway shares annually, almost doubling the foundation\u2019s resources.",
      "Buffett teamed with Gates and French Gates again in 2010 to launch a new commitment for billionaires: to give away more than half their money in their lifetimes or at the time of their death.",
      "The Giving Pledge now has more than 240 people agreeing to those terms, far exceeding Gates\u2019 expectations. However, certainly not every billionaire has.",
      "Gates hopes others will surpass his giving.",
      "\u201cI'd love to be beat in all of this work,\" he said. \"Somebody should try and pay more taxes than I did, and save more lives than I did, and give more money than I did, and be smarter than I\u2019ve been.\u201d",
      "He acknowledged that cuts to foreign aid and health funding under President Donald Trump's current administration, wars, and economic turmoil significantly challenge the foundation's hopes of eradicating polio, controlling malaria, and reducing the number of child and maternal deaths in the next 20 years.",
      "\u201cThe metric that we should be measured against is the success of the whole global health field. Did we draw people in? Did we keep governments engaged, and therefore, do we get childhood death rates down from the 5 million to cut it in half again?\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t promise you we will, because without the partners, that\u2019s not doable. And the current trend line is not positive for that.\u201d",

      "SEATTLE -- SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Bill Gates says he will donate 99% of his remaining tech fortune to the Gates Foundation, which will now close in 2045, earlier than previously planned. Today, that would be worth an estimated $107 billion.",
      "The pledge is among the largest philanthropic gifts ever \u2013 outpacing the historic contributions of industrialists like John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie when adjusted for inflation. Only Berkshire Hathaway investor Warren Buffett's pledge to donate his fortune \u2014 currently estimated by Forbes at $160 billion \u2014 may be larger depending on stock market fluctuations.",
      "Gates' donation will be delivered over time and allow the foundation to spend an additional $200 billion over the next 20 years. The foundation already has an endowment of $77 billion built from donations from Gates, Melinda French Gates and Buffett.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of thrilling to have that much to be able to put into these causes,\u201d Gates said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "His announcement Thursday signals both a promise of sustained support to those causes, particularly global health and education in the U.S., and an eventual end to the foundation\u2019s immense worldwide influence. Gates says spending down his fortune will help save and improve many lives now, which will have positive ripple effects well beyond the foundation's closure. It also makes it more likely that his intentions are honored.",
      "\u201cI think 20 years is the right balance between giving as much as we can to make progress on these things and giving people a lot of notice that now this money will be gone,\u201d Gates said.",
      "In a league of its own",
      "The pledge is \u201ca welcome bit of boldness,\u201d at a time when optimism is in short supply said, Rhodri Davies, a philanthropy expert and author of the publication, \u201cPublic Good by Private Means.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis announcement seems like yet more evidence that norms in foundation philanthropy might be shifting\u201d away from a default of operating in perpetuity, he said.",
      "The Gates Foundation has long been peerless among foundations \u2014 attracting supporters and detractors but also numerous unfounded conspiracy theories.",
      "In addition to the $100 billion it has spent since its founding 25 years ago, it has directed scientific research, helped develop new technologies, and nurtured long-term partnerships with countries and companies.",
      "About 41% of the foundation\u2019s money so far has come from Warren Buffett and the rest from the fortune Gates made at Microsoft.",
      "Started by Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates in 2000, the foundation plays a significant role in shaping global health policy and has carved out a special niche by partnering with companies to drive down the cost of medical treatments so low- and middle-income countries could afford them.",
      "\u201cThe foundation work has been way more impactful than I expected,\u201d Gates said, calling it his second and final career.",
      "The foundation\u2019s influence on global health \u2014 from the World Health Organization to research agendas \u2014 is both a measure of its success and a magnet for criticism. For years, researchers have asked why a wealthy family should have so much sway over how the world improves people\u2019s health and responds to crises.",
      "Gates said, like any private citizen, he can choose how to spend the money he earns and has decided to do everything he can to reduce childhood deaths.",
      "\u201cIs that a bad thing? It\u2019s not an important cause? People can criticize it,\u201d he said, but the foundation will stick to its global health work.",
      "The Associated Press receives financial support for news coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation and for news coverage of women in the workforce and statehouses from Melinda French Gates\u2019 organization, Pivotal Ventures.",
      "Major ambitions for the remaining 20 years",
      "The foundation\u2019s most prized metric is the drop in childhood deaths from preventable causes by almost half between 2000 and 2020, according to United Nations figures. The foundation\u2019s CEO Mark Suzman is careful to say they do not take credit for this accomplishment. But he believes they had a \u201ccatalytic role\u201d \u2014 for example, in helping deliver vaccines to children through Gavi, the vaccine alliance they helped create.",
      "The foundation still has numerous goals \u2014 eradicating polio, controlling other deadly diseases, like malaria, and reducing malnutrition, which makes children more vulnerable to other illnesses.",
      "Gates hopes that by spending to address these issues now, wealthy donors will be free to tackle other problems later.",
      "The Gates Foundation had planned to wind down two decades after Gates' death, meaning today\u2019s announcement significantly moves up that timetable. Gates plans to stay engaged, though at 69, he acknowledged he may not have a say.",
      "In its remaining two decades, the foundation will maintain a budget of around $9 billion a year, which represents a leveling off from its almost annual growth since 2006, when Buffett first started donating.",
      "Suzman expects the foundation will narrow its focus to top priorities.",
      "\u201cHaving that time horizon and the resources just puts an even greater burden on us to say, \u2018Are you actually putting your resources, your thumb down, on what are going to be the biggest, most successful bets rather than scattering it too thinly?\u2019\" Suzman said, which he acknowledged was creating uncertainty even within the foundation about what programs would continue.",
      "Gates is the only remaining founder",
      "Major changes preceded the foundation's 25th year.",
      "In 2021, Melinda French Gates and Bill Gates divorced, and Buffett resigned as the foundation\u2019s trustee. They recruited a new board of trustees to help govern the foundation, and in 2024, French Gates left to continue work at her own organization.",
      "French Gates said she decided to step down partly to focus on countering the rollback of women\u2019s rights in the U.S. At the ELLE Women of Impact event in New York in April, she said she wanted to leave the foundation at a high point.",
      "\u201cI so trusted Mark Suzman, the current CEO,\" she said. \u201cWe had a board in place that I helped put in place, and I knew their values.\u201d",
      "Even as the foundation\u2019s governance stabilizes, the road ahead looks difficult. Enduring conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, global economic turmoil and cuts to foreign aid forecast fewer resources coming to global health and development.",
      "\u201cThe greatest uncertainty for us is the generosity that will go into global health,\u201d Gates said. \u201cWill it continue to go down like it has the last few years or can we get it back to where it should be?\u201d",
      "Even facing these obstacles, Gates and the foundation speak, as they often do, with optimism, pointing to innovations they\u2019ve funded or ways they\u2019ve helped reduce the cost of care.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible to come up with these low-cost things and tragic if we can\u2019t get them out to everyone who needs them,\u201d Gates said. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to require renewing that commitment of those who are well off to help those who are in the greatest need.\u201d",

      "As Republican leaders draft President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill of $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and $1.5 trillion in spending cuts, dozens of more moderate Republicans from contested congressional districts have positioned themselves at the center of the ...",
      "WASHINGTON -- When it comes to Medicaid, Rep. Juan Ciscomani is telling fellow Republicans he won't support steep cuts that could hit thousands of residents in his Arizona district \u2014 \u201cmy neighbors, people my kids go to school with\u201d \u2014 who depend on it.",
      "Republican Rep. Don Bacon, who represents the liberal-leaning \u201cblue dot\u201d of Omaha, Nebraska, is trying to protect several Biden-era green energy tax breaks. He's warning colleagues that \u201cyou can\u2019t pull the rug out from under\u201d businesses that have already sunk millions of dollars into renewable developments in Nebraska and beyond.",
      "And for Republican Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, it\u2019s simple: \u201cNo Salt. No Deal. For Real.\u201d He wants to revive \u2014 and bump up \u2014 what\u2019s known as the SALT deduction, which allows taxpayers to write off a portion of their state and local taxes. Capping the deduction at $10,000 hurt many of his Long Island constituents.",
      "\u201cGoverning is a negotiation, right?\u201d said Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York, another Republican who is also involved in the talks. \u201cI think everybody is going to have to give a little.\u201d",
      "As GOP leaders draft President Donald Trump\u2019s \"big, beautiful bill\u201d of some $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and $1.5 trillion in spending cuts by Memorial Day, dozens of Republicans from contested congressional districts have positioned themselves at the center of the negotiating table.",
      "While it\u2019s often the most conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus driving the legislative agenda \u2014 and they are demanding as much as $2 trillion in cuts \u2014 it\u2019s the more centrist-leaning conservatives who could sink the bill. They have been hauled into meetings with Trump at the White House, some have journeyed to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, and many are huddling almost daily with House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "And they are not satisfied, yet.",
      "\u201cTo get everybody politically and policy-wise on the same page is going to require more conversations,\u201d said LaLota, who is among five Republicans pledging to withhold their support unless changes to the SALT deduction are included.",
      "Diving into the gritty details of the massive package, the GOP leaders are running into the stubborn reality that not all the ideas from their menu of potential tax breaks and spending cuts are popular with voters back home.",
      "Moreover, their work of compiling the big package is not happening in a vacuum. It comes amid growing economic unease rippling across the country as Trump has fired thousands of federal workers, including some of their own constituents, and as his trade war sparks concerns of empty store shelves and higher prices.",
      "Brendan Buck, a former adviser to an earlier House speaker, Paul Ryan, warned in an op-ed Wednesday that all the party's energy is being poured into one bill, with questionable returns.",
      "\"Many Republicans are hoping that the tax bill can blunt the economic damage caused by the Trump tariffs,\" Buck wrote in The New York Times, \u201cbut that is highly unlikely.\u201d",
      "Democrats are ready for the fight, warning that Trump and his fellow Republicans are ripping away health care and driving the economy into the ditch \u2014 all to retain tax breaks approved during Trump's first term that are expiring at year's end.",
      "\u201cWhat we see from Donald Trump and the Republicans is they are actually crashing the economy in real time,\u201d said House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York.",
      "\u201cWhy,\u201d the Democratic leader asked, \u201care Republicans jumping through hoops\u201d to try to reduce Medicaid and food stamps used by millions of Americans?",
      "\u201cIt's all in service of enacting massive tax breaks for their millionaire donors like Elon Musk,\u201d he said.",
      "Johnson has projected a calm confidence, insisting that House Republicans are on track to deliver on Trump's agenda.",
      "The speaker's office has become a waystation with a revolving door of Republicans privately laboring to piece together the massive package.",
      "So far, GOP leaders have signaled they are walking away from some, but not all, of the steep Medicaid cuts. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the proposals could result in millions of people losing their coverage.",
      "Instead, what appears to still be on the table are tougher work requirements for those receiving Medicaid and food stamp assistance and more frequent eligibility tests for beneficiaries.",
      "That's not enough for the conservatives, who also number in the dozens and are insisting on deeper reductions.",
      "Ciscomani, in his second term, signed onto a letter with Bacon and others warning House Republican leadership he cannot support a bill that includes \u201cany reduction in Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur point is that we understand the need for reform,\u201d Ciscomani said. \u201cBut anything that goes beyond that and starts jeopardizing rural hospitals in my district and their existence overall, then we\u2019re running into an area where it will be very difficult to move forward. I think it\u2019s very important they know that.\u201d",
      "Bacon, Ciscomani and others joined on a separate letter raising concerns about eliminating clean-energy tax credits, including those passed under President Joe Biden, a Democrat.",
      "\u201cGo with a scalpel. Go pick out some things,\u201d Bacon told The Associated Press. He and the others warned that companies are already investing millions of dollars from the Inflation Reduction Act's incentives to green energy.",
      "\"You just can\u2019t do a wholesale throw it out,\" Bacon said.",
      "Democrats are also applying political pressure in Ciscomani\u2019s district and beyond.",
      "As Republicans decline to hold town halls on the advice of their leaders, Democrats are stepping in to warn constituents about what could happen to programs they rely on for health coverage and to put food on the table.",
      "Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Cory Booker of New Jersey visited Ciscomani's Tucson-based district last month to offer harsh condemnations.",
      "Kelly asked how many in the room were represented by Ciscomani, and then he warned about how scores of residents in the district could lose their health care coverage.",
      "\u201cAnd for what? It is so Donald Trump could give a big, giant tax cut to the wealthiest Americans. It is not fair,\u201d Kelly said.",
      "Booker, fresh off his 25-hour speech on the Senate floor, was even more pointed, saying just three House Republicans have to change their mind to upend the GOP\u2019s effort in the House, with its narrow majority.",
      "\u201cI believe one of them has to be in this district right here,\u201d Booker said. \u201cEither he changes his mind or this district changes congresspeople. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The road to the U.S.-Ukraine minerals agreement was paved with challenges",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Last fall, weeks before Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy floated a pitch that proposed, among other things,\u202fan economic deal that would allow Washington access to Ukraine\u2019s largely untapped minerals and deepen strategic ties.",
      "Under pressure from Western allies and amid global war fatigue, Zelenskyy saw that the days of Biden administration-era robust military aid might be numbered, and so the pitch was part of the Ukrainian leader\u2019s so-called victory plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war. It was an offer that would appeal to Trump\u2019s penchant for transactions-based diplomacy in hopes of ensuring a steady flow of future American support in return.",
      "Seven months later, a landmark deal between Ukraine and the Trump administration on Ukraine\u2019s mineral resources was inked. But the road in between was paved with mutual recriminations, a historic Oval Office blowout, \u201chundreds\u201d of revisions, and finally, a chance meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis\u2019 funeral.",
      "Last minute snags threatened to undermine the signing of the agreement, but in the end Ukraine secured a deal that, once set in motion, brings closer ties with the U.S. and a provides a vehicle for future military assistance.\u202f Ukraine\u2019s parliament is expected to pass the agreement on Thursday, and other documents pertaining to the deal are being finalized.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that this is the first time in history that the United States considers Ukraine as a long-term strategic partner, economically,\u201d Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said at a media briefing in Kyiv on Thursday, hours before the parliament vote.",
      "Here\u2019s a timeline of the deal\u2019s conception and signing:",
      "In response to rising pressure from Western allies and clear battlefield disadvantages, Zelenskyy outlines a so-called victory plan to end the war. The plan sought to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s negotiating hand and proposed measures to boost its military potential, but also economic partnerships with Western allies.",
      "Ukraine is rich in natural resources, including critically important metals such as uranium, titanium, lithium, and graphite.",
      "Zelenskyy pitches the plan to the White House during a visit to Washington in late September, and later in a meeting with Trump at Trump Tower in New York.",
      "Giving American companies preferential access to Ukraine would serve as leverage against Russia as most mineral deposits are located very close to front-line areas. Having U.S. companies on the ground, the thinking goes, would cement Washington's interests in Ukraine and serve as a de facto security guarantee. Critical minerals used to manufacture weapons, aviation and batteries would also give the U.S. access to reserves in a global market dominated by China.",
      "Trump appears captivated by the idea and very soon after his inauguration in January starts touting the idea of getting Ukraine\u2019s rare earth elemnts.",
      "By February, the White House and Ukraine appear to have made significant progress toward reaching an agreement that would provide the U.S. with access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals.",
      "On Feb. 12, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent arrives in Kyiv, becoming the first senior Trump administration official to visit and expecting Zelenskyy to sign the deal that day amid a push by Washington quickly end the war. But the Ukrainian president declines, saying elements of the draft didn't align with his country\u2019s constitution. The deal would have given the U.S. 50% rights to Ukraine\u2019s minerals and mentioned nothing of security guarantees.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t let the ministers sign \u2026 because in my view it is not ready to protect us, our interest,\u201d Zelenskyy told The Associated Press at the Munich Security Conference in February.",
      "Bessent later said in an interview with Tucker Carlson that Zelenskyy \u201cblew up\u201d the deal.",
      "Zelenskyy shot back, saying Bessent\u2019s approach had been disrespectful.",
      "\u201cMy colleagues know that if someone taps their finger on an agreement and says, \u2018You must sign now\u2019 \u2014 I could only say to him, \u2018Stop tapping your finger and let\u2019s have a proper conversation,'\u201d Zelenskyy later said in recounting the meeting in April to reporters in Kyiv.",
      "The two sides agreed to a new draft later in February.",
      "And on Feb. 28, Zelenskyy arrived in Washington with the intention of signing the revised version of the deal. But Zelenskyy insists on adding explicit U.S. security guarantees to the deal, saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin couldn\u2019t be trusted to comply with a ceasefire deal. A shouting match breaks out in the Oval Office, and Trump berates the Ukrainian president for not demonstrating gratitude for American support.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not in a good position. You don\u2019t have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards,\u201d Trump shouted.",
      "Zelenskyy leaves the White House with no deal and a deeply uncertain future with Washington. Shortly after, the U.S. pauses military aid and intelligence-sharing with Ukraine.",
      "According to multiple Ukrainian and Western officials, results from ceasefire talks between Ukrainian and U.S. delegates in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 marked a turning point after the disastrous Oval Office meeting.",
      "Ukraine agrees to a U.S. proposal for a full and immediate 30-day ceasefire, pending approval by the Kremlin, which had so far opposed anything short of a permanent end to the conflict without accepting any concessions. By piling conditions on both proposals for both full and partial ceasefires, Putin began testing Trump\u2019s patience.",
      "Meanwhile, technical discussions over the minerals deal resume. But the Trump administration introduces a new clause demanding that Ukraine reimburse the full amount of U.S. aid provided since the start of the full-scale invasion. Trump mentions a $500 billion figure as compensation, an amount many times more than the sum of aid provided.",
      "Ukrainian officials continue lobbying for a more equitable structure that respects Ukraine\u2019s strategic interests and state sovereignty. Zelenskyy spells out three core principles: The creation of a joint investment fund, 50-50 governance and the exclusion of debt repayment.",
      "Intensive negotiations continue, requiring Ukrainian and U.S. officials to work across time zones. Each day ushers in proposals and counterproposals.",
      "\u201cThere were likely hundreds of revisions and dozens of draft revisions,\u201d a senior European official close to the talks said. \u201cEvery morning meant a new batch of edits for each side.\u201d",
      "Svyrydenko said on April 18 that the two countries signed a memorandum of intent before a possible fuller agreement later. A draft, dated April 17 and obtained by The Associated Press, called for creating a joint U.S.-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, incorporated as a partnership in Delaware.",
      "The draft document was a version marked up by the United States and showed that the Trump administration could be willing to cede on some demands that Ukraine opposed.",
      "The draft was notable because it called for the U.S. to make a significant initial cash investment in the fund, in addition to receiving credit in the form of equity that is equivalent to the billions in U.S. military assistance already spent. Earlier versions had the U.S. investing no additional capital in Ukraine while having exclusive rights to the country\u2019s natural resources.",
      "Then, a breakthrough moment came on April 26 in the form of a tete-a-tete between Trump and Zelenskyy in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica at the sidelines of Pope Francis\u2019 funeral. Zelenskyy described it as a turning point and \u201cthe best conversation\u201d the two leaders have had to date.",
      "The exchange paved the way for the signing of the minerals deal in Washington four days later, he said.",
      "In the end, Zelenskyy didn't get explicit security guarantees as part of the deal. Still, the final agreement was considered a victory for Ukraine after months of diplomatic work.",
      "The signed deal crucially doesn't call for Kyiv to reimburse the U.S. for the aid it has already received \u2014 a concession from Trump. That concession was",
      "That concession was extracted after Ukrainians argued that recognizing past aid as debt retrospectively would go against agreements that Ukraine has made to obtain that aid with the U.S., European Union, International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Deputy Economy Minister Taras Kachka said. Instead, Ukrainians argued for future military assistance to count as part of investment into the fund.",
      "Bessent acknowledged that the agreement was a \u201ctacit security guarantee because of the economic partnership.\u201d",

That estimate covers April and May, meaning it could grow in coming months.",
      "Consolidated vehicle sales for the fiscal year through March totaled 9.36 million vehicles, down slightly from 9.44 million vehicles the previous fiscal year.",

      "The overall Emirates Group, owned by Dubai\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, saw annual profits of $5.6 billion, compared to $5.1 billion the year before.",
      "\u201cOur excellent financial standing enables us to continue building on and scaling up from our successful business models,\u201d said Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktom, Emirates' chairman and chief executive.",
      "\u201cWhile some markets are jittery about trade and travel restrictions, volatility is not new in our industry,\" he said. \"We simply adapt and navigate around these challenges.\u201d",
      "Emirates serves as a crucial link in East-West travel and is the crown jewel of what experts and diplomats refer to as \u201cDubai Inc.\u201d \u2014 a series of interconnected companies overseen by the sheikhdom\u2019s ruling Al Maktoum family.",
      "The Emirates\u2019 results track with those for its base, Dubai International Airport. The world\u2019s busiest airport for international travelers had a record 92.3 million passengers pass through its terminals in 2024.",
      "The airport now plans to move to the city-state\u2019s second, sprawling airfield in its southern desert reaches in the next 10 years in a project worth nearly $35 billion.",
      "A real-estate boom and the city\u2019s highest-ever tourism numbers have made Dubai a destination as well as a layover. However, the city is now grappling with increasing traffic and costs pressuring both its Emirati citizens and the foreign residents who power its economy.",

      "LONDON -- The Bank of England cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25% amid concerns over the potential shock to global growth emanating from the tariff policies of the Trump administration.",
      "The decision Thursday was widely expected, though there was an array of opinion on the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee, with two voting for a bigger half-point cut to 4%, and two voting to hold rates.",
      "Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey said inflationary pressures have continued to ease, paving the way for the fourth quarter-point rate cut since August.",
      "\u201cThe past few weeks have shown how unpredictable the global economy can be,\u201d he said. \"That\u2019s why we need to stick to a gradual and careful approach to further rate cuts. Ensuring low and stable inflation is our top priority.\u201d",
      "The decision is the first since President Donald Trump made his tariff announcement in early April. Though most tariffs were paused for 90 days following the ensuing market turmoil, including the 10% baseline tariff applied to U.K. goods entering the U.S., the backdrop for the global economy remains highly uncertain.",
      "Some of that uncertainty, with regard to the British economy, could be lifted later Thursday when details of a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. are announced. At the very least, they are expected to lower the tariff burden.",
      "Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that a deal due to be announced at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT) will be a \u201cfull and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come.\u201d",
      "Though the tariff burden may be eased, the biggest uncertainty facing the global economy is the potential for a U.S.-China trade war, which would dampen economic growth everywhere.",
      "The rate cut comes despite expectations that inflation will rise further above the bank's 2% target over coming months, from the current 2.6% as a result of a raft of price increases in April, such as domestic energy and water bills, and firms passing on tax rises to consumers.",
      "\u201cWhile headline inflation is expected to rise in the near-term, we do not expect that to persist,\u201d said Bailey, adding that it will be back around target in two years time.",
      "Unlike the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank, which last month cut interest rates too, the U.S. Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged Wednesday as its policymakers wait to see how Trump\u2019s tariffs affect the U.S. economy before making any moves.",
      "Most economists think the Bank of England will continue to lower borrowing rates over the coming months, though admitted that the three-way split in the voting may complicate its messaging.",
      "\u201cWe still think the Bank will cut rates at least twice more later this year, but much like the Fed\u2019s message yesterday, U.K. policy makers will want to see more data on how tariffs and domestic tax increases are being digested by the economy before moving decisively\u201d said Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at asset management firm Aberdeen.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China is crippling an entire industry that hand-harvests geoducks",
      "SUQUAMISH, Wash. -- For over two decades, Suquamish tribal member Joshua George has dived into the emerald waters of the Salish Sea looking for an unusually phallic clam that\u2019s coveted thousands of miles away.",
      "George is a geoduck diver. Pronounced \u201cgooey-duck,\u201d the world\u2019s largest burrowing clam has been harvested in tidelands by George\u2019s Indigenous ancestors in the Pacific Northwest since before Europeans arrived.",
      "In recent years it has also become a delicacy in China, with Washington state sending 90% of its geoducks there, creating a niche yet lucrative American seafood export.",
      "But the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China is now crippling an entire industry that hand-harvests geoducks, leaving Washington state divers without work, Seattle exporters without business and Chinese aficionados with fewer of these prized clams.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in 24 years where I don\u2019t know when or if we\u2019ll be going back to work or if I have to find another job or what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d George said.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff-driven economic feud with China, which dates back to his first term in office, swiftly resumed in February within weeks of taking back the White House. By April, Trump had placed tariffs of at least 145% on China, which led China to retaliate with tariffs of 125% on the U.S.",
      "Top U.S. officials are set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend in Switzerland in the first major talks between the two nations since the latest tariffs were imposed, but it is unclear where those talks will lead.",
      "Enter the geoduck, weighing about 2 pounds and so entrenched in local culture that it is the mascot for Evergreen State College in Olympia. The meaty mollusk is best described as sweet and briny, and it's often sliced raw for crisp sashimi out west while China consumers prefer it chewy in stir-fries or hot pot soups. Pre-tariff costs were as high as $100 per pound in restaurants, so it\u2019s a dish generally reserved for special occasions like Chinese New Year, or to celebrate a business gathering.",
      "Unlike other products with long-lasting shelf life and standing inventory, the trade war has had an immediate, direct effect on the delicate geoducks, which are shipped alive the same day of harvest.",
      "\u201cThe whole market, everybody just had to stop,\u201d said Jim Boure, general manager of Suquamish Seafoods, an enterprise of the Suquamish Tribe. \u201cWe started getting phone calls from buyers saying orders are canceled.\u201d",
      "The millions of pounds of geoducks shipped annually to China come from two main sources: wild harvests on tracts of seafloor that are split between the Washington State Department of Natural Resources and Puget Sound Treaty Indian Tribes, and tideland farms. The state\u2019s share is auctioned to private exporters that often hire contract divers to harvest them.",
      "As of late April, Washington state divers had only pulled about half of the expected harvest from the state tracts, said Blain Reeves, an aquatic resources division manager for the state\u2019s Department of Natural Resources. Last year, the state and tribes collectively harvested about 3.4 million pounds of wild Washington geoduck for sale. The state generated $22.4 million in revenue for their half of the clams, which went toward paying for aquatic restoration projects locally. The state doesn't track how much is harvested by private farmers.",
      "\u201cIf only half the pounds that were contracted are harvested, then our revenue is halved,\u201d Reeves said.",
      "The Suquamish operation has no orders to harvest for at the moment, but it still must keep up with the maintenance to stay ready for business if and when China comes calling.",
      "On a recent April day, George\u2019s team made a quick trip to collect a handful of the clams for state lab testing.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re doing the job, and it\u2019s not all this other political stuff behind the scenes and everything else, we love this,\u201d said George, adding that diving, which takes place early in the day so that the geoducks are on an airplane by evening, has allowed him to watch his kids grow up.",
      "Fellow diver Kyle Purser said he cherishes his underwater job, but now fears it's being taken away.",
      "\"When you\u2019re watching your money disappear and you\u2019ve got families to feed and not knowing when you're going to get your next paycheck, (it's) very stressful,\u201d he said.",
      "The geoduck import market was already facing weaker demand in recent years due to the Chinese economy\u2019s struggle to regain post-pandemic momentum. While the tariffs have only exacerbated troubles for geoduck sellers in Washington, there's also been an unintended consequence: The American trade war has inadvertently boosted the Canadian geoduck business, which is facing a mere 25% tariff from China in comparison to the 125% for the U.S.",
      "Washington state in the U.S. and Canada's British Columbia province are the two primary places where the wild geoducks grow naturally for commercial harvest. The two countries did healthy business primarily serving Chinese appetites for decades, in part because quantities are limited. It\u2019s a labor-intensive and heavily-regulated harvest, as divers must go several feet below the surface to dig for them.",
      "\u201cThey love the fact that it tastes like the sea,\u201d said James Austin, president of Canada\u2019s Underwater Harvesters Association. \u201cIt\u2019s a product that\u2019s really a hit with the Chinese. It\u2019s all about the wild coastline. It\u2019s really prestigious.\u201d",
      "Austin said he expects there will be 2.75 million pounds of Canadian geoducks harvested in 2025, worth approximately $60 million Canadian dollars ($43.4 million USD) in revenue.",
      "While demand has been relatively low but still steady for Canadian's geoducks, Austin said they're now the leading exporters for China, which has helped them negotiate higher prices as a result. For example, after Canada got hit with a 25% tariff in March, export sale prices dropped to $12 per pound, and after the U.S. got hit with a 125% tariff in April, Canadian geoducks are now being sold for $17 a pound.",
      "\u201cWe have no competitors right now,\u201d Austin said.",
      "Yang Bin at Beihai Huaxiashougang Health Industry Company in Beihai city of Guangxi province in China said their seafood wholesale important business no longer gets geoduck from the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t care about U.S. tariffs because we can get geoduck from other countries with stable prices,\u201d Yang said.",
      "On their first week back to work since the tariff fight brought business to a standstill in Washington state, Derrick McRae and his brother pulled up about 800 pounds of wild geoducks in just one April day.",
      "He donned a full-body diving outfit with an oxygen line tethered to his boat to dive under the cold waters of an inland sea channel west of Seattle. Kneeled on the seafloor, McRae used a water spray gun to move the sand covering the geoducks. In the cloud of sediment, he felt for the neck with his hand, pulling the clam and stuffing it in a net attached to him.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just kind of waiting on the edge of our seats to see what happens next,\u201d McRae said.",
      "At one of the southernmost inlets, farmer Ian Child said the tariff disruption is not just hurting his bottom line but the entire farming process. He usually places young geoducks in the sand in the summer, but he can\u2019t mix new crops with any existing unharvested clams.",
      "\u201cI think that the demand is still over there for the product,\u201d he said of China. \u201cI think they still want it. It\u2019s just a matter of where the tariffs will land.\u201d",

      "That\u2019s particularly the case after the trade war seems to be entering \u201ca new phase,\u201d Powell said, where the U.S. is conducting more talks on trade with other countries.

      "More than a dozen states are suing the Trump administration for withholding funds from for the buildout of electric vehicle chargers across the U.S. The federal lawsuit says $5 billion allocated to states under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law signed ...",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Seventeen states are suing President Donald Trump 's administration for withholding billions of dollars for building more electric vehicle chargers, according to a federal lawsuit announced Wednesday.",
      "The Trump administration in February directed states to stop spending money for electric vehicle charging infrastructure that was allocated under President Joe Biden \u2014 part of a broader push by the Republican president to roll back environmental policies advanced by his Democratic predecessor. The EV charger program was set to allocate $5 billion over five years to various states, of which an estimated $3.3 billion had already been made available.",
      "The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California, Colorado and Washington, and challenges the Federal Highway Administration's authority to halt the funding. They argue Congress, which approved the money in 2021 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, holds that authority.",
      "\"These funds were going to be used to shape the future of transportation,\u201d California Attorney General Rob Bonta said, calling it \u201cshort-sighted\u201d of Trump to revoke the funds.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t sit back while the Trump administration violates the law,\u201d Bonta, a Democrat, said.",
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "EVs stood at about 8% of new car sales in the U.S. last year, according to Motorintelligence.com, a sign the market is growing \u2014 although the pace has slowed as the auto industry tries to convince mainstream buyers about going electric. The program was meant to assuage some concerns and build infrastructure along highway corridors first, then address gaps elsewhere once the state highway obligations were met.",
      "Some states with projects running under the program have already been reimbursed by the Biden-era federal funds. Others are still contracting for their sites. Still more had halted their plans by the time the Trump administration ordered states to stop their spending. Regardless, getting these chargers installed and operating has been a slow process with contracting challenges, permitting delays and complex electrical upgrades.",
      "It was expected that states would fight against the federal government\u2019s efforts to slow the nation\u2019s electric vehicle charger buildout. New York, for example, which is part of the suit, has been awarded over $175 million in federal funds from the program, and state officials say $120 million is currently being withheld by the Trump administration.",
      "Even the electric carmaker Tesla, run by Elon Musk, who has spearheaded Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency efforts to cut federal spending, benefited greatly from funding under the program, receiving millions of dollars to expand its already-massive footprint of chargers in the U.S.",
      "Despite threats to the program, experts have said they expect the nation\u2019s EV charging buildout to continue as automakers look to make good on massive electrification ambitions.",
      "Consumers thinking about buying an EV often cite concerns about the availability of charging infrastructure. It's a hurdle for people living in multifamily dwellings and in rural areas, or what are otherwise known as \u201ccharging deserts.\u201d It's also a problem for people who can't find a place to charge their vehicle near their work, or who often drive longer highway routes.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said withholding the funds was illegal and would kill thousands of U.S. jobs, ceding them to China.",
      "\"Instead of hawking Teslas on the White House lawn, President Trump could actually help Elon \u2014 and the nation \u2014 by following the law and releasing this bipartisan funding,\u201d Newsom said, referencing Trump's recent purchase of a Tesla in a show of support for Musk.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s effort to withdraw funding for electric vehicle chargers is part of a broader push to roll back environmental policies advanced under Biden.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first week back in office, he signed executive orders to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement again, reverse a 2030 target for electric vehicles to make up half of new cars sold, and end environmental justice efforts. At the same time, federal agencies under Trump have rolled back key rules and regulations and supported the build-out of the fossil fuel industry.",
      "The U.S. House also advanced proposals last week aimed at blocking California from enforcing vehicle-emission rules, including a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. The Senate parliamentarian says the California policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.",

      "Missouri is poised to become the first state to repeal a common tax on profits from stocks and real estate sales",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Investors who profit from selling stocks, real estate and other assets soon could reap an even larger benefit in Missouri, which is poised to become the first U.S. state to exempt capital gains from its income tax.",
      "Legislation that won final approval Wednesday would halt the capital gains tax this year for individuals and could eventually eliminate it for corporations, if state revenues keep growing. The tax repeal now heads to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has said he's \u201cvery supportive\u201d of it.",
      "Though proponents hope it can spur the economy, detractors assert that the capital gains tax repeal will primarily benefit the rich and result in less tax revenue for public schools and services.

      "Missouri's unique income tax carve-out comes as Republican-led legislatures in at least eight other states have passed more traditional income tax rate reductions this year. It also comes as Congress weighs whether to renew and expand income tax breaks enacted during President Donald Trump's first term in office.",

Missouri currently is among 32 states and the District of Columbia that tax capital gains at the same rate as wages and other income, according to the nonprofit Tax Foundation. Eight states tax capital gains at a lower rate than other income.",
      "Some Democratic-led states have been moving in the opposite direction. Maryland lawmakers last month passed a bill that would impose a 2% capital gains tax on those with incomes over $350,000. And Washington lawmakers recently passed legislation to impose an extra 2.9% tax on capital gains over $1 million. Minnesota already imposes a surcharge on capital gains and other investment income over $1 million.",

      "The more President Donald Trump talks about his efforts to reach deals with America\u2019s trading partners, the more confusing the tariff picture gets",
      "WASHINGTON -- The more President Donald Trump talks about his efforts to reach deals with America's trading partners, the more confusing the tariff picture gets. His team seems good with that, saying Trump is using \u201cstrategic uncertainty\u201d to his advantage.",
      "Trump says the United States does not have to sign any agreements, and that it could sign 25 of them right now. He says he is looking for fair deals on all sides, and that he does not care about other countries' markets. He says his team can sit down to negotiate the terms of a deal, and that he might just impose a set of tariffs on his own.",
      "\u201cI am struggling to make sense of it,\u201d Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote in an email.",
      "Late Wednesday on his social media site, Trump wrote that he\u2019ll be holding a news conference Thursday morning concerning a \u201cMAJOR TRADE DEAL WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY.\u201d He added that it would be \u201cTHE FIRST OF MANY!!!\u201d",
      "Although Trump's team holds up his best-selling book \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d as proof that he has a master plan, much of the world is on tenterhooks. That has meant a volatile stock market, hiring freezes and all kinds of uncertainty even as Trump continues to promise that new factories and jobs are on the horizon.",
      "A look at how the trade talks may play out:",
      "As part of any deal, Trump wants to keep some of his tariffs in place. He believes the import taxes can generate massive revenues for a heavily indebted federal government even though other countries see the whole point of striking a deal as getting rid of tariffs.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a beautiful thing for us,\u201d Trump said recently about tariffs. \u201cIf you can use them, if you can get away with using them, it\u2019s going to make us very rich. And we\u2019ll be paying off debt, we\u2019ll be lowering your taxes very substantially because so much money will be taken in that we\u2019ll be able to lower your taxes even beyond the tax cut that you\u2019re going to be getting.\u201d",
      "So far this year, the U.S. government has collected $45.9 billion from tariffs, about $14.5 billion more than last year, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Those revenues could escalate sharply given the 10% baseline tariffs, the 145% rate being charged on Chinese goods and rates as high as 25% on steel, aluminum, auto and Mexican and Canadian imports.",
      "To reach Trump's stated goals of repaying the $36 trillion debt and reducing income taxes, his tariffs would need to raise at least $2 trillion annually without causing the economy to crash in ways that lead to lower overall tax revenues. That would be close to impossible mathematically.",
      "The Republican administration has said 17 of its major 18 trading partners have essentially presented them with term sheets, which list the possible compromises that they are prepared to make. Agreeing to a mutual understanding of the terms would be only the start of any trade talks.",
      "But foreign leaders have said it is unclear exactly what Trump wants or how deals could be codified into a durable agreement. They also know Trump approved the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement in 2020, only to charge new tariffs on those same two trading partners this year.",
      "While meeting with Trump on Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney suggested the next version of that agreement would need to be strengthened to prevent a repeat of the fentanyl-related tariffs imposed this year by Trump that Canada saw as arbitrary.",
      "\u2019Some things about it are going to have to change,\" Carney said.",
      "The 145% tariffs on China \u2014 and the 125% tariffs on the U.S. that Beijing imposed in response \u2014 hang over the entire negotiating process. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledges that those tariffs are not \u201csustainable.\u201d",
      "The first talks between the U.S. and China are set to begin this weekend in Switzerland, but they will likely be limited to finding ways to de-escalate tensions enough for meaningful negotiations to take place.",
      "The key issue is that China is the world's dominant manufacturer, which makes also makes it a leading exporter in ways that can supplant domestic industries. Because China suppresses domestic consumption and focuses on production, the rest of the world buys what it makes because there is not enough internal demand. The U.S. wants to rebalance trade, but it has done so also through tariffs on countries that could be its natural allies in defending their auto and tech industries against China.",
      "\u201cObviously in this trade puzzle, China is the biggest piece,\u201d Bessent said this week. \u201cWhere do we end up with China?\u201d",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian has suggested that a meaningful way for the Trump administration to jump-start talks would be to pull back on its rhetoric and punitive import taxes.",
      "\u201cIf the U.S. truly wants to resolve the issue through dialogue and negotiation, it should stop threatening and pressuring and engage in dialogue with China on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit,\u201d Lin said Tuesday.",
      "Asked on Wednesday whether he would reduce the tariffs on China as a condition for negotiations, Trump said, \u201cNo.\u201d",
      "The president also disputed statements by the Chinese government that his administration sought the talks in Geneva. \u201cWell, I think they ought to go back and study their files,\" Trump said.",
      "Not necessarily.",
      "Trump unilaterally imposed his universal tariffs without Congress, using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to do so, which has led to multiple lawsuits. The administration also maintains that any agreements to change the rates would not need congressional approval.",
      "Previously, presidents, including Trump in his first term with his \u201cPhase One\u201d China deal, could negotiate only \u201cmore limited agreements that have focused on select bilateral trade and tariff issues,\u201d according to a Congressional Research Service report updated this April. Other examples of limited deals include a 2023 agreement on critical minerals and a 2020 deal on digital trade with Japan.",
      "The challenge is that Trump has also made nontariff barriers such as safety regulations for autos and the value added taxes charged in Europe part of his talks. He wants other countries to change their nontariff policies in exchange for the U.S. reducing the new tariffs he introduced. Other countries, in return, might object to U.S. subsidies to its companies.",
      "In theory, it would take House and Senate approval to complete a deal that would address \u201cnon-tariff barriers and require changes to U.S. law,\u201d the Congressional Research Service report said.",
      "If other countries fail to satisfy him, Trump has suggested he will just do some kind of internal deals and set a tariff rate, although he technically already did that with his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs. The import taxes announced by Trump then led to a financial market sell-off that caused him to pause some of his new tariffs for 90 days and charge the lower 10% baseline rate while negotiations take place.",
      "It appears Trump will agree not to impose the originally threatened tariffs if he thinks other countries are making adequate concessions, essentially meaning that the U.S. gives up nothing because the tariffs are new. But Trump might also pull back his tariffs without necessarily getting much in return.",
      "\u201cTrump is notorious for making maximalist demands and then retreating as negotiations go on, so we\u2019ll see how long he sticks with his formula,\u201d said William Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. \u201cBut so far it is pretty clear that countries coming in and wanting a \u2018normal\u2019 trade negotiation with both sides making substantive concessions are being rebuffed.\u201d",

      "Researchers from vaccine-maker Moderna reported in a study published Wednesday that the new combo shot generated a stronger immune response against COVID-19 and most strains of flu than existing standalone shots in people 50 and older. Side effects were injection site pain, fatigue and headaches. Moderna previously reported a summary of the results from the company-sponsored trial in 8,000 people.",

A combo shot also might improve vaccination rates, the researchers wrote in the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.",
      "Dr. Greg Poland, who studies vaccine response at Mayo Clinic and was not involved in the new study, said he's not convinced that a combo shot would be popular. And while flu comes in seasonal waves, COVID-19 has been spreading throughout the year, Poland said, posing challenges for how to time the shots to keep protection strong.",

      "\u201cLet\u2019s see how long he can run this for,\" Dallas coach Peter DeBoer said. \"He\u2019s rolling. He's feeling it. Pretty impressive, what he\u2019s doing. I mean, considering the opponent and the time of year and how he\u2019s dominating games, really impressive.\u201d",
      "When/Where to Watch: Game 3, Friday, 7 p.m. EDT (TNT/truTV/Max)",
      "Series: Maple Leafs lead 2-0",
      "If losing a pair of one-goal playoff games wasn't bad enough \u2014 5-4 in Game 1, 4-3 in Game 2 \u2014 the Panthers can look at two goals given up in those games and really lament how those scores factored into creating their current situation.",
      "In Game 1, Seth Jones scored to get Florida within 2-1 \u2014 and the Panthers gave up a goal to Morgan Rielly 19 seconds later. In Game 2, Anton Lundell scored early in the third to pull Florida into a 3-3 tie \u2014 only to have Mitch Marner score what became the game-winner 17 seconds later.",
      "The Leafs held serve at home, which is what they were supposed to do. Toronto became the first team to get to six wins in these playoffs and will be feeling very good about its game going into Game 3.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change how we go about our day today,\" Panthers forward Sam Reinhart said Thursday before Florida hopped aboard its charter flight back home. \"It\u2019s about recovering and putting the best foot forward to play our best game tomorrow night and get back in this thing.\u201d",
      "When/Where to Watch: Game 2, Friday, 9:30 p.m. EDT (TNT/truTV/Max)",
      "Series: Stars lead 1-0",
      "Playoff hockey is different. Every opponent at this time of year is obviously proven. But the Winnipeg Jets \u2014 who needed seven games and a Game 7 miracle to escape St. Louis in Round 1 \u2014 are right back into some hot water, in large part because they're giving up a lot of goals.",
      "The Jets have given up 26 goals in the last six games, after not giving up more than 20 in any six-game span of the regular season.",
      "Rantanen's hot streak is one thing, but Winnipeg's defense wasn't exactly airtight going back to Round 1 either. And while the Jets survived a Game 7 at home to get here, the last thing they need is to go back to Dallas in a 2-0 hole.",
      "That starts with doing more against Rantanen.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s just somebody that you always have to know when he\u2019s on the ice,\" Jets coach Scott Arniel said of facing Rantanen. \u201cWhenever you face elite players, you\u2019ve got to know where they are. And he\u2019s feeling it. We've got to know when he\u2019s on the ice.\u201d",

      "For Mike Sullivan, the latest coach of the New York Rangers, there will be many priorities in taking over a team that missed the playoffs a season after winning the Presidents\u2019 Trophy.",
      "Foremost will be communication.",
      "\u201cI have spoken to every player on the roster over the last three days,\u2019\u2019 Sullivan said Thursday at his introductory press conference. \u201cI think there is a fair amount of leadership in that room. There\u2019s a lot of character in that room.\u201d",
      "Sullivan, the 38th coach in franchise history and fifth since 2018, agreed to lead the Rangers on May 2 after parting ways with Pittsburgh, where he won the Stanley Cup twice.",
      "He replaces Peter Laviolette, who was fired April 19 after the Rangers slid 29 points to miss the postseason despite their raft of talent. It will be up to Sullivan to resuscitate a power play that fell from the league\u2019s top echelon to 28th overall in 2024-25 and help the defense improve in front of elite goaltender Igor Shesterkin, who is coming off his worst NHL season.",
      "Sullivan spent four seasons as a Rangers assistant under then-coach John Tortorella from 2009-13. He also coached current Rangers president and general manager Chris Drury during that time. They also worked together through USA Hockey at the 4 Nations Face-Off last February and will be part of the U.S. contingent for the 2026 Milan Olympics.",
      "Sullivan will have top scorers Artemi Panarin, Mika Zibanejad and Adam Fox on his side after years guiding Penguins stars Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang in Pittsburgh, where he won the Cup in 2016 and 2017.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve grown so much respect over the years for the talent that the Rangers have,\u2019\u2019 said Sullivan, who lost a seven-game first-round playoff series to the Rangers in 2022. \"I look forward to the opportunity to get to know these guys on a more personal level. I look forward to the opportunity to work with them, both on the ice and off the ice, to try to become the most competitive team that we can become.\u201d",
      "Also pressing for the 57-year-old Sullivan \u2014 who was drafted by the Rangers in 1987 and later played 709 NHL games for four other franchises \u2014 is how he will handle younger Rangers such as 22-year-old Brennan Othmann and 20-year-old Gabe Perreault, a first-round pick in 2023 who joined the team briefly at the end of last season.",
      "\u201cPart of coaching or the art of coaching, I guess, is trying to figure out what that daily recipe is that\u2019s best for the player,\u2019\u2019 Sullivan said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s time in the American League as a young player, sometimes it\u2019s time in the National League depending on the types of minutes that that player can play. What I will tell you is that I think it\u2019s important that every player earns their opportunities, that no one\u2019s entitled to an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Sullivan was joined Thursday by Drury, who was awarded a contract extension last month.",
      "Drury\u2019s previous two coaching hires \u2014 Laviolette and Gerard Gallant \u2014 each lasted two seasons. The 48-year-old executive expressed enthusiasm for the addition of Sullivan, the only U.S.-born coach with multiple Stanley Cup wins.",
      "\u201cThe second Mike was available, we quickly and aggressively pursued him,\u2019\u2019 Drury said. \u201cWe are certainly thrilled that pursuit led us to this moment today. There\u2019s a lot of work to be done.\u201d",

      "Sue Bird is giving another assist to USA Basketball, becoming the managing director of the women\u2019s national team",
      "NEW YORK -- Sue Bird is giving another assist to USA Basketball, becoming the managing director of the women's national team.",
      "The five-time Olympic champion was named to the newly created position Thursday and it marks a major change in the way the organization creates its roster and coaching staff.",
      "\u201cI played for USA Basketball for so long and always really enjoyed my time with them,\" Bird said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI love representing my country. I love being competitive on that stage. To have that opportunity to do it in a different role is exciting.\u201d",
      "Before the change, a committee made those decisions, but now in a move similar to what the USA men's national team does, Bird will be the one responsible for putting things together. Grant Hill has the same role on the men's side.",
      "\u201cWe are really, really excited about Sue for so many reasons,\u201d USA Basketball CEO Jim Tooley said in a phone interview. \u201cHer pedigree and standing in the sport is so strong. Not just in women\u2019s basketball, but all of sport. She\u2019s a tremendous leader and we're very excited that she took this on for us.\u201d",
      "The men's team has had a managing director for two decades with Jerry Colangelo serving in that spot from 2005-21 before Hill took over.",
      "\u201cShe's had five Olympic gold medals herself and understands what's involved,\u201d Tooley said. \u201cHaving the managing director position makes it easier to work with the staff for long term vision of the program. It's hard to do that with a committee that comes and goes and gets together a handful of times.\u201d",
      "Tooley said Bird's term will be for four years \u2014 the same as the Olympic cycle \u2014 and the change to this structure has been in the works for a few years, well before the decision to not select Caitlin Clark for the 2024 Paris Games team that left some people upset.",
      "\u201cDiscussions happened after the \u201821 Olympics and Sue served on the board last quad,\u201d Tooley said. \u201cWe got in discussions about the managing director role and we sat with her awhile and she gave it a lot of consideration and thought. It\u2019s an enormous responsibility.\u201d",
      "Bird said she's used to the pressure of USA Basketball where it's basically win a gold medal or bust. The Americans have won eight straight, including one at last year's Paris Olympics.",
      "\u201cThis is a different type of pressure,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm hoping to bring all that I learned as a player, all my experience, all my understanding. The whole goal is to win a gold medal and it feels at times that's the only option. ... I know what it's like to be a player, know what it's like as a player to build teams and have teams come together and see what clicks.\u201d",
      "Before the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, the Americans will play in the FIBA World Cup in Germany next year. The first qualifying event will take place in November. Besides figuring out what players will be on that team, Bird will have to decide who will be coaching the squad. There is no clear-cut choice right now.",
      "\u201cOf course I\u2019ve started to think about it, jotting some names down here and there,\u201d Bird said. \u201cIt's the first priority without a doubt. There are so many qualified coaches in college and the WNBA.\u201d",
      "Bird said that she doesn't have a specific time frame to have a coach in place.",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Jannik Sinner was just as surprised by which fellow players sent him messages of support at the start of his three-month doping ban as those who sent nothing.",
      "The top-ranked player is returning to tennis at the Italian Open this week after his settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency raised questions, since it conveniently allowed Sinner not to miss any Grand Slams and come back at his home tournament.",
      "\u201cAt the start of the suspension I received some surprising messages from some players, whereas there were others who I would have expected to hear from that didn\u2019t send anything,\u201d Sinner said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to name names.\u201d",
      "The settlement was made after WADA appealed a decision last year by the International Tennis Integrity Agency to fully exonerate Sinner for what it deemed to be an accidental contamination by a banned anabolic steroid in March 2024.",
      "Many fellow pros feel Sinner was treated too lightly and Sinner recently discussed how he didn\u2019t really feel comfortable in the locker room and the players' lounge during his run to a second straight Australian Open title in January, noting that \u201cplayers were looking at me differently.\u201d",
      "Coach Simone Vagnozzi said that he and Darren Cahill, Sinner\u2019s other coach, also sensed the glares.",
      "\u201cWhen something like that happens I think it\u2019s almost inevitable to have everyone looking at you. But there have also been some nice things said,\u201d Vagnozzi said, highlighting comments he appreciated from Holger Rune\u2019s mom, Casper Ruud and Alexander Zverev.",
      "In the final month of his ban, Sinner practiced with Jack Draper, Lorenzo Sonego and Rune at his training base in Monaco.",
      "At the start of his suspension, Sinner was banned from entering any sanctioned sports event.",
      "\u201cI wanted to support my friends in cycling or motorsport,\u201d Sinner said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go there. That for me was the toughest part.\u201d",
      "In March, professional cyclist Giulio Ciccone posted a photo on Instagram of himself posing during a bike outing with Sinner and Ferrari endurance drivers Alberto Giovinazzi and Alessandro Pier Guidi.",
      "Cahill has announced he will retire at the end of the year and Vagnozzi was asked if he would consider then coaching Sinner on his own.",
      "\u201cI would be able to do it on my own,\" Vagnozzi said. \"But with players of this level it\u2019s important to have another viewpoint. And it\u2019s important to sometimes split up the weeks you spend with the player. Otherwise it\u2019s a 365-day/year job and that\u2019s a bit much.",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019m hoping that Darren stays on for another five years, because we have such a great relationship. He might be the best coach ever in terms of results and other factors.\u201d",
      "Vagnozzi referred to how Sinner is the fourth player the Australian has coached to No. 1 after Andre Agassi, Lleyton Hewitt and Simona Halep. \u201cBut most of all, he\u2019s a special person.\u201d",
      "Sinner will play his opening match on Saturday against No. 99 Mariano Navone, who beat 18-year-old Italian wild card Federico Cin\u00e0 6-3, 6-3 on Thursday. Sinner enters on a 21-match winning streak but hasn\u2019t played an official match since January.",
      "Also, the red clay at the Foro Italico is not Sinner\u2019s best surface. Only one of his 19 career titles has come on the dirt, in Umag, Croatia, in 2022.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely the surface where he is the least sure of himself,\u201d Vagnozzi said. \u201cBut last year he had a good clay season, reached the semifinals in Monte Carlo and the French Open and the quarterfinals in Madrid. \u2026 So I think he can do well here, too.\u201d",
      "The last Italian man to win the Rome title was Adriano Panatta in 1976.",

      "Neither club was among the favorites when the new-look, 36-team league phase of the competition rolled out in September.",
      "Indeed, PSG \u2014 without Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and at the start of the post-galacticos era \u2014 guaranteed its place in the knockout stage only by winning its final game of the league phase.",
      "Months later, however, PSG has been widely admired as perhaps the most stylish team in the competition after ending the title hopes of a succession of English opponents in its latest bid for its first European title.",
      "Meanwhile, three-time champion Inter, another team lacking superstars but well-coached and with a never-say-die spirit, has gone under the radar once again like it did when reaching the final in 2023 and losing to Manchester City.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at the details of the final, the teams and their route to the title match:",
      "Munich's Allianz Arena will host the final on May 31. It's the fifth time the German city has staged the European Cup's title match.",
      "The first three \u2014 1979, 1993, 1997 \u2014 were at Munich's previous home, Olympiastadion. The Allianz Arena was the host for Chelsea beating Bayern in a penalty shootout in 2012.",
      "American rock band Linkin Park will play the pre-match show.",
      "Real Madrid earned almost 139 million euros ($154 million) from its title-winning campaign in the Champions League last season and this season's winner should get more.",
      "Last year's prize fund of more than 2 billion euros ($2.22 billion) rose by 25% this season in the expanded format featuring more teams (36, up from 32) and more games (eight instead of six in the first stage).",
      "So expect PSG or Inter earn at least 150 million euros ($170 million) if the team winds up as champion.",
      "These coffers can be further boosted across June and July, when both teams will be in the United States for the expanded 32-team Club World Cup. Winning that competition could net PSG or Inter more than $100 million from the $1 billion prize money fund.",
      "The finalists have never met in the Champions League.",
      "That's a refreshing rarity for two big clubs who regularly compete in Europe.",
      "PSG became the third French team to reach the European Cup final on two occasions, after Reims (1956 and \u201859) and Marseille (1991 and \u201993). PSG's other time was in 2020, when losing to Bayern Munich 1-0 in Lisbon.",
      "PSG's road to Munich has gone mostly through England. After seeing off fellow French club Brest in the playoffs, PSG has beaten Liverpool, Aston Villa and lastly Arsenal in successive rounds in the knockout stage \u2014 having also defeated then-Premier League champion Manchester City in a key victory in the next-to-last round of the league stage. Qualification was in the balance at that stage, with PSG having won just one of its first five league games only to win its last three.",
      "Inter was a two-time European champion before PSG was even founded in 1970, after titles in 1964 and 1965, while the Italian team added a third European crown in 2010.",
      "Unlike PSG, Inter qualified directly to the last 16 after finishing in fourth place, conceding just one goal in its eight league games. In the knockout stage, Simone Inzaghi's team overcame Feyenoord in the round of 16, Bayern in the quarterfinals and Lamine Yamal and Barcelona in a pair of epic legs in the semifinals.",
      "PSG's relatively brief history was underwhelming until the club was bought in 2011 by Qatar Sports Investments.",
      "Then came the soccer boom in the capital and the arrival of trophy after trophy \u2014 well, at domestic level anyway. PSG has won 11 of the last 13 Ligue 1 titles but now the hardware the Qatari owners want is the Champions League.",
      "There will be extra satisfaction if it happens after a change in approach that has seen the club shed the superstars \u2014 Lionel Messi, Neymar and Mbapp\u00e9 \u2014 and rely on mostly young and hungry replacements, such as midfielder Jo\u00e3o Neves and forward D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dou\u00e9.",
      "It has been a more financially turbulent story at Inter, which has been owned by U.S. investment fund Oaktree since May last year after the eight-year tenure of Chinese retail giant Suning came to an end amid mounting debts.",
      "For three years before that, Inter was owned by a consortium led by Indonesian businessman Erick Thohir, which bought out Massimo Moratti.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Golden State Warriors are planning to play without Stephen Curry for at least the next three games of their second-round series against Minnesota, after an MRI exam on Wednesday confirmed a mild strain of the star guard\u2019s left hamstring.",
      "The Warriors said Curry would be sidelined at least a week after the injury Tuesday night forced him out early in second quarter of Game 1, which they went on to win 99-88. He had 13 points in 13 minutes to help Golden State build a comfortable lead and take home-court advantage away from the Timberwolves.",
      "Game 2 is in Minneapolis on Thursday, before the series moves west to San Francisco for Game 3 on Saturday and Game 4 on Monday. The earliest return for Curry appears to be Game 5 on May 14, which is conveniently followed by three straight off days before Game 6 on May 18.",
      "Curry missed multiple games because of injuries during the 2016 and 2018 playoffs, absences the Warriors endured on their way to the NBA Finals. They lost to Cleveland in seven games for the 2016 championship, and they swept the Cavaliers in 2018 for a third title in four years.",
      "This Golden State roster hardly stacks up to those predecessors, however, when Curry and Draymond Green were much younger and other standouts like Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala were integral to their success. In 2018, they had Kevin Durant, too.",
      "For now, the Warriors were feeling good about the all-hands-on-deck effort led by Jimmy Butler, Buddy Hield and Green in Game 1, in which coach Steve Kerr played 12 different players.",

      "Woll was solid off the bench and held off the Panthers late in a nail-biting 5-4 victory Monday for Toronto, stopping 17 of 20 shots as Florida rallied after trailing 4-1 through 40 minutes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to get just thrown into fire like that,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be prepared and ready to go. A lot of confidence in him.\u201d",
      "Stolarz, who also took a shot off his mask early in Game 1, was briefly able to continue following the collision with Bennett \u2014 a bruising center and former teammate from last season\u2019s Stanley Cup-winning Panthers roster \u2014 before he vomited into Toronto\u2019s bench a few minutes later and headed to the locker room.",

      "PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Steelers have run out patience with wide receiver George Pickens, agreeing Wednesday on a trade that sends the talented but mercurial 24-year-old to the Dallas Cowboys.",
      "The Steelers will get a third-round pick in the 2026 draft and a fifth-rounder in 2027. The Cowboys get a sixth-round choice in two years.",
      "The trade was first reported by ESPN.",
      "Pickens is about to enter the final year of the rookie deal he signed in 2022 when the Steelers took the former Georgia star in the second round. The 6-foot-3, 200-pound Pickens has spent his first three seasons in the NFL being equal parts productive and petulant, mixing highlight-reel catches with bouts of immaturity along the way.",
      "Pickens joins a Cowboys offense that could use another downfield threat to pair with star CeeDee Lamb. Dallas\u2019 second-leading pass catcher behind Lamb last year was tight end Jake Ferguson, with Jalen Tolbert\u2019s modest 49 receptions a distant third.",
      "Dallas didn't address the need for a No. 2 receiver in the draft, with first-year coach Brian Schottenheimer saying he liked the youth that was already on the roster. Owner and general manager Jerry Jones made reference before the draft to \u201csubstantive\u201d trades the Cowboys were pursuing. This qualifies as one.",
      "The Steelers, particularly head coach Mike Tomlin, frequently backed Pickens as he endured what the team frequently described as a version of growing pains while he adjusted to life in the NFL.",
      "Pickens has been one of the most dynamic receivers in the league when he's on the field and engaged, which is not always a given. Pickens led the league by averaging 18.1 yards per catch in 2023 and has 174 receptions for 2,841 yards and 12 scores in 48 games.",
      "Yet he's also consistently struggled to keep his emotions in check. Last season alone he twice ended games by getting into dust-ups with opposing defensive backs, first when he grabbed Dallas' Jourdan Lewis by the facemask and then when he tussled with Cleveland's Greg Newsome II rather than try to get in position for a last-second Hail Mary.",
      "That doesn't include a fine for using an expletive on his eye black against the Cowboys, a rule he said he was unaware of at the time. Pickens also drew widespread criticism in 2023 for what could generously be described as inattentive downfield blocking for his teammates.",
      "Considering his volatility, the Steelers didn't seem interested in signing Pickens to a contract extension and he became expendable when they traded for two-time Pro Bowler DK Metcalf in March, whom they promptly signed to a five-year contract.",

      "Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty is not running in the Preakness Stakes and that means for a fifth time in the past seven years there is no chance of a Triple Crown champion going into the race",
      "Just a few days after winning the Kentucky Derby, Sovereignty was ruled out of running in the Preakness Stakes.",
      "It is the second time in four years the owner and trainer of the Derby champion opted to skip the Preakness in favor of the Belmont Stakes in June. Rich Strike also bypassed the Preakness in 2022 after winning at Churchill Downs at odds of 80-1.",
      "Country House did not run in 2019 because of illness after getting elevated to Derby winner when Maximum Security was disqualified for interference, the races were run out of order in 2020 and Medina Spirit ran and finished third in the 2021 Preakness after being DQed from his first-place finish in the Derby for a positive drug test.",
      "That means this is the fifth time in seven years that the Preakness gates open at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore without even a chance at a Triple Crown. That was only the case once in the previous 33 years from to 1986-2018, and that happened because a horse was retired because of injury after taking the Run for the Roses.",
      "Horse racing has changed from its heyday, when stars of the sport like War Admiral, Secretariat and Seattle Slew were used to running every couple of weeks. Breeding, money and other factors have changed that, and the top 3-year-old horses eligible for the Triple Crown race far less often, with bigger stretches in between.",
      "\u201cMost trainers hate running their horses back in two weeks,\u201d NBC Sports analyst Randy Moss said. \u201cThey feel like it\u2019s bad for the horses.\u201d",
      "Beginning in the early 21st century, many of the Derby horses who finish between second and 20th started getting more rest to wait five weeks for the Belmont. It was essentially automatic that the Derby winner would go, though not anymore.",
      "\u201cThe trainers of Derby winners that do run back in the Preakness do it out of a sense of tradition \u2014 not because they like it,\u201d Moss said.",
      "Sovereignty's Bill Mott made that clear the morning after his horse passed Journalism down the stretch in the mud at Churchill Downs with a record audience watching, casting doubt on the Preakness.",
      "\u201cWe want to do what\u2019s best for the horse,\u201d Mott told reporters in Louisville, Kentucky, on Sunday. \u201cOf course, you always think about a Triple Crown, and that\u2019s not something we\u2019re not going to think about.\u201d",
      "The debate has been raging for decades about horses not being able to handle the grind of three premier races over a span of five weeks. That was primarily because no one swept the Triple Crown between Affirmed in 1978 and American Pharoah in 2015, a 37-year drought that made industry stakeholders question tradition versus modern-day changes.",
      "Justify doing it in 2018 to give the sport a pair of Triple Crown champions in four years quieted that talk. The recent uncertainty about Derby winners going to the Preakness reignited the chatter.",
      "Prominent owner Mike Repole shared a proposal on social media Tuesday that would move the Belmont up to second in the rotation and shift the Preakness back to provide more spacing. Others have suggested moving the Preakness back to the first Saturday in June and the Belmont to the first Saturday in July.",
      "No one really knows. And does there need to be seismic change like the pitch clock in baseball?",

      "Pending approval, the $2.8 billion House settlement will allow schools to share revenue with athletes directly for use of their name, image and likeness",
      "The $2.8 billion NCAA settlement awaiting final approval from a federal judge is touted as a solution for thousands of athletes to finally get the money they deserve and provide some clarity to recruiting. For some, it may have come too late.",
      "Sophomore distance runner Jake Rimmel says he was one of five walk-ons cut from Virginia Tech\u2019s cross country team after Thanksgiving break. Rimmel decided to take a leave of absence and train independently while considering his next move \u2014 something that\u2019s proven easier said than done.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s got their hands tied right now, so there\u2019s just not many opportunities for me,\u201d Rimmel told The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019ve just been having to bet on myself and trust the process. It\u2019s just been lonely. I\u2019ve been at home training by myself and living with my family again. Thank God for my family and all, I appreciate them. It\u2019s still kind of lonely though, being out of the norm, not being at school and with my friends.\"",
      "Pending approval, the so-called House settlement will allow schools to share revenue with athletes directly for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL). That could secure generational wealth for some but not others, and replacing scholarship caps with roster limitations is expected to leave walk-ons, partial scholarship earners, nonrevenue sport athletes and high school recruits at risk. There are deep concerns about the potential impact on sports that feed the U.S. Olympic teams.",
      "U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken told attorneys handling the settlement to come back to her with a plan soon to protect athletes currently or recently on rosters at schools across the country, a request seen as a way to soften the blow.",
      "That filing came late Wednesday, with attorneys saying schools must offer athletes who lost their spots a chance to play \u2014 at their old school or their new school \u2014 without counting against the roster limits for as long as they have eligibility.",
      "There is no guarantee those athletes will win a spot on the roster and, for now, thousands of athletes like Rimmel have no idea where they might be this fall or are in jeopardy of no longer playing college sports at all. And many athletes balancing school and their sport are unaware of what\u2019s at stake and have more questions than answers.",
      "Belmont track and field athlete Sabrina Oostburg said everything she knows about the settlement is from personal research.",
      "\u201cMy school doesn\u2019t do a lot of education around it (the settlement). Every now and then, we\u2019ll be told, \u2018Hey, if you want to sign up to potentially get some money from this House settlement that\u2019s happening, you can do that,\u2019\u201d Oostburg said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the education we\u2019re being given is optional to consume, even though it\u2019s limited.\u201d",
      "Oostburg is used to taking matters into her own hands, securing over 50 NIL deals by herself. She has contacted lawyers and asked for updates on the settlement, but she\u2019s not quite reassured. The chaotic nature of college athletics, so obvious to the public, is even worse for the athletes themselves.",
      "\u201cBeing a college athlete, it\u2019s so hard to stay up to date with what\u2019s happening every day because it\u2019s so constantly changing,\u201d she said.",
      "Smaller, nonrevenue-generating programs don\u2019t often have a point person to navigate NIL deals or educate athletes. At Belmont, Oostburg said, NIL-related responsibilities are managed by an already busy compliance office.",
      "\u201cTo take time to learn about what\u2019s happening is just so time-consuming, especially if you\u2019re not in that one percent or one of the football players where they have people dedicated to helping them stay up to date,\u201d she said.",
      "Over the next six weeks, athletes will wrap up their spring semesters and many of them have league tournaments or even NCAA championship competition ahead before what many expect will be the final summer before college sports sees some of the most dramatic changes in history.",
      "For athletes like Rimmel, those changes are already here. On the bright side, his name was among those on an eight-page list of \u201cdesignated student-athletes\u201d released in Wednesday's court filing, meaning he is one of many who will be able to seek a roster spot without counting against a school's roster limit.",
      "Some of the others cut from the Virginia Tech program have given up on their dreams of collegiate running altogether. Rimmel hasn't given up completely; he spoke with his former coach recently, who said the Hokies' athletics department is still trying to figure out what\u2019s to come.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still kind of hoping I might be able to find my way back there next fall,\" he said.",

      "\u201cI look at it like it\u2019s a tremendous privilege to be able to do it,\u201d Presti said at the start of the season when asked about his job. \u201cEventually someone else is going to be the person that\u2019s doing it, and for me, while I\u2019m serving the position, I think I\u2019ve said this in the past, it\u2019s not my job, it\u2019s the Thunder\u2019s job. I\u2019m just serving the position the best that I can and hopefully doing a good job with it for as many people as possible, and I enjoy it.\u201d",
      "Cleveland\u2019s Koby Altman was second with six first-place votes, after the Cavaliers won 64 games and finished atop the Eastern Conference standings.

Pelinka engineered the biggest trade of the season, the one that brought Luka Doncic to the Lakers from the Dallas Mavericks \u2014 but was listed on only five of the 30 ballots cast.",

      "Florida basketball coach Todd Golden has signed a contract extension that raises his annual salary to $6 million",
      "GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- Florida basketball coach Todd Golden has signed a contract extension that raises his annual salary to $6 million, a lucrative bump nearly a month after the Gators won the national championship.",
      "Golden inked a six-year, $40.5 million extension Tuesday night, adding a year to his current deal and putting him under contract through the 2030-31 season. He signed a two-year extension in March 2024 that increased his average salary to $4.1 million annually.",
      "His latest raise is a significant commitment from Florida and puts Golden nearly on par with football coach Billy Napier, who is scheduled to make $7.4 million in 2025.",
      "Golden\u2019s deal pays $6 million a year (beginning April 16, 2025), with a $300,000 pay hike every year after.",
      "The new money makes the 39-year-old Golden the second-highest-paid basketball coach in the Southeastern Conference behind Arkansas\u2019 John Calipari, who earns $8 million annually. Golden, once an assistant under Bruce Pearl at Auburn who got his first head coaching job at San Francisco in 2019, previously ranked 12th out of 16 coaches in the league.",
      "He now jumps to fifth among the seven active coaches with national titles, behind Bill Self of Kansas, Calipari, UConn\u2019s Dan Hurley and Michigan State\u2019s Tom Izzo.",
      "Golden\u2019s new deal is nearly fully guaranteed. Florida would owe him 85% of the remaining value if the school fired him without cause at any point.",
      "Golden\u2019s buyout to leave Gainesville starts at $16 million next season and drops annually: $11 million in 2026-27; $4 million in 2027-28; $3 million in 2028-29; $2 million in 2029-30; and $1 million in 2030-31.",
      "However, Golden can leave for the NBA at a much lower price. His NBA buyout begins at $3 million next season and drops to $2 million (2026-28) and then $1 million in 2028-29.",
      "Included in Golden\u2019s annual compensation is a $500,000 signing bonus, a $500,000 annual longevity incentive and a $60,000 annual expense account. In addition to that, he gets $70,000 annually in travel allowance for using the university athletic association\u2019s plane and other fringe benefits valued at $62,000.",
      "He would get a $100,000 bonus for winning the SEC regular-season championship, a $50,000 bonus for winning the SEC Tournament, a $100,000 bonus for making the NCAA Tournament and a $50,000 bonus for every NCAA Tournament victory.",
      "With Golden at the helm for his third season in Gainesville, the Gators finished 36-4 and beat Houston to clinch the program\u2019s third national title. They won their final 12 games, including four in the NCAA Tournament in come-from-behind fashion.",
      "Florida\u2019s style of play under Golden has drawn rave reviews, leading to sellouts in eight of the team\u2019s last 10 home games. Florida averaged 84.8 points a game this season after setting the program record (85.6) during the 2023-24 campaign.",
      "Golden became the third coach this century to win a national title within his first three seasons on the job, joining North Carolina\u2019s Roy Williams (2005) and UConn\u2019s Kevin Ollie (2014). Williams and Ollie accomplished the feat in their second seasons.",
      "Golden has a modest rebuild on his hands now. Leading scorer Walter Clayton, the Final Four\u2019s Most Outstanding Player, is headed to the NBA along with fellow guards Alijah Martin and Will Richard. Forwards Alex Condon and Rueben Chinyelu are going through the NBA draft process with the potential to stay in school and return for next season.",
      "Backup guard Denzel Aberdeen (Kentucky) and backup forward Sam Alexis (Indiana) transferred, and assistant coaches Kevin Hovde (Columbia) and John Andrzejek (Campbell) took head coaching jobs.",
      "Golden signed two guards out of the transfer portal \u2014 Princeton\u2019s Xaivian Lee and Ohio\u2019s AJ Brown \u2014 and have swingman CJ Ingram and guard Alex Lloyd joining the team as incoming freshmen.",

      "WASHINGTON -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and executives from Microsoft and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices testified on Capitol Hill about the biggest opportunities, risks and needs facing an industry which lawmakers and technologists agree could fundamentally transform global business, culture and geopolitics.",
      "The hearing comes as the race to control the future of artificial intelligence is heating up between companies and countries. Altman's OpenAI is in a furious race to develop the best artificial intelligence model against tech rivals like Alphabet and Meta, as well as against those developed by Chinese competitors.",
      "\u201cI believe this will be at least as big as the internet, maybe bigger,\u201d Altman said in his opening remarks about AI\u2019s potential to transform society. \u201cFor that to happen, investment in infrastructure is critical.\u201d Altman urged senators to help usher in the \u201cdual revolutions\u201d of artificial intelligence and energy production that \u201cwill change the world we live in, I think, in incredibly positive ways.\u201d",
      "The witnesses included Altman; Lisa Su, chief executive of semiconductor maker AMD; Michael Intrator, co-founder of AI cloud computing startup CoreWeave; and Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft. They four executives unanimously urged lawmakers to help streamline policy for AI-related projects and fundraising.",
      "The hearing spanned topics ranging from industry debates over chip performance, jobs, human relationships and power generation to grander questions about the global competition with China and the European Union.",
      "\u201cChina aims to lead the world in AI by 2030,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz, chair of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. \u201cIn this race, the United States is facing a fork in the road. Do we go down the path that embraces our history of entrepreneurial freedom and technological innovation? Or do we adopt the command and control policies of Europe?\u201d",
      "Senators were broadly sober in their questioning and united in their concern that the U.S. maintain its dominance in artificial intelligence. Lawmakers from both parties also raised concerns over cybersecurity, data privacy and AI's ability to create content that could confuse or mislead people.",
      "Some partisan fighting did arise. Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican, pressed Su and Smith on whether the Biden administration\u2019s sustainable energy policies hindered the goal of producing more power for AI-related infrastructure.",
      "And Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, criticized cuts by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk to federal funding for research and to agencies like the Energy Department\u2019s national laboratories and National Science Foundation, painting them as \u201ca self sabotaging attack.\u201d",
      "\u201cDoes anyone truly have confidence that had DOGE been around decades ago, they would not have cut the project that created the internet as an example of wasteful, publicly funded research and development?\u201d asked Duckworth.",
      "But despite some barbs, the hearing maintained a low-key tenor and some bipartisan joking as lawmakers and executives discussed the potential of a technology all present agreed would determine humanity's future.",
      "\u201cLook, there is a race, but we need to understand what we\u2019re racing for,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, told the witnesses. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a sort of commercial race, so we can edge out our nearest competitor in the public sector or the private sector. We\u2019re trying to win a race so that American values prevail.\u201d",
      "Several of the executives warned against U.S. export controls that could end up pushing other countries toward China\u2019s AI technology.",
      "\u201cWe totally understand as an industry the importance of national security,\u201d Su said. But she added, if not able to \u201chave our technology adopted in the rest of the world, there will be other technologies that will come to play.\u201d Those technologies are less advanced today but will mature over time, she said.",
      "Altman drew a direct connection between the United State's ability to attract global talent and ability to sell its products globally to national security and its international influence.",
      "\u201cThe leverage and the power the U.S. gets from having iPhones be the mobile device people most want, and Google being the search engine that people most want around the world is huge,\u201d Altman said. \u201cWe talk maybe less about how much people want to use chips and other infrastructure developed here, but I think it\u2019s no less important, and we should aim to have the entire U.S. stack be adopted by as much of the world as possible.\u201d",
      "Trade rivalry between the U.S. and China has been weighing heavily on the AI industry, including California-based chipmakers Nvidia and AMD.",
      "The Trump administration announced in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips and AMD\u2019s MI308 chips to China.",
      "Nvidia has said the tighter export controls will cost the company an extra $5.5 billion. AMD said after reporting its quarterly earnings this week that it will cost the firm $1.5 billion in lost revenue over the coming months.",
      "Still uncertain are the effects on additional AI chip controls set by former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that are set to take effect next week targeting more than 100 countries. The policy drew strong opposition from Nvidia and other tech companies, while it was supported by others, including AI company Anthropic, as a way to prevent China\u2019s \u201csophisticated smuggling operations\u201d to obtain chips from shell companies in third countries.",
      "The Commerce Department said in an email Thursday that Trump plans to replace Biden\u2019s \u201coverly complex, overly bureaucratic\u201d rule with a simpler one but didn\u2019t say when.",
      "The day before the hearing, Altman visited the Abilene, Texas, site of the massive Stargate data center project being built for OpenAI in collaboration with Oracle and other partners. The site was chosen for its potential access to a variety of energy resources, including wind and solar power.",
      "Altman, during the hearing, said that Texas had been \u201cunbelievable\" in incentivizing major AI projects. \u201cI think that would be a good thing for other states to study,\u201d Altman said. He predicted that the Abilene site would be the \u201clargest AI training facility in the world.\u201d",
      "But Altman also later cautioned against a patchwork regulatory framework for AI.",
      "\u201cIt is very difficult to imagine us figuring out how to comply with 50 different sets of regulations,\u201d said Altman. \u201cOne federal framework that is light touch, that we can understand, and it lets us move with the speed that this moment calls for, seems important and fine.\u201d",
      "While the tech industry has long relied on data centers to run online services, from email and social media to financial transactions, new AI technology behind popular chatbots and generative AI tools requires even more powerful computation to build and operate.",
      "A report released by the Department of Energy late last year estimated that the electricity needed for data centers in the U.S. tripled over the past decade and is projected to double or triple again by 2028 when it could consume up to 12% of the nation\u2019s electricity.",

      "New experiments show eggs are less likely to crack when they fall on their side",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Eggs are less likely to crack when they fall on their side, according to experiments with over 200 eggs.",
      "What does this mean for the best way to crack an egg for breakfast? Not much, since a break around the middle is the best way to get the golden yolk and runny whites to ooze out.",
      "But scientists said it could help with hard-boiling eggs in a pot: Dropping eggs in horizontally may be less likely to cause a stray crack that can unleash the egg's insides in a puffy, cloudy mess.",
      "It's commonly thought that eggs are strongest at their ends \u2014 after all, it's how they're packaged in the carton. The thinking is that the arc-shaped bottom of an egg redirects the force and softens the blow of impact.",
      "But when scientists squeezed eggs in both directions during a compression test, they cracked under the same amount of force.",
      "\u201cThe fun started when we thought we would get one result and then we saw another,\u201d said Hudson Borja da Rocha with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who helped run the experiments.",
      "The researchers also ran simulations and dropped eggs horizontally and vertically from three short heights up to 0.4 inches (10 millimeters).",
      "The egg result? The ones dropped horizontally cracked less .",
      "\u201cThe common sense is that the egg in the vertical direction is stronger than if you lay the egg down. But they proved that's not the case,\u201d said materials scientist Marc Meyers with the University of California, San Diego who was not involved with the new study.",
      "Scientists found that the egg's equator was more flexible and absorbed more of the energy of the fall before cracking. The findings were published Thursday in the journal Communications Physics.",
      "Eggs are also usually nestled top-down into homemade contraptions for egg drop challenges as part of school STEM projects, which partially inspired the new study. It's not yet clear whether the new results will help protect these vulnerable eggs, which are dropped at much loftier heights.",
      "It's a bit counterintuitive that the oblong side of an egg could hold up better against a tumble, said study co-author Tal Cohen with Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",

      "More than a dozen states are suing the Trump administration for withholding funds from for the buildout of electric vehicle chargers across the U.S. The federal lawsuit says $5 billion allocated to states under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law signed ...",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Seventeen states are suing President Donald Trump 's administration for withholding billions of dollars for building more electric vehicle chargers, according to a federal lawsuit announced Wednesday.",
      "The Trump administration in February directed states to stop spending money for electric vehicle charging infrastructure that was allocated under President Joe Biden \u2014 part of a broader push by the Republican president to roll back environmental policies advanced by his Democratic predecessor. The EV charger program was set to allocate $5 billion over five years to various states, of which an estimated $3.3 billion had already been made available.",
      "The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California, Colorado and Washington, and challenges the Federal Highway Administration's authority to halt the funding. They argue Congress, which approved the money in 2021 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, holds that authority.",
      "\"These funds were going to be used to shape the future of transportation,\u201d California Attorney General Rob Bonta said, calling it \u201cshort-sighted\u201d of Trump to revoke the funds.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t sit back while the Trump administration violates the law,\u201d Bonta, a Democrat, said.",
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "EVs stood at about 8% of new car sales in the U.S. last year, according to Motorintelligence.com, a sign the market is growing \u2014 although the pace has slowed as the auto industry tries to convince mainstream buyers about going electric. The program was meant to assuage some concerns and build infrastructure along highway corridors first, then address gaps elsewhere once the state highway obligations were met.",
      "Some states with projects running under the program have already been reimbursed by the Biden-era federal funds. Others are still contracting for their sites. Still more had halted their plans by the time the Trump administration ordered states to stop their spending. Regardless, getting these chargers installed and operating has been a slow process with contracting challenges, permitting delays and complex electrical upgrades.",
      "It was expected that states would fight against the federal government\u2019s efforts to slow the nation\u2019s electric vehicle charger buildout. New York, for example, which is part of the suit, has been awarded over $175 million in federal funds from the program, and state officials say $120 million is currently being withheld by the Trump administration.",
      "Even the electric carmaker Tesla, run by Elon Musk, who has spearheaded Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency efforts to cut federal spending, benefited greatly from funding under the program, receiving millions of dollars to expand its already-massive footprint of chargers in the U.S.",
      "Despite threats to the program, experts have said they expect the nation\u2019s EV charging buildout to continue as automakers look to make good on massive electrification ambitions.",
      "Consumers thinking about buying an EV often cite concerns about the availability of charging infrastructure. It's a hurdle for people living in multifamily dwellings and in rural areas, or what are otherwise known as \u201ccharging deserts.\u201d It's also a problem for people who can't find a place to charge their vehicle near their work, or who often drive longer highway routes.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said withholding the funds was illegal and would kill thousands of U.S. jobs, ceding them to China.",
      "\"Instead of hawking Teslas on the White House lawn, President Trump could actually help Elon \u2014 and the nation \u2014 by following the law and releasing this bipartisan funding,\u201d Newsom said, referencing Trump's recent purchase of a Tesla in a show of support for Musk.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s effort to withdraw funding for electric vehicle chargers is part of a broader push to roll back environmental policies advanced under Biden.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first week back in office, he signed executive orders to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement again, reverse a 2030 target for electric vehicles to make up half of new cars sold, and end environmental justice efforts. At the same time, federal agencies under Trump have rolled back key rules and regulations and supported the build-out of the fossil fuel industry.",
      "The U.S. House also advanced proposals last week aimed at blocking California from enforcing vehicle-emission rules, including a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. The Senate parliamentarian says the California policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.",

      "The seal survived the March attack in a cove in the small town of Neskowin, which sits along the Pacific Ocean, NOAA said Monday. The administration\u2019s marine stranding team was able to help the animal relocate after monitoring and evaluating it.",
      "The agency's law enforcement office, which is investigating the attack, was searching for a \u201cperson of interest\u201d spotted by a witness. Officials were also looking for the owner of a vehicle seen in a parking lot near the cove behind a condominium building that may be connected with the Sunday evening attack, according to NOAA.",
      "Officials are asking anyone with information on the person of interest, vehicle owner or attack to call NOAA's enforcement hotline.",
      "In the spring and summer, juvenile elephant seals will often drag themselves onto Oregon's beaches to spend weeks shedding their hair and skin, according to Oregon State University's Marine Mammal Institute. Adult elephant seals are rarely seen in the state.",
      "The federal Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibits harassing, harming, killing or feeding wild elephant seals and other marine mammals. Violators can face criminal penalties of up to $100,000 in fines and up to 1 year in jail.",

      "A new study out in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment finds that wildfires fueled by climate change are linked to as many as thousands of annual deaths and billions of dollars in economic burden",
      "Wildfires driven by climate change contribute to as many as thousands of annual deaths and billions of dollars in economic costs from wildfire smoke in the United States, according to a new study.",
      "The paper, published Friday in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment, found that from 2006 to 2020, climate change contributed to about 15,000 deaths from exposure to small particulate matter from wildfires and cost about $160 billion. The annual range of deaths was 130 to 5,100, the study showed, with the highest in states such as Oregon and California.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot more of these wildfire smoke events,\u201d said Nicholas Nassikas, a study author and a physician and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. So he and multidisciplinary team of researchers wanted to know: \"What does it really mean in a changing environment for things like mortality, which is kind of the worst possible health outcome?\u201d",
      "Lisa Thompson, a professor at Emory University who studies air pollution and climate change and was not involved in the paper, said it is one of the first studies she has seen to isolate the effect of climate change on mortality. Looking at the impacts across time and space also made it unique, she said.",
      "The paper's researchers focused on deaths linked to exposure to fine particulate matter, or PM2.5 \u2014 the main concern from wildfire smoke.",
      "These particles can lodge deep into lungs and trigger coughing and itchy eyes with short-term exposure. But longer term they can make existing health problems worse and lead to a range of chronic and deadly health issues. Children, pregnant people, the elderly and outdoor workers are among the most vulnerable. The Health Effects Institute estimated the pollutant caused 4 million deaths worldwide.",
      "Evidence is emerging that PM2.5 from wildfire smoke is more toxic than other pollution sources. When wildfires encroach into cities, burning cars and other toxics-containing materials, it adds to the danger.",
      "Numerous studies have tied human-caused climate change \u2014 caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas \u2014 to a growth in fires in North America. Global warming is increasing drought, especially in the West, and other extreme weather. Drier conditions suck moisture from plants, which act as fuel for fires. When drier vegetation and seasons are mixed with hotter temperatures, that increases the frequency, extent and severity of wildfires and the smoke they spew.",
      "Jacob Bendix, professor emeritus of geography and environment at Syracuse University, said he was \u201cdismayed\u201d by the findings but not surprised.",
      "\u201c(T) hese numbers are really significant. I think there\u2019s a tendency for people outside of the areas actually burning to see increasing fires as a distant inconvenience \u2026 This study drives home how far-reaching the impacts are,\u201d said Bendix in an email. He wasn't involved in the study.",
      "The study\u2019s authors drew on modeled and existing data to reach their findings. First, they sought to understand how much area burned by wildfires was attributable to climate change. They did that by analyzing the real climate conditions \u2014 heat and rain, for instance \u2014 when wildfires erupted from 2006 to 2020, and compared that to a scenario where weather measurements would be different without climate change.",
      "From there, they estimated the levels of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke tied to climate change using the same approach. Lastly, integrating the current understanding of how particulate matter affects mortality based on published research, they quantified the number of deaths related to PM2.5 from wildfires and calculated their economic impact.",
      "This framework showed that of 164,000 deaths related to wildfire-PM2.5 exposure from 2006 to 2020, 10% were attributable to climate change. The mortalities were 30% to 50% higher in some western states and counties.",
      "Marshall Burke, global environmental policy professor at Stanford University, said the evidence linking climate change to burned areas was \u201crock solid,\u201d but the subsequent steps were harder.",
      "\u201cLinking burned area to smoke is trickier because you never know exactly which way the wind\u2019s going to blow,\u201d he said, and he wondered how the death estimates compared to fatalities tied to general air pollution.",
      "Still, their approach was sensible and reasonable, Burke said.",
      "Johns Hopkins University lecturer in climate and energy policy Patrick Brown said he had some concerns about the study. One was conceptual. The study acknowledges the power non-climate drivers have on wildfires, but it doesn't give them proper weight, he said in an email.",
      "Brown, who was not involved in the study, worries decision-makers could wrongly conclude that mitigating planet-warming carbon emissions is the only solution. \u201cYet in many regions, the more immediate life\u2011saving action may be fuel breaks, prescribed burns, ignition\u2011source regulation, public health efforts, etc.,\u201d he said.",
      "Land management practices such as prescribed burns can reduce wildfire fuel, Nassikas said. But ultimately, the study notes, the problem of deaths from wildfire smoke will only get worse without the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\u201cPart of the study is raising awareness,\" he said. \u201cAnd then once we kind of understand that \u2026 now what are the interventions that we can deploy at a personal level, at a community level, and then obviously at a larger level across the country and across the world?\u201d",

      "Skype users are scrambling to find an alternative after Microsoft shut down the pioneering internet phone service which let people make cheap long distance calls and chat with other users",
      "LONDON -- Skype is dead. What now?",
      "Microsoft's shutdown of Skype on May 5 sent millions of users scrambling to find an alternative to the pioneering internet phone service.",
      "Skype, which Microsoft bought in 2011, was beloved by a dwindling group of users who appreciated how it let them make cheap long-distance calls as well as communicate with other users through chat messages, voice or video calls.",
      "Some liked its simplicity and ease of use \u2014 an advantage, for example, when setting up a communications app for an elderly parent living far away.",
      "Or they just used it out of habit.",
      "Skype was founded in 2003 and was among the first in a wave of communication services that used voice over internet protocol technology (VoIP), which converts audio into a digital signal.",
      "Skype's disappearance also inconveniences Americans and other expatriates living overseas who signed up because they needed an U.S.-based number to receive text authentication codes from, say, a bank back home. It was also handy for calling 800 numbers for free even if you weren't living in North America.",
      "Here is a guide for life after Skype:",
      "Microsoft announced in late February that it was shutting down Skype on May 5 and shifting some of its services to Microsoft Teams, its flagship office videoconferencing and group collaboration platform.",
      "Skype users can use their existing accounts to log into Teams and have the option to automatically migrate their contacts and chats.",
      "If you had a Skype number or a calling subscription, it stopped automatically renewing on April 3.",
      "If your account still has credit, you can access Skype's dial pad from the web portal or Teams to make calls.",
      "Skype numbers won't immediately expire on May 5 so you'll still be able to receive calls until your subscription expires. But you'll have to use Teams or keep the Skype dial pad open on the web portal to receive them.",
      "If your Skype number hasn't expired and you don't want to lose it, you should transfer it to another provider.",
      "Skype numbers can be ported to a phone carrier or any number of other VoIP services. But you'll have to start the process through the new provider, not Skype.",
      "Google users can access the online search giant's internet phone service to make calls from a smartphone or a desktop web browser. You can get your own Google Voice phone number and use features like call forwarding and voicemail. Or you can port your number from another service like Skype, but it will cost $20.",
      "Calls to U.S., Canadian or Puerto Rican numbers are free. Rates for other countries vary.",
      "The free version of Google Voice is only available to U.S. residents physically located in the 48 contiguous states, so that means expatriate Americans can only use it if they registered before they moved overseas.",
      "\u201cYou cannot sign up for a Google Voice number while outside the USA,\u201d according to a help page. \u201cDo not try to circumvent this by using a VPN.\u201d",
      "Owned by Japan's Rakuten, Viber was long considered one of the closest competitors to Skype. One key difference is that Skype users don't need a phone number and are identified by their usernames, while Viber users need a number to register for service.",
      "Similar to Skype, Viber users can buy credit or packages to call phone numbers around the world but it's no longer possible to get a Viber number to receive calls.",
      "The videoconferencing service that\u2019s become a byword for online company meetings offers a calling service, Zoom Phone, and features like number porting and the ability to send and receive SMS text messages.",
      "Take note that Zoom Phone isn't free. There are various calling plans that involve a monthly subscription cost and extra fees for international calls.",
      "Microsoft users have the option of making calls on Teams, dubbed Teams Phone. Like Zoom Phone, you'll need to buy a subscription and pay extra for international calls.",
      "But it's not an option for regular people because Microsoft says Teams Phone isn't for consumer use and is only available to small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "If you absolutely need a U.S. number but live overseas, sign up for service with a low-cost virtual wireless carrier that offers cheap cellphone plans or pay-as-you-go rates.",
      "One provider, Tello, offers monthly plans for as little as $5 and says users can activate its service even if they're living outside the U.S.",
      "Because mobile virtual network operators like Tello are essentially wireless phone companies that piggyback off a bigger carrier's physical network, you can't use it to make calls on a computer or an app.",
      "There are a slew of Skype pretenders offering phone calls over the internet, such as Zoiper, VoIP.ms, CallCentric, Mytello, and Virtual Landline. Many are aimed at business users.",
      "Some are capitalizing on Skype\u2019s disappearance. Hushed, which started as an anonymous calling app, bills itself as a Skype alternative. Users can buy a phone number from the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom or Puerto Rico or port their own number.",
      "It warns that some of its numbers aren't guaranteed to work with third-party verification text messages.",
      "\u201cWe do not intentionally block anyone from receiving these codes, but it\u2019s common that some services will prevent verification texts from being sent to certain phone numbers due to their own security policies,\" Hushed says on its website.",
      "Maybe you can't decide which calling service you want to switch to. If you want to save your current number, there are services to just park your number like NumberBarn.com and Parkmyphone.com.",
      "They let you store a phone number for a monthly fee while relaying any text messages sent to that number. You can port the number to another service whenever you want.",
      "Beware, you can only port in U.S. or Canadian phone numbers.",
      "What about an international eSIM? They're the virtual version of the mobile phone SIM card that you can buy and add to your phone when you're on a trip to save on roaming fees.",
      "They offer cheap data access rates so you can use the internet without worrying about racking up a huge bill when you get home.",
      "Unfortunately, you can't port a Skype number to an international eSIM because of \u201cthe fundamental differences\" between VoIP services and traditional mobile networks, said Pedro Maiquez, co-founder of eSIM provider Holafly. \u201cSkype numbers are not tied to a mobile carrier\u2019s physical infrastructure, making them incompatible with mobile eSIM solutions.\"",

      "The U.S. Justice Department is doubling down on its attempt to break up Google by asking it to give up the underlying technology powering the company\u2019s digital ad network",
      "The U.S. Justice Department is doubling down on its attempt to break up Google by asking it to give up the underlying technology powering the company's digital ad network. The proposed remedy joins a separate federal effort to separate the Chrome browser from its dominant search engine.",
      "The government's latest proposal was filed late Monday in a Virginia federal court two-and-half weeks after a federal judge ruled that parts of its lucrative digital ad network have been improperly abusing its market power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers.",
      "In a 17-page filing, Justice Department lawyers argued that U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema should punish Google by ordering the company to offload its AdX business and DFP ad platform, tools that bring together advertisers, who want to market their products, and publishers, who want to sell commercial space on their sites, to bring in revenue.",
      "Not surprisingly, it's an idea that Google vehemently plans to oppose when the penalty phase of the antitrust case \u2014known as remedy hearings \u2014 begins in late September. Google already has vowed to appeal Brinkema's ruling that the technology powering the ad network has been breaking the law, but can't do that until the judge rules on its punishment in a decision expected late this year or early next year.",
      "Google said in its own filing Monday that divestiture of AdX and DFP wouldn\u2019t be technically feasible because neither piece of technology is capable of working outside of Google's proprietary infrastructure. The company proposed its own remedies to restore competition, and reiterated its intent to appeal the ruling.",
      "\u201cDivestiture is not as simple as selling either the AdX or DFP source code to a willing buyer,\u201d Google wrote.",
      "The attempt to tear down Google's ad network comes on top of the Justice Department's ongoing effort to have the company part with its popular Chrome browser and impose other restrictions to curtail the power of its ubiquitous search engine, which another federal judge branded an illegal monopoly in a ruling last August.",
      "The remedy hearings in the search case are scheduled to conclude later this month, with a ruling from U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta expected by Labor Day.",
      "If the Justice Department is able to persuade the two different judges to order its proposed dismantling of Google, it would be the biggest breakup of a U.S. company since AT&T was forced to spin off its phone service into seven separate regional companies more than 40 years ago.",
      "Google's Play Store for apps running on its Android software that powers most of the world's smartphones also was declared an illegal monopoly by a federal jury in 2023 and is battling a judge's order that would require it to overhaul a commission system that generates billions of dollars in annual revenue.",
      "But hobbling its search engine and digital ad network would be far bigger blows because they are the key cogs in a business that generated $265 billion in revenue last year.",
      "Google is confronting the breakup threats at the same time the advent of artificial intelligence is changing the way consumers are using technology and seeking information online \u2014 a shift that could also siphon traffic and money away from a powerhouse that began in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Despite the adversity, Google is still delivering robust financial growth to its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., which is currently valued at $2 trillion.",

      "The app is integrated with Greece\u2019s government services platform, already widely used to pay taxes, navigate bureaucracy, and even buy soccer tickets, and works with existing digital ID systems for adults.",
      "Parents will log in using their online tax identification credentials.",
      "The general age of digital consent has been set at 15, and officials have invited major digital platforms to collaborate on the rollout.",
      "\u201cDear platforms, we ask for your cooperation so that together we can protect children at a vulnerable age,\u201d Papastergiou said.",
      "Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis voiced support for the initiative, expressing concern over technology\u2019s impact on family life. \u201cYou see families in restaurants where parents and children are all on their phones, and you wonder when they actually talk to each other,\u201d he said.",
      "A 2024 survey by Greek research organization KMOP found that 76.6% of children aged 9\u201312 have internet access via personal devices, 58.6% use social media daily, and 22.8% have encountered inappropriate content.",
      "The app\u2019s launch is part of a broader set of government measures aimed at curbing youth violence and aligns with EU plans to strengthen online protections for minors.",

    "summary": "Judges in several states may soon get a new tool to stop dangerous drivers from speeding again",
    "story": [
      "Judges in several states may soon get a new tool to stop dangerous drivers from speeding again",
      "A teenager who admitted being \u201caddicted to speed\u201d behind the wheel had totaled two other cars in the year before he slammed into a minivan at 112 mph (180 kph) in a Seattle suburb, killing the driver and three of the five children she was transporting for a homeschool co-op.",
      "After sentencing Chase Daniel Jones last month to more than 17 years in prison, the judge tacked on a novel condition should he drive again: His vehicle must be equipped with a device that prevents accelerating far beyond the speed limit.",
      "Virginia this year became the first state to give its judges such a tool to deal with the most dangerous drivers on the road. Washington, D.C., already is using it and similar measures await governors' signatures in Washington state and Georgia. New York and California also could soon tap the GPS-based technology to help combat a recent national spike in traffic deaths.",
      "\u201cIt's a horror no one should have to experience,\u201d said Amy Cohen, who founded the victims' advocacy group Families for Safe Streets after her 12-year-old son, Sammy Cohen Eckstein, was killed by a speeding driver in front of their New York home more than a decade ago.",
      "Andrea Hudson, 38, the minivan driver who was killed when Jones ran a red light, was building a backyard greenhouse with her husband to help educate several kids who shuttle between homes during the school day, her father, Ted Smith, said.",
      "Also killed in the March 2024 crash near Hudson's home in Renton, Washington, were Boyd \u201cBuster\u201d Brown and Eloise Wilcoxson, both 12, and Matilda Wilcoxson, 13. Hudson's two children were sitting on the passenger side and survived, but they spent weeks in a hospital.",
      "\u201cYou always hear of these horrific accidents, and it\u2019s always far away, you don\u2019t know anybody. But all of a sudden, that\u2019s my daughter,\" Smith said. \u201cThis guy did not swerve or brake. And it was just a missile.\u201d",
      "Smith knew Washington state Rep. Mari Leavitt, who reached out to offer condolences and tell him she was sponsoring legislation to mandate intelligent speed assistance devices as a condition for habitual speeders to get back their suspended licenses.",
      "Leavitt predicts it will have an even more powerful impact than revoking driving privileges, citing studies showing around three-quarters of people who lose their licenses get behind a wheel anyway.",
      "Between 2019 and 2024, the state saw a 200% increase in drivers cited for going at least 50 mph (80 kph) over the speed limit, according to the Washington Traffic Safety Commission.",
      "\u201cI guess I don\u2019t understand why someone is compelled to want to drive that fast,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cBut if they choose to drive that fast with the speed limiter, they can\u2019t. It's going to stop them in their tracks.\u201d",
      "The measure, which Washington legislators passed last month and Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson is expected to soon sign, is called the BEAM Act, using the first letters of the names of the four victims: Buster, Eloise, Andrea and Matilda.",
      "Because Jones, 19, didn't receive a speeding ticket in his two previous crashes, he likely wouldn't have been required to use the speed-limiter ahead of the fatal one. And because it could be 2029 before the law takes effect, the judge's requirement at sentencing only applies to his time on probation after being released from prison, Smith said.",
      "Competing tech companies that joined forces to lobby for ignition interlock requirements for drunken drivers have been working in unison again the last few years to pitch intelligent speed assistance.",
      "Brandy Nannini, chief government affairs officer at one manufacturer, Grapevine, Texas-based Smart Start, said fleet vehicles including school buses in the nation's capital have been trying it out for years.",
      "But it took a lot of refinement before the GPS technology could instantly recognize speed limit changes and compel vehicles with the devices installed to adjust accordingly.",
      "\u201cWe've got a lot more satellites in the sky now,\u201d said Ken Denton, a retired police officer who is the chief compliance officer at Cincinnati-based LifeSafer, part of the coalition of companies.",
      "When court-mandated, the devices would prevent cars from exceeding speed limits or whatever threshold regulators set. An override button allows speeding in emergencies, but states can decide whether to activate it and authorities would be alerted any time the button is pushed.",
      "A more passive version, which beeps to alert drivers when they are going too fast, is required for new cars in the European Union. California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a similar proposal last year, explaining vehicle safety requirements are set by the federal government and he was concerned a patchwork of state laws could stir confusion.",
      "Before Del. Patrick Hope agreed to sponsor the proposal in the Virginia Legislature, he tried out the device in Nannini's car, which was calibrated to not go more than 9 mph (14 kph) over the speed limit.",
      "\u201cThat was my first question: Is it safe?\u201d Hope said.",
      "Not only did he come away convinced it was safe, Hope is now pondering whether to install it on the cars of his three children, all of whom are new drivers.",
      "For those mandated by a court, the price could be hefty: $4 per day and a $100 installation fee. The fee would be reduced for low-income offenders.",
      "Cohen with Families for Safe Streets, which provides support services to the loved ones of crash victims, knows firsthand the kind of impact slowing down speeders can make. A year after her son was struck and killed in front of their New York apartment, another boy was injured in the same spot.",
      "By then, the road's speed limit had been lowered.",
      "\u201cThat boy lived when he was hit, and mine did not,\u201d she said. \"When you are going a few miles slower, there's more time to stop. And when you hit somebody, it's much less likely to be deadly.\u201d",

      "BOSTON -- Fans of the hugely popular video game series Grand Theft Auto will have to wait a little longer to play the latest version.",
      "In a post on X Friday, Rockstar Games said it delayed the launch of Grand Theft Auto VI until May 26, 2026. It apologized for the delay of a game, the release of which has been talked about for several years. It didn't provide any specifics on why the release date has been pushed back from fall of this year.",
      "\u201cWith every game we have released, the goal has been to try and exceed your expectations and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe hope you understand we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.\u201d",
      "Shares of Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar\u2019s parent company, fell Friday by nearly 7%.",
      "Strauss Zelnick, the chairman and CEO for Take-Two Interactive Software, stood by Rockstar in a statement and said it supports the company taking additional time to realize their creative vision. He said it still expects a \u201cgroundbreaking, blockbuster entertainment experience that exceeds audience expectations.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto VI, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence,\u201d Zelnick said in a statement. \"As we continue to release our phenomenal pipeline, we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders.\u201d",
      "Fans of the game reacted to the delay with disappointment but also a shrug -- since it has been suggested the game would be released in 2024 and then this year.",
      "On a Reddit discussion forum dedicated to the game, several fans noted they had seen this before and wouldn't be surprised if the release was delayed again. Others took a more optimistic tone, saying an exact release date means it will actually happen this time around.",
      "One of the last times the game garnered this much buzz was in 2023, when a trailer for the game was leaked online. At the time, Rockstar released the first look of the sixth game 15 hours earlier than planned, citing the leak.",
      "That 90-second trailer gave fans a taste of what comes next for the game. The trailer suggested the next installment would be set in the Miami-inspired Vice City and star a female protagonist, a first for the franchise, named Lucia.",
      "It is unclear whether the delay means any, or all, of these details will remain part of Grand Theft Auto VI.",

      "Trump's White House lawyers were provided the audiotape by the Department of Justice weeks ago, the sources said.",

      "Hur's yearlong probe into Biden's handling of classified documents ended with no criminal charges being recommended because the evidence wasn't sufficient to support a conviction, Hur said. However, the 388-page report Hur released created a political firestorm as the special counsel described Biden as someone who could appear to a jury as an \"elderly man with a poor memory.\"",
      "Hur, in his report, repeatedly pointed to moments from his interview where he said Biden appeared to have trouble remembering the years he served as vice president and when his son Beau died.",

      "On ABC's \"The View,\" Biden blamed sexism and racism against his vice president.",
      "Former President Joe Biden, in a wide-ranging interview on ABC's \"The View\" on Thursday, said he was not surprised by Vice President Kamala Harris' loss in the 2024 presidential election, but not because of her qualifications as a candidate -- instead, pointing to sexism and racism he said had been leveled against her.",
      "\"I wasn't surprised, not because I didn't think the vice president was the most qualified person to be president \u2026 I wasn't surprised because they went the route of -- the sexist route, the whole route,\" Biden said.",
      "He continued: \"I've never seen quite as successful and consistent campaign, undercutting the notion that a woman couldn't lead the country -- and a woman of mixed race.\"",
      "But Biden, separately, said he still thinks he would have beaten Trump if he had stayed in the race.",
      "\"Yeah, he still got seven million fewer votes,\" Biden said of Trump, noting by how much he beat Trump in the 2020 election popular vote.",
      "His comments come after several months out of the spotlight for the former president as he and Democrats look to sort out his role post-presidency. Last month, Biden emerged from private life to deliver a speech on Trump's potential impact on Social Security and made an appearance at Harvard University.",
      "Questions persist on the party's priorities and who may be the best to message and communicate on the Democrats' behalf -- questions that extend to both Biden and Harris.",
      "Biden, for his part, told \"The View\" that he's in the midst of self-reflection -- and, to that end, writing a book.",
      "\"Things are moving along and we're getting squared away trying to figure out what the most significant and consequential role I can play, consistent with what I've done in the past,\" he said.",
      "The former president also addressed his relationship with his former running-made-turned-candidate, saying that he and Harris had spoken as recently as Wednesday. Yet, he quickly stopped himself from addressing specifics of their \"frequent\" conversations, including side-stepping any chatter about Harris' possible gubernatorial or potential presidential ambitions.",
      "Sources have told ABC News previously that Harris may be mulling a run for governor of California, her home state; others have speculated she could mount a run for president in 2028 -- a controversial notion within the Democratic Party.",
      "Many of Harris' longtime national supporters told ABC News in March that they are lukewarm on her potentially running for president in 2028; others have called for a full break from the Biden-Harris administration and for the party to consider new standard bearers.",
      "But on Harris' broader political future, Biden said he was hopeful that she stayed involved in some significant way, but stopped short of sharing which route he hopes she takes.",
      "\"She's got a difficult decision to make about what she's going to do. I hope she stays fully engaged. I think she's first-rate, but we have a lot of really good candidates as well. So, I'm optimistic. I'm not pessimistic,\" Biden said.",
      "Biden's remarks don't seem to have mollified progressives who felt he hamstrung Democrats' chances in 2024. Progressive Change Campaign Committee co-founder Adam Green said in a statement after the interview that the former president is in \"denial\" over both his and Harris' viability as strong candidates on the 2024 ticket, suggesting that anti-establishment Democrats would fare better to lead the party.",
      "\"Joe Biden is in denial about the fact that neither he nor Kamala Harris should have been the 2024 Democratic nominee if we wanted to defeat Donald Trump. In this moment, voters demand authentic anti-establishment figures who will shake up a broken political system and economic status quo rigged for billionaires against working people, and that's not Biden or Harris.\"",
      "Asked on \"The View\" to respond to claims that he should have dropped out of the race and endorse Harris sooner, Biden said that Harris still had a long period to campaign and that they worked together \"in every decision I made.\"",
      "Biden also denied reporting that claimed he had advised Harris to suggest that there was no daylight between the two of them -- saying that they were partners and worked together.",
      "\"The View\" co-anchor Sunny Hostin brought up Harris' comments on \"The View\" in October, toward the end of her presidential campaign, when asked if she would have done \"something differently\" from what Biden had done over the last four years. She responded, \"there is not a thing that comes to mind,\" a moment widely seen as one that hurt her among voters who felt she needed to make a cleaner break from the Biden White House.",
      "\"I did not advise her to say that,\" Biden said, adding that he thought Harris meant she would not change any of the successes that the Biden-Harris White House had achieved.",
      "\"She was part of every success we had. We'd argue like hell, by the way,\" Biden added, stressing that the disagreements were all signs of a positive working relationship.",
      "Even though he indicated no tension between himself and Harris, Biden did not answer directly when asked about tension between him and other longtime supporters, including former President Barack Obama, whose administration he served in as vice president.",
      "Asked about what his relationship with Obama is like now, and how he addresses concerns Obama and others reportedly raised over his ability to serve a second term as president, Biden pivoted to why he got out of the race -- and did not mention Obama.",
      "\"The only reason I got out of the race was because I didn't want to have a divided Democratic Party ... I thought it was better to put the country ahead of my interest, my personal interest,\" Biden said.",
      "Biden did say, in his response, that concerns over his age -- 81 during the campaign -- were valid, but pointed to what he still accomplished at the end of his presidency as evidence against claims he had cognitively declined.",

      "During a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who traveled to El Salvador to meet with Abrego Garcia, asked if the Trump administration would comply with the Supreme Court's decision that the U.S. government must facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, Noem replied that the government is following the law but didn't say yes or no.",
      "\"What I would tell you is that we are following court order,\" Noem shot back. \"Your advocacy for a known terrorist is alarming.\"",
      "Van Hollen said he isn't \"vouching for the man\" but rather due process.",
      "\"I suggest that rather than make these statements here, that you and the Trump administration make them in court under oath,\" he added.",
      "Van Hollen then accused Noem of a political speech, and Noem said she would suggest Van Hollen is an \"advocate\" for victims of illegal crime.",
      "Last month, after Abrego Garcia's family filed a lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the U.S. The Supreme Court affirmed that ruling on April 10.",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., pressed Noem on whether she read the Supreme Court decision, noting that the court ruled 9-0 that the U.S. must facilitate his release.",
      "\"Garcia is a citizen of El Salvador. It is up to the president of El Salvador to make the decision coming back,\" Noem replied. \"It's been a big topic of conversation between all of us. ... The president has been very clear on this issue, as the secretary of state and I have as well. Abrego Garcia is not a citizen of this country and is a dangerous individual.\"",
      "Earlier in the hearing, Murphy blasted Noem, saying, \"Your department is out of control.\"",
      "\"You are spending like you don't have a budget. You're on the verge of running out of money for the fiscal year. You are illegally refusing to spend funds that have been authorized by this congress and appropriated by this committee,\" he said. \"You are brazenly violating the law every hour of every day. You are refusing to allow people showing up at the southern border to apply for asylum. I acknowledge that you don't believe that people should be able to apply for asylum, but you don't get to choose that.\"",
      "He added that DHS will run out of money by July on immigration and argued that the department isn't giving migrants due process.",
      "\"What you are doing both the individuals who have legal rights to stay here, like Kilmar Abrego Garcia or students who are just protesting Trump's policies is immoral, and to follow the theme, it is illegal. You have no right to deport a student visa holder with no due process, simply because they have spoken in a way that offends the president. You can't remove migrants who a court has given humanitarian protection from removal,\" he said.",
      "Noem also noted that the Biden administration let in upward of 20 million people into the country illegally.",
      "Noem was also asked about the Trump administration's plan for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Noem has said she wants to get rid of FEMA and return the funds to the states.",
      "Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.V., asked Noem to \"tread lightly\" on dismantling FEMA, marking the first time a Republican has raised caution about the president's plan to dismantle FEMA. Moore Capito said she is \"concerned\" that there could be issues with small states \"subject to a lot of natural disasters, flooding,\" in providing relief.",
      "\"I think it's [a] vital function, and I'm concerned, if you turn it all over to the states, capacity for the state to really handle this is something that -- so I would ask you to tread lightly,\" she added.",
      "On CISA, she said previously it was operating as the \"ministry of truth\" during the Biden administration and that the Trump administration is returning CISA to accomplish the stated goals of DHS.",
      "\"They were out doing election security missions where censorship and deciding what was truth and what wasn't truth, and we have eliminated those functions within CISA,\" Noem said. \"CISA was created to be an entity that supported small and medium businesses and also critical infrastructure, our electrical grid, our water systems that are vulnerable to hacking attempts and influence from foreign countries but enemies of the United States of America.\"",

      "\u201cNo arrests were made as part of these worksite enforcement operations,\" the statement said.",
      "Multiple sources told ABC News that federal law enforcement officials had visited dozens of restaurants, carry-out spots and bars across several neighborhoods in D.C. -- including U Street, 14th Street, Chinatown, Dupont Circle and Mount Vernon Triangle. The visits spanned a wide range of establishments, from fast-casual spots to fine-dining restaurants and luxury cocktail bars, reflecting the breadth of the operation.",
      "At many restaurants, agents distributed information and pamphlets requesting to see I-9 forms to verify the identities and employment authorizations for all employees dating back to one year ago, sources said, adding that some restaurants were told federal officials would return in three days.",
      "Following Tuesday's visits, some restaurant owners chose to close preemptively.",
      "\"I have heard those reports, I've been getting them all morning. I am disturbed by them,\" Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters on Tuesday. \"It appears that ICE is at restaurants or even in neighborhoods, and it doesn't look like they're targeting criminals. It is disrupting.\"",

      "Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman was meeting recently with representatives from a teachers union when things quickly devolved",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania was meeting last week with representatives from a teachers union in his home state when things quickly devolved.",
      "Before long, Fetterman began repeating himself, shouting and questioning why \u201ceverybody is mad at me,\u201d \u201cwhy does everyone hate me, what did I ever do\u201d and slamming his hands on a desk, according to one person who was briefed on what occurred.",
      "As the meeting deteriorated, a staff member moved to end it and ushered the visitors into the hallway, where she broke down crying. The staffer was comforted by the teachers who were themselves rattled by Fetterman's behavior, according to a second person who was briefed separately on the meeting.",
      "The interaction at Fetterman's Washington office, described to The Associated Press by the two people who spoke about it on the condition of anonymity, came the day before New York Magazine published a story in which former staff and political advisers to Fetterman aired concerns about the senator's mental health.",
      "That story included a 2024 letter, also obtained by the AP, in which Fetterman's one-time chief of staff Adam Jentleson told a neuropsychiatrist who had treated Fetterman for depression that the senator appeared to be off his recovery plan and was exhibiting alarming behavior, including a tendency toward \u201clong, rambling, repetitive and self-centered monologues.\u201d",
      "Asked about the meeting with teachers union representatives, Fetterman said in a statement through his office that they \u201chad a spirited conversation about our collective frustration with the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to our education system.\u201d He also said he \"will always support our teachers, and I will always reject anyone\u2019s attempt to turn Pennsylvania\u2019s public schools into a voucher program.\u201d",
      "Fetterman earlier this week brushed off the New York Magazine story as a \u201cone-source hit piece and some anonymous sources, so there\u2019s nothing new.\u201d Asked by a reporter in a Senate corridor what he would say to people who are concerned about him, Fetterman said: \u201cThey\u2019re not. They\u2019re actually not concerned. It\u2019s a hit piece. There\u2019s no news.\u201d",
      "Reached by telephone, Aaron Chapin, the president of the Pennsylvania State Education Association who was in the meeting with Fetterman, said he didn\u2019t want to discuss what was a private conversation.",
      "The teachers union encounter adds to the questions being raised about Fetterman's mental health and behavior barely three years after he survived a stroke on the 2022 campaign trail that he said almost killed him. That was followed by a bout with depression that landed him in Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for six weeks, barely a month after he was sworn into the Senate.",
      "The scrutiny also comes at a time when Fetterman, now serving third year of his term, is being criticized by many rank-and-file Democrats in his home state for being willing to cooperate with President Donald Trump, amid Democrats' growing alarm over Trump's actions and agenda.",
      "Fetterman \u2014 who has been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, in which the heart muscle becomes weakened and enlarged, and auditory processing disorder, a complication from the stroke \u2014 has talked openly about his struggle with depression and urged people to get help.",
      "In November, he told podcast host Joe Rogan that he had recovered and fended off thoughts of harming himself.",
      "\u201cI was at the point where I was really, you know, in a very dark place. And I stayed in that game and I am staying in front of you right now and having this conversation,\u201d Fetterman said.",
      "But some who have worked closely with Fetterman question whether his recovery is complete.",
      "In the 2024 letter to Dr. David Williamson, Jentleson warned that Fetterman was not seeing his doctors, had pushed out the people who were supposed to help him stay on his recovery plan and might not be taking his prescribed medications. Jentleson also said Fetterman had been driving recklessly and exhibiting paranoia, isolating him from colleagues.",
      "\u201cOverall, over the last nine months or so, John has dismantled the early-warning system we all agreed upon when he was released,\u201d Jentleson wrote. \u201cHe has picked fights with each person involved in that system and used those fights as excuses to push them out and cut them off from any knowledge about his health situation.\u201d",
      "Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where Williamson works, declined to make him available for an interview, citing privacy and confidentiality laws protecting patient medical information.",
      "Fetterman has long been a wild card in the political realm, forging a career largely on his own, independently from the Democratic Party.",
      "As a small-town mayor in Braddock, the plainspoken Fetterman became a minor celebrity for his bare-knuckled progressive politics, his looks \u2014 he\u2019s 6-foot-8 and tattooed with a shaved head \u2014 and his unconventional efforts to put the depressed former steel town back on the map.",
      "He endorsed the insurgent Democrat Bernie Sanders in 2016\u2019s presidential primary and ran from the left against the party-backed Democrat in 2016\u2019s Senate primary. In 2020, when he was lieutenant governor, he became a top surrogate on cable TV news shows for Joe Biden's presidential bid and gathered a national political following that made him a strong small-dollar fundraiser.",
      "Elected to the Senate in 2022, he has made waves with his casual dress \u2014 hoodies and gym shorts \u2014 at work and at formal events and his willingness to chastise other Democrats.",
      "Fetterman returned to the Senate after his hospitalization in 2023 a much more outgoing lawmaker, frequently joking with his fellow senators and engaging with reporters in the hallways with the assistance of an iPad or iPhone that transcribes conversations in real time.",
      "Yet two years later, Fetterman is still something of a loner in the Senate.",
      "He has separated himself from many of his fellow Democrats on Israel policy and argued at times that his party needs to work with, not against, Trump. He met with Trump and Trump\u2019s nominees \u2014 and voted for some \u2014 when other Democrats wouldn't.",
      "He has stood firmly with Democrats in other cases and criticized Trump on some issues, such as trade and food aid.",
      "One particularly head-scratching video of Fetterman emerged earlier this year in which he was on a flight to Pittsburgh apparently arguing with a pilot over his seatbelt.",
      "Despite fallout with progressives over his staunch support of Israel in its war in Gaza, Fetterman was still an in-demand personality last year to campaign in the battleground state of Pennsylvania for Biden and, after Biden dropped his reelection bid, Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "Since Trump won November's election \u2014 and Pennsylvania \u2014 things have changed. Many one-time supporters have turned on Fetterman over his softer approach to Trump and his willingness to criticize fellow Democrats for raising alarm bells.",
      "It nevertheless brought Fetterman plaudits.",
      "Bill Maher, host of the political talk show \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher,\" suggested that Fetterman should run for president in 2028. Conservatives \u2014 who had long made Fetterman a target for his progressive politics \u2014 have sprung to Fetterman\u2019s defense.",
      "Still, Democrats in Pennsylvania say they are hearing from people worried about him.",
      "\u201cPeople are concerned about his health,\" said Sharif Street, the state's Democratic Party chairman. \u201cThey want to make sure he\u2019s OK. People care about him. There\u2019s a lot of love for him out there.\u201d",

      "\u201cHousing is not a luxury. It\u2019s a basic human need,\u201d Alvarado said at the bill signing. \u201cAnd everyone in this state deserves a stable and affordable home.\u201d",
      "The measure caps rent increases at 7% plus inflation or 10% \u2014 whichever is lower. The restrictions include single-family homes. The rent-increase cap for manufactured homes is 5%. Lawmakers approved the plan on a 54-44 vote, with five Democrats joining the Republican opposition.",
      "Ferguson praised Alvarado and the many advocates across the state who worked hard to get the bill passed.",
      "It almost didn't make it.",
      "It successfully moved through both houses, but two amendments added on the Senate floor sent it into a conference committee. Those amendments increased the cap from 7% to 10% plus inflation and exempted single-family homes. Opponents of the bill argued that developers would leave the state if it became law and said similar policies in Oregon and California added to those states\u2019 financial burdens instead of slowing the homeless crisis.",
      "Oregon's rent-control bill was passed in 2019 and later updated to cap rent increases at either 7% plus the annual 12-month average change in the consumer price index for the U.S. West, or 10% \u2014 whichever is lower.",
      "The conference committee got the cap down to 7% plus inflation or 10% \u2014 whichever is lower, and restored protections for the 38% of renters who live in single-family homes. With Ferguson's signature, it's now law.",
      "\u201cThis law is a good beginning. It\u2019s long overdue and it\u2019s urgently needed,\u201d Alvarado said. \u201cForty percent of the people in the state of Washington are renters or manufactured homeowners and before today they had no protections over how high the rent can go, leading to pain and to devastating destabilization of families and communities.\u201d",
      "Ferguson also signed nine other bills to help homeowners and renters. He said when he campaigned for governor, affordable housing was the top issue voters raised, so he supports bills to help make it easier to secure housing.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s make this the session of affordable housing,\u201d he said before signing the first measure.",
      "The other measures included limits on certain provisions in rental agreements, notices for mobile home communities, and property tax relief for disabled veterans.",

      "The White House has discussed deporting migrants to Libya, sources say.",
      "A federal judge ruled Wednesday that deporting noncitizens to Libya without due process would violate his existing court order, after sources said the White House has discussed such plans.",
      "Lawyers representing a group of migrants filed an emergency motion seeking to prevent their deportation to Libya or Saudi Arabia, citing both press reports and firsthand accounts from migrants who alleged they were actively being prepared for removal to Libya or Saudi Arabia on military aircraft.",
      "Sending noncitizens to Libya or Saudi Arabia without giving them a chance to raise concerns about their safety \"blatantly defies this Court's preliminary injunctions,\" lawyers representing the migrants argued in an emergency motion filed in federal court in Boston, where U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy last month issued a preliminary injunction barring the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens to any country other than their place of origin without due process.",
      "In his order Wednesday, Judge Murphy clarified that any \"allegedly imminent removals\" to a country like Libya or Saudi Arabia would violate the preliminary injunction he issued last month.",
      "\"If there is any doubt -- the Court sees none -- the allegedly imminent removals, as reported by news agencies and as Plaintiffs seek to corroborate with class-member accounts and public information, would clearly violate this Court's Order,\" Judge Murphy wrote about potential deportations to Saudi Arabia or to Libya, an Arab country located in North Africa that the U.S. State Department has advised American citizens not to travel to due to \"crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict.\"",
      "\"Any Class Member who is removed to Libya faces a strong likelihood of imprisonment followed by torture and even disappearance or death,\" the plaintiffs' motion said. \"Indeed, given Libya's human rights record, it is inconceivable that Class Members from other countries would ever agree to removal to Libya, but instead would uniformly seek protection from being removed to Libya.\"",
      "To support their application for the emergency order, lawyers representing the noncitizens included a series of exhibits showing the scramble that played out over the last day as the attorneys sought to determine if any of their clients were bound for Libya. According to the lawyers, Laotian, Vietnamese and Philippine immigrants are at risk of removal.",
      "According to two lawyers whose correspondence was included as exhibits, their clients were informed that they would be removed to Libya and were asked to sign documents agreeing to the deportations. When one of the men and a group of other migrants declined to sign the document, they were allegedly handcuffed in separate rooms \"in order to get them to sign it,\" according to one lawyer.",
      "\"ICE [Immigrations and Customs Enforcement] did not advise him that he has a right to request a reasonable fear interview, nor did ICE provide me with any notice of their intention to remove him to Libya, in clear violation of the district court's orders,\" another lawyer wrote.",
      "Reports that the administration is considering deportations to Libya follow the government's deportation of several hundred alleged migrant gang members to El Salvador as part of a $6 million deal the Trump administration made with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele to house detainees at the CECOT mega-prison there.",
      "Lawyers representing the noncitizens said they reached out to the Trump administration to confirm whether any class members are onboard flights to Libya and Saudi Arabia but had not heard back.",
      "Asked earlier Wednesday if the United States will be sending migrants to Libya, President Donald Trump told reporters, \"I don't know, you'll have to ask Homeland Security.\"",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who was asked about potential plans Wednesday morning prior to Trump's comments, said, \"I can't confirm anything.\"",
      "Libya's Government of National Unity has denied any connection to reports regarding the deportation of migrants to that country, saying in a statement that \"the Government affirms that it rejects the use of Libyan territory as a destination for the deportation of migrants without its knowledge or consent.\"",
      "ABC News has reached out to Libya's competing government, the Government of National Stability, for comment.",
      "Officials with the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has dispatched Vice President JD Vance all over the world in the opening months of the administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- When JD Vance was running for vice president, he walked across an airport tarmac in Wisconsin one August day when his campaign travels happened to intersect those of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and approached Air Force Two. Besides wanting to take a poke at Republican Donald Trump's rival for avoiding the press, Vance said, \"I just wanted to check out my future plane.\u201d",
      "It's an aircraft he now knows well.",
      "In the opening months of Trump's term, Vice President Vance has traveled all over the globe \u2014 family in tow \u2014 to conduct top-level diplomacy for the administration, in addition to taking a number of domestic trips. His international forays have featured a mix of meetings with world leaders, sharply crafted speeches advancing U.S. policy, \u201csoft power\u201d appearances to build goodwill and family time at tourist sites along the way.",
      "Vance's trips have included a five-day trip to Europe in February, a hastily reorganized trek to Greenland in March and a tour of Italy and India in April that was notable for the vice president's brief meeting with Pope Francis the day before the pontiff died.",
      "In his first big moment on the world stage in February, Vance pressed Trump's \u201cAmerica first\u201d message at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris and spoke of maintaining U.S. dominance in the surging industry. From there, he attended a security conference in Munich, where the vice president left his audience stunned with his lecturing remarks about democracy and scant focus on Russia's war against Ukraine.",
      "In March, Vance delivered pointed remarks while in Greenland, scolding Denmark for not investing more in the security of its territory and demanding a new approach. Trump has upset many Greenlanders with his aggressive claims that the U.S. needs to take control of the island away from Denmark.",
      "There's been dealmaking, too.",
      "In India last month, Vance announced after meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi that they had agreed on a negotiating framework for a U.S.-India trade deal. In Italy, he held talks with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, in addition to his separate audiences with the pope and a top Vatican official.",
      "Vance has been accompanied on his overseas trips by his wife, Usha, and their 7- and 5-year-old sons and 3-year-old daughter. The kids are usually in pajamas as they board Air Force Two for the overnight flights.",
      "The Vances have gazed aloft at the newly restored Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City and been photographed, with the children in traditional Indian dress, in front of the Taj Mahal in Agra. Without their children, the Vances also visited Dachau in Germany.",
      "Brad Blakeman, a former senior official in George W. Bush's administration who has provided planning advice to Vance\u2019s office for some of his foreign travel, said that, while some personal time is woven in, these are not vacations.",
      "\u201cYou try and balance the policy with the culture aspect of the trip so that you\u2019re honoring the customs and culture of the places that you are visiting,\u201d he said. Visiting iconic cultural sites while abroad shows respect and builds rapport with host nations that can enhance diplomacy.",
      "It\u2019s also important to be mindful that the president and vice president travel at the public\u2019s expense, he said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the balancing act that always has to be done because of the stewardship of the taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d he said.",
      "Joel Goldstein, a law professor at Saint Louis University who specializes in the U.S. vice presidency, said the journeys also could be intended to build Vance's foreign policy chops.",
      "\u201cPart of foreign travel for a vice president is establishing a national security and diplomatic credential,\u201d he said, noting that it's particularly important for Vance.",
      "At age 40, Vance served just two years in the Senate before ascending to the office.",
      "Vance is also the second-youngest person and the first of the millennial generation to hold the job.",
      "\u201cGenerations\u201d author Jean Twenge, a San Diego State University psychology professor who studies generational differences, said the ease with which Vance moves between work and leisure is emblematic of his generation.",
      "\u201cThe research suggests that, just with internet use and social media use, the lines between work time and family time blur, that you switch tasks much more quickly than, say, Gen Xers or boomers,\u201d she said.",
      "Vance frequently switches gears on the road. Last week, he wedged in a quick beer with service members in Germany \u2014 and autographed the \u201ckegerator\u201d built by one airman \u2014 after days of wall-to-wall official and cultural activities throughout Italy and India.",
      "Usha Vance was originally slated for a solo trip to Greenland with one of their sons to attend a dogsled race. But that plan was scrapped amid growing discontent from the governments of Greenland and Denmark over the visit and Trump\u2019s tough talk of the U.S. taking the territory away from a NATO ally. Instead, the vice president joined the trip, and their visit was limited to a U.S. military base there.",
      "On his Italy trip, Vance took heat on X for being photographed inside the Sistine Chapel. Photography there is usually forbidden, but the session turned out to have been sanctioned by the Vatican, as has happened on past visits by U.S. dignitaries.",
      "A decision during the same trip to close the Roman Colosseum to the public so Usha Vance and the children could take a tour drew some grumbling from tourists stranded outside. A consumer group has since filed a legal complaint.",
      "In India, the Taj Mahal, normally swarming with tourists, was also closed to visitors to accommodate the Vances, according to local media reports.",
      "American officials are often formally invited to make such cultural diversions, and it\u2019s not unusual for the U.S. Secret Service, which provides protection for top U.S. officials, to ask for the sites to be closed to the public for security reasons during presidential and vice presidential tours.",
      "The Vances appear to have tried on occasion to avoid such disruptions. In France, the family visited the Louvre on a Tuesday, a day when the museum is closed to the public.",
      "Other recent vice presidents also have taken family members along on trips. Presidents do, as well.",
      "As vice president, Democrat Joe Biden often took one of his older granddaughters on trips, a practice he continued as president. Presidents' children, including Malia and Sasha Obama and Chelsea Clinton, went along on some trips with their parents, too.",
      "Practices differ, but the idea is the same: Time in office is short, so make the most of it and expose your children to the world.",
      "Usha Vance said as much during the family visit to India, where her parents were born. She hadn't visited in decades, and her husband and children had never been there.",
      "In an interview with India's NDTV, she said she'd been anxious to make the \u201ctrip of a lifetime\u201d with them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been something that I\u2019ve wanted to share with my new nuclear family,\u201d the U.S. second lady said, adding that they knew Vance would have a chance to visit India as vice president. \"We always knew that, when that opportunity arose, we would all come with him.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe think of it as sort of a gateway, the first of many trips to come, I hope,\" she said.",
      "One aim of vice presidential travel abroad is often soft diplomacy, or the building of favorable attitudes toward the U.S. through imagery and symbolism.",
      "When Vance, with his wife of Indian descent and their children, is photographed at the Taj Mahal, it sends a message of solidarity with that nation. When he visits the Vatican and worships there, it emphasizes common ground with Catholics around the world.",
      "Likewise, when Vance appears in public with his children, it could help drive home his quest to encourage large families and build goodwill among American voters, said University of Dayton political scientist Christopher Devine, co-author of \u201cDo Running Mates Matter?\u201d",
      "\u201cI wonder, with JD Vance, if it's an effort to soften his image,\" Devine said. \u201cHe's someone who has not been particularly popular ever since he entered the national scene, and appearing with family tends to make people a little more likable, harder to hate.\u201d",

      "Alabama last year became the first state to carry out an execution with nitrogen gas. Nitrogen has now been used in five executions \u2014 four in Alabama and one in Louisiana.

      "Prosecutors said Hunt broke into her apartment and killed her. A physician who performed an autopsy testified that Lane had sustained some 60 injuries, including 20 to the head.",
      "A jury in 1990 convicted Hunt of capital murder and recommended by a vote of 11-1 that he receive a death sentence.",

They argued that a February U.S. Supreme Court decision could be applicable to his longstanding claim that his conviction was unconstitutionally obtained by false or misleading evidence.",

      "In February, the Trump administration changed the way it reviews sponsors who want to care for migrant children in government custody, whether parents or relatives of the minors -- or others. More changes followed in March and April when the government started to require identification or proof of income that only those legally present in the U.S. could acquire. Advocates for the families affected are asking a judge to declare the changes unlawful and return the agency to the policies in place before that.",
      "\u201cThe government has dramatically increased the burden on families in a way that deeply undermines children\u2019s safety. These policy changes are part of a broader unraveling of a bi-partisan, decades-long commitment to support the best interests of unaccompanied children,\u201d said Neha Desai, a managing director at National Center for Youth Law.",

      "The founder and former CEO of the cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network has been sentenced to 12 years in prison",
      "NEW YORK -- The founder and former CEO of the cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network was sentenced Thursday to 12 years in prison after a prosecutor labeled him a predator who \u201cpreyed on hope\u201d by enticing vulnerable customers to risk their life savings for a supposedly safe investment.",
      "Alexander Mashinsky, 59, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl, who said a substantial term in prison was necessary for someone who engaged in \u201cextremely serious\u201d crimes that enabled him to pocket over $45 million while some of his customers lost everything and suffered severe psychological harm.",
      "Celsius declared bankruptcy in 2022, exposing risky financial bets Mashinsky had made with some of the $20 billion that thousands of customers poured into the company. He had promised that their money would be safe and secure at Celsius, which pitched itself as a modern-day bank where crypto assets could earn interest.",
      "The defense blamed the collapse of Celsius on a \u201ccataclysmic downturn\u201d of cryptocurrency markets in May and June of 2022 and said in court papers that Mashinsky's \u201cactions were never predatory, exploitative or venal. He never acted with the intent to hurt anyone.\u201d",
      "But Assistant U.S. Attorney Allison Nichols cast him as a financial predator, telling the judge Thursday that Mashinsky had deceived customers from the start by exaggerating Celsius' ability to build momentum.",
      "\u201cHe preyed on hope,\u201d she said. \u201cMashinsky knew exactly what he was doing \u2014 selling these people hope.\u201d",
      "She said the customers were not going to be made financially whole regardless of money that can be recovered through bankruptcy proceedings.",
      "Before he was sentenced, Mashinsky sobbed several times as he apologized to customers and referenced his difficult past as his family was able to leave a small Ukrainian town in the former Soviet Union with help from the United States when he was 7.",
      "The family moved to Israel, where Mashinsky served three years in the Israeli Defense Forces as a fighter pilot before coming to America.",
      "Mashinsky said he \u201cnever meant to hurt anybody here after all this country has done for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI'm truly sorry,\u201d he said, describing himself as someone \u201cwho came from nothing.\u201d",
      "When he pleaded guilty in December, Mashinsky admitted to misleading customers between 2018 and 2022 by promising their investments were safe even as he fabricated Celsius' profitability and put customers' funds at the mercy of uncollateralized loans and undisclosed risky market bets.",
      "His attorney, Marc Mukasey, said victim impact statements submitted to the court were \u201crather brutal\u201d toward his client.",
      "\u201cWe hear the intensity of their pain,\u201d he said. \u201cOur sympathies are with everyone.\u201d",
      "Several victims spoke at the sentencing hearing.",
      "Cameron Crewes, who serves on a victims' committee, called for a \u201charsh sentence,\u201d saying nearly 250 victims died before they could see justice served or get adequately compensated for losses.",
      "\u201cMany people have been wiped out,\u201d he said.",
      "In a statement, U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said Mashinsky \u201cmade tens of millions of dollars while his customers lost billions.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cAmerica's investors deserve better. The case for tokenization and the use of digital assets is strong, but it is not a license to deceive. The rules against fraud still apply.\u201d",

      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- New York is set to lower the minimum hiring age for prison guards from 21 to 18, seeking to boost the ranks of corrections officers during a shortage that was exacerbated by the firing of more than 2,000 guards after a weekslong strike crippled the state\u2019s prison system.",
      "State lawmakers approved the measure on Wednesday and Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, is expected to sign it into law.",
      "The bill establishes some rules for the younger guards, including policies that they cannot obtain or use firearms or transport inmates outside of prisons. They also must be supervised when performing \u201ccontact roles\u201d with inmates during the first year-and-a-half on the job.",
      "The push to lower the age for correction officers came after guards walked off the job in February while striking to protest poor working conditions. Hochul was forced to deploy the state National Guard to prisons to maintain operations during the strike.",
      "The governor ended up firing more than 2,000 guards who refused to return to work after the state and guards' union reached a deal to end the walkout, which lasted around three weeks. Hochul has barred the guards who were fired from holding other state jobs in the future.",
      "The state corrections commissioner has since directed the department to begin the process of releasing some inmates early because of a shortage of guards. But the early discharges have been limited to inmates who were convicted of minor crimes and were already set for release in the near future. Inmates convicted of sex crimes, violent felonies or serious felonies such as murder, terrorism and arson would not be eligible for early release, the agency said.",
      "The strike came after the high-profile fatal beating of Robert Brooks at an upstate New York prison in December, which was recorded on guards' body cameras and led to charges against more than a dozen people.",
      "Another incarcerated person, Messiah Nantwi, died on March 1 after being injured in a series of beatings by guards, according to an indictment. Ten guards were charged over Nantwi's death, including two who were charged with murder.",
      "Some other states, including Florida, Maine and New Jersey, allow 18-year-olds to become correction officers.",

    "story": [
      "Senate Democrats have blocked legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency after arguing that the bill needed stronger protections",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats have blocked legislation to regulate stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency, after arguing that the bill needed stronger protections and airing concerns that it could help President Donald Trump enrich himself.",
      "The bill, which would regulate how stablecoin issuers operate in the U.S., had previously won some Democratic support. But it failed 49-48 on a procedural vote Thursday after Democrats said that they needed to see more changes to the legislation before they could back it.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune said that Republicans would work with Democrats if they allowed the bill to move forward, but they refused. All Democrats voted not to bring it up.",
      "The vote is a blow to one of Trump\u2019s top legislative priorities and a setback for the cryptocurrency industry, which spent heavily in last year\u2019s election and has been emboldened to cement its influence in politics and the mainstream financial system. The legislation would aim to create a federal framework to regulate the stablecoin industry, which is currently governed by a patchwork of existing federal and state laws.",
      "Stablecoins are a fast-growing corner of the cryptocurrency industry that have produced enormous profits for some of the major players involved. They offer a buffer from cryptocurrency\u2019s notorious volatility because they are pegged to real-world assets, like U.S. dollars or gold. Typically, that means a single stablecoin is worth $1, making them a much more reliable digital asset to make commercial transactions than other forms of crypto.",
      "While some Democrats agree that regulation is needed, and several voted to move the bill out of committee, Trump\u2019s involvement in the crypto industry has complicated the legislation\u2019s path. Trump launched a meme coin earlier this year that has generated more than $320 million in fees for its creators, according to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. And earlier this week, Trump promoted a dinner he\u2019s set to attend on May 22 that\u2019s open to almost anyone who buys enough of the coins.",
      "Another Trump-family linked crypto venture called World Liberty Financial recently announced that it was issuing its own stablecoin, called USD1. The stablecoin got a huge boost when World Liberty Financial announced last week that an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates would be using $2 billion worth of USD1 to purchase a stake in Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.",
      "Among other proposed changes, Democrats said that elected officials and their families should be barred from owning, controlling or promoting stablecoin business ventures.",
      "\u201cThe Senate should not pass a bill that facilitates Trump\u2019s breathtaking corruption and lines his pockets and welcomes other elected officials to do the same,\u201d said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.",
      "A former skeptic turned zealous promotor, Trump has promised to usher in a golden age for the cryptocurrency industry. His administration has already taken many early actions without Congress to boost crypto, including establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve and undoing previously enforcement actions. But Trump needs Congress to get some of his and the deep-pocketed industry\u2019s top priorities passed, including enacting the stablecoin legislation.",
      "The legislation could still move forward if the two parties can come to a deal. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat who has been helping negotiate the legislation, said in a statement after the vote that he would continue to work on it.",
      "\u201cI remain fully committed to getting this right,\u201d Warner said.",
      "A group of nine Democrats, including Warner, said in a release over the weekend that they could not support the legislation until it included stronger provisions on money laundering, foreign issuers and accountability for those who violate it, among other concerns. They did not mention Trump.",
      "\u201cWe recognize that the absence of regulation leaves consumers unprotected and vulnerable to predatory practices,\u201d the Democrats said.",
      "Thune, the Republican leader, questioned Democrats' motives, speculating that they just wanted to deny Trump a bipartisan win.",
      "\u201cIt makes you wonder if this is about the bill at all,\u201d he said of their opposition.",

      "A flurry of rumors and unconfirmed media reports has fueled fears that agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be descending on schools in Washington, D",
      "WASHINGTON -- Word spread \u2014 and fast \u2014 as it does in so many moments of rumor and fear.",
      "Early Tuesday morning, dozens of concerned parents and staff members gathered outside of Mundo Verde, one of Washington's most prominent bilingual schools, bracing for a crackdown.",
      "A flurry of rumors and unconfirmed media reports had fueled fears that agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be descending on area schools that were known to have large Hispanic immigrant populations.",
      "The group tensed up as a black SUV slowly cruised past the school twice, then parked up the block. \u201cI think it\u2019s happening,\u201d one parent said.",
      "The man who emerged turned out to be a television news cameraman. People laughed in relief \u2014 for the moment.",
      "It was a rare moment of levity in the middle of several days of tension and fear as Washington's Hispanic community waits for President Donald Trump's pledge of an immigration crackdown to take shape in the nation's capital. It mirrors, in some ways, similar fears around the country.",
      "The reports of a crackdown on bilingual schools in the District turned out to be a false alarm that day \u2014 but only partially false. While the schools were on high alert, ICE agents reportedly raided several local restaurants, including Millie's in northwest Washington. On Wednesday, staffers at Millie's were reluctant to discuss the incident, with one manager \u2014 who did not give a name \u2014 saying the restaurant had been descended upon by \u201cfascists.\u201d",
      "Staff at Millie's referred all questions to owner Bo Blair, who did not respond to an emailed request for comment. ICE also did not immediately respond to a request for details on what establishments had been raided and whether anyone had been detained.",
      "The ambient fear among Washington's robust Hispanic community, though, remains. It is exacerbated by concerns that the city government will not help them. Washington, D.C., declared itself a sanctuary city in 2020 via the Sanctuary Values Act. Among the most prominent aspects of that declaration is a \u201cprohibition on cooperation with federal immigration agencies\u201d by city officials and agencies.",
      "But Mayor Muriel Bowser has publicly distanced herself from that status ever since Trump was elected to a second term. Bowser has worked hard to maintain a positive relationship with Trump and with congressional Republicans, who hold significant power over the District of Columbia.",
      "In February, she publicly characterized the sanctuary city designation as \u201can expression of our values,\u201d but not a binding legal concept. The city and its agencies, she said, would not hinder or defy any federal immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s misleading to suggest to anyone that \u2026 this is a place where you can violate immigration laws,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cThe city is not an immigration enforcement agency. No city is. The federal government is.\u201d",
      "Washington's Hispanic community, and the schools and charities that serve it, have spent months quietly preparing for the worst-case scenario.",
      "\u201cMy community is really scared,\u201d said one senior official at a local bilingual school, speaking on condition of anonymity to protect her students, parents and staff. \u201cWe have a whole crisis management plan if ICE was to come to the door.\u201d",
      "That plan includes posting \u201cprivate property\u201d signs all around the school perimeter and running special trainings for staff members on how to handle the arrival of ICE agents. Parents have been advised to sign \u201ccustody agreements\u201d stipulating who would be authorized to take care of their children if they were suddenly detained. The administrator estimated that as much as 35% of the school's student body \u201ccould be undocumented.\u201d",
      "In February, a collection of bilingual charter schools hosted a \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d training session for parents conducted by an immigration attorney. Dozens of families attended, although many were afraid to attend in person and participated via Zoom.",
      "The attorney, speaking on condition of anonymity to protect her clients, said requests for \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d training sessions have surged in the past six months, \u201cAnybody who was anything less than a full citizen is going, \u2018Oh my God, what does this mean for me?\u2019\u201d",
      "The attorney said that \u201cmanaging this culture of fear\u201d has become a steadily increasing part of her job. And for clients who are undocumented, \u201cI don't really have advice for them other than to just stay off the radar.\u201d",
      "At Mundo Verde this week, parents set up tables on the sidewalk so they could work on their laptops and stay all day, just in case. Another school, Oyster-Adams Bilingual School, established a volunteer escort network to help bring students safely to and from the school building.",
      "Rio Sigala, a Mundo Verde parent, praised the immediate rallying of physical support from the school's non-Hispanic parents and community.",
      "\u201cAs a Latina, seeing how many parents are out here in solidarity makes you feel less alone,\u201d Sigala said. \u201cYou walk around kind of scared and to see everyone come out, it feels hopeful.\u201d",

      "U.S. District Judge Leslie Kobayashi handed down the ruling Wednesday, awarding from $5,000 to more than $104,000 to each plaintiff.

      "Republicans who control the Wisconsin Legislature have voted to kill most of the top spending priorities of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Republicans who control the Wisconsin Legislature voted Thursday to kill most of the top spending priorities of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, including legalizing marijuana, even as both sides negotiate a tax cut.",
      "The Legislature's Republican-controlled budget committee voted along party lines to kill more than 600 budget proposals put forward by Evers, including spending more state money on child care providers, expanding Medicaid and raising taxes on joint tax filers those who earn more than $1 million.",
      "Republicans did the same thing in each of Evers' previous three budgets and had said they were going to do it again. Some of the killed ideas, like allowing absentee ballots to be processed before polls open on Election Day, have had bipartisan support in the past and could return in another form.",
      "The cuts come amid uncertainty about how much federal money the state will get as President Donald Trump's administration moves to drastically reduce government spending. Evers' budget as introduced would have spent about $119 billion money over two years, a 20% increase in spending.",
      "Evers and Republicans have been talking about a tax cut plan they both could support but have not released details. Republicans argue that most of the state's roughly $4 billion surplus should be returned as tax cuts rather than used to support spending on K-12 schools, the University of Wisconsin and other state programs.",
      "Evers proposals stripped from the budget on Thursday include: eliminating the tax on tips; increasing funding to combat what some people call forever chemicals or PFAS; targeted property tax cuts for veterans, seniors and people with disabilities; spending $128 million on new financial aid targeting low-income college students and adding gender-neutral language such as \u201cperson inseminated\u201d to state law.",
      "\u201cRepublicans talk a lot about what they\u2019re against, but not what they\u2019re for,\" Evers said in a statement. \u201cThere are pressing challenges facing our state. Wisconsinites are sick and tired of having a do-nothing Legislature. Republicans must get serious about getting things done.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. Howard Marklein, co-chair of the budget committee, said \u201cpopular items\u201d could return as separate bills. Co-chair Rep. Mark Born said just because the committee was rejecting Evers' approach to various issues facing the state doesn't mean they won't be addressed in other ways.",
      "The vote gutting the governor's spending plan marks the first step in what will be a weekslong process of slowly rebuilding the two-year budget to include more Republican priorities. Evers can make more changes with his broad veto power once the Legislature passes a budget, which typically happens in late June or early July.",
      "However, Republicans have talked about taking longer to pass a budget this year, or passing only certain top priority spending bills, in reaction to a Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling upholding a line-item budget veto Evers made in 2023 that extended a K-12 spending increase for 400 years.",
      "That ruling affirmed the governor's power to veto digits from a budget bill, allowing him to create new amounts and years not envisioned by lawmakers.",
      "The court noted in its ruling, however, that the Legislature could rein in the governor's veto powers in several ways. That includes passing a constitutional amendment that\u2019s under consideration curbing a governor\u2019s veto power and drafting budget bills in a way to prevent a governor from making such a sweeping veto.",

    "story": [
      "The nation\u2019s infant mortality rate is falling",
      "NEW YORK -- The nation's infant mortality rate dropped last year after two years of hovering at a late-pandemic plateau.",
      "Some experts think one reason for the drop could be a vaccination campaign against RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, which is a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can be dangerous for infants.",
      "The infant mortality national rate dropped to about 5.5 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024, according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted Thursday. That's down from about 5.6 per 1,000 live births, where it had been the previous two years.",
      "CDC officials believe the findings will not change much when the final numbers come out later this year.",
      "Infant mortality is the measure of how many babies die before they reach their first birthday. Because the number of babies born in the U.S. varies from year to year, researchers instead calculate rates to better compare infant mortality over time.",
      "U.S. infant deaths fell to about 19,900 last year, according to CDC data, compared with about 20,150 in 2023.",
      "The U.S. infant mortality rate has been worse than other high-income countries, which experts have attributed to poverty, inadequate prenatal care and other things. Even so, the U.S. rate generally has improved over the decades because of medical advances and public health efforts.",
      "The 2022 and 2023 levels were up from 5.44 per 1,000 in 2021 \u2014 the first statistically significant jump in the rate in about two decades. Experts attributed those years to a rebound in RSV and flu infections after two years of pandemic precautions.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to prevent the toll on infants \u2014 one was a lab-made antibody shot for infants that helps the immune system fight off the virus, and the other was giving an RSV vaccine to women between 32 weeks and 36 weeks of pregnancy.",
      "That effort is probably one explanation for the improvement, said Dr. Amanda Williams, interim chief medical officer for the March of Dimes.",
      "In a separate CDC report released Thursday, researchers noted infant hospitalizations in the 2024-25 respiratory virus season were more than 40% lower than past averages.",
      "But more work needs to be done to tease out other reasons, Williams added, noting that much of the improvement in 2024 was in infants who were at least one month old when they died. That could be explained not only by fewer deaths from RSV but also from other causes, like accidents, homicides or SIDS.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Democratic voters on Thursday asked the liberal-controlled Wisconsin Supreme Court to throw out the battleground state\u2019s current congressional district boundaries after a similar request was rejected last year.",
      "Republicans currently hold six of the state's eight U.S. House seats \u2014 but only two of those districts are considered competitive. The petition seeks to have the state\u2019s congressional district lines redrawn ahead of the 2026 midterms. Filed on Wednesday and made public Thursday, the petition comes from the Elias Law Group, which represents Democratic groups and candidates and also filed last year's request.",
      "The new petition argues that the court's decision to redraw maps for state legislative districts a couple years ago has opened the door to revisiting maps for U.S. House districts. The petition asks for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to take the case directly, skipping lower courts.",
      "The chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, Brian Schimming, called the lawsuit \"a desperate attempt by far-left Democrats who have shown time and time again that they can\u2019t win without rigged maps.\u201d",

      "Redistricting was an issue in that race after Crawford spoke at a virtual event billed as a \u201cchance to put two more House seats in play,\u201d a move that Republicans said shows that Crawford is committed to redrawing congressional districts to benefit Democrats. Crawford denied those allegations.",
      "The court in 2023 ordered new maps for the state Legislature, saying the Republican-drawn ones were unconstitutional. The GOP-controlled Legislature, out of fear that the court would order maps even more unfavorable to Republicans, passed ones drawn by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. Democrats made gains in the state Legislature in the November election and are hoping to take majority control in 2026.",
      "When ordering the state legislative maps redrawn, the Wisconsin Supreme Court said the earlier conservative-controlled court was wrong in 2021 to say that maps drawn that year should have as little change as possible from the maps that were in place at the time. The latest lawsuit argues that decision warranted replacing the congressional district maps that were drawn under the \u201cleast change\u201d requirement.",

      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will no longer track the cost of climate change-fueled weather disasters, including floods, heat waves, wildfires and more. It is the latest example of changes to the agency and the Trump administration limiting federal government resources on climate change.",
      "NOAA falls under the U.S. Department of Commerce and is tasked with daily weather forecasts, severe storm warnings and climate monitoring. It is also parent to the National Weather Service.",
      "The agency said its National Centers for Environmental Information would no longer update its Billion-dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database beyond 2024, and that its information \u2014 going as far back as 1980 \u2014 would be archived.",
      "For decades, it has tracked hundreds of major events across the country, including destructive hurricanes, hail storms, droughts and freezes that have totaled trillions of dollars in damage.",
      "The database uniquely pulls information from the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s assistance data, insurance organizations, state agencies and more to estimate overall losses from individual disasters.",
      "NOAA Communications Director Kim Doster said in a statement that the change was \u201cin alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes.\u201d",
      "Scientists say these weather events are becoming increasingly more frequent, costly and severe with climate change. Experts have attributed the growing intensity of recent debilitating heat, Hurricane Milton, the Southern California wildfires and blasts of cold to climate change.",
      "Assessing the impact of weather events fueled by the planet's warming is key as insurance premiums hike, particularly in communities more prone to flooding, storms and fires. Climate change has wrought havoc on the insurance industry, and homeowners are at risk of skyrocketing rates.",
      "One limitation is that the dataset estimated only the nation's most costly weather events.",
      "The information is generally seen as standardized and unduplicable, given the agency's access to nonpublic data, and other private databases would be more limited in scope and likely not shared as widespread for proprietary reasons. Other datasets, however, also track death estimates from these disasters.",
      "Jeff Masters, a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections, pointed to substitutes from insurance brokers and the international disaster database as alternative sources of information.",
      "Still, \u201cThe NOAA database is the gold standard we use to evaluate the costs of extreme weather,\u201d Masters said, \u201cand it\u2019s a major loss, since it comes at a time when we need to better understand how much climate change is increasing disaster losses.\u201d",
      "These moves also don\u2019t \u201cchange the fact that these disasters are escalating year over year,\u201d Kristina Dahl, vice president of science at nonprofit climate organization Climate Central. \u201cExtreme weather events that cause a lot of damage are one of the primary ways that the public sees that climate change is happening and is affecting people.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s critical that we highlight those events when they\u2019re happening,\u201d she added. \u201cAll of these changes will make Americans less safe in the face of climate change.\u201d",
      "The move, reported Thursday by CNN, is yet another of President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to remove references to climate change and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the weather from the federal government\u2019s lexicon and documents.",
      "Trump has instead prioritized allies in the polluting coal, oil and gas industries, which studies say are linked or traced to climate damage.",
      "The change also marks the administration's latest hit overall to the weather, ocean and fisheries agency.",
      "The Trump administration fired hundreds of weather forecasters and other federal NOAA employees on probationary status in February, part of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency efforts to downsize the federal government workforce. It began a second round of more than 1,000 cuts at the agency in March, more than 10% of its workforce at the time.",
      "At the time, insiders said massive firings and changes to the agency would risk lives and negatively impact the U.S. economy. Experts also noted fewer vital weather balloon launches under NOAA would worsen U.S. weather forecasts.",

      "The Trump administration is halting some hiring at the federal Bureau of Prisons, the crisis-plagued agency where chronic understaffing has led to long overtime shifts and the use of prison nurses, teachers, cooks and other workers to guard inmates.",
      "The move, which coincides with President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive campaign to cut the cost and size of the federal government, was announced Thursday by the agency\u2019s newly appointed director, William K. Marshall III. Some union officials characterized the move as a \u201chiring freeze,\u201d though the agency denied that, saying some positions would continue to be filled.",
      "The Bureau of Prisons will maintain current staffing levels at least through the end of the fiscal year, Sept 30, Marshall wrote in an email to staff titled \u201cStaffing and Hiring Decisions.\u201d The agency will still work to fill critical positions, such as correctional officers and medical clinicians, and will honor job offers that are currently pending on an accelerated timeline.",
      "The change comes days after Trump ordered the Bureau of Prisons to reopen Alcatraz, the fabled former penitentiary in San Francisco Bay that last held inmates more than six decades ago.",
      "The dilapidated facility, now a popular museum and tourist attraction, will likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild at a time when the federal prison system is facing a $3 billion repair backlog and myriad other woes. Marshall said this week that the cash-strapped agency will conduct \u201can immediate assessment to determine our needs and the next steps\u201d on Trump\u2019s Alcatraz directive.",
      "Since mid-March, 11 federal prison inmates have died. Last week, an inmate in Miami tested positive for tuberculosis, while others were diagnosed with COVID-19. In February, a Bureau of Prisons official told Congress that more than 4,000 beds within the system \u2014 the equivalent of at least two full prisons \u2014 are unusable because of dangers like leaking or failing roofs, mold, asbestos or lead.",
      "In his announcement Thursday, Marshall told employees that changing the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 hiring practices are necessary to \u201cavoid more extreme measures\" as it navigates budgetary challenges. The plan will \u201cmaintain stability and protect the livelihood of our workforce to the fullest extent possible,\" he wrote.",
      "The hiring freeze is likely to exacerbate a staffing crisis at the agency, which has more than 4,000 unfilled positions, union officials said. The administration previously eliminated some pay bonuses that were credited with retaining and attracting new staff. In one example of staffing problems, a federal jail in Brooklyn had more than 150 vacancies despite a hiring surge that increased staffing by about 20%. Before that, the facility was operating at about 55% of full staffing, according to court filings.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re already severely understaffed, they took our retention pay, they have been literally stripping all the things away from us that matter,\u201d said Aaron McGlothin, union president at the federal prison in Mendota, California. \u201cFreezing an already severely understaffed agency will lead to tragic consequences, we are tired of doing more with less.\"",
      "Trump suspended hiring across many parts of the federal bureaucracy when he took office in January, but initially spared the Bureau of Prisons and other law enforcement agencies. At the same time the administration and billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency cut probationary workers and offered buyouts to hundreds of thousands of workers across the government.",
      "Trump previously imposed a hiring freeze at the Bureau of Prisons during his first term, in 2017. That freeze was blamed for accelerating the glut of vacancies and overtime spending \u2014 a trend that has continued for years as the agency has struggled to hire and retain employees. Some correctional officers have been pressed into duty for 16-hour shifts and 80-hour weeks.",
      "\u201cStaff are mentally and physically exhausted from the do more with less directives,\u201d McGlothin said, noting a wave of retirements in the wake of Trump\u2019s actions. \u201cNothing ever good comes from these situations and I pray no one is injured or killed over these senseless decisions.\u201d",
      "An ongoing investigation from The Associated Press has uncovered deep, previously unreported flaws within the Bureau of Prisons, an agency with more than 30,000 employees, 158,000 inmates, 122 facilities and an annual budget of about $8 billion.",
      "AP reporting has revealed rampant misconduct, including staff-on-inmate sexual abuse, dozens of escapes, chronic violence, deaths and severe staffing shortages that have hampered responses to emergencies, including inmate assaults and suicides.",
      "In December, the agency announced it was permanently closing its women\u2019s prison in Dublin, California, in the wake of rampant sexual abuse by employees, including the warden. It addition, it idled six prison camps across the country, moves it said were done to address \u201csignificant challenges, including a critical staffing shortage, crumbling infrastructure and limited budgetary resources.\u201d",

      "Natalie Rupnow entered Abundant Life Christian School, a religious school in Madison that offers prekindergarten through high school classes, on Dec. 16 and opened fire in a study hall. She killed teacher Erin Michelle West and 14-year-old student Rubi Bergara and injured six others before she killed herself.",
      "According to the complaint, investigators recovered 20 shell casings from the study hall where she opened fire.",
      "They also recovered a 9 mm Glock handgun that Jeffrey Rupnow had purchased for her from the room and a .22-caliber Sig Sauer pistol from a bag the girl was carrying, the complaint says. Jeffrey Rupnow had given that gun to her as a Christmas present in 2023, the complaint says.",
      "Also in the bag were three magazines loaded with .22 ammunition and a 50-round box of 9 mm ammunition. She wore a black T-shirt emblazoned with a bull's-eye during the attack.",
      "Jeffrey Rupnow told investigators that his daughter lived with him but had been struggling with his divorce from her mother in 2022, saying she hated her life and wanted to kill herself. He said she used to cut herself to the point where he had to lock up all the knives in his house.",
      "She had been in therapy to learn how to be more social until the spring before the attack, he told investigators. Her mother, Melissa Rupnow, told detectives that the therapist told her that Natalie was suffering post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from the divorce. One of Natalie's friends told investigators that Jeffrey Rupnow was \u201cfrequently verbally aggressive\u201d with Natalie and that she had told him that her father was a \u201cdrinker,\u201d according to the complaint.",
      "Jeffery Rupnow told investigators that took Natalie shooting with him on a friend's land about two years before the Abundant Life attack. She enjoyed it, and he came to see guns as a way to connect with her. But he was shocked at how her interest in firearms \u201csnow balled,\u201d he told investigators.",
      "He kept Natalie's pistols in a gun safe, telling her that if she ever need them the access code was his Social Security number entered backward. About 10 days before the school attack, he texted a friend and said that Natalie would shoot him if he left \u201cthe fun safe open right now,\" according to the complaint.",
      "The day before the school attack he took the Sig Sauer out of the safe so Natalie could clean it. But he got distracted and wasn't sure if he put the weapon back in the safe or locked it, according to the complaint.",
      "A search of Natalie's room netted a six-page manifesto the girl had written entitled \u201cWar Against Humanity.\u201d She started the piece by describing humanity as \u201cfilth\u201d and saying she hated people who don't care and \u201csmoke their lungs out with weed or drink as much as they can like my own father.\u201d",
      "She wrote about how she admired school shooters, how her mother was not in her life and how she obtained her weapons \u201cby lies and manipulation, and my fathers stupidity.\u201d",
      "Investigators also discovered maps of the school and a cardboard model of the building, along with a handwritten schedule that detailed how she would being the attack at 11:30 a.m. and wipe out the first and second floors of the school by 11:55 a.m. She planned to end the attack by 12:10 p.m. with a notation \u201cready 4 Death.\u201d",
      "She had been communicating online with people around the world about her fascination with school shootings and weapons, Acting Madison Police Chief John Patterson said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.",
      "Jeffery Rupnow sent a message to a detective two weeks after the school shooting saying that his biggest mistake was teaching Natalie how to handle guns safely and urging police to warn people to change their gun safe combinations every two to three months, the complaint said.",
      "\u201cKids are smart and they will figure it out,\u201d he wrote. \u201cJust like someone trying to hack your bank account. I just want to protect other families from going through what I'm going through.\"",
      "According to the complaint, after learning that Natalie was the shooter while talking to a police officer, Melissa Rupnow began breathing very quickly through her nose and yelled something, to the effect of, \u201cI'm going to kill him, I'm going to kill him,\" apparently referring to her ex-husband.",
      "Jeffrey Rupnow is the latest parent of a school shooter to face charges associated with an attack.",
      "Last year, the mother and father of a school shooter in Michigan who killed four students in 2021 were each convicted of involuntary manslaughter. The mother was the first parent in the U.S. to be held responsible for a child carrying out a mass school attack.",
      "The father of a 14-year-old boy accused of fatally shooting four people at a Georgia high school was arrested in September and faces charges including second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter for letting his son possess a weapon.",
      "In 2023, the father of a man charged in a deadly Fourth of July parade shooting in suburban Chicago pleaded guilty to seven misdemeanors related to how his son obtained a gun license.",

      "A former model has testified that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her when she was 16 years old, calling it the most \u201chorrifying thing I ever experienced\u201d to that point",
      "NEW YORK -- A former model tearfully testified Thursday that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her when she was 16 years old, calling it the most \u201chorrifying thing I ever experienced\u201d to that point.",
      "Kaja (KEYE\u2019-ah) Sokola, an aspiring actor at the time, told jurors at Weinstein\u2019s #MeToo retrial that the onetime movie honcho put his hand inside her underwear and made her touch his genitals at a Manhattan apartment in 2002.",
      "Sokola said she saw Weinstein\u2019s eyes \u2014 \u201cblack and scary\u201d \u2014 staring at her in a bathroom mirror as it happened.",
      "Afterward, she said, he told her to keep quiet about what had happened, touting that he'd made the careers of A-listers like Gwyneth Paltrow and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and that he could help her Hollywood dreams come true.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d never been in a situation like this,\u201d Sokola testified, as riveted jurors scribbled notes. \u201cI felt stupid and ashamed and like it\u2019s my fault for putting myself in this position.\u201d",
      "Weinstein is not charged with any crime in connection with the alleged assault, which Sokola first detailed in a lawsuit a few years ago. The timing put it outside the statute of limitations for criminal charges.",
      "Sokola is testifying because Weinstein is charged with forcibly performing oral sex on her at a Manhattan hotel four years later, around the time of her 20th birthday. Prosecutors say it happened after Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra in the film \u201cThe Nanny Diaries.\u201d",
      "Sokola reported the allegation to authorities a few days into Weinstein\u2019s first trial in 2020, but was not a part of that case. Prosecutors added her to the retrial, joining two women who testified in the first case, after his conviction was overturned last year.",
      "Weinstein, now 73, looked down and away from Sokola as she recounted the earlier allegation, pressing his left thumb and index finger against his face like a shield.",
      "Sokola testified that she first met the then-studio boss at a Manhattan restaurant in 2002, three or four days before the alleged assault. During the short chat, she said, Weinstein asked her if she wanted to be an actress.",
      "A few days later, she said, he invited her to lunch \u2014 ostensibly to talk about acting \u2014 but instead took her to an apartment, where led her into a bedroom and then a bathroom, instructed her to take her top off and assaulted her.",
      "\u201cHe told me to talk my clothes off and I didn\u2019t want to do that. I was panicking,\u201d Sokola testified. \u201cAnd then he said that if I want to be an actress, that\u2019s what actors do in films, so I should get used to it. If a director says you have you take your clothes off, you have to take your clothes off. I was scared. I was scared of him.\u201d",
      "Sokola avoided looking at Weinstein as she walked to the witness stand \u2014 testifying for a second day after detailing on Wednesday her upbringing in Poland, entr\u00e9e into modeling and her professional career as a psychotherapist and author who recently launched a film production company. She peered briefly at Weinstein when asked Thursday to point him out in court.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "His lawyers contend that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting movie and TV opportunities, and the defense has emphasized that the women stayed in contact with him for a while after the alleged assaults. The women, meanwhile, say the then-producer used the prospect of show business work to prey on them.",
      "Sokola sued Weinstein after industry whispers about his behavior toward women became a chorus of public accusations in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. Prosecutors have said Sokola eventually received $3.5 million in compensation.",
      "Prosecutors have said they began investigating Sokola\u2019s claims in 2020 but set the inquiry aside after Weinstein was convicted. They revived the investigation after New York\u2019s highest court reversed his conviction.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers fought unsuccessfully to keep Sokola out of the retrial, accusing prosecutors of \u201csmuggling an additional charge into the case\u201d to try to bolster other accusers\u2019 credibility.",
      "One of the others, Miriam Haley, testified last week that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser in the case, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify later.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name sexual assault accusers without their permission, which Haley, Mann and Sokola have given.",

      "A Texas man associated with a neo-Nazi group has been convicted of posting threats to lynch and kill Nashville District Attorney General Glenn Funk",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A Texas man associated with a neo-Nazi group was convicted on Wednesday of posting threats to lynch and kill Nashville District Attorney General Glenn Funk after another group member was charged with attacking a downtown bar worker.",
      "David Aaron Bloyed, 60, of Frost, Texas, was found guilty by a federal jury in Nashville of one count of communicating a threat in interstate commerce, according to a news release from the U.S. Department of Justice. He faces up to five years in prison at sentencing.",
      "Bloyed was found to have posted a photograph of Funk with the caption, \u201cGetting the rope,\u201d and an emoji finger pointed towards Funk\u2019s image. A second post included a drawing of a person hanging by the neck from a gallows, with the phrase, \u201cThe \u2018Rope List\u2019 grew by a few more Nashville jews today.\u201d Both included swastika symbols.",
      "Funk was targeted after a group of white supremacist, antisemitic and neo-Nazi provocateurs came to Nashville last summer and began livestreaming antics for shock value \u2014 waving swastika flags through crowded streets, singing hate songs on the downtown courthouse steps, and even briefly disrupting a Metro Council meeting.",
      "At one point, a fight broke out between a bar worker and a member of the group, who used metal flagpole with a swastika affixed to the top to hit the employee. The group member was charged with aggravated assault. The bar worker was also charged in the tussle.",
      "\u201cAntisemitic hate has no place in Nashville or anywhere, and this verdict shows these hateful threats for what they are: a crime,\u201d Acting U.S. Attorney Robert E. McGuire for the Middle District of Tennessee, said in a news release.",

      "A pathologist hired by attorneys for death row inmates says a South Carolina man executed by firing squad was conscious and likely in extreme pain for as long as a minute",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A man who was put to death last month in South Carolina's second firing squad execution was conscious and likely in extreme pain for as long as a minute after the bullets, meant to quickly stop his heart, struck him lower than expected, according to a pathologist hired by his attorneys.",
      "An autopsy photo of Mikal Mahdi's torso showed only two distinct wounds from the three volunteer prison employees who all had live ammunition in the April 11 execution, according to the pathologist's report, which was filed Thursday with a letter to the state Supreme Court titled \u201cnotice of botched execution.\u201d",
      "Prison workers suggested two bullets entered his body at the same spot.",
      "\u201cThe shooters missed the intended target area and the evidence indicates that he was struck by only two bullets, not the prescribed three. Consequently, the nature of the internal injuries from the gunshot wounds resulted in a more prolonged death process,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Arden, a pathologist hired by attorneys for condemned inmates.",
      "Arden said that likely meant Mahdi took 30 to 60 seconds to lose consciousness \u2014 two to four times longer than the 15 seconds that experts including Arden and ones hired by the state predicted for a properly conducted firing squad execution.",
      "During that time Mahdi would have suffered excruciating pain as his lungs tried to expand and move into a broken sternum and ribs, as well as from \u201cair hunger\u201d as the damaged lungs struggled and failed to bring in needed oxygen, Arden said.",
      "Witnesses to the execution heard Mahdi cry out as the shots were fired, groan again some 45 seconds later and let out one last low moan just before he appeared to draw his final breath at 75 seconds.",
      "Mahdi, 42, was executed after admitting he killed Orangeburg Public Safety officer James Myers in 2004, shooting him at least eight times before burning his body. Myers\u2019 wife found him in the couple\u2019s Calhoun County shed, which had been the backdrop to their wedding 15 months earlier.",
      "Prison officials have given no indication that there were problems with Mahdi's execution. A shield law keeps many details private, including the training and methods used by the firing squad.",
      "The official autopsy did not include X-rays to allow the results to be independently verified; only one photo was taken of Mahdi\u2019s body, and no close-ups of the wounds; and his clothing was not examined to determine where the target was placed and how it aligned with the damage the bullets caused to his shirt, Arden said in a report summarizing his findings.",
      "\u201cI noticed where the target was placed on Mikal\u2019s torso, and I remember thinking to myself, \u2018I\u2019m certainly not an expert in human anatomy, but it appears to me that target looks low,\u2019\u201d said David Weiss, an attorney for Mahdi who was also a witness at his death.",
      "In the official autopsy report, pathologist Dr. Bradley Marcus wrote that the reason there were only two wounds is that one could have been caused by two bullets entering the body at the same spot. Marcus said he spoke to an unnamed prison official who reported that when the three volunteer firing squad members practice, sometimes their targets end up with just one or two holes from three live rounds.",
      "Arden called that virtually unheard of in his 40 years of examining dead bodies and said Marcus told him in a conversation that the possibility was remote.",
      "The autopsy found damage in only one of the four chambers of Mahdi's heart \u2014 the right ventricle. There was extensive damage to his liver and pancreas as the bullets continued down.",
      "\u201cThe entrance wounds were at the lowest area of the chest, just above the border with the abdomen, which is an area not largely overlying the heart,\u201d Arden wrote.",
      "In their conversation Marcus also said the severe amount of liver damage was not anticipated and he \u201cexpected the entrance wounds to be higher on the chest,\u201d Arden wrote in his report.",
      "In contrast the autopsy on Brad Sigmon, the first man killed by firing squad in the state, showed three distinct bullet wounds and his heart was obliterated, Arden said. He added that the autopsy report in that case included X-rays, adequate photos and a cursory examination of his clothes.",
      "Without X-rays or other internal scans to follow the path of the bullets through Mahdi\u2019s body, no additional light could be shed on the two-bullets-through-one-hole claim, Arden said.",
      "Weiss said he was stunned that so little was done in the autopsy even after the pathologist saw only two holes in his chest. The apparent errors in how the execution was carried out are a major problem, he asserted.",
      "\u201cHis heart was missed, and in all likelihood only two out of three shots were fired,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cAnd I think that raises incredibly difficult questions about the type of training and oversight that is going into this process.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was obvious to me as a lay person upon reading his autopsy report that something went wrong here. We should want to figure out what it was that went wrong when you\u2019ve got state government carrying out the most serious, most grave possible type of function,\u201d Weiss said.",
      "Mahdi's body was cremated preventing a second autopsy, Weiss said.",
      "South Carolina allows condemned inmates to choose whether to die by lethal injection, electric chair or firing squad. Three in the past year have chosen lethal injection, but the past two opted for the firing squad, saying they feared the other methods \u2014 autopsies have shown that lethal injection causes a rush of fluid into the lungs, and burns have been found on bodies after electrocutions.",
      "Twenty-six people remain on South Carolina's death row. Stephen Stanko, who has two death sentences for murders in Horry County and Georgetown County, has run out of appeals and likely will be scheduled to die in June.",

    "story": [
      "The trial of a Michigan police officer charged with second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of a 26-year-old Black man has ended in a mistrial",
      "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- A jury couldn\u2019t reached a unanimous verdict Thursday in the second-degree murder trial of a Michigan police officer who shot Patrick Lyoya, a Black man, following a traffic stop in 2022.",
      "The judge declared a mistrial and ended the proceedings, a partial victory for Christopher Schurr, who still could face another trial. Lyoya\u2019s death had sparked weeks of protest in Grand Rapids, especially after the city\u2019s police chief released video of the confrontation.",
      "Schurr shot Lyoya, a Congolese immigrant, in the back of the head while the 26-year-old lay facedown on the ground. Schurr told jurors that he feared his life was at stake after losing control of his Taser during an intense struggle in a residential neighborhood.",
      "\u201cThank you for your time,\u201d Judge Christina Mims told the jury.",
      "The mistrial came a day after three former Memphis police officers were acquitted in the beating death of Tyre Nichols after a traffic stop. His death more than two years ago was the first post-George Floyd case that revealed the limits of an unprecedented reckoning over police reform and racial injustice in Black America.",
      "Schurr, a seven-year veteran of the Grand Rapids police department, was fired shortly after he was charged in 2022.",
      "Schurr stopped a Nissan Altima driven by Lyoya for improper license plates on April 4, 2022.",
      "Body camera and dash camera footage showed Lyoya running after Schurr requested his driver\u2019s license. Schurr tackled him and a struggle ensued. The officer tried to subdue Lyoya by firing his Taser but he was unsuccessful.",
      "Lyoya eventually got control of the device, which fires electrically charged probes, and Schurr repeatedly demanded that he stop resisting and drop the Taser.",
      "Schurr was on top of Lyoya when he shot him in the head. Videos were a key part of trial and were repeatedly shown to the jury.",
      "The struggle with the Taser was central to Schurr\u2019s defense. He testified that he was \u201crunning on fumes\u201d after the fight and in great fear because a Taser can cause \u201cexcruciating pain\u201d and injury.",
      "\u201cI believed that if I hadn\u2019t done it at that time, I wasn\u2019t going to go home,\u201d Schurr said of shooting Lyoya.",
      "The prosecutor, however, argued that the Taser had already been deployed twice by Schurr by that time and could only be used in a different mode if Lyoya had decided to turn it against the officer.",
      "It\u2019s not known why Lyoya was trying to flee. Records show his driver\u2019s license was revoked at the time and there was an arrest warrant for him in a domestic violence case, though Schurr didn\u2019t know it. An autopsy revealed his blood-alcohol level was three times above the legal limit for driving, according to testimony.",
      "Lyoya ultimately joined a list of other Black immigrants who sought better lives in the U.S., only to suffer abuse or death at the hands of law enforcement. Before him were Botham Jean, Amadou Diallo and Abner Louima \u2014 all men whose cases increased awareness around the global impact of systemic racism in policing.",
      "As in many U.S. cities, Grand Rapids police have been occasionally criticized over the use of force, particularly against Black people, who make up 18% of the population.",

      "But there was nothing quite like hearing from the victim himself \u2014 in this case, an AI-generated version.",
      "In what's believed to be a first in U.S. courts, Pelkey\u2019s family used artificial intelligence to create a video using his likeness to give him a voice. The AI rendering of Pelkey told the shooter during the sentencing hearing last week that it was a shame they had to meet that day in 2021 under those circumstances \u2014 and that the two of them probably could have been friends in another life.",
      "\u201cI believe in forgiveness and in God who forgives. I always have and I still do,\u201d Pelkey's avatar told Gabriel Paul Horcasitas.",
      "The AI version of Pelkey went on to share advice for people to make the most of each day and to love each other, not knowing how much time one might have left.",
      "While use of artificial intelligence within the court system is expanding, it's typically been reserved for administrative tasks, legal research, case preparation. In Arizona, it's helped inform the public of rulings in significant cases.",
      "Using AI to generate victim impact statements marks a new \u2014 and legal, at least in Arizona \u2014 tool for sharing information with the court outside the evidentiary phases.",
      "Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Todd Lang, who presided over the road rage case, said after watching the video that he imagined Pelkey, who was 37 at the time of his killing, would have felt that way after learning about him. Lang also noted the video said something about Pelkey's family, who had expressed their anger over his death and had asked for Horcasitas to receive the maximum sentence.",
      "Horcasitas was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 10.5 imprisonment.",
      "\u201cEven though that's what you wanted, you allowed Chris to speak from his heart as you saw it,\" Lang said.",
      "The Associated Press left phone and emailed messages Wednesday seeking comment from Horcasitas' lawyer.",
      "Pelkey\u2019s sister, Stacey Wales, raised the idea of her brother speaking for himself.",
      "For years, while the case worked its way through the legal system, Wales said she thought about what she would say at the sentencing hearing. She struggled to get words down on paper.",
      "But when she thought about what her brother would say to the shooter, knowing he would have forgiven him, the words poured out of her.",
      "In Arizona, victims can give their impact statements in any digital format, said victims\u2019 rights attorney Jessica Gattuso, who represented the family.",
      "Arizona Supreme Court Justice Ann Timmer didn't address the road rage case specifically in an interview Wednesday. But she said the rise in popularity and accessibility to AI in recent years led to the formation of a committee to research best practices in the courts.",
      "Gary Marchant, a member of the committee and a law professor at Arizona State University, said he understands why Pelkey\u2019s family did it. But he warned the use of this technology could open the door to more people trying to introduce AI-generated evidence into courtrooms.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a real concern among the judiciary and among lawyers that deepfake evidence will be increasingly used,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to create it and anyone can do it on a phone, and it could be incredibly influential because judges and juries, just like all of us, are used to believing what you see.\u201d",
      "Marchant pointed to a recent case in New York, where a man without a lawyer used an AI-generated avatar to argue his case in a lawsuit via video. It took only seconds for the judges on the appeals court to realize that the man addressing them from the video screen didn\u2019t exist at all.",
      "In the Arizona case, Wales said the AI-generated video worked because the judge had nearly 50 letters from family and friends that echoed the video's message.",
      "\u201cThere was a solid gold thread through all of those stories \u2014 that was the heart of Chris,\u201d Wales said. \u201cThis works because it talks about the kind of person Chris was.\u201d",

      "A poll finds that as the Social Security Administration undergoes massive changes and staffing cuts ushered in by the Trump administration, an increasing share of older Americans, particularly Democrats, aren\u2019t confident the benefit will be available t...",
      "WASHINGTON -- As the Social Security Administration undergoes massive changes and staffing cuts ushered in by the Trump administration, an increasing share of older Americans \u2014 particularly Democrats \u2014 aren't confident the benefit will be available to them, a poll shows.",
      "The share of older Americans who are \u201cnot very\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d confident has risen somewhat since 2023, according to the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in April. In the poll, about 3 in 10 U.S. adults age 60 or older are \u201cnot very\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d confident that Social Security benefits will be there for them when they need it, up from about 2 in 10 in an AP-NORC poll conducted in 2023.",
      "That shift looks very different depending on older Americans' political party, though. There has been a substantial decrease in confidence among older Democrats. About half of Democrats age 60 or older are \u201cnot very\u201d or \u201cnot at all confident\u201d that Social Security will be there for them when they need it, a sizable swing from 2023, when only about 1 in 10 said they were \u201cnot very\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d confident.",
      "Older Republicans, on the other hand, have become more confident that Social Security will be there for them. In contrast with older Democrats, about 6 in 10 Republicans age 60 or older are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d confident that Social Security will be there when they need it, up from only about one-quarter who thought this in 2023.",
      "The findings point to a partisan divide in the ongoing debate over the benefits program, which serves millions of people. When the 2023 poll was conducted, a Democratic president, Joe Biden, was in the White House, which may have contributed to older Democrats' confidence in the program. Now, large changes including mass federal worker layoffs, cuts to programs and office closures are being ushered in by Republican President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, led by billionaire adviser Elon Musk. A planned cut to nationwide Social Security phone services was eventually walked back.",
      "Musk, who recently said he is preparing to wind down his role with the Trump administration, garnered widespread condemnation when, in March, he said on a podcast interview with Joe Rogan that the Social Security program is a \u201cPonzi scheme.\u201d",
      "Those comments have caused some voters to feel less confident in the future of the program.",
      "Dennis Riera, a 65-year-old Republican in Huntington Beach, California, says Musk\u2019s comments have made him feel very worried.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really a shame that something that so many people have relied on for so many generations is being looked at as a Ponzi scheme,\u201d Riera said. He has not yet retired from his job as a security official in the entertainment sector and doesn\u2019t know when he will be able to.",
      "\u201cWhat is their purpose in trying to undermine this institution?\u201d he said.",
      "But Linda Seck, a 78-year-old Republican and retired nurse from Saline Township in Michigan, says she\u2019s very confident about the future of Social Security.",
      "\u201cWhen I was in college, financial planners were telling us not to depend on Social Security, but here we are more than 50 years later and it's still going,\u201d she said.",
      "Voters in recent weeks have flooded town halls to express their displeasure with the cuts, and both political parties expect Social Security to emerge as a key issue in next year\u2019s midterm elections. The upheaval has made Social Security a major focus of Democrats, including Biden, who said Trump has \u201ctaken a hatchet\u201d to the program.",
      "Timothy Black, a 52-year-old Democrat who lives in San Diego, receives Social Security Disability Insurance payments to manage his chronic illness. He said his concern is not only for the retirement portion of Social Security but also for the agency\u2019s disability benefits arm.",
      "\u201cIf anything happens to Social Security it would really impact me,\u201d he said, listing the bills and expenses he has to pay to survive. \u201cIf SSDI doesn\u2019t keep up with the cost of living, my medical expenses are only going to grow and I could end up homeless.\u201d",
      "The Social Security Administration has for decades moved closer toward its go-broke date, when it will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035, according to the 2024 Social Security and Medicare trustees report.",
      "Social Security would then only be able to pay 83% of benefits. A common misconception is that Social Security would be completely unable to pay benefits once it reaches its go-broke date.",
      "Roughly 72.5 million people, including retirees and children, receive Social Security benefits.",
      "Older Americans are generally more confident that Social Security will be available to them than younger adults are, according to the poll. About half of U.S. adults under age 30 are \u201cnot very\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d confident that Social Security will be there for them, which is unchanged from 2023.",
      "That skepticism transcends party loyalty. Younger Republicans aren't sure, on the whole, whether Social Security will be around to benefit them. Only about 2 in 10 Republicans under age 60 are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d confident that Social Security will be available to them when they need it.",
      "But younger people's confidence in Social Security was low when Biden was president, too. Steven Peters, a 42-year-old independent from White House, Tennessee, says for years he's heard warnings about the program's precarious finances.",

      "It's going to be a very sexy summer, a touch of romantic, cowboy and rock and roll.",
      "That's according to Mehdi Sousanne, at least. And he should know. He's a designer for Zara who helps create the clothes for a brand that's one of the most successful stories in High Street fashion.",
      "Zara is owned by Inditex, the world's biggest fashion retailer, which runs a string of store chains including Massimo Dutti and Pull & Bear.",
      "It relies on 1,800 suppliers across the world, but nearly all the clothes are brought to Spain where the company is based, to be despatched to stores in 97 countries.",
      "Zara doesn't advertise and rarely gives interviews. But as it marks 50 years since the opening of its first store, I've come to its vast campus in Galicia to meet the boss and workers for a rare glimpse into how the secretive brand operates.",
      "It's a time when the company finds itself having to navigate fast-changing markets, with growing competition from ultra-cheap online players Shein and Temu, who ship their goods direct from China, as well as uncertainty surrounding US tariffs.",
      "But Oscar Garcia Maceiras, Inditex's CEO, says US President Donald Trump's tariffs won't disrupt its supply chains or change Zara's plans to expand further in the US, now its second biggest market.",
      "\"Bear in mind that for us, diversification is key. We are producing in almost 50 different markets with non-exclusive suppliers so we are more than used to adapt ourselves to change,\" he tells me.",
      "The business has certainly adapted and grown since its first store opened a short drive away in the town of A Coruna.",
      "It now has 350 designers, with the staff coming from some 40 different countries.",
      "\"There are no rules in general. It's all about feelings,\" says Mehdi, who works on delivering the key pieces for the season.",
      "He says inspiration can come from anyone ranging from the \"street\" to the cinema\u00a0 as well as the catwalks. He likes to sketch his ideas once an all-important mood board has been created.",
      "In the pattern cutting room, the designs are turned into paper samples, and are pinned on to mannequins. Dozens of seamstresses then run up the first fabric samples on the spot for a first fitting.",
      "Pattern maker Mar Marcote has been with the business 42 years and still uses a magnifying glass to examine each item of clothing before it finally goes into production.",
      "\"When you finish the item and see that it looks good, and then sometimes sells out, it's marvellous,\" she says.",
      "Zara is a business that has changed the way we shop.",
      "In the old days, retailers released just two main collections a year, Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter. For decades, most chains have outsourced manufacturing to lower-cost factories in the far east with the clothes arriving up to six months later.",
      "Zara went against conventional wisdom by sourcing a lot of its clothes closer to home and changing products much more frequently. That meant it could respond much faster to the latest trends and drop new items into stores every week.",
      "Just over half of its clothes are made in Spain, Portugal, Morocco and Turkey. There's a factory doing small production runs on site at HQ, with another seven nearby, which it also owns.",
      "As a result, it can turn around products in a matter of weeks.",
      "More basic fashion staples are produced with longer lead times in countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh.",
      "Logistics and data are other factors behind its success. Every piece of clothing is packaged and despatched from its distribution centres in Spain, as well as one in the Netherlands.",
      "\"What is absolutely critical is the level of accuracy,\" says CEO Mr Maceiras.",
      "\"It's something that allows us to make the right decision in the last possible minute, in order to assess properly the appetite from our customers, in order to adapt our fashion proposition to the profile of our customers in different locations.\"",
      "In other words, getting the right products to the right shops.",
      "At HQ, product managers then receive real-time data on how clothes are selling in stores worldwide, and \u2013 crucially \u2013 feedback from customers, which is then shared with designers and buyers, who can adjust the ranges along the season according to demand.",
      "Unlike some other High Street rivals, it only discounts when it stages its twice-yearly sales.",
      "But is Zara starting to lose its shine after posting slower sales growth at the start of this year?",
      "\"The key challenge for Inditex is continuing to be relevant in a fashion world that continues to get faster and cheaper,\" says William Woods, European retail analyst for Bernstein.",
      "Not only are mainstream rivals like H&M, Mango and Uniqlo trying to catch up, the market has been disrupted by Shein and Temu.",
      "Shein racked up $38bn in global sales last year, just a whisker behind Inditex.",
      "Asked how much of a threat Shein and Temu's success poses to Zara, Mr Maceiras stresses that its business model doesn't rely on price.",
      "\"Of course, we are looking at providing our customers our products at an affordable price. But for us, it's critical to provide customers fashion that should be inspirational, with quality, creativity and sustainable.\"",
      "Zara has come a long way since its founder Amancio Ortega started the business.",
      "The company is still majority-owned by his family and his daughter Marta is now chairwoman of the group.",
      "Now aged 89, Mr Ortega remains famously reclusive but still pops in, according to Mr Maceiras.",
      "\"He's a presence, a physical or moral presence, absolutely every day.\""

      "From the US perspective, the trebling of tariffs is a tax on foreigners that \"wins\" revenue for US Treasury. From the UK perspective, the tariff is a tax on domestic consumers that increases inflation, so a lower value is in and of itself good.",
      "Over at the Bank of England, the lack of retaliation and acceptance of diverted goods from Asia are among the reasons that inflation is now rising more gently, which has enabled today's interest rate cut with more to come.",
      "The Governor Andrew Bailey told me that he hoped the deal would mark the first of many which would calm global trade tensions.",
      "The real win here could be that this agreement on tariffs will keep the US sweet whilst leaving the door open to a substantive deal with the European Union.",
      "By maintaining UK food standards and not, for example, accepting hormone treated beef or chlorinated chicken, a \"full fat\" food and farm export deal with the EU, similar to Switzerland's, is now clearly on the cards in the next fortnight. This could slash post Brexit red tape for key exporters both ways.",
      "Then you have an overall picture of a growing economy, with good trade relations with the US, EU, India and soon the Gulf too, with rates being cut.",
      "The Government will try to project the UK as an oasis of trade and political stability in a tumultuous world, after years of turmoil. It is a world away from the recessionary negativity at the turn of the year, and it might just work.",

    "story": [
      "UK interest rates have been cut to 4.25% from 4.5% and the governor of the Bank England has hinted more could follow in the coming months.",
      "Andrew Bailey said he would not \"give predictions as to when and how much\", but said he was \"still of the view that the path, gradually and carefully, is downwards\".",
      "The reduction in rates on Thursday marks the fourth cut within the past year and the Bank considered an even bigger cut to 4% due to concerns the global trade war could hit UK economic growth.",
      "Mr Bailey welcomed a UK-US deal on tariffs and said it was \"important as a signal, I hope, of many more to come\", adding a UK trade deal with the European Union would be \"beneficial\".",
      "\"Maybe we need a bit of a jolt to the system to remind us that trade is important,\" Mr Bailey said, adding he hoped the likes of deals between the UK and US, and the UK and India, would help to \"rebuild the world trading system\".",
      "On Thursday, the UK and US announced a deal to avoid tariffs on certain goods in order to boost trade.",
      "As it announced the latest cut in interest rates, the Bank said that while a trade war could hit economic growth, it could lead to lower inflation in the UK over time as countries such as China look to divert cheap goods originally bound for America.",
      "Mr Bailey said the path for rates was \"downwards\", but said future rate cuts were likely to be \"gradual and careful\".",
      "The minutes of the Bank's meeting showed the rate-setting committee was divided. Of the nine members, five voted to cut rates to 4.25%, two voted in favour of a larger reduction to 4% and two voted for no change.",
      "The Bank's base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.",
      "More than eight in 10 customers have fixed-rate deals, but could continue to face higher repayment costs when renewing.",
      "However, mortgage rates have been edging down recently, primarily because the markets and lenders expect further rate cuts this year.  On Thursday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.14%, while a five-year deal was 5.08%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.",
      "About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so rates being cut will have an impact on monthly repayments.",
      "A typical tracker mortgage-holder is likely to see about \u00a329 knocked off their monthly repayments following the latest cut, said the banking trade body UK Finance.",
      "Homeowner Vanda, who has a tracker, told the BBC she had a \"really good rate\", but then got \"caught out\" when rates were previously increased.",
      "\"A drop would help because I've just been made redundant, so that would help a wee bit. I don't think it will ever go back to the way it was, though,\" she said.",
      "Interest rates are the Bank's main tool in try to maintain the annual rate of inflation at, or close to, its target of 2%.",
      "The most recent UK inflation figures show prices rose 2.6% in the year to March. However, the rate is expected to jump following a series of household bill increases at the start of April \u2013 including energy and water prices.",
      "The Bank said it expected inflation to rise \"temporarily\" to 3.5% this year due to the bill increases before falling back due lower oil and gas prices set to feed through in the coming months.",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "UK inflation rate: How quickly are prices rising?",
      "The theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing.",
      "But it is a balancing act as high interest rates can harm the economy as businesses hold off on investing in production and jobs.",
      "The Bank expects UK growth for the first three months of this year to be stronger than it originally forecast at 0.6%, boosted by US firms stockpiling goods ahead of Trump's tariffs coming into effect. The official figures are set to be released next week.",
      "A boost in growth would be welcome news to the government, which has made growing the economy its main priority in order to boost living standards.",
      "The government's Budget decision to increase National Insurance last month for employers kicked in last month, but the Bank said the effect of the tax increase \"appears to have been fairly small to date\", though it added business confidence had taken a hit in recent months.",
      "A lot of firms are taking a \"wait and see\" approach to whether the UK economy picks up before hiring and investing, it said.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the latest rate cut was \"welcome news\", but added: \"There is more to do, and I know families are still facing cost of living pressures.",
      "Mr Bailey said the UK had \"still a lot to do\" on growth: \"We have seen over the last, really since the financial crisis, 15 years or so now, the rates of growth be consistently lower than they were before that.\"",

      "High above the Arctic Circle, the archipelago of Svalbard lies halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole.",
      "Frozen, mountainous, and remote, it's home to hundreds of polar bears and a couple of sparse settlements.",
      "One of those is Longyearbyen, the world's northernmost town, and just outside the settlement, in a decommissioned coal mine, is The Arctic World Archive (AWA) - an  underground vault for data.",
      "Customers pay to have their data stored on film and kept in the vault, for potentially hundreds of years.",
      "\"This is a place to make sure that information survives technology obsolescence, time and ageing. That's our mission,\" says founder Rune Bjerkestrand, leading the way inside.",
      "Switching on head-torches we descended a dark passageway and followed the old rail tracks 300 metres into the mountainside, until we reached the archive's metal door.",
      "Inside the vault, stands a shipping container stacked with silver packets, each containing reels of film, on which the data is stored.",
      "\"It's a lot of memories, a lot of heritage,\" Mr Bjerkestrand says.",
      "\"It's anything from digitised art pieces, literature, music, motion picture, you name it.\"",
      "Since the archive's launch eight years ago, more than 100 deposits have been made by institutions, companies and individuals, from 30-plus countries.",
      "Among the many digitised artefacts are 3D scans and models of the Taj Mahal; tranches of ancient manuscripts from the Vatican Library; satellite observations of Earth from space; and Norway's treasured painting, the Scream, by Edvard Munck.",
      "The AWA is a commercial operation and relies on technology provided by Norwegian data preservation company, Piql, which Mr Bjerkestrand also heads.",
      "It was inspired by the Global Seed Vault, a seed bank that's located only a few hundred metres away, a repository where crops can be recovered after natural or manmade disasters.",
      "\"Today, there are a lot of risks to information and data,\" said Mr Bjerkstand. \"There is terrorism, war, cyber hackers.\"",
      "According to him, Svalbard is the perfect place, for hosting a secure data storage facility.",
      "\"It's far away from everything! Far away from wars, crisis, terrorism, disasters. What could be safer!\"",
      "Underground it's dark, dry and chilly, with temperatures remaining sub-zero all year-round; conditions which Mr Bjerkestrand claims are ideal for keeping the film safe for centuries.",
      "Should global warming cause the thick Arctic permafrost to thaw, the vault is still robust enough to preserve its contents he says.",
      "At the back of the chamber, another large metal box contains GitHub's Code Vault.",
      "The software developer has archived hundreds of reels of open source code here, which are the building blocks underpinning computer operating systems, software, websites and apps.",
      "Programming languages, AI tools, and every active public repository on its platform, written by its 150 million users, are also stored here.",
      "\"It's incredibly important for humanity to secure the future of software, it's become so critical to our day to day lives,\" Githhub's chief operating officer, Kyle Daigle tells the BBC.",
      "His firm has explored a variety of long-term storage solutions, he said, and there are challenges. \"Some of our existing mechanisms can be stored for a very long time, but you need technology to read them.\"",
      "At Piql's headquarters in southern Norway, data files are encoded onto photosensitive film.",
      "\"Data is a sequence of bits and bytes,\" explains senior product developer, Alexey Mantsev, as film ran through a spool at his fingertips.",
      "\"We convert the sequence of the bits which come from our clients data into images. Every image [or frame] is about eight million pixels.\"",
      "Once these images are exposed and developed, the processed film appears grey, but viewed more closely, it's similar to a mass of tiny QR codes.",
      "The information can't be deleted or changed, and is easily retrievable explains Mr Mantsev.",
      "\"We can scan it back, and decode the data just the same way as reading data from a hard drive, but we will be reading data from the film.\"",
      "One key question arising with long-term storage methods, is whether people will understand what has been preserved and how to recover it, centuries into the future.",
      "That's a scenario Piql has also thought about, and so a guide that can be magnified and read optically, is printed onto the film, as well.",
      "Every day more data is being used and generated than ever before, but experts have long warned of a potential \"digital Dark Age\", as technological advances render previous software and hardware obsolete.",
      "That could mean the files and formats we use now, face a similar fate to the floppy disks and DVD drives of the past.",
      "Many firms offer long-term data storage.",
      "Cassettes of magnetic tape known as LTO (Linear Tape Open), are the most common form, but newer innovations promise to revolutionise how we preserve information.",
      "For example, Microsoft's Project Silica has developed 2mm-thick panes of glass, onto which chunks of data is transferred by powerful lasers.",
      "Meanwhile a team of scientists from the University of Southhampton have created a so-called 5D memory crystal, which has saved a record of the human genome.",
      "That's also been placed in the Memory of Mankind repository, another vault safeguarding historic documents, hidden in a salt mine in Austria.",
      "The Arctic World Archive receives deposits three times a year, and as the BBC visited, recordings of endangered languages and the manuscripts of the composer Chopin, were among the latest reels placed in the vault.",

      "This has been cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, which matches the number of cars the UK exported last year.",

      "In a detailed timeline, it said the fire at the North Hyde substation, which was built in the 1960s, started at 23:21 GMT on 20 March and resulted in a \"simultaneous loss of connection\".",
      "The power outage affected 66,919 domestic and commercial customers, including Heathrow Airport, Neso said.",

      "Neso's chief executive Fintan Slye said: \"It is important that the right lessons are learnt from this incident to prevent future instances where possible and to manage them effectively when they do occur.\"",
      "Power was restored to Heathrow's substations by 06:25 using circuits from another nearby substation, Neso said, and the flow of electricity to all four of Heathrow's passenger terminals was restarted by 10:56.",
      "But Flights did not resume until after 18:00 that day, once safety checks were completed. Planes were able to land and take off through the night to allow Heathrow to get back up to full capacity.",

      "Heathrow relies on three electricity substations, and has emergency back-up power supplies, such as diesel generators and batteries - but these only keep crucial safety systems running, such as landing equipment and runway lights.",
      "Heathrow's chief executive Thomas Woldbye previously said the shutdown was caused not by a lack of power but by the time it took to switch from the damaged substation's supply to the other operational substations.",
      "Due to Heathrow's \"size and operational complexity\", managers decided to close the airport on safety grounds while this took place.",
      "The airport said at the time that its objective \"was to reopen as soon as safely and practically possible after the fire\".",
      "Neso confirmed that the restoration of power to the airport was followed by \"a period of safety checking\" to ensure \"safety critical systems were fully operational prior to passengers arriving at the airport\".",

      "London Fire Brigade (LFB), which sent 70 firefighters, previously said that the substation blaze \"involved a transformer containing insulating oil which was fully alight\".",
      "\"This created a significant hazard due to being within a substation containing high-voltage equipment and the challenges of an oil-fuelled fire,\" it said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Apple is asking an appeals court to pause a US district judge's recent ruling in a case which could determine the future of its highly lucrative App Store.",
      "Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found last week the tech giant wilfully violated an order she had previously made in a case filed by Fortnite-maker Epic Games.",
      "That order - handed down in 2021 - demanded Apple refrain from anti-competitive conduct and pricing and allow outside payment options in the App Store.",
      "Last week she determined Apple was flouting that demand - a finding Apple has now called \"extraordinary.\"",
      "The iPhone maker has alleged in a court filing that her order unlawfully prevents the company from controlling \"core aspects of its business operations.\"",
      "\"A federal court cannot force Apple to permanently give away free access to its products and services, including intellectual property,\" the company's lawyers wrote.",
      "Case origins",
      "Both of Judge Gonzalez Rogers' judgements stem from an antitrust case filed by Epic Games.",
      "In 2020, Epic accused the iPhone-maker of possessing an illegal monopoly with its App Store, which collected commissions of between 15% and 30% on in-app purchases.",
      "The judge rejected Epic's monopoly claims, but found Apple was stopping developers from giving users alternative payment options in violation of California competition rules.",
      "She ordered Apple to make changes that would help developers steer customers to cheaper payment options outside of the Apple ecosystem.",
      "Last year, Epic accused Apple of failing to comply by creating a new set of fees for developers instead.",
      "In a contempt order last week, Judge Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple continued to interfere with competition, saying that internal company documents showed Apple deliberately violated her 2021 injunction.",
      "'Substantial sums'",
      "On Wednesday, Apple requested an appeals court take action, including by lifting a ban that stops it from charging developers fees on purchases made outside the App Store.",
      "The company wrote that such restrictions \"will cost Apple substantial sums annually\" and are based on conduct that has not been found unlawful.",
      "\"Rather, they were imposed to punish Apple for purported non-compliance with an earlier state-law Injunction that is itself invalid,\" Apple wrote.",
      "In response, Epic Games said Judge Gonzalez Rogers' contempt order last week was already benefitting consumers.",
      "\"Apple has faced a surge of genuine competition as developers have updated their apps with better payment methods, better deals, and better consumer choice,\" Epic wrote in a post on the social media platform X.",
      "The company criticized Apple's motion as \"a last ditch effort to block competition and extract massive junk fees at the expense of consumers and developers.\"",
      "Epic says it is on track with plans to bring Fortnite back to iPhones and iPads.",
      "Apple removed Fortnite from its App Store in 2020 after Epic unveiled an in-app payment system into the game.",
      "The move led to the current court battle between the two companies.",
      "Apple did not directly addresses Judge Gonzalez Rogers' stunning rebuke of company executives in its court filing.",
      "In her most recent order, she said CEO Tim Cook ignored executive Phillip Schiller's urging to have Apple comply with her injunction, and allowed then-Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri to convince him not to.",
      "\"Cook chose poorly,\" she wrote.",
      "The company documents she reviewed reveal \"that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option\", she wrote.",
      "Judge Gonzalez Rogers said she would refer the matter to the US Attorney for Northern District of California to investigate if a criminal contempt proceeding against Apple is appropriate.",
      "Apple said last week it would comply with the court's order while it appeals.",

      "Powell said if Trump's tariff policies remain in place they were likely \"to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and an increase in unemployment\".",
      "Typically, the Fed cuts rates if it believes the economy is struggling and raises them if prices start to rise too quickly.",

      "US-China trade",
      "Officials from the US and China are set to meet this week, but the scope of the talks remains unclear. Trump on Wednesday dismissed the idea of lowering tariff rates pre-emptively to help trade negotiations.",
      "Powell said the talks had the potential to change the economic picture \"materially\".",
      "\"Usually, things clarify and the appropriate direction becomes clear,\" he said. \"Right now it's very hard to say what that would be. In the meantime, the economy is doing fine.\"",
      "The US economy shrank in the first three months of the year for the first time since 2022. But officials said those figures had been distorted by firms rushing goods into the country ahead of tariffs rather than a decline in wider activity.",
      "Hiring remained unexpectedly strong last month, keeping the unemployment rate near historic lows of 4.2% while the US stock market has largely recovered from the sharp declines it saw last month.",
      "Powell said those figures gave the Fed time to wait.",

      "The hope is that the deal will benefit the economies of both countries.",
      "The British government said the deal was the \"biggest and most economically significant\" trade agreement the UK had signed since leaving the European Union in 2020.",
      "Here's a quick guide to what's been agreed and what it could mean for you.",

      "electrical machinery",
      "The deal will also allow British firms to compete for more services contracts in India.",
      "What will be the impact on people in the UK and India?",
      "The trade deal won't come into force for up to a year, so don't expect to notice any immediate changes.",
      "Over time though, the UK government says lowering tariffs on the likes of clothing, jewellery, and frozen prawns \"could\" lead to cheaper prices and more choice.",
      "This deal could also be a big win for UK businesses which manufacture the goods which have seen tariffs slashed, such as car makers and whisky distillers.",
      "For example, tariffs on whisky and gin being imported to India from the UK will be halved from 150% to 75% before reducing to 40% by the 10th year of the deal. Car tariffs will fall from more than 100% to 10%.",
      "That will provide a boost to those two industries, which look set to be hit hard by US tariffs, as it will mean Indian companies wanting to import those products will pay less import charges than before.",
      "If businesses end up exporting more goods to India and make higher profits, this could lead to them spending more on hiring staff, investing and also paying more tax.",
      "In India, consumers could see much more choice among the goods which have been included under the deal. Clothing manufacturing businesses and jewellers will also be able to access the UK market which will boost their margins.",
      "How important is this for the UK and India?",
      "This deal has been a long time in the making, with on-off negotiations going on for some three years.",
      "However it appears US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on goods entering America has prompted other world leaders to consider striking free-trade deals with one another.",
      "The UK's deal with India is its third biggest after its agreements with Australia and Japan. For context, the UK has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with about 70 countries and one with the EU.",
      "The EU is the biggest trade partner for both the UK and India. Therefore, a free trade agreement between India and the EU would be more significant than the one with the UK. Both India and the EU have said they aim to finalise this by the end of 2025.",
      "Last year trade between the UK and India totalled \u00a342bn. The UK government has said this deal would boost that trade by an additional \u00a325.5bn a year by 2040.",
      "It is said over time it will boost the UK economy by \u00a34.8bn. This is a tiny proportion of the UK economy which was worth \u00a32,851bn last year.",
      "However, India is also forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years. It is also home to 1.45bn people - about 20 times the population of the UK -which is a lot of potential customers.",
      "The UK is also a high priority trading partner for India, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1tn (\u00a3750bn) by 2030.",
      "What does this mean for visas?",
      "One of the reasons the UK India free trade deal has taken so long to reach is that India had made big demands about visas for Indian professionals and students to work and study abroad.",
      "The British government said this deal does not include any change in immigration policy, including towards Indian students studying in the UK.",
      "But it does includes a three-year exemption on the social security paid by Indian employees working in the UK, on short-term visas.",
      "This agreement, known as the Double Contribution Convention, designed to ensure social security contributions are not made in more than one country, was one of the elements India had pushed for during negotiations.",
      "The UK's Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the deal would make it easier for people with certain skills to work in the UK temporarily.",
      "\"It opens up a small number of visas from an existing route for chefs and musicians and yoga teachers, very, very small, about 1,800,\" he added."

      "One part of the deal extends an exemption on national insurance contributions (Nics) from one to three years - meaning people on short-term visas will only make social security payments in their home country when working abroad.",

      "The Business Secretary also dismissed opposition claims that many more Indian workers would come to the UK than British workers would go to India.",
      "'Gamechanger' for Scotch whisky industry",
      "The deal - which took three years to negotiate - will make it easier for UK firms to export some goods including whisky, cars and other products to India, and cut taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports to the UK.",
      "Last year, trade between the two countries totalled \u00a342.6bn. The government has said the deal would boost that trade by an additional \u00a325.5bn a year by 2040.",
      "The UK government said lowering tariffs on the likes of clothing, jewellery, and frozen prawns \"could\" lead to cheaper prices and more choice for consumers.",
      "The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA), which is set to benefit from Indian tariffs being lowered, said it could increase Scotch exports to the country by \u00a31bn over the next five years, creating 1,200 jobs across the UK",
      "Tariffs on Scotch whisky are set to fall from 150% to 75% and are expected to be tapered down to 40% over the next decade.",
      "Jean-Etienne Gourgues, chair of the SWA and chief executive of Chivas Brothers, said the deal was a \"gamechanger\" for the industry.",
      "\"We will have suddenly 10 million consumers who cannot today afford our product, which will be in a position to afford our product so that's a big change for us,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He added it would provide \"a lot of safety and long term safety\" for the business.",

      "\"We are the only other country in the world with access to that procurement market so when you have that kind of success that will involve more British workers on a short term basis going to India,\" Reynolds said.",

    "story": [
      "The takeover of Deliveroo by its US counterpart DoorDash is an illuminating example of the differing fortunes and attractions of US and UK stock markets.",
      "DoorDash's offer for Deliveroo values the business at \u00a32.9bn and will create a  company with operations in more than 40 countries.",
      "While both are similar companies, their fortunes have dramatically diverged over the past few years.",
      "Both started out as food delivery services offering customers convenient and speedy access to their favourite restaurants and offering restaurants the ability to more fully utilise the capacity of their kitchens.",
      "Both extended their offerings to include other convenience shopping items \u2013 like nappies, flowers and pet food.",
      "Both raised money by selling shares to the public in an initial public offering (IPO) around the same time \u2013 Deliveroo on the London stock market, DoorDash on the New York Stock Exchange.",
      "But when Deliveroo listed its shares in London, DoorDash was worth five times as much as its UK counterpart. Four years later DoorDash was worth 35 times as much.",
      "This is not a perfect comparison as DoorDash has issued more shares to raise money to expand over time which would boost its total value \u2013 its market capitalisation. But the appetite for shares in the US company meant that it could successfully raise that money on US markets.",
      "Let's look at another measure \u2013 the price of each share.",
      "An investor who bought a share of DoorDash has seen its value rise 84%.",
      "An investor who bought a share of Deliveroo has seen its value fall 56%.",
      "What this means is that DoorDash is now in a position to use its greater financial heft to take over its UK rival \u2013 just as Deliveroo is finally turning a profit.",
      "One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, told the BBC in 2023 that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing, and people close to the company agree that the current takeover bid was partly enabled by DoorDash's access to US capital markets.",
      "UK's Deliveroo to be bought by US firm DoorDash",
      "This is just one example which helps explain a wider problem. Companies are increasingly shunning the London stock market in favour of a US listing.",
      "There are many reasons.",
      "Higher valuation. The 500 largest publicly traded US companies (S&P 500) are worth, on average, 28 times the profit they make in a year. The 100 largest publicly traded UK companies (the FTSE 100) sell for 12 times their yearly earnings. Less than half.",
      "How can there be such a huge disparity?",
      "Partly because the US is home to most of the world's most successful and profitable companies \u2013 the so-called Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla)",
      "Take those out and shares trade at 20 times earnings \u2013 still a massive premium to the UK.",
      "One of the other reasons UK valuations lag is old-fashioned lack of demand.",
      "UK investors' appetite for UK stocks has shrivelled.",
      "Over the last 30 years, the share of the UK market owned by UK financial institutions has shrunk from 50% to less than 5%. This is partly because financial regulation has encouraged pension funds to buy less risky investments like government bonds.",
      "But it's also partly because the managers of those pension funds think they will get better returns investing in US markets \u2013 and they have been dead right.",
      "In just the last five years, the total return including dividends on investing in US shares has been 116% while the same number for the UK is 45%.",
      "Positive comments",
      "But there are changes afoot.",
      "The government's so-called \"Edinburgh Reforms\", designed to make listing in the UK more attractive, included reducing the proportion of a company available for sale to the public and retaining more voting power for founders who wanted to keep control of the company even as they sold stakes to others.",
      "There have also been positive comments on the attractiveness of the UK from financial giants like Larry Fink of BlackRock and Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan.",
      "They both noted the UK looks undervalued and the UK market has outperformed the US so far this year.",
      "The secret that UK stocks are cheap has been out there for some time. That is precisely why private buyers from the US and elsewhere have swooped on UK-listed companies meaning they disappear from the UK stock market.",
      "Even some of the biggest ones left are considered candidates for a move. Shell boss Wael Sawan told the BBC that while he had \"no immediate\" plans to move, he and his company \"got a very warm welcome\" when they held their big reception for investors in New York. Shell trades at a 35% discount to its US-listed peers and many of its shareholders aren't happy about it.",
      "What the DoorDash swoop on Deliveroo seems to highlight once again is that companies listed in the US can summon greater financial firepower with which to expand or acquire their rivals.",
      "Deliveroo will join the likes of Arm Holdings, Morrisons, CRH Holdings, Ultra, Meggitt and many others as companies who used to be listed on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "Does it matter? Pension funds, or individual investors, can buy shares whether they are listed in the UK, US or one of the European exchanges.",
      "But a UK listing generates significant ancillary business for a UK financial services industry that still makes up more than 10% of the UK's entire economy and contributes more than 10% of all taxes paid here.",
      "Accountants, lawyers, financial PR firms and others feed off the fees that UK listings generate.",
      "Trading on the London Stock Exchange is dwarfed by the trading of currencies, bonds and complex contracts but it has always been a centre of gravity for financial activity and one which many argue has lost its power to attract."

    "summary": "The South American country is turning to wind power, but some local people are unhappy.",
    "story": [
      "When Jos\u00e9 Luis Iguar\u00e1n steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea.",
      "The Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguar\u00e1n belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing.",
      "With some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.",
      "But this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature.",
      "\"You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n says.",
      "His community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more.",
      "\"At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n adds.",
      "The Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family.",
      "Despite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguar\u00e1n says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones.",
      "Isagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions.",
      "Mr Iguar\u00e1n believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm.",
      "\"The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,\" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela.",
      "His community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption.",
      "\"Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,\" he adds.",
      "These concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits.",
      "\"There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,\" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu.",
      "\"In Colombia\u2026 there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable.\"",
      "In December 2024, Spanish company EDP Renov\u00e1veis shelved plans for two wind farms in La Guajira, saying the projects were no longer economically viable.",
      "One factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113.",
      "EDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to \"constant protests\" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023.",
      "Guajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard.",
      "And think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms.",
      "\"We call it the 'wind wars',\" says Ms Barney.",
      "For Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies.",
      "\"There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,\" he says.",
      "This gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects.",
      "\"For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected.\"",
      "By contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs.",
      "While Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix.",
      "For energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect.",
      "One such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms.",
      "The company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits.",
      "But it says good community relations are not enough.",
      "\"We cannot do these projects alone,\" says Federico Echavarr\u00eda, general manager of AES Colombia. \"The government must help resolve conflicts between communities.\"",
      "On the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state.",
      "Education and healthcare are poor, and most rural communities do not have running water.",
      "Some people still walk hours each day to collect water from jag\u00fceys \u2013 reservoirs filled with rainwater.",

    "summary": "The Bank cuts rates for the second time this year, saying the slowdown in inflation was behind the move.",
    "story": [
      "UK interest rates have been cut to 4.25% from 4.5% and the governor of the Bank England has hinted more could follow in the coming months.",
      "Andrew Bailey said he would not \"give predictions as to when and how much\", but said he was \"still of the view that the path, gradually and carefully, is downwards\".",
      "The reduction in rates on Thursday marks the fourth cut within the past year and the Bank considered an even bigger cut to 4% due to concerns the global trade war could hit UK economic growth.",
      "Mr Bailey welcomed a UK-US deal on tariffs and said it was \"important as a signal, I hope, of many more to come\", adding a UK trade deal with the European Union would be \"beneficial\".",
      "\"Maybe we need a bit of a jolt to the system to remind us that trade is important,\" Mr Bailey said, adding he hoped the likes of deals between the UK and US, and the UK and India, would help to \"rebuild the world trading system\".",
      "On Thursday, the UK and US announced a deal to avoid tariffs on certain goods in order to boost trade.",
      "As it announced the latest cut in interest rates, the Bank said that while a trade war could hit economic growth, it could lead to lower inflation in the UK over time as countries such as China look to divert cheap goods originally bound for America.",
      "Mr Bailey said the path for rates was \"downwards\", but said future rate cuts were likely to be \"gradual and careful\".",
      "The minutes of the Bank's meeting showed the rate-setting committee was divided. Of the nine members, five voted to cut rates to 4.25%, two voted in favour of a larger reduction to 4% and two voted for no change.",
      "The Bank's base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.",
      "More than eight in 10 customers have fixed-rate deals, but could continue to face higher repayment costs when renewing.",
      "However, mortgage rates have been edging down recently, primarily because the markets and lenders expect further rate cuts this year.  On Thursday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.14%, while a five-year deal was 5.08%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.",
      "About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so rates being cut will have an impact on monthly repayments.",
      "A typical tracker mortgage-holder is likely to see about \u00a329 knocked off their monthly repayments following the latest cut, said the banking trade body UK Finance.",
      "Homeowner Vanda, who has a tracker, told the BBC she had a \"really good rate\", but then got \"caught out\" when rates were previously increased.",
      "\"A drop would help because I've just been made redundant, so that would help a wee bit. I don't think it will ever go back to the way it was, though,\" she said.",
      "Interest rates are the Bank's main tool in try to maintain the annual rate of inflation at, or close to, its target of 2%.",
      "The most recent UK inflation figures show prices rose 2.6% in the year to March. However, the rate is expected to jump following a series of household bill increases at the start of April \u2013 including energy and water prices.",
      "The Bank said it expected inflation to rise \"temporarily\" to 3.5% this year due to the bill increases before falling back due lower oil and gas prices set to feed through in the coming months.",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "UK inflation rate: How quickly are prices rising?",
      "The theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing.",
      "But it is a balancing act as high interest rates can harm the economy as businesses hold off on investing in production and jobs.",
      "The Bank expects UK growth for the first three months of this year to be stronger than it originally forecast at 0.6%, boosted by US firms stockpiling goods ahead of Trump's tariffs coming into effect. The official figures are set to be released next week.",
      "A boost in growth would be welcome news to the government, which has made growing the economy its main priority in order to boost living standards.",
      "The government's Budget decision to increase National Insurance last month for employers kicked in last month, but the Bank said the effect of the tax increase \"appears to have been fairly small to date\", though it added business confidence had taken a hit in recent months.",
      "A lot of firms are taking a \"wait and see\" approach to whether the UK economy picks up before hiring and investing, it said.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the latest rate cut was \"welcome news\", but added: \"There is more to do, and I know families are still facing cost of living pressures.",
      "Mr Bailey said the UK had \"still a lot to do\" on growth: \"We have seen over the last, really since the financial crisis, 15 years or so now, the rates of growth be consistently lower than they were before that.\"",

      "However, that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly.",

      "It then remained well above the 2% target partly because of higher food prices.",
      "Why does putting up interest rates help to lower inflation?",
      "When inflation was well above its 2% target, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high.",
      "The idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more.",
      "In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises.",
      "But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy.",

      "Students collecting their results in person can do so from 08:00.",

      "But the party couldn't last forever.",
      "In 2008, The Word magazine coined the phrase \"indie landfill\" to describe a seemingly endless parade of identikit bloke-bands cluttering the airwaves.",
      "Where were they all coming from? Why couldn't you tell them apart? Why where they all called \"The Something\"?",
      "Almost overnight, radio stations ditched indie for a new generation of forward-thinking pop (Lady Gaga, Florence + The Machine) and club-centric hip-hop (Black Eyed Peas, Dizzee Rascal).",
      "\"It did suddenly seem that four boys in a band became very un-hip,\" says Archer.",
      "\"The opportunities dried up in England,\" agrees Pritchard. \"We were playing smaller venues and the vibe just wasn't exciting any more.\"",
      "\"It got to a point where we were just exhausted,\" Archer continues. \"It felt like we were screaming into the void. So we stopped and tried other things.\"",
      "In the 2010s, Hard-Fi's guitarist Ross Phillips retrained as a tiler, while Archer formed the short-lived blues band OffWorld.",
      "But when he streamed an acoustic set of Hard-Fi songs during Covid, the response was big enough to tempt the band back on stage. A one-off gig at London's Forum sold out in minutes.",
      "\"The response was just so warm. I was quite taken aback by it,\" says Archer.",
      "The show led to a full reunion. This summer, the band will release a 20th anniversary edition of their class-conscious, Mercury Prize-nominated debut, Stars of CCTV, while preparing a long-delayed fourth album.",
      "The Kooks, meanwhile, never went away, recording a clutch of more experimental albums that blended drum loops, pastoral pop and even Ethiopian jazz influences.",
      "But today, the band are bigger than ever after hits like Na\u00efve and Ooh La found a new audience on TikTok.",
      "Later this year, they will headline the O2 Arena for the first time, with18 to 24-year-olds making up 45% of the audience.",
      "How do they explain this sudden revival?",
      "\"We're at that point where teenagers start going back to listen to the music their parents grew up with,\" Pritchard observes.",
      "\"In the 90s, we did it too, going back and discovering Nick Drake, so there's a circular nature to it. The scene, and even the fashion, has come around again.\"",
      "But there's something else, too. Songs like The Kooks' She Moves In Her Own Way and Hard-Fi's Hard To Beat have something that went missing in the 2010s - choruses you can sing until you're hoarse.",
      "\"Yeah, that anthemic thing was removed from guitar music,\" agrees Pritchard. \"People started consuming music on earbuds, so they connected with the introspective stuff.",
      "\"But when we were gathering a little fanbase in Brighton, we'd play all these small clubs and you'd filter the setlist by whether people could sing along to the hook.\"",
      "Archer recalls the grind of those early tours. In their first year, he reckons, Hard-Fi were on the road for \"almost 365 days\".",
      "But with one grassroots venue closing every fortnight in the UK, it's getting harder to book tours and road-test songs.",
      "\"What worries me is, if you're a new artist now, do you have the opportunity to go out there and make mistakes and fix them?\" says Archer.",
      "A shrinking live scene isn't the only upheaval in the industry.",
      "The Kooks' debut album sold 1.5 million copies in 2006 \u2013 making it the fifth biggest record of the year. Compare that with 2024, when the best-selling album in the UK (Taylor Swift's Tortured Poets Department) only sold 600,000 copies.",
      "Streams have cannibalised sales, turning every artist into a cult act. It doesn't help that opportunities for promoting music have dried up.",
      "The only music TV show left standing is Later... With Jools Holland, while weekly music magazines like the NME are no more - not that everyone laments its demise.",
      "\"We were never the best friends with the NME,\" laughs Archer.",
      "\"Who was?\" asks Pritchard. \"There were two or three anointed bands and the rest of us were cast out.\"",
      "Are there any reviews seared into their memories?",
      "\"No, I've done a lot of work on that,\" Pritchard jokes. \"But I definitely was more sensitive than I should have been.\"",
      "\"How can you not be, though?\" asks Archer. \"They're criticising something you've sweated blood and tears over.\"",
      "While compiling the anniversary edition of Stars of CCTV, he found an old clipping where a critic said the band's fans didn't understand real music.",
      "\"I kept it,\" he says, \"so I could get revenge later.\"",
      "\"You should frame it and put it in the loo,\" Pritchard suggests.",
      "\"Then I'd just be angry every time I have a dump.\"",
      "But the music press was powerful in the 2000s. Both frontmen recall feeling pressure to live up to the NME's ideal of a gobby frontman.",
      "Archer, a thoughtful and introspective character, was even provoked into saying he wanted to be the biggest star in the world.",
      "\"I don't see the point in being just another indie band,\" he boasted in one interview. \"What's the point of being parochial and small-time? I'm in competition with Eminem.\"",
      "\"You had to be super-confident and say provocative things,\" Pritchard reflects now.",
      "\"But what I learned is that a lot of songwriters are introspective, insular people - and when you throw them in front of a camera, it's quite challenging.\"",
      "With hindsight, both men emerged from the 2000s relatively unscathed, and share a newfound appreciation for their early records.",
      "Pritchard, in particular, is revisiting the breathless pop of The Kooks' first two albums on their new record Never/Know, released this week.",
      "\"I felt like I slightly lost my identity [because] I'd been collaborating with outside producers so much,\" he says.",
      "\"So I went back and played all the records we were listening to when we started -  not to repeat ourselves, but to get a firm hand on the identity again.\"",
      "The result is an album that's perfectly timed for summer road trips and sun-soaked festival sets, replete with buoyant melodies and timeless guitar grooves.",
      "Archer is in a similar place, with a new album inspired by a CD-Rom of old demos an ex-girlfriend sent to him last year.",
      "So, have the bands got a five-year plan?",
      "\"Definitely - but it's locked up in my safe,\" laughs Pritchard. \"I think it's good to have goals!\"",
      "\"Do you really?\" asks Archer, with a concerned frown.",
      "\"I literally don't know what I'm going to have for lunch.\""

    "story": [
      "The Last of Us star Bella Ramsey has voiced support for awards shows keeping separate categories for male and female performers.",
      "The British star, who identifies as non-binary and asks to be referred to with they/them pronouns, said it was important that \"recognition for women in the industry is preserved\".",
      "\"But then, where do non-binary or gender non-conforming people fit into that? I don't know,\" Ramsey added.",
      "Ramsey has been nominated for best actress at the Baftas and Emmys. Other ceremonies such the MTV and Brit Awards have switched to all-encompassing gender-neutral prizes as the entertainment industry grapples with how non-binary actors should be treated by awards shows.",
      "Organisers of the Oscars said last year they were \"exploring\" the idea of merging the best actor and actress categories.",
      "Ramsey told Louis Theroux's podcast: \"If people call me an actress, I have a guttural 'ugh, that's not quite right' instinct to it.",
      "\"But I just don't take it too seriously. It doesn't feel like an attack on my identity. It's just a funny thing that doesn't really fit.\"",
      "'I've tried to think my way to the answer'",
      "Ramsey said they \"didn't find it insulting\" to be nominated for best actress at the Emmys.",
      "Theroux suggested that having a single category would mean \"basically a lot of women wouldn't get nominated\" - as happened when the Brits scrapped their best male and female categories in favour of a best artist award, and no women were nominated in 2023.",
      "Ramsey responded: \"I think it's so important that that's preserved - that the recognition for women in this industry is preserved.",
      "\"I think the gendered categories conversation's a really interesting one and I don't have the answer. I wish that there was something that was an easy way around it.",
      "\"I think that it is really important that we have a female category and a male category - but then, where do non-binary and gender con-conforming people fit into that? I don't know.",
      "\"I've literally sat and tried to think my way to the answer, and haven't got there.",
      "\"You could do it for the character portrayed - like, best performance in a female character. But then, what about when there are non-binary characters on screen? Which is few and far between at the moment. But where does a non-binary person playing a non-binary character fit in? I don't know. It's really complicated.\"",
      "There has also been a move towards referring to all performers as actors rather than using the term actress, but Ramsey said many people prefer to be called an actress \"and are really comfortable in that\".",
      "\"I've always just called myself an actor, but I don't think that those words [like actress] have to be taken away.\"",
      "Pronoun 'stress'",
      "The 21-year-old said they didn't think about the use of pronouns until The Last of Us started in 2023, \"and it was a question that I had and suddenly I had to choose\".",
      "\"I was so stressed out about it because I didn't know, and I didn't really care.\"",
      "Ramsey said they rejected the term non-binary \"for so long\" because they didn't want to be seen as being \"trendy\".",
      "\"It was just something that had been very obvious since I was young. I'd always call myself a tomboy, but it wasn't that I was like a boyish girl. I was always a bit of an inbetween, leaning more to the boy's side to be honest.",
      "\"I feel like I grew up more as a little boy than I did a little girl. I always felt more masculine or... yeah, more on that side of the spectrum, I guess.\"",
      "The question of how to categorise awards has been a long-running debate in the entertainment industry.",
      "Currently, most awards shows invite actors to submit themselves for the category they feel comfortable in.",
      "In 2022, The Crown's Emma Corrin, who identifies as non-binary, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I don't think the categories are inclusive enough at the moment. It's about everyone being able to feel acknowledged and represented.\"",
      "In 2023, Yellowjackets star Liv Hewson, also non-binary, didn't enter the Emmys, saying: \"There's not a place for me in the acting categories. It would be inaccurate for me to submit myself as an actress. It neither makes sense for me to be lumped in with the boys.\"",
      "Others worry that gender-neutral categories would lead to women being underrepresented. After having all-male nominees for best artist in 2023, the Brits expanded the prize's shortlist from five to 10 acts.",

      "The memorial, commemorating the life of Britain's longest-reigning monarch who died in September 2022, will be built in St James's Park in central London.",
      "Illustrations of the design concepts are being put online by the Cabinet Office and the public will be invited to have their say about the ideas for the major new monument.",
      "Three of the five proposed designs feature the late Queen riding a horse, reflecting her lifelong enthusiasm for equestrianism.",
      "There are other features proposed by the competing teams of artists and architects, such as incorporating recordings of the late Queen's voice into a memorial, and large sculptures of lilies around a figure of the late Queen.",
      "One of the proposed designs uses an oak tree to represent Queen Elizabeth's strength and resilience. Another suggests building symbolic pathways and a pair of bridges over the lake in the park.",
      "The winning entry will be chosen later this year, but there is no date yet set for when the finished memorial will be unveiled. The construction budget will be between \u00a323m and \u00a346m, depending on the selected design, says the Cabinet Office.",
      "The public will get a chance to say whether they want a more traditional representation of the late Queen, or something more experimental, in what will become an important London landmark.",
      "The new memorial will be placed not too far from statues of the late Queen's parents, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother.",
      "Also nearby is the memorial to Queen Victoria outside Buckingham Palace.",
      "The location for the monument will be a section of St James's Park close to the Mall and across to a bridge over a lake in the park. The entries include plans to landscape and redesign this area and the construction process is expected to mean replacing the current bridge.",
      "The memorial scheme will also provide community projects and facilities around the country.",
      "This will follow in the tradition of legacy schemes such as the King George V Playing Fields, which saw almost 500 sports grounds opened in memory of the monarch who died in 1936.",

      "The public is being encouraged to contribute ideas about the memorial and to give feedback on the shortlisted designs.",

      "Baroness Amos, a former leader of the House of Lords, said the memorial should be a fitting tribute to the late Queen, who died at the age of 96 after seven decades on the throne.",

      "One place you won't have seen her during that time, however, is on stage.",
      "The Swedish actress hasn't appeared in the theatre for 17 years, when she was a teenager. But that's about to change.",
      "Vikander will star in a new West End production of Ibsen's The Lady from the Sea, which will also be her UK theatre debut.",
      "Speaking to BBC News, Vikander, 36, said she was \"thrilled\" to be returning to the stage, but added it was a \"daunting thing to do... it's my first time on stage as an adult\".",
      "The production will play at London's Bridge Theatre for eight weeks from 10 September, organisers announced on Wednesday.",
      "\"I grew up being at the theatre a lot, my mother [Maria Fahl] was a stage actress, and I think even when I was dreaming of becoming an actress myself, being on stage was the journey that I kind of visualised,\" Vikander said.",
      "\"Back in Sweden, where I'm from, if you're an actor then really what you are is on stage. And you're lucky to maybe have a TV show or film every couple of years, because that's how small the industry is in Sweden.",
      "\"So I think that's what I always saw in front of me. And then life happened, and throughout the years [theatre] has always been something I've been waiting for and thinking 'it will happen'.\"",
      "The play has been adapted and directed by Simon Stone, and will also star The Walking Dead's Andrew Lincoln.",
      "Vikander will play lead character Ellida, the sea-loving daughter of a lighthouse-keeper.",
      "Ellida is married to a Norwegian doctor, but when a sailor she used to be engaged to suddenly returns, she is forced to choose between her current and former lover.",
      "The play marks the introduction of the character Hilde Wangel, one of the doctor's daughters from a previous marriage.",

      "\"He once again is going to take a classic and reinvent it and make it be something that is relatable to our modern audience today,\" Vikander said.",
      "\"And when I was told he was doing Ibsen and The Lady from the Sea, I guess that going back to my Scandinavian and Swedish heritage, it kind of felt like a perfect match.\"",
      "Vikander said she felt the reason many of the classics are still being performed in the West End is they tackle many of the same subjects society still grapples with today.",
      "\"I have discussions with my friends, I just passed 35, I'm getting close to my 40s soon and I have my kids, but I still feel extremely young. Really young. Sometimes I'm like, 'I'm 25 still!'",
      "\"But then I also realise I'm entering this very new chapter which is really exciting, but I think if you are in a place where you feel like you haven't fulfilled certain dreams or tried things, you're still wondering where these choices or action would have led you, then I think it's extremely human thing.",
      "\"Women throughout history have been held back, maybe because they didn't have the same opportunities, or they financially couldn't do some things, or ended up in situations where it was harder to break away from the role of being a mother.",
      "\"So therefore when I read it, I feel like I totally understand the turmoil this woman goes through, and I don't think humans have changed that much from a core, emotional point of view. And I think that's why we're interested in these stories.\"",
      "She added: \"It's incredible that the big universal questions are something we're still battling in the same way.\"",
      "Vikander said she was \"super excited and wonderfully nervous\" to begin the workshopping process with Stone in the coming weeks, out of which he will begin to produce the final script.",
      "As the show is still being developed, it has not yet been confirmed what the setting will be for this production.",
      "Another UK adaptation of The Lady from the Sea performed in 2017 at the Donmar Theatre moved the story to the Caribbean in the 1950s.",
      "The new adaptation is billed as her UK stage debut, but Vikander notes it's actually her first theatre of any kind since she was 19.",
      "\"I did theatre for my teens for a lot of years, like a child actor, and then the last thing I did was when I was a dancer for the Stockholm Opera House,\" she explained.",
      "\"I grew up watching my mother doing theatre, and I 'd always watch from afar, and I can't wait to try and do it myself.",
      "\"It's a daunting thing to do, obviously, it's my first time on stage as an adult, and it's on the London stage, and obviously I want to make sure people get their ticket money's worth! But I'm really excited.\""

      "What is Trump proposing?",
      "The president says he wants to \"immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% tariff on any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands. We want movies made in America again!\"",
      "This has led to questions about whether the tariffs would also apply to American film companies producing films abroad.",
      "Several recent major movies produced by US studios were shot outside America, including Deadpool & Wolverine, Wicked and Gladiator II. Hit franchises like Mission Impossible also shoot overseas.",
      "We also don't yet know if the tariffs will be applied retrospectively.",
      "Trump later told reporters that \"other nations have been stealing the movies and movie-making capabilities from the United States\", which may suggest he was only referring to non-US films.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai told the BBC that \"no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made\", and added that the administration is \"exploring all options\".",
      "We will have to wait for more detail.",
      "What incentives do other countries offer?",
      "Many countries offer tax breaks to encourage film production such as New Zealand, Australia and the UK and that's something Trump wants to take on.",
      "But it's not the only reason a US film company might wish to film abroad.",
      "Some choose to do so for the specific location, exotic and exciting backdrops for example. Who could forget Tom Cruise's ascent of the Burj Khalifa, Dubai, in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol?",
      "What could it mean for the next James Bond movie, a franchise now owned by US giant Amazon, but based on an iconic British character who works for MI6, based in London?",
      "And it's not just other countries that offer incentives - other US states are luring film production away from Hollywood.",
      "Georgia, Illinois and Kentucky are among the many other US states which California are now competing with.",
      "Gavin Newsom, California's governor, who Trump described as \"grossly incompetent\" when speaking about the movie tariffs on Monday, is currently pushing for his plan to more than double the state's film and TV tax incentives to $750 million annually.",
      "While Newsom has made no comment yet on Trump's proposal, his senior communications advisor told Deadline: \"We believe he has no authority to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, since tariffs are not listed as a remedy under that law.\"",
      "How would any such tariffs actually work?",
      "There are more questions than answers at this stage.",
      "The World Trade Organization (WTO) has a moratorium on tariffs for digital goods until 2026. Presumably films count as digital goods.",
      "And what would they base the tariffs on? Box office revenue or production costs? Is streaming content included? That would have a huge impact on US companies like Netflix. What about post-production ie editing?",
      "Tim Richards, Vue Entertainment CEO and founder, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"A big part of this is what constitutes US film - is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot?\"",
      "And how do you even classify a foreign film when so many are co-productions and are often shot in several countries?",
      "Trump appeared to be talking about film and not TV but it's not 100% clear at this stage. Would tariffs apply to films made for streaming or just cinema releases? We'll have to wait for more detail. And of course, Trump may rollback on the proposals as he has done with some other tariffs.",
      "What could it mean for other countries?",
      "Obviously, putting a 100% tariff on foreign films means a huge cost increase for those production companies who want to sell to the US market.",
      "Commenting on Trump's announcement, the UK government's Culture Media and Sport Committee chair Dame Caroline Dinenage MP said: \"Last month the Culture, Media and Sport Committee warned against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe. President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real.",
      "\"Making it more difficult to make films in the UK is not in the interests of American businesses. Their investment in facilities and talent in the UK, based on US-owned IP, is showing fantastic returns on both sides of the Atlantic. Ministers must urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way.\"",
      "Head of media and entertainment trade union Bectu in the UK, Philippa Childs, said in a statement: \"These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.\"",
      "Kirsty Bell, chief executive of production company Goldfinch, questioned how the tariffs would work, pointing out that blockbusters like Barbie, which was distributed by US film studio Warner Bros Pictures, \"was actually shot virtually entirely in the UK\".",
      "\"If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,\" she told PA.",
      "The governments of Australia and New Zealand have also spoken out in support of their countries' film industries.",
      "\"Nobody should be under any doubt that we will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry,\" Australia's home affairs minister Tony Burke said.",
      "New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told a news conference that his government was awaiting further details of the proposed tariffs.",
      "\"But we'll be obviously a great advocate, great champion of that sector and that industry,\" he added.",
      "And with the Cannes film festival just around the corner, uncertainty hangs in the air with many US film producers looking to sell foreign distribution rights.",
      "Could such tariffs work?",
      "Tariffs could incentivise US film companies to make more films on home soil but the risk is that if it's more expensive than to do so abroad, some films just won't get made.",
      "More incentives or rebates could help offset this but we just don't know at this stage if that's under discussion on a national scale.",
      "NPR Radio film critic Eric Deggans warned that the tariffs, should they be introduced, could further harm the industry.",
      "Other countries may respond by placing tariffs on American films, he told the BBC, making it \"harder for these films to make profits overseas\".",

    "summary": "After pushing the much-anticipated sequel into 2026, developer Rockstar gives fans a new glimpse of the game.",
    "story": [
      "Just when you'd come to terms with the fact that Grand Theft Auto 6 had been delayed until next year, Rockstar Games goes and drops a brand new trailer.",
      "Last week, the video game developer announced the game had been pushed back to May 2026, shocking fans who were expecting it to land this autumn.",
      "It's been 12 years since the last GTA game was released, and the long wait for the most anticipated sequel of all time just became even more agonising.",
      "But earlier, the company released a new, three-minute trailer, giving eager players a stack of new information to dissect in the meantime.",
      "Here are some of the highlights.",
      "The record-breaking first trailer for GTA 6, published online in late 2023, introduced players to protagonists Jason and Lucia -  a couple who live a life of crime in Leonida, the fictional US state where the game is set.",
      "We now know a bit more about their backstory.",
      "The new trailer opens with Jason doing odd jobs before driving around Vice City - the Miami-inspired location from the 2002 PlayStation 2 game.",
      "According to Rockstar, Jason was a troubled teen who joined the army to escape his bad influences, but fell back into crime after returning home.",
      "In the trailer he eventually collects Lucia from prison, where she has been serving time for \"protecting her family\".",
      "From there, the clip launches into a montage of action sequences, romantic scenes and glimpses of the game's wider world.",
      "We see the couple carrying out armed heists, partying on a yacht and riding a jetski together.",
      "According to a description on Rockstar's website, the two want to forge a new life together but are plunged into \"the middle of a conspiracy\" after an \"easy score goes wrong\".",
      "New characters revealed",
      "Players also got to put names to faces of some of game's wider cast, including bank robber Raul Bautista, smuggler Brian Heder and rap combo Real Dimez.",
      "Like GTA 5, which was heavily based on Los Angeles and its surrounding areas, the sequel also appears to contain accurate recreations of some of Florida's most famous landmarks.",
      "Vice City's version of Miami's art deco, neon-lit beachfront appears in the trailer, as does the Grassrivers swampland, inspired by the Florida everglades.",
      "Rockstar also revealed the Leonida Keys, the industrial Ambrosia region, sleazy Port Gellhorn and the mountainous Kalaga National Park.",
      "In each case, it suggested the areas would be home to different groups and factions, from \"hillbilly mystics\" to biker gangs.",
      "The trailer did not appear to include any gameplay footage, but was made up of cinematic sequences usually seen between story missions.",
      "But fans were quick to praise the game's next-generation graphics in the trailer and a series of screenshots published by Rockstar.",
      "Video game trailers are sometimes created using powerful PCs but a note at the end of the trailer said the scenes in it were taken from a PlayStation 5 console.",
      "But that doesn't answer questions about new ways of interacting with the game's world, or whether players can switch between characters on-the-fly as they could in GTA 5.",
      "Why has GTA 6 taken so long?",
      "The hype around GTA 6 is huge, and Rockstar has form for delaying its games and a reputation for perfectionism.",
      "When it announced the delay last week it told fans it needed extra time to \"deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve\".",
      "According to Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier, the delay was to also to avoid \"crunch\" - a gaming industry term for enforced overtime.",
      "The company was previously criticised by some staff over the practice - it accepted that some worked \"long hours\" but said some accounts were exaggerated.",
      "When GTA 6's delay was announced, shares in Rockstar's parent company, Take Two Interactive, dropped by 10%.",
      "The industry was banking on the game - which will initially be available only on Xbox and PlayStation 5 - to boost console sales and break software sales records.",
      "However, having a firm date of 26 May 2026 for GTA 6 means that other publishers can now avoid releasing their own games at the same time.",

      "More victims of the infected blood scandal will die without ever receiving full compensation, a government minister has said.",
      "The paymaster general Nick Thomas-Symonds was giving evidence to a special session of the public inquiry into what's been called the worst treatment disaster in NHS history.",
      "It's thought 30,000 patients in the UK were infected with HIV or hepatitis B and C after being treated with a contaminated blood clotting product or given a blood transfusion in the 1970s and 80s.",
      "Mr Thomas-Symonds agreed it was \"profoundly unsatisfactory\" that just 106 final compensation awards have been paid, almost a year after a damning report into the scandal was published.",
      "What is the infected blood scandal?",
      "'Infected blood has ruined my life for 40 years'",
      "\"I'm never going to think this is satisfactory until everybody has received the compensation that is due,\" the Cabinet Office minister said.",
      "\"The objective should be absolutely to pay [people] as soon as possible.\"",
      "A final report into the scandal, published last year, found that the disaster could largely have been avoided if different decisions had been taken by the health authorities at the time.",
      "The report said too little was done to stop the importing of contaminated blood products from abroad in the 1970s and 80s, and there was evidence that elements of the scandal had been covered up.",
      "Last month the chair of the public inquiry, Sir Brian Langstaff, ordered two days of extra hearings after he received \"letter after letter, email after email\" expressing concerns about the way the government's compensation scheme has been managed.",
      "The Chancellor Rachel Reeves set aside \u00a311.8bn in the last budget to make final awards to victims and their family members, but the latest figures show less than 1% of that total, some \u00a397m, has been paid out to date.",
      "Survivors of the scandal and some bereaved relatives have also received a series of smaller interim compensation payments over the last three years.",

      "\"People have given up on any expectation of receiving anything,\" he said.",
      "\"They have lost all hope of ever getting justice and we can't be doing this for much longer.\"",
      "Other witnesses criticised the way in which individuals were being contacted and \"invited\" to come forward to claim final compensation, describing it as \"waiting for your lottery ticket to come up\".",
      "Gary Webster, a haemophiliac who was infected with HIV and hepatitis C when a pupil at Treloar's School in Hampshire in the 1970s and 80s, said that \"[some] people will not get their compensation and a lot of claims will die with them.\"",
      "\"It's just too slow and people won't get the justice they deserve,\" he added.",
      "Under the current rules, if someone infected with HIV or hepatitis B or C dies before receiving full compensation, then any final award can be passed on to their relatives through their estate.",
      "But compensation can also be claimed by those affected by the scandal \u2013 a partner, sibling or parent of a child, for example \u2013 for the separate impact on their lives.",
      "And if they die before that compensation is agreed, then their claim will die with them and cannot be passed on.",
      "In questioning later in the day, Mr Thomas-Symonds, who leads on the response for the government, said he was \"restless for further progress on payments\".",
      "The Infected Blood Compensation Authority (IBCA), an independent body set up to pay victims of the scandal, has said it expects the \"bulk\" of awards to be made to infected survivors by the end of 2027, with most of those affected, such as family members and carers, paid by the end of 2029.",
      "Mr Thomas-Symonds said he regarded that timeline as a \"backstop\" rather than a target to work towards.",
      "\"The logic for that is there may be other people who have not yet come forward at this stage [to claim],\" he said.",

      "\"Some clinicians were interviewed after he died, and they had a very patronising approach to him\" he told the inquiry.",

      "Sir Rob agreed with a suggestion put to him by Nicholas Griffin KC, chief counsel to the inquiry, that some incidents \"fall through the gaps\" due to the complexity of the complaints process and therefore are not investigated.",

      "The \"big baby\" trial aimed to find out if starting labour earlier than 38 weeks made it less likely for infants who appeared large in the womb to be born with shoulder dystocia, where the shoulder becomes stuck during delivery.",
      "Study findings from between 2018 and 2022 showed giving birth a week to 10 days earlier reduced the risk, researchers said.",
      "It is hoped the data from the \u00a32.5m Coventry-based trial will give doctors and midwives more confidence in facilitating natural births.",
      "Coventry nurse Eve Morgan took part in the study 2018 after monitoring found her baby could reach 9lb (4kg).",

      "Around \u00a3102m is being provided to expand and modernise surgeries, with work getting under way this summer. The government said it was the biggest public investment in facilities for five years.",
      "It comes as satisfaction levels with GP service have hit record-low levels and figures suggest two in five GPs are reporting their practices are not fit for purpose.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting called it a \"significant step\", but warned it would not solve all existing problems overnight.",
      "Under the plan, some of the projects will involve converting office space into clinical consulting rooms as well as building new practices.",
      "Mr Streeting said: \"These are simple fixes for our GP surgeries, but for too long they were left to ruin, allowing waiting lists to build and stopping doctors treating more patients.",
      "\"It is only because of the necessary decisions we took in the Budget that we are able to invest in GP surgeries, start tackling the 08:00 scramble and deliver better services for patients,\" he added.",

      "Research by the Institute for Government, an independent think-tank, found that patient satisfaction with GPs had fallen significantly since the pandemic, driven by fewer in-person appointments.",
      "Around 80% of patients saw a GP in person in 2019. By last year, that had fallen to 66%.",
      "Ruth Rankine, the primary care director at the NHS Confederation, said doctors would welcome the \u00a3102m boost to \"deliver high quality care, closer to home, and fit for the 21st century\".",
      "\"If we are serious about shifting care from hospital to community, from sickness to prevention, and from analogue to digital, then sustained investment in primary and community estates, equipment and technology is vital,\" she added.",
      "It is unclear which of the 6,252 GP surgeries in NHS England will benefit from the new funding.",
      "Last month the government announced it would expand a scheme to help GPs provide care to patients without admitting them to hospital - backed by \u00a380m in funding.",

      "The estimate forms part of the official impact assessment, carried out by civil servants to inform MPs as they debate whether to allow assisted dying.",
      "It said initially the numbers coming forward would be low, but are expected to grow over time.",
      "The impact assessment says that the total number of assisted deaths is estimated to range from between 164 and 787 in the first (half) year of the service to between 1,042 and 4,559 in year 10, and assuming a start date to the policy of October 2029.",
      "The upper estimate  of just over 4,500 assisted deaths would still only represent less than 1% of all deaths, the document said.",
      "The impact assessment also provides a financial analysis of the costs and savings involved \u2013 it is not a document that gets into the ethical or philosophical arguments for and against the policy.",
      "It comes as the bill returns to the House of Commons later this month, with a crucial vote that will determine whether the bill becomes law expected to happen in mid June.",
      "Costs and savings",
      "In the first six months, savings for the NHS could range from around \u00a3919,000 to \u00a310.3m.",
      "This figure includes hospital care, primary and community care, hospice, medicines and other care costs that someone choosing an assisted death would not need.",
      "By the time the system has been running for ten years, savings could range from \u00a35.84m to \u00a359.6m.",
      "But there will be costs too. Staffing an assisted dying service could cost in excess of \u00a310m a year within a decade. And training costs in the first six months alone could be over \u00a311m.",
      "One assisted death would likely involve six health and care professionals working 32 hours.",
      "It said this could take staff away from existing services, but the overall impact of this was uncertain.",
      "And each panel that would review cases, comprising of a lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker, could cost \u00a32,000 a day.",
      "Overall, it said it was not possible to calculate whether the costs outweighed the savings or vice versa as there were too many uncertainties.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said the government was neutral on the issue. It said the document had been produce to help ensure any legislation that passes through parliament is \"workable, effective and enforceable\".",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, said she was grateful for the work that had been done on the impact assessment.",
      "She said she was still \"firmly of the view that the overall impact of this long overdue reform will be to make end of life care in England and Wales more compassionate and significantly safer\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: \"For me, assisted dying and giving people a choice at the end of their life when they are facing a terminal illness is about the human cost, it's not about pounds and pence.\"",
      "But Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, a former Paralympian and member of the House of Lords, who opposes assisted dying, said: \"This assessment highlights how assisted dying would put disabled and other vulnerable people at grave risk by providing financial incentives to an already overburdened and under-resourced NHS to offer assisted dying as a 'treatment option'.\"",
      "Leadbeater told Today the eligibility criteria under the bill was \"extremely strict\".",
      "She said: \"You have to be terminally ill. There are multiple layers of safeguarding built into the bill, including a multi-disciplinary panel of experts.",
      "\"So we are assessing mental capacity, we are checking for coercion at every level of this process to make sure that this is the clear and settled informed wish of the person who is terminally ill.\"",
      "She said that the bill was \"only about terminally ill adults who have less than six months to live\". \"The bill does not cover people with disabilities,\" she added.",
      "Prof Katherine Sleeman, professor of palliative care at King's College London, said the cost of end of life care was \"very, very high\", adding \"obviously if someone is not living those last months of life then it's lower\".",

    "story": [
      "Lucy says she's always been a bit of worrier, but two years ago she began to get anxious and started having panic attacks.",
      "\"I didn't know what was happening and my parents didn't either,\" says the 15-year-old. \"It was scary. The attacks would occur without warning. It got worse and I began to have them in public.\"",
      "Lucy started missing a lot of school and stopped socialising. She says it was hard for her parents to see her struggling. \"We didn't know what to do or where to go.\"",
      "For six months, she tried to manage her anxiety herself, but eventually the family decided to pay for a talking therapy called cognitive behavioural therapy.",
      "Lucy says it has made a huge difference. While she still has panic attacks, they are much less frequent and she is back attending school and doing the things she enjoys.",
      "Lucy's story is far from unique. NHS figures suggest one in five children and young people aged eight to 25 has a probable mental health disorder.",
      "Why problems are so common",
      "The teenage years are when problems become increasingly common as young people grapple with the challenges of growing up, exam stresses, and friendships and relationships.",
      "There are biological reasons too that make emotional health problems more likely, says Prof Andrea Danese, an expert in child and adolescent psychiatry at King's College London.",
      "\"Teenagers' brains don't develop all at once. The part that processes emotions matures earlier than the part responsible for self-control and good judgement. This means young people can feel things very intensely before they've fully developed the ability to manage those feelings, which helps explain some of the emotional ups and downs parents often see.\"",
      "The zenith, he says, is adolescence, when emotional reactions are further heightened by hormones and changes to the internal body clock which impact sleeping patterns.",
      "When and how to help",
      "So, what constitutes normal emotional challenges - and when should teens and their parents be worried and consider seeking professional help?",
      "Prof Danese says he understands why many find this difficult to judge. He considers the following as normal teenage emotional traits:",
      "Periodic irritability and moodinessOccasional social withdrawal or desire for privacyAnxiety about social acceptance or academic performanceExperimenting with identity and independenceEmotional reactions that seem disproportionate",
      "Periodic irritability and moodiness",

      "Experimenting with identity and independence",
      "Emotional reactions that seem disproportionate",
      "Providing these are not interfering too much with daily activities, parents should feel able to support their children, he believes.",
      "The most common problems teenagers experience are low mood and anxiety. For low mood, Prof Danese says, maintaining healthy routines around eating, sleeping, being active and keeping in touch with friends and family is important as is planning activities that your child enjoys, such as trips out or playing a sport.",
      "\"And help them identify, break down and try out solutions for problems that may have arisen,\" he adds.",
      "For anxiety, calming techniques are helpful, he says. These can include breathing exercises, grounding, whereby you concentrate on the environment around you and what you can see, touch and smell, and mindfulness activities.",
      "\"It's important to avoid the trap of providing unnecessary reassurance,\" Prof Danese says. Instead, alongside teaching calming techniques, parents should discuss and test out feared situations. \"To reduce worries, it can help to write them down or talk about them at a special 'worry time' once a day.\"",
      "Building resilience",
      "Stevie Goulding, who runs the parent helpline for Young Minds, says anxiety is the issue they get the most calls about.",
      "\"Many children will have bouts of anxiety and even panic attacks. It's difficult for parents. They can easily find themselves lacking in confidence and judgement about what to do. We get lots of calls from parents in that position. When they see their child struggling it can make them question themselves and they just don't know where to turn.",
      "\"The main advice we give parents is to communicate with their children. Give them permission to talk about what is bothering them \u2013 and if they don't want to talk to them, ask if there is someone else they would prefer to talk to.\"",
      "Ms Goulding also recommends talking to your child's school as they may have noticed things too.",
      "But she adds: \"Children need to be given space \u2013 avoid the temptation to rush in and try to fix things. Just reflect what they are saying and listen.\"",
      "Child psychologist Dr Sandi Mann agrees, saying parents have an understandable temptation to want to resolve whatever issue their child is facing when that is not necessarily the best solution.",
      "She says instead parents should help teach and build resilience in their children \u2013 and has written about this for the BBC.",
      "She recommends parents:",

      "But Dr Mann and Prof Danese both stress parents should not shy away from asking for professional support when needed.",

      "But with long waiting times for NHS child mental health services, knowing where to go for help is not straightforward, particularly if you cannot afford private therapy.",
      "The first point of call is normally your GP or mental health support teams that are linked to schools in some areas. As well as referrals to NHS mental health services, they can put you in touch with local organisations and charities that can provide support.",
      "\"Schools themselves can also help \u2013 some have counselling and support services,\" says Dr Lockhart.",
      "\"But I think parents can underestimate the role they can play even if their child is waiting for support or actually getting therapy or treatment. The home is where they will spend most of their time \u2013 so parents are a big part of the solution.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 03 May 2025 01:19:44 GMT",
    "summary": "Why is the number of autism diagnoses changing? And what does it mean for autistic people?",
    "story": [
      "You might have seen the social media videos: the \"five signs you're autistic\". You may have heard about long waiting lists for autism diagnosis. You might know, or sense, that the numbers of people deemed autistic are going up, fast.",
      "There's a lot at stake. These numbers mean fiercely different things to different people. To some, autism is a fear (what if this happens to my child?); to others it's an identity, maybe even a superpower.",
      "So what's the truth about the number of autistic people - and what does it mean?",
      "To count something, you first need to say what it is you're counting.",
      "For someone to be diagnosed with autism, they need to have \"persistent difficulties in social life and in social communication,\" says Ginny Russell, an associate professor in psychiatry at University College London (UCL) and the author of The Rise of Autism. She's using the criteria for autism from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, known as the DSM.",
      "She says examples of this behaviour can range from a lack of turn-taking in conversation to being completely non-verbal.",
      "Restricted interests and repetitive behaviours are part of a second group of traits required to meet the criteria, she says. So things like \"hand flapping or rocking or skin picking, but also sticking to repeated routines, like eating the same food every day.\"",
      "The data",
      "But what evidence is there that the number of people meeting those criteria has risen?",
      "Ms Russell led a study that looked at changes in rates of autism diagnosis in the UK over 20 years. It drew on a big sample of data from about nine million patients who were registered at GP surgeries.",
      "They found eight times as many new autism diagnoses in 2018 as in 1998. \"It was an enormous increase,\" she says, \"best described as exponential.\"",
      "And it's not just happening in the UK. Though data is lacking in much of the world, Ms Russell says that \"in the Anglophone and European countries where we do have data, there is compelling evidence to suggest that other countries have seen a similar sort of rise in diagnosis as in the UK\".",
      "But - and this is a crucial point - a rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism is not the same thing as a rise in the number of people who are autistic.",
      "Ms Russell's study and others like it show there has been a huge rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism, so in that sense there is more autism around than there used to be. But could that rise in diagnosis be explained by changes to who we count as autistic rather than an increase in the number of autistic people?",
      "Why are diagnoses rising?",
      "The definition of autism has not been static. The first studies to describe autism appeared in the 1930s and 1940s, says Francesca Happ\u00e9, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at King's College London, who's been researching autism since 1988.",
      "\"The original descriptions of autism are of children who have pretty high support needs, typically are very late to talk,\" she says. \"Some don't talk at all. And the focus really was on children, of course, and largely on males.\"",
      "But the definition was broadened, Prof Happ\u00e9 says, when in the 1990s Asperger's syndrome was added to diagnostic manuals. People with Asperger's were seen as on the autistic spectrum because of social difficulties and repetitive behaviour, but had fluent language and good intelligence, she says.",
      "The eightfold increase in new diagnoses that Ginny Russell found included Asperger's syndrome, which was seen as a particular type of autism.",
      "Another subset of autism added to the manuals was a \"safety net diagnosis\" called \"pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified\" (PDD-NOS) and that increased the numbers too.",
      "Today, diagnostic manuals refer simply to autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, which includes people previously diagnosed with Asperger's or PDD-NOS.",
      "The autism net has been cast wider.",
      "Autism in women and girls",
      "One group of people now falling under this net more often is women and girls.",
      "Studies looking at the huge rise in autism diagnoses show that the rise has been considerably faster for females than for males.",
      "It's something Sarah Hendrickx has seen in her job as part of a team that diagnoses autism.",
      "\"I've been doing this maybe 15, 20 years or so,\" she says. \"In the early days, they were virtually all males that were coming forward for diagnosis. And now they're nearly all females who I see.\"",
      "Ms Hendrickx was herself diagnosed with autism as an adult and is also the author of a book called Women and Girls on the Autism Spectrum.",
      "She says the big growth in the number of people diagnosed with autism is because we're\u202f\"playing catch-up for decades and decades of people like myself\".",
      "Because autism was originally seen as something that affected mainly boys, she says autistic girls would instead be diagnosed with mental health conditions like social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD).",
      "Now we have a better understanding of how autism can present in girls and women, thanks to an increase in research and books like Ms Hendrickx's, which was first published in 2014.",
      "She says that one important gender difference is that girls may be better at masking, which means hiding their autistic traits so that they fit in socially, perhaps by copying others' behaviour.",
      "More adults diagnosed",
      "The rise in diagnosis has also been much faster among adults than children. Ms Hendrickx says this shows another way the autism net has been cast wider: it now includes more people with lower support needs.",
      "\"We are talking, I think, more about individuals with no intellectual disability,\" she says. \"I think people with delays in their development, in their speech, are much more likely to have been diagnosed much, much earlier because the signs were much clearer at a very young age.\"",
      "There's data to back this up. One study shows that between 2000 and 2018, new autism diagnoses of those with intellectual disability rose about 20%, while autism diagnoses in those without intellectual disability rose 700%. Autism's centre of gravity has shifted.",
      "For Ellie Middleton, an autistic and ADHD content creator and author, that's a good thing.",
      "The 27-year-old says that sceptics questioning the increase in diagnoses should instead be asking: \"how did all of these people spend so much of their life undiagnosed, unsupported and let down?\"",
      "She says she became very mentally unwell before being diagnosed with autism. \"I was on the maximum dose of antidepressants that any fully grown adult could be on at the age of 17,\" she says. \"I couldn't be left alone, I couldn't go out.\"",
      "Her autism diagnosis three years ago helped her to change the way she lives her life and to keep her mental health in a better place.",
      "But others worry that the version of autism people now see in the media and in their social media feeds is distorting public perceptions.",
      "A focus on celebrities can \"glamorise\" autism, says Venessa Swaby, who is also autistic and runs support groups for autistic children and their parents through her organisation A2ndvoice. Meanwhile, she says, families with non-speaking autistic children feel they are \"written off\".",
      "As the number of people diagnosed with autism has risen, so then has the diversity of autistic people, which, in turn, has brought tensions over who owns the word - and what it means.",
      "Environmental causes",
      "There's also been a looping effect: as more people are diagnosed with autism, more people become aware of it and that fuels the rise in numbers further.",
      "The internet and social media have played a big part in that - as well as speculation about the reasons behind the rapid rise in diagnoses.",
      "Disproven theories linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination to autism linger. Others say there must be something in what we eat, drink, or breathe that's causing more autism.",
      "But, as we've seen, the data suggest the rise in diagnoses can be explained by a broadening autism definition rather than an increase in the amount of underlying autism. And there's solid research showing that autism is largely a product of the genes you inherit from your parents.",
      "Is there any evidence that environmental causes could be playing some part in the rise, even if a small one?",
      "Ginny Russell looked at research into different potential environmental factors and found only a few that were plausible to explain some of the rise.",
      "\"There is definitely a quite well established link between autism and the age of the parent,\" she says. \"If the parent is older you're more likely to have an autistic child, but it's not a huge effect.\"",
      "She also says that there's some evidence around \"preterm birth and infection during pregnancy and also some birth complications\".",
      "But Ms Russell says it's important to put those possible factors into perspective.",
      "\"I honestly believe that the vast majority of the increase is due to what I would call a diagnostic culture,\" she says. \"Our conception of the condition has changed, and that's meant that there's been an increase.\"",

    "summary": "The Bank cuts rates for the second time this year, saying the slowdown in inflation was behind the move.",
    "story": [
      "UK interest rates have been cut to 4.25% from 4.5% and the governor of the Bank England has hinted more could follow in the coming months.",
      "Andrew Bailey said he would not \"give predictions as to when and how much\", but said he was \"still of the view that the path, gradually and carefully, is downwards\".",
      "The reduction in rates on Thursday marks the fourth cut within the past year and the Bank considered an even bigger cut to 4% due to concerns the global trade war could hit UK economic growth.",
      "Mr Bailey welcomed a UK-US deal on tariffs and said it was \"important as a signal, I hope, of many more to come\", adding a UK trade deal with the European Union would be \"beneficial\".",
      "\"Maybe we need a bit of a jolt to the system to remind us that trade is important,\" Mr Bailey said, adding he hoped the likes of deals between the UK and US, and the UK and India, would help to \"rebuild the world trading system\".",
      "On Thursday, the UK and US announced a deal to avoid tariffs on certain goods in order to boost trade.",
      "As it announced the latest cut in interest rates, the Bank said that while a trade war could hit economic growth, it could lead to lower inflation in the UK over time as countries such as China look to divert cheap goods originally bound for America.",
      "Mr Bailey said the path for rates was \"downwards\", but said future rate cuts were likely to be \"gradual and careful\".",
      "The minutes of the Bank's meeting showed the rate-setting committee was divided. Of the nine members, five voted to cut rates to 4.25%, two voted in favour of a larger reduction to 4% and two voted for no change.",
      "The Bank's base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.",
      "More than eight in 10 customers have fixed-rate deals, but could continue to face higher repayment costs when renewing.",
      "However, mortgage rates have been edging down recently, primarily because the markets and lenders expect further rate cuts this year.  On Thursday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.14%, while a five-year deal was 5.08%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.",
      "About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so rates being cut will have an impact on monthly repayments.",
      "A typical tracker mortgage-holder is likely to see about \u00a329 knocked off their monthly repayments following the latest cut, said the banking trade body UK Finance.",
      "Homeowner Vanda, who has a tracker, told the BBC she had a \"really good rate\", but then got \"caught out\" when rates were previously increased.",
      "\"A drop would help because I've just been made redundant, so that would help a wee bit. I don't think it will ever go back to the way it was, though,\" she said.",
      "Interest rates are the Bank's main tool in try to maintain the annual rate of inflation at, or close to, its target of 2%.",
      "The most recent UK inflation figures show prices rose 2.6% in the year to March. However, the rate is expected to jump following a series of household bill increases at the start of April \u2013 including energy and water prices.",
      "The Bank said it expected inflation to rise \"temporarily\" to 3.5% this year due to the bill increases before falling back due lower oil and gas prices set to feed through in the coming months.",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "UK inflation rate: How quickly are prices rising?",
      "The theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing.",
      "But it is a balancing act as high interest rates can harm the economy as businesses hold off on investing in production and jobs.",
      "The Bank expects UK growth for the first three months of this year to be stronger than it originally forecast at 0.6%, boosted by US firms stockpiling goods ahead of Trump's tariffs coming into effect. The official figures are set to be released next week.",
      "A boost in growth would be welcome news to the government, which has made growing the economy its main priority in order to boost living standards.",
      "The government's Budget decision to increase National Insurance last month for employers kicked in last month, but the Bank said the effect of the tax increase \"appears to have been fairly small to date\", though it added business confidence had taken a hit in recent months.",
      "A lot of firms are taking a \"wait and see\" approach to whether the UK economy picks up before hiring and investing, it said.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the latest rate cut was \"welcome news\", but added: \"There is more to do, and I know families are still facing cost of living pressures.",
      "Mr Bailey said the UK had \"still a lot to do\" on growth: \"We have seen over the last, really since the financial crisis, 15 years or so now, the rates of growth be consistently lower than they were before that.\"",

    "story": [
      "Prisons minister James Timpson has told the BBC more criminals could be tagged in future instead of being sent to prison - but insists he's not \"soft on crime\".",
      "More than 30 companies, including Microsoft and Google, will meet the government today to explore how technology could help monitor offenders in the community more effectively and tackle violence in prison.",
      "Lord Timpson says tagging more people instead of sending them to prison is a potential alternative punishment.",
      "But critics have questioned his previous comments about the UK being \"addicted\" to sentencing and punishment, and how \"only a third\" of inmates should be in prison.",
      "\"I don't think I'm soft on crime at all,\" Lord Timpson says in the wide-ranging BBC interview. \"I think I'm pretty tough in my style. In business, I'm tough but I use the evidence - and in this job I'm using the evidence.\"",
      "He says he is passionate about rehabilitating offenders in prison so they don't commit further crimes when released. However, 38.3% of adult criminals in England and Wales go on to reoffend within a year of being let out of prison.",
      "\"How do we reduce re-offending? How do we deal with people's drug addiction, mental health problems, the fact that people leave prison they don't know where to live, people don't have a job? That is also a really important part of my job,\" he says.",
      "How many people are in prison and who is being released early from jail?",
      "The former CEO of the Timpson Group, which provides key cutting and shoe repair services, is known for hiring ex-offenders and is a former chairman of the Prison Reform Trust.",
      "Lord Timpson took up his role at the Ministry of Justice in July last year, when the penal system in England and Wales was close to breaking point. Prisons were full, and months later thousands of inmates were released early as part of an emergency plan to ease overcrowding and free up space.",
      "He says prisons are still in a state of \"crisis\", with fewer than 1,000 spare places and more than 88,000 people in custody in England and Wales.",
      "\"We recently opened HMP Millsike,\" he says, describing the new category C prison which opened in East Yorkshire in March, with capacity for up to 1,500 inmates. \"We've got more cells opening across the country. We need to keep building prison places because the population is going up.\"",
      "Last month, three prison officers were seriously injured at HMP Frankland, in Durham, after they were attacked with makeshift weapons and hot oil by one of the men responsible for the Manchester Arena bombing. Hashem Abedi was being held in a separation centre - used to house a small number of the most dangerous and extremist inmates - at the category A, maximum security jail.",
      "\"What happened in Frankland is absolutely shocking,\" Lord Timpson says. \"The level of violence in prisons is far too high - and it is increasing.",
      "\"Our prison staff did an incredible job. I don't want them to turn up to work thinking that there's going to be violence. I want them to turn up to work helping people turn their lives around.\"",
      "However, the number of assaults on staff in prison is the highest in a decade, with 10,605 recorded in 2024.",
      "Violence, overcrowding, self-harm: BBC goes inside one of Britain\u2019s most dangerous prisons",

      "Prison officers deal drugs and ask inmates for sex, BBC told",
      "Probation: 'Too few staff, with too little experience, managing too many offenders'",
      "Lord Timpson refutes claims that gangs are in charge of some of Britain's biggest jails, but acknowledges that serious organised crime is the one thing that \"keeps me awake at night\".",
      "\"Serious organised crime brings drugs in and creates violence and intimidation in prisons,\" he says. \"This has been a long-term problem in prisons, but it is even more of a problem when the capacity is as full as it is.",
      "\"If we had people who went to prison who didn't get drugs and weren't intimidated by serious organised criminals, they'd be far more likely to engage with a sentence and get well enough so that when they leave they don't commit further crime.\"",
      "Why Starmer hired key-cutting boss as prisons minister",
      "The government has commissioned an independent sentencing review to explore alternatives to prison in an attempt to ease overcrowding. The review will provide long-term solutions for the justice system and examine the use and composition of non-custodial sentences, including community alternatives to prison and the use of fines. Increased tagging will also be considered.",
      "The total number of people fitted with an electronic monitoring device in England and Wales on 30 June 2024 was 20,893, an increase of 17% on the previous year.",
      "There are three types of ankle tags currently used to monitor offenders: alcohol, GPS, and curfew tags. A new study suggests tags that monitor curfews cut reoffending by 20%.",
      "\"We want them to have a one-way ticket - not a return back into prison or back into non-custodial sentences,\" Lord Timpson says.",
      "\"What's really important is we embrace technology and look at the evidence - tagging can have some very important benefits.\"",
      "But the use of electronic tagging to monitor offenders has been problematic. In recent months several probation staff have told the BBC offenders who should be tagged, have not been. The security company Serco has been contracted by the government to manage tagging since October 2023.",
      "\"We inherited a contract with Serco and it's been far from perfect,\" Lord Timpson says. \"We're putting a lot of pressure still on them to perform, but we need to work together to make sure that people are tagged on time in the right way. Things are getting better, but we're not there yet.\"",
      "Anthony Kirby, Serco Group CEO, told the BBC he is pleased the prisons minister has recognised the progress Serco has made since taking over the electronic monitoring service: \"We are proud of the role we have supporting the Criminal Justice System, monitoring record numbers of people in the community and protecting public safety in partnership with HMPPS.\"",

      "In a significant blow to the government's clean energy ambitions the Danish energy company Orsted has cancelled plans for a huge windfarm off the coast of East Yorkshire.",
      "The Hornsea 4 project would have become one of the biggest offshore wind farms in the world with a potential capacity of 2.4GW \u2013 enough to power more than a million homes.",
      "Orsted said the project no longer made economic sense, despite signing a 15-year contract with the UK government guaranteeing to sell power at an agreed price.",

      "Thay project was sold to the German energy company RWE, which has said it plans to see the project through.",
      "However, the difficulties offshore developers are facing raise significant questions about the viability of the government's clean power by 2030 target \u2013 one of the Labour government's five central \"missions\".",
      "Just over half of the country's power currently comes from wind, solar, nuclear and biomass \u2013 organic matter.  The government wants to raise that to 95% by 2030 \u2013 so in just five years' time.",
      "In order to meet that target the UK will need to triple offshore wind capacity and double the amount of solar and onshore wind power on the system, according to estimates by Aurora Energy.",
      "It will also need a significant upgrade to the electricity grid with 620 miles of new power lines as well as substations and other equipment.",

      "Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, has long argued building out this infrastructure in the timescale would be near impossible.",
      "\"In failing to meet a very short-term target, it is going to maximise the costs of trying,\" he has warned.",

Even his own MPs are saying it's wrong. He's refused to listen to me on this, will he at least listen to his own party and change course?\"",
      "In response, Sir Keir said: \"No other party is saying how they would invest in our NHS and public services.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey also urged the PM to reverse the cuts, saying this was \"among the messages voters sent ministers last week\".",
      "The winter fuel payment is a lump sum worth between \u00a3200 and \u00a3300, designed to help with higher energy costs during the colder weather.",
      "It was previously paid to all pensioners but last year the government restricted this to only the poorest, who qualify for pension credit and other income-related benefits, in a bid save \u00a31.4bn.",
      "The move, which did not feature in Labour's general election manifesto, means around nine million pensioners no longer qualify for the payment.",
      "Labour MPs who oppose the cuts believe a reversal of the policy would be a clear sign from the prime minister that he is listening to voters.",
      "However, others closer to government thinking question whether there would be any political benefit to changing course at this stage, believing the damage has already been done.",
      "Criticism of changes to disability benefits, which would make it harder for people to claim Personal Independence Payment (Pip), could become a more pressing issue, with a vote in the House of Commons likely next month.",

      "Opposition parties have criticised the new UK-India trade deal, saying it could undercut British workers.",
      "One aspect of the free trade agreement, which Labour says will be worth \u00a35bn a year to the UK, is extending an exemption on national insurance contributions (Nics) from one to three years.",
      "Known as the double contribution convention, this means people on short-term visas will not make social security payments in both the country they work in, and their home country, when working abroad.",
      "Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Reform have claimed this could mean Indian workers become cheaper to hire than British workers - particularly when UK employer Nics have just been increased.",
      "The Indian government said the exemption was a \"huge win\" and an \"unprecedented achievement\" that \"will make Indian service providers significantly more competitive in the UK\".",
      "The UK has 16 agreements preventing double taxation of work, which cover more than 50 countries - including the US, EU and South Korea - and workers will still be required to pay the NHS immigration surcharge.",
      "Defending the deal, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the arrangement was limited and only applied to inter-company transfers of professionals between the UK and India.",
      "\"This is something we have with a great deal of countries already,\" he said.",
      "\"It's very specific as to who this applies to, and obviously if people were in the UK they would still be paying income tax, they would still be paying, for instance, the health surcharge and they wouldn't be eligible for benefits from the National Insurance system.\"",

      "The exemption will also apply to British staff, who are increasingly working away from home in India for large corporations.",
      "However, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch claimed she had refused a similar trade-off when she was business secretary, because the deal contains \"two-tier taxes\" which will cost the UK \"hundreds of millions\".",
      "\"I had this deal on the table as trade secretary and I refused to sign it because that double taxation agreement was unfair,\" she said.",
      "\"It basically encourages workers from India but does not provide the same benefit to UK citizens.\"",
      "Pushed on the fact the UK has similar arrangements with other countries, Badenoch stressed that in those cases there were equivalent numbers of UK nationals working in those countries, whereas that was not the case with India, making the agreement \"very lopsided\" which would result in being a \"net cost to the Treasury.\"",
      "UK and India agree trade deal after three years of talks",
      "UK - India free trade deal at a glance",
      "Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the National Insurance plans were \"half-baked\" and risked damaging UK businesses' competitiveness, particularly  in light of the global trade turmoil sparked by US President Donald Trump.",
      "\"This deal risks undercutting British workers at a time when they're already being hammered by Trump's trade war and Labour's misguided jobs tax,\" she said.",
      "\"The government's failure to even publish an impact assessment of these changes gives the impression of something that is completely half-baked.",

      "Former cabinet minister Louise Haigh, who resigned last year, has hit out at the winter fuel cuts, adding that they had become a \"totemic\" issue for many voters.",
      "Writing in the Sunday Times over the weekend, she argued that winter fuel and proposed benefits cuts were \"primary examples offered as to why the Labour government simply did not look like it understood their priorities\".",
      "The move has also been opposed by unions and the main opposition parties.",
      "Speaking to the BBC earlier, Streeting said he would not be \"pretending that winter fuel didn't come up on the doorstep, of course it did\".",

      "\"We did protect it for the poorest pensioners, but there are a lot of people saying they disagree with it regardless.\"",
      "However, he also defended the move as part of a wider package of changes, that would provide the \"means of raising the investment\" in public services.",
      "\"Unfortunately when you look across the board at the breadth and depth of the multiple crises that we've inherited, in order to deliver the change that people voted for we have had to do heavy lifting at the Budget,\" he added.",

      "The potential for a shake-up in the Senedd is partly down to plans to expand the number of politicians there from 60 to 96 - the brainchild of former First Minister Mark Drakeford and former Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price.",
      "As well as more politicians, the new parliament is likely to better reflect the proportion of votes won by each party - more so than the mixed system used up until now.",
      "This is important when it is considered against polls that suggest Welsh voters are divided.",
      "Two recent ones - from Survation and Beaufort Research - have put Labour ahead of Plaid and Reform but only just.",
      "But a poll by ITV Wales and Cardiff University conducted in late April placed Plaid on 30%, with Reform behind on 25% and Labour on 18% - a historic low. The Conservatives were placed at 13%, the Lib Dems 7% and the Greens 5%.",
      "All recent polling for Labour on Senedd voting intention is lower than how the party performed at the last general election, where it got 37% of the vote.",
      "Cardiff University politics expert Prof Richard Wyn Jones said the previous mixed proportional and first-past-the-post system helped Labour win around 50% of the seats in Wales with \"a third of the vote\".",
      "He said elections in both Wales and Scotland next year will be the \"most high-profile test for the Starmer administration\".",
      "\"It would be utterly seismic if they are not the largest party in Wales,\" he told BBC Wales.",
      "Prof Wyn Jones spoke before Tuesday's poll was published - as did everyone else in this article. He said Labour's chances of coming first should not be written off.",
      "\"But even if Labour is only barely ahead, that would be seismic because it would mean the Labour group in the Senedd is essentially not much bigger than the current Labour group in the Senedd, and the Senedd would be 36 seats bigger,\" he said.",
      "So, what could be behind it all?",
      "The post-pandemic period has been tough for Welsh Labour \u2013 plunged into crisis over the donation of \u00a3200,000 from a man convicted of illegally dumping waste to its now-former leader, Vaughan Gething.",
      "The row exposed splits within the Labour group of 30 MSs. Despite Welsh Labour having a landslide general election result, several Welsh ministers resigned to force Gething's ouster, prompting the rise of Morgan as first minister.",
      "Even before Drakeford decided to step down in late 2023, triggering the leadership contest that Gething won, Labour MSs had been arguing over transport policies, including the default 20mph speed limit, while the government has been struggling with long waits in the Welsh NHS.",
      "Former Labour special advisor turned lobbyist Cathy Owens, of Cavendish Cymru, partly blamed the leadership crisis and factors at a UK level.",
      "Or, as she puts it: \"As soon as Labour won power at UK level... everybody realised that Keir Starmer wasn't the most exciting leader we've had and then Labour had to make lots of difficult decisions.\"",
      "'We were lecturing over 20mph'",
      "NHS waits and the controversial 20mph speed limit were always among the top three issues relayed on the doorstep at the general election, according to a well-connected Welsh Labour activist.",
      "They said a mix of Welsh and UK issues were at play, but argued that the Welsh government \"got complacent\".",
      "The activist blamed the \"way\" the 20mph speed limit was delivered - \"it told voters we weren't listening to them and we were essentially lecturing them\".",
      "\"I agree with the desired outcomes of the policy, but you can't treat voters like that,\" they said.",
      "Alun Davies, Labour Blaenau Gwent MS, acknowledged the public was \"frustrated with politics\" but said: \"Labour remains the party that probably most people in Wales feel represents their own values.\"",
      "The politician, who is involved in the production of the party's manifesto, said: \"Eluned has got the power to transform Welsh Labour's fortunes during an election campaign.",
      "\"She is very straight-talking - what you see is what you get.\"",
      "Wales' Labour first minister says she will 'call out' Starmer",
      "Politics 'doesn't work' for many people in Wales",
      "Cathy Owens said the current first minister needed two things to get to 30% of the vote or more, \"one of which is to reduce waiting times\".",
      "For the second thing, Ms Owens said Morgan needed help from her party colleagues in the UK government - \"some funding, or some extra investment\" over and above what is automatically provided through the existing Barnett formula system, which is largely based on population.",
      "\"Now, that is proving more of a sticky wicket,\" she said. \"There has been no evidence of a win so far on that\".",
      "The relationship between Welsh and Westminster Labour has become a big part of the story of Morgan's time as Welsh Labour leader.",
      "She has been increasingly keen to distance herself from Sir Kier Starmer - on Tuesday she gave a speech where she was willing to call out his government, should it take decisions that \"harm\" Welsh communities.",
      "'The polls tell a good story'",
      "One party hoping to benefit from the turn in Labour's fortunes is Plaid Cymru.",
      "The left-leaning party has long struggled to beat its strong showing in the first assembly election of 1999 when it won almost 29% of the vote, but the splintering of British politics has presented Plaid with an opportunity.",
      "Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth has been presenting himself as a first minister in waiting, while the party has published plans on health and the economy it said it would enact if it formed the next Welsh government.",
      "Unlike their political cousins in Scotland, the SNP, Plaid has never won a Welsh election and came third last time round.",
      "It took part in a short-lived coalition with Labour between 2007 and 2011, and helped Labour govern more recently in the form of the co-operation deal which ended in summer 2024.",
      "\"We're not getting too carried away with the polls,\" Plaid's Senedd party chairman Llyr Gruffydd said. \"But the polls do tell a good story for us.\"",
      "\"We will clearly be highlighting the need for change. It's a tired government.\"",
      "He said the party will face a challenge in helping \"people realise that this is a different electoral system. Every single vote counts - there will not be a wasted vote\".",
      "It was put to Gruffydd that it was difficult for Plaid to be seen as anti-establishment when it had been involved in helping Labour govern. \"We won't shy away from the fact that we've been punching above our weight... and still achieving elements of our manifesto,\" he said. \"Imagine what we could do if we were in government.\"",
      "'There's so much frustration'",
      "One party hoping to make their big entrance into Welsh politics is Farage's Reform UK.",
      "The party has polled closely to Labour and Plaid Cymru and came second in 13 seats at the last general election. While it has five MPs in England, and some councillors in Wales, it has no-one at Senedd at present.",
      "It is celebrating its recent English local election successes, where it made big gains, won control of 10 councils, two mayors and a by-election from Labour.",
      "Pointing to who the party is in Wales is difficult - it is yet to decide who will stand for them at the next election, or who might act as a figurehead.",
      "They are not starting from scratch - Farage's previous party UKIP had a short-lived stint in the Senedd after it won seven AMs in 2017.",
      "At least one of their former AMs is hoping to become a Reform MS - Caroline Jones. She is hoping to stand for Reform in the seat of Pen-y-bont Bro Morgannwg - which covers Bridgend and Vale of Glamorgan.",
      "Opponents accuse Reform of simply being a protest party, something that would be denied by Jones. She told BBC Wales that another former UKIP Senedd politician, and one-time Tory MP and ex-Abolish the Assembly AM, Mark Reckless, was working with a team on policy for the Senedd.",
      "\"At the moment, there's so much frustration among the public - we are offering something different.\"",
      "Jones added: \"You have to have a party that's representative of the people, as opposed to just representing their own interests.\"",
      "UKIP's time in the Senedd was characterised by two changes in leadership, rows, and splits. At one point there were more UKIP AMs who had been leader than had not - including Jones herself.",
      "\"The Reform party is united,\" she said. \"There are hardly any arguments at all, and anything that people disagree on.\"",
      "Other parties may try to capitalise on Farage's relationship with the controversial US president Donald Trump to galvanise opposition to Reform.",
      "Jones said that was not a negative: \"If we've got special links with America, then I think it's to be capitalised on.\"",
      "Asked if she thought the party needed a Welsh figurehead, she said: \"That's above my pay grade.\"",
      "'This is what we're for'",
      "The Conservatives have a relatively new leader in the Senedd - Darren Millar, who took over late last year after a row over the leadership of Andrew RT Davies.",
      "Under Millar the party has tried to present itself as a serious alternative to Labour, with the Senedd leader keen to show he can be the next first minister and not simply an opposition force.",
      "But the Tories are still in the shadow of a disastrous general election, where the party went from having won 14 seats in the 2019 vote to zero. Recently it has been polling in fourth place. It came second in the Senedd election in 2021.",
      "Samuel Kurtz, chairman of the Tory group in the Senedd, said he was excited by the prospect of the election and the \"opportunities of a different political landscape come 8 May 2026\".",
      "The MS for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire said: \"We need to put forward a positive vision for what Wales could look like. We have had 25 years of the same party in charge, the same government, and a tried and tested method of pretty much trying the same thing.",
      "\"It's saying, look, this is what we're for. We're for a stronger economy, we're for the ability for families to have choice over certain things like education, we're for agriculture, we're for tourism.\"",
      "He added: \"What we've really done with Darren is really hunker down as to what is our USP as Welsh Conservatives, what are we for... rather than just saying we are against the 20mph speed limit for example, or we're against the tourism tax.\"",
      "Asked why he thought the Welsh Conservatives were struggling in polls, former Senedd Tory adviser Anthony Pickles said: \"Because the national party is still so involved in trying to work out its future strategy, its very difficult for the Welsh Conservatives to be diverging, and creating their own brand proposition\".",
      "Smaller parties are thought to be at a disadvantage in the new system - with experts suggesting parties need 13% to 15% to win seats.",
      "That is not to say they won't try - with the Greens among those who will be hoping to enter the Welsh Parliament for the first time.",
      "The Liberal Democrats, who won one regional seat at the last Senedd election and one at the last general election, are hoping to win more.",
      "Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds previously told the BBC: \"We'll have gold everywhere. Look at what we did in England [at the last general election].",
      "\"No-one thought we would win 72 seats. The results were coming in fast and furious that night and I reckon it is going to be like that next May as well.\"",
      "Who could work with who?",
      "It is early days, but the prospect of the electorate being split four ways or more raises questions about how the next government could be formed.",
      "Politicians can be reluctant to talk about the topic with 12 months to go, but for Labour, you would assume a deal with the Conservatives or Reform would be unthinkable. Ministers have instead worked with Plaid and the Lib Dems in the past.",
      "Plaid have ruled out working with Reform, but not Labour or the Tories.",
      "The Conservative's Kurtz declined to talk about who the party might work with, but said the likelihood of a coalition is \"nailed on - it'll have to be a coalition. No one party will reach the threshold of governing on their own\".",
      "Plaid's Gruffydd said a rotating first ministership - similar to how the coalition running the Irish government has operated with rotating prime ministers - \"could be on the agenda\".",
      "\"It depends on the arithmetic,\" he said, suggesting it could be discussed if there are \"two parties thoroughly at the same kind of level\".",
      "But Ms Owens said if Labour held at 27% as in some recent polls, you are \"more likely to have a Labour first minister\", with the party a few seats or more ahead of Plaid.",
      "Prof Wyn Jones also argued the upheaval in geopolitics could play a role.",
      "It could not be predicted, he argued, whether something happening worldwide could make people feel more positive about Labour.",
      "The expert added: \"This is such a hugely uncertain time that everything that we are saying needs to be caveated.\""

    "story": [
      "\"It's all depressing to be honest\". Those are the words of one Labour MP, hitherto proudly supportive of the government, as they returned to Parliament on Tuesday morning.",
      "The anger among Labour MPs in the aftermath of the party's local elections drubbing was striking in its breadth and depth. The evidence so far is that it did not dissipate over the long weekend.",
      "The focus of many MPs' rage - and it is rage - is the means-testing of the winter fuel allowance.",
      "It is not just the view of critical MPs that this harmed Labour in the elections, but of cabinet ministers too.",
      "Earlier Health Secretary Wes Streeting told Breakfast: \"I'm not going to insult your viewers by pretending that winter fuel didn't come up on the doorstep, of course it did, and I know that people aren't happy about winter fuel allowance in lots of cases.\"",
      "Government sources spent Tuesday morning scotching the suggestion that a formal review of the policy is under way, and by the afternoon they were adamant.",
      "\"There will not be a change to the government's policy,\" the prime minister's official spokesman said.",
      "Local elections at-a-glance: What's happened?",
      "Henry Zeffman: Seven things we have learnt from the election results",
      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "That will be a disappointment to those Labour MPs who believed that reversing the policy on winter fuel would be the clearest sign to the public that the prime minister, as he said on Friday morning, \"gets it\".",
      "Others closer to government thinking questioned whether there would be any political benefit to changing course at this stage, believing the damage has been done.",
      "Given the categorical denial of any wiggle room on winter fuel, more topical perhaps is the debate over the government's welfare reforms.",
      "The changes in eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) were announced in March but require parliamentary approval. A vote in the House of Commons is likely next month.",
      "Given Sir Keir's colossal majority there is no prospect of the government losing that vote. But there is the possibility that it becomes the locus of broader disaffection with the government's direction.",
      "One Labour MP who identified winter fuel and Pip as the two key reasons for Labour's poor showing last week said the latter was a more acute problem.",
      "\"When people were complaining about winter fuel on the doorstep you'd look at the [canvassing] sheet and often it's people who have never voted for us or haven't voted for us for a long time. With Pip, they were our people.\"",
      "Even those Labour MPs who are more frustrated than angry at the decline in the party's support over the past ten months believe that Sir Keir and his team need to do more to carry their parliamentary ranks with them.",
      "\"There's still a lot of goodwill,\" one said. \"But if we don't have a sense of what the strategic direction is soon then the PLP [Parliamentary Labour Party] will become unmanageable.\"",
      "Pat McFadden, one of the most senior cabinet ministers but also the director of Labour's successful 2024 general election campaign, will deliver a presentation to MPs about the local election results on Wednesday evening.",
      "Questions about the party's strategic direction will be paramount. Though the principal beneficiary of Thursday's local elections at Labour's expense was Reform UK, there are plenty in Labour who worry just as much about bleeding votes on their left flank to more progressive parties such as the Greens.",
      "Many are noting that in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election the Conservative vote more than halved, at least partly due to defections to Labour to stop Reform. Meanwhile, the Green vote actually nudged upwards.",
      "\"We couldn't squeeze the progressive vote - and we'll need to do that at the general election,\" one government source said.",
      "Cooler heads believe that in the scenario of a general election where the most plausible prime ministers were Sir Keir or Nigel Farage, voters on the broad left would inevitably coalesce around Labour.",
      "And whereas the next general election is as much as four years away, events over the next few weeks could help.",
      "A UK-EU summit on May 19 is seen as an opportunity to put significant meat on the bones of the European \"reset\" for which the prime minister has spent much of the past year pushing.",
      "Party strategists believe that a clear demonstration from the prime minister that he believes the UK should be more closely allied to Europe will boost progressive support.",
      "It could also solve other problems. If the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) were to upgrade its forecasts for economic growth as a result of closer ties to the EU, then that would give Rachel Reeves more money to spend in this autumn's Budget.",
      "Before the EU summit, however, comes next week's immigration white paper - which will contain more detail of the government's plans to reduce legal migration and improve the asylum system.",
      "This is seen in government both as a crucial way to demonstrate to sceptical voters that Labour is serious about dealing with their concerns about immigration, as well as a potentially tricky moment for the progressive segment of Labour's coalition.",
      "\"We can't be sheepish about this, we need to make an argument to our own people that there's nothing progressive about letting people smugglers run the English Channel or letting cheap foreign labour undercut good wages,\" one government source said.",
      "And once the rage subsides, many in the Labour Party remember that things could be worse.",
      "Unlike the Conservatives, confronting arguably a much deeper malaise, Labour are in government at control of the levers of power.",
      "\"Things are going to materially improve over the coming years,\" a senior government source said. \"There is no way through this that doesn't involve making people feel better off.\"",

      "True, the party's share of the votes cast across all 23 councils where elections took place on Thursday was no more than 31%. So despite doing well, it secured far from a majority of those voting.",
      "However, its performance was enough to put Reform well ahead of the Conservatives \u2013 who traditionally dominate county councils - on 23%, the Liberal Democrats on 17% and Labour on 14% when you tally up the votes in those parts of England that went to the polls on Thursday.",
      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "At the 2024 general election Reform secured 14% of the vote but just 5 out of 650 seats at Westminster. But crucially, being ahead of everyone else in 2025 ensured the first-past-the-post election system helped Reform.",
      "Its tally of 677 council seats represented 41% of all those being contested on Thursday, 10 points above its share of the vote, a nod to both the nature of the voting system and Reform's ability to cluster votes. That boost helped the party win control of as many as 10 councils, something that Reform's predecessor, UKIP, never managed at the height of its popularity in the run up to the 2015 general election.",
      "In Staffordshire, Reform won 72% of the seats on 41% of the vote. In Kent, 37% of the vote delivered it 70% of the seats, while in Derbyshire the same share was rewarded with 66% of all the councillors.",
      "Instead of insulating Conservative and Labour from the impact of a third-party challenge, as it has done so often before, first past the post exacerbated their losses. In both cases Reform took nearly half of all the seats those parties were defending.",
      "The map above is the most detailed local election mapping ever produced by the BBC. It details the strength of the Reform vote in every ward that voted on Thursday and shows support for Reform varied considerably.",
      "That variation has some striking and important features. They suggest the party was particularly popular among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019 - and that Reform's success cannot simply be dismissed as a short-lived protest vote.",
      "Brexit still a fault line",
      "Reflecting the party's anti-EU stance, Reform did much better in wards that voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum than it did in wards that backed Remain.",
      "In wards where more than 65% voted Leave in 2016, Reform won on average as much as 45% of the vote. In contrast, in places where a majority backed Remain, only 19% voted for Reform.",
      "Although talked about much less by politicians nowadays, Brexit is still an important fault line in our politics. Reform's appeal is significantly concentrated among those who believe the Brexit decision was right.",
      "Even so, the fact that even in pro-Remain wards the party was able to win as much as a fifth of the vote was testimony to the scale of the swing that it enjoyed on Thursday.",
      "The Brexit division is also evident in the demographic character of the places where Reform did best and those where it did less well.",
      "University graduates and those in professional and managerial jobs were least likely to vote for Brexit in 2016. Reform found it more difficult to do well in places where they are most numerous.",
      "Reform won 39% of the vote in heavily working-class wards but only 19% in the most middle-class ones.",
      "The map shows Reform's highest vote of all (65.1%) was in Thornley & Wheatley Hill, situated in Tony Blair's former Sedgefield constituency in Durham and once a centre of coal mining. Next highest was Romney Marsh in Kent and Chadsmoor in Staffordshire.",
      "Meanwhile, support for the party averaged 43% in wards where more than half of adults have few, if any, educational qualifications. In contrast, it polled just 19% where more than two in five have a degree.",
      "Reform's lowest share of the vote, 3.7%, was in the Parks ward in Oxford, situated in the heart of the famous university city.",
      "Immigration is also a key issue for Reform. However, this perhaps makes the party less appealing to those from a minority background.",
      "Certainly, on average the party only polled 22% in wards where more than one in five identify as other than 'white', compared with a tally of 33% in places where more than 95% told the 2021 Census that they were 'white'.",
      "In summary, Reform did best in what has sometimes been characterised in the wake of the Brexit referendum as 'left-behind' Britain \u2013 places that have profited less from globalisation and university expansion and where a more conservative outlook on immigration is more common.",
      "A problem for the two main parties",
      "Neither the Conservatives nor Labour are likely to recover from the drubbing they received on Thursday unless they can appeal more to this slice of Britain.",
      "Although polls indicate that Reform finds it easier to win over former Conservative voters than their Labour counterparts, Reform's average share of the vote was strikingly just as high in wards that Labour were defending as it was in places that the Conservatives were trying to retain.",
      "The party on average won 32% of the vote in previously Labour wards and 32% in Conservative ones.",
      "As a result, Labour lost seats to Reform at much the same rate as the Conservatives, a pattern that cost Labour control of the one council they were defending, Doncaster.",
      "In contrast, Reform's advance was more muted in wards that the Liberal Democrats and the Greens were defending.  The party's average share in these wards was just 22%. As a result, Reform had relatively little success in taking seats from these two parties.",
      "Liberal Democrat and Green wards \u2013 unlike many Conservative and Labour ones - are heavily populated by university graduates.",
      "Reform's success on Thursday undoubtedly reflects the mood of an electorate that still has little faith in the Conservatives and which now is disappointed by Labour's performance in office.",

      "Regional mayors are now commonplace in England: Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester, Ben Houchen in the Tees Valley and Tracy Brabin in West Yorkshire are all well-known spokespeople for their areas.",
      "But the most prominent directly-elected mayor in Britain was also the first: London.",
      "As is fitting for a city as exciting as London, the first election for that coveted position included allegations of betrayal, stitch ups and intrigue \u2013 and one candidate ended up in prison.",
      "Twenty five years ago Tony Blair's government, elected in 1997 and known as New Labour, was very keen on a new form of devolution.",
      "They wanted mayors like those in America, big personalities elected with powers and budgets (but not too many powers, or too big a budget).",
      "In the end, only one was created by Blair's government.",
      "The 1998 Greater London Authority referendum, held in May that year, asked whether there was support for creating a Greater London Authority with a directly elected mayor and Assembly.",
      "The voters were less keen than New Labour - just 34% turned out to vote, but the majority was clear nonetheless: 72% in favour.",
      "The 'Yes' vote won in every London borough, with support lowest in Bromley with 57% and highest in Haringey with 84%.",
      "Now London was to have a mayor, who would it be?",
      "The obvious candidate was Ken Livingstone, the former left-wing firebrand (and publicity-friendly) leader of the Greater London Council (GLC), who went toe-to-toe with the Thatcher government - and lost.",
      "The GLC was abolished in 1986, leaving London in the unenviable position of having 32 boroughs (and the City of London) but no overall strategic elected body for the largest city in Europe.",

      "Dobson had initially, and somewhat bravely, declared his desire to remain at health, but then had to give up his cabinet seat to run for a job he didn't want.",
      "The internal workings of Labour can be difficult for outsiders - and many insiders - to navigate.",
      "In this case, an electoral college was mandated which led to the popular Livingstone not winning selection.",
      "The vote was a third each for party members, trade unions and London MPs and other elected representatives.",
      "In the final ballot Livingstone won 60% of party members and 72% of affiliated unions, but Dobson won 86% of MPs, MEPs and Greater London Assembly candidates.",
      "Dobson therefore won a narrow overall victory, and the Blairites were accused of rigging the whole thing to keep Old Labour Ken from the nomination.",
      "Livingstone for his part had promised not to run as an independent, then decided that that was what he was going to do after all.",
      "The Tories also had a colourful time choosing their candidate.",
      "In September 1999 the novelist Jeffrey Archer was selected by party members, beating Steve Norris.",
      "But in a plot twist reminiscent of one of his books, Archer withdrew from the race a few months later after it was alleged he had committed perjury in a famous libel case.",
      "Lord Archer had secured the Conservative nomination with backing from former prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major, who in 1992 had made him a peer.",
      "Five years earlier, in 1987, Archer had won a libel case against The Daily Star which published a story that he had paid off a sex worker called Monica Coghlan.",
      "After his selection as a mayoral candidate, a former friend of Archer's told the News of the World that he had lied in the libel trial and asked him to provide a false alibi.",
      "Archer stood down from the race, and starred in a production of his courtroom play, The Accused, in London's West End while waiting for his trial to start.",
      "In July 2001 he was found guilty and spent two years in jail, but retained his peerage and membership of the House of Lords as there was no mechanism to remove them at the time.",
      "Norris was selected as the Conservative Party candidate to replace Archer.",
      "A very different type of Tory, Norris advocated for gay rights and had a relaxed approach to monogamy.",
      "He was also a former transport minister who was obsessed with buses.",
      "In that role, he had a hand in approving the Jubilee line extension from Green Park to Stratford, and the privatisation of London's bus services.",
      "In the rough and tumble world of turn of the century politics, he was given the nickname \"Shagger\".",
      "A brief snippet from a Guardian profile piece published during that first mayoral campaign gives a flavour of Norris' complex appeal.",
      "\"The day his original candidature was announced was marked by a letter to the Times from his father-in-law, a retired rear-admiral, expressing astonishment at Norris's public plans to marry the fourth of his famous five mistresses \u2026 since as far as the rear-admiral knew, Norris was still married to his daughter.\"",
      "Norris was a self-made man, a millionaire car salesman who grew up in working class Liverpool, attending the same school as Paul McCartney.",
      "Not many 2025 Tories can boast that sort of hinterland.",
      "There may have been some intrigue in the Lib Dem selection process, but it is lost to history if there was.",
      "Their candidate was the estimable Susan Kramer, who was subjected to condescension and mansplaining throughout the campaign - this was a time when female Labour MPs were referred to as \"Blair's Babes\" by tabloid and broadsheet newspapers alike.",
      "Livingstone was to mount the first - and so far only - successful independent bid for Mayor of London.",
      "Dobson ran a campaign that never really captured the imagination of London's voters, and his old comrade won the historic poll despite a late surge in support for the Tory candidate.",
      "The May 2000 election was a disaster for New Labour: Dobson got just 13% of the vote and was eliminated in the first round along with Susan Kramer, who polled a respectable 11.9% for the Lib Dems.",
      "Livingstone led by 39% to 27% of first preference votes and polled a total of 776,427 votes to 564,137 for Norris, after second preferences were calculated.",
      "It was a bloody nose and a notable defeat for the previously unassailable Tony Blair.",
      "The BBC News website has an archive of reports from this election, a time capsule of the way politics used to be.",
      "It reported that Dobson's \"humiliation in the mayoral poll was underlined as he came fourth in the mayoral contest in Barnet and Camden - the seat which includes his parliamentary constituency\".",
      "The 2000 election reports reveal Livingstone said he would \"fight for the interests of Londoners as mayor, demanding more money from the government and telling ministers they were wrong over plans to partially privatise the London Underground\".",
      "London Underground, now part of Transport for London, remains in public hands under the control of the Mayor of London.",
      "It also reported that Blair \"made it clear Mr Livingstone would not be allowed to return to Labour after standing against an official party candidate\".",
      "Blair was wrong about that: in 2004 Livingstone was the Labour candidate, and he won, again defeating Norris.",
      "Livingstone was his party's standard bearer again in both 2008 and 2012, on both occasions losing to a young Conservative contender called Boris Johnson.",

      "Kosmos 482 was launched in 1972 as part of a mission to Venus but it never escaped low Earth orbit and separated into four pieces, according to Nasa.",
      "One of those pieces, believed to be the lander probe, is expected to re-enter our atmosphere around 10 May and at least part of it could survive the journey without burning up, according to Nasa.",
      "There is much we don't know about the re-entry, including where it might land, but even if any of it does survive, 70% of the planet is covered by sea so it is unlikely to cause significant damage.",
      "\"It's much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris.\" said Mr Stijn Lemmens, Senior Space Debris Mitigation Analyst at the European Space Agency.",
      "The lander capsule is a tough, spherical object about a metre wide and weighs nearly half a tonne.",
      "It was built to survive the extreme heat and pressure of Venus's atmosphere, meaning it has a robust heat shield and durable structure.",
      "This is why experts think it may survive an uncontrolled descent through Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The parachute system, originally intended to slow the lander's descent towards Venus, is likely long since degraded after more than 50 years in space.",
      "The risk to people on the ground is considered low, but the capsule's projected flight path could see it land anywhere between 51.7\u00b0 north and south latitude, covering most of the inhabited world.",
      "This means it could potentially land anywhere from as far north as London to as far south as the southern tip of South America.",
      "Uncontrolled space debris incidents have occurred before.",
      "Mr Lemmens explained that the \"re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs quite frequently,\" happening weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones. Objects typically burn up in the earth's atmosphere before they reach the ground.",
      "China's Long March 5B booster re-entered over the Indian Ocean in 2022, and the Tiangong-1 space station mostly burned up over the Pacific in 2018.",

    "published": "Tue, 06 May 2025 20:13:28 GMT",
    "summary": "Sir David says his new film Ocean is one of the most important of his career.",
    "story": [
      "Sir David Attenborough is launching what he says is one of the most important films of his career as he enters his hundredth year.",
      "He believes his new, cinema-length film Ocean could play a decisive role in saving biodiversity and protecting the planet from climate change.",
      "Sir David, who will be 99 on Thursday, says: \"After almost 100 years on the planet, I now understand the most important place on Earth is not on land, but at sea.\"",
      "The ocean is the planet's support system and humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe, the film argues. It shows how the world's oceans are at a crossroads.",
      "The blue carpet was rolled out for the premiere the Royal Festival Hall in London.",
      "In attendance was the King, told Sir David he \"can't believe\" his 99th birthday was on Thursday.",
      "The pair posed for photos before they entered the auditorium for the screening.",
      "A host of celebrities also attended, including singer Geri Halliwell-Horner, astronaut Tim Peake, singer James Blunt and model Cara Delevingne.",
      "Earlier, Prince William attended a matinee in a \"private capacity\", along with hundreds of children from schools across the country.",
      "Toby Nowlan, who produced Ocean, says this new production is not a typical Attenborough film. \"This is not about seeing brand new natural history behaviours.  It is the greatest message he's ever told,\" he says.",
      "The film documents how the state of the world's oceans and our understanding of how they function have changed in the course of Sir David's lifetime.",
      "Sir David remembers his first scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef way back in 1957:  \"I was so taken aback by the spectacle before me I forgot \u2013 momentarily \u2013 to breathe.\"",
      "Since then, there has been a catastrophic decline in life in the world's oceans.  \"We are almost out of time,\" he warns.",
      "Ocean contains some of the most graphic footage of the damage that bottom trawling \u2013 a common fishing practice around the world - can do to the seabed. It is a vivid example of how industrial fishing can drain the life from the world's oceans, Sir David claims.",
      "The new footage shows how the chain that the trawlers drag behind them scours the seafloor, forcing the creatures it disturbs into the net behind. They are often seeking a single species: more than three-quarters of what they catch may be discarded.",
      "\"It's hard to imagine a more wasteful way to catch fish,\" comments Sir David.",
      "The process also releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide which contributes to the warming of our planet, yet bottom trawling is not just legal but is actively encouraged by many governments.",
      "Sir David says the state of the ocean has almost made him lose hope for the future of life on the planet. What has kept him from despair is what he calls the \"most remarkable discovery of all\" \u2013 that the ocean can \"recover faster than we had ever imagined\".",
      "Sir David says the story of the world's whales has been a source of huge optimism for him.",
      "It is estimated that 2.9 million whales were killed by the whaling industry in the 20th Century alone. Scientists have said it is the largest cull of any animal in history when measured in terms of total biomass. It pushed almost all whale species to the edge of extinction.",
      "Just one per cent of Blue Whales were left, recalls Sir David: \"I remember thinking that was it. There was no coming back, we had lost the great whales.\"",
      "But in 1986 lawmakers bowed to public pressure and banned commercial whaling worldwide. The whale population has rapidly recovered since then.",
      "One of the film's directors, Keith Scholey, has worked with Sir David for 44 years.  \"When I first met David, I was in shorts,\" he jokes. That was in 1981, two years after Sir David had resigned as the BBC's director of programmes \u2013 one of the most senior jobs at the Corporation. \"He'd done one career, and he was off on his next.\"",
      "Despite now nearing his 99th birthday Sir David is still remarkably energetic, says Scholey. \"Every time you work with David, you learn something new,\" he says.  \"It's really good fun. But also, David keeps you on your mettle, because he is so on his mettle and so, you know, it's always a very creative process.\"",
      "Sir David's key message in the Ocean film is that all is not lost.  Countries have promised to protect a third of the world's oceans.  He hopes his new film will spur leaders to take firm action on this promise at a UN conference next month.",
      "He believes that could be transformational.",
      "\"The ocean can bounce back to life,\" Sir David says. \"If left alone it may not just recover but thrive beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.\"",
      "A healthier ocean ecosystem would also be able to trap more carbon dioxide, helping protect the world from climate change, according to scientists.",
      "\"In front of us is a chance to protect our climate, our food, our home,\" Sir David says.",
      "As he celebrates his 99th birthday this week he is still fighting to protect the natural world he has worked his lifetime to show to us in all its glory.",

    "summary": "In a letters to MPs, four major banks have set out the extent of the disruption caused in February's outage.",
    "story": [
      "About 1.2m people in the UK were affected by banking outages that happened on what was pay day for many earlier this year.",
      "The details have emerged in letters from Lloyds, TSB, Nationwide and HSBC to Dame Meg Hillier, the chair of the Commons Treasury Committee, which is looking into the incident that occurred on Friday, 28 February.",
      "HSBC also revealed that customers had to wait two hours on average that day to reach its online customer service team. Its standard target wait time is five minutes.",
      "In their correspondence, the banks said they had paid compensation to affected customers and also outlined what they were doing to try to prevent similar problems in the future.",
      "Pay day problems",
      "Lloyds Banking Group customers faced the biggest impact from the February outages.",
      "Ron van Kemenade, the bank's group chief operating officer, said around 700,000 people who are customers of Lloyds, Halifax, Bank of Scotland and MBNA were affected as they couldn't log into their accounts on a first attempt.",
      "However Mr van Kemenade argued it did not amount to an outage, as there were five million successful logins during the period of disruption.",
      "Nonetheless, the bank said it was improving its log-in infrastructure and monitoring systems following the incident.",
      "The letters from the banks revealed about 250,000 TSB customers, 196,255 from Nationwide and 60,000 from HSBC also faced disruption on that morning.",
      "The banks have paid out over \u00a3114,000 in compensation to customers so far, with Nationwide (\u00a384,341) paying the most.",
      "All the banks said there was no evidence of an increase in fraudulent activity during the disruption, and said there was also no indication that outages were more prevalent at some times - such as pay days - than at other periods.",
      "Fine and failing infrastructure",
      "The pay day outage was far from the only IT problem the banking sector has experienced.",
      "In March, it emerged that nine major banks and building societies operating in the UK accumulated at least 803 hours - the equivalent of 33 days - of tech outages in the past two years.",
      "The Treasury Committee - which has been investigating the impact of banking IT failures - compelled Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, Nationwide, Santander, NatWest, Danske Bank, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank to provide the data.",
      "The report also said Barclays could now face compensation payments of \u00a312.5m following an outage there that affected customers on pay day in January.",
      "Experts including Patrick Burgess of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, and Shilpa Doreswamy, a director with GFT, a company committed to the digital transformation of the financial sector, have stated that the recent outages reveal the problems banks have with ageing infrastructure and failing IT systems.",
      "Ms Doreswamy told the BBC on Thursday that payday outages were \"not just a case of unfortunate timing\" but also predictable, preventable events.",
      "\"They've highlighted the need for banks to invest in IT modernisation to prevent the eroding of customer trust,\" she said.",
      "Not acting to reduce the possibility of downtime or frustration for customers - particularly during high-demand periods - could potentially see banks risk their reputation and losing customers, Ms Doreswamy added.",
      "\"When customers can't access their wages, pay bills or run their businesses, the impact is not just financial, it becomes deeply personal.\"",

      "The Wikimedia Foundation - the non-profit which supports the online encyclopaedia - is seeking a judicial review of rules which could mean Wikipedia is subjected to the toughest duties required of websites under the act.",
      "Lead counsel Phil Bradley-Schmieg said it was \"unfortunate that we must now defend the privacy and safety of Wikipedia's volunteer editors from flawed legislation\".",
      "The government told the BBC it was committed to implementing the act but could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.",
      "It's thought this is the first judicial review to be brought against the new online safety laws - albeit a narrow part of them - but experts say it may not be the last.",
      "\"The Online Safety Act is vast in scope and incredibly complex,\" Ben Packer, a partner at law firm Linklaters, told the BBC.",
      "The law would inevitably have impacts on UK citizens' freedom of expression and other human rights, so as more of it comes into force \"we can expect that more challenges may be forthcoming\", he told the BBC.",
      "These will add to the array of challenges the act already faces, from claims its burdensome rules are forcing harmless small websites to close - to those who argue the law and its enforcement are too weak and not up to the job.",
      "Why is Wikipedia unhappy?",
      "The OSA requires the regulator, Ofcom, to categorise platforms according to a number of factors, including how many users they have and what features they offer.",
      "Those designated \"Category 1\" - the highest level - will face additional duties to keep users safe.",
      "In very simple terms, sites are most likely to be classed as Category 1 if they allow millions of UK users to interact and share content with each other, and have systems that recommend content.",
      "These rules were originally designed to target the services where UK users were most likely to encounter harmful content - but Wikipedia is concerned they are so vaguely defined there is \"a significant risk\" it will be included in Category 1.",
      "If that happened, the consequences for the army of volunteers who write and edit articles could be serious and would reach beyond the UK, the Foundation argues.",
      "It has singled out additional duties which could, in effect, require the site to verify the identities of its volunteers - something it fears could expose them to data breaches, stalking, vexatious lawsuits or even imprisonment by authoritarian regimes.",
      "\"We would be forced to collect data about our contributors, and that would compromise their privacy and safety, and what that means is that people would feel less safe as contributors\", Rebecca MacKinnon the Wikimedia Foundation's vice president of global advocacy told the BBC",
      "\"We've seen in other parts of the world, when people do not feel safe contributing to Wikipedia, then they shy away from controversial topics that may be challenging to to people who are powerful, and that reduces the quality and the usefulness of the encyclopaedia\".",
      "'Outlier' services",
      "The Wikimedia Foundation stresses it is not trying to challenge the OSA in general, or the idea that there should be Category 1 services subject to additional duties.",
      "Instead, it is challenging parts of the so-called \"Categorisation Regulations\" that set out how the regulator Ofcom will decide which sites will have to follow the most stringent duties.",
      "It argues, as currently defined, they risk not only inappropriately catching sites such as Wikipedia but also missing some platforms which should be abiding by tougher rules.",
      "\"The Regulations do not just risk overregulating low risk \"outlier\" services, like Wikipedia,\" Phil Bradley-Schmieg wrote in a blog post.",
      "\"As designed, the regulations will also fail to catch many of the services UK society is actually concerned about, like misogynistic hate websites\".",
      "The foundation argues its volunteers already do an effective job of keeping harmful content off the platform.",
      "After the 2024 Southport murders, volunteers worked night and day to provide reliable and neutral information Mr Bradley-Schmieg wrote.",
      "Ben Packer argues the foundation will have a high bar to cross to convince a court that the Secretary of State acted unlawfully making the regulations.",

      "The judge rejected Epic's monopoly claims, but found Apple was stopping developers from giving users alternative payment options in violation of California competition rules.",
      "She ordered Apple to make changes that would help developers steer customers to cheaper payment options outside of the Apple ecosystem.",
      "Last year, Epic accused Apple of failing to comply by creating a new set of fees for developers instead.",
      "In a contempt order last week, Judge Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple continued to interfere with competition, saying that internal company documents showed Apple deliberately violated her 2021 injunction.",
      "'Substantial sums'",
      "On Wednesday, Apple requested an appeals court take action, including by lifting a ban that stops it from charging developers fees on purchases made outside the App Store.",
      "The company wrote that such restrictions \"will cost Apple substantial sums annually\" and are based on conduct that has not been found unlawful.",
      "\"Rather, they were imposed to punish Apple for purported non-compliance with an earlier state-law Injunction that is itself invalid,\" Apple wrote.",
      "In response, Epic Games said Judge Gonzalez Rogers' contempt order last week was already benefitting consumers.",
      "\"Apple has faced a surge of genuine competition as developers have updated their apps with better payment methods, better deals, and better consumer choice,\" Epic wrote in a post on the social media platform X.",
      "The company criticized Apple's motion as \"a last ditch effort to block competition and extract massive junk fees at the expense of consumers and developers.\"",
      "Epic says it is on track with plans to bring Fortnite back to iPhones and iPads.",

      "\"To Gabriel Horcasitas, the man who shot me, it is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances,\" said the AI version of Mr Pelkey in court. \"In another life, we probably could have been friends.\"",

      "Arizona courts, he notes, already have started using AI in other ways. When the state's Supreme Court issues a ruling, for example, it has an AI system that makes those rulings digestible for people.",

      "\"We'll be leaning [AI] on a case-by-case basis, but the technology is irresistible,\" he said.",

      "\"If we have other people doing this moving forward, are we always going to get fidelity to what the person, the victim in this case, would've wanted?\" Mr Leben asked.",
      "For Ms Wales, however, this gave her brother the final word.",
      "\"We approached this with ethics and morals because this is a powerful tool. Just like a hammer can be used to break a window or rip down a wall, it can also be used as a tool to build a house and that's how we used this technology,\" she said."

      "It allowed people to make computer-to-computer calls free, and then became the way users could make low cost calls to landlines and mobiles to people in other parts of the world.",
      "In recent years though, Skype has been diminishing as its owner Microsoft focussed on Teams. Its services will close for good on 5 May, with the Skype for Business feature the only part to remain.",

    "story": [
      "High above the Arctic Circle, the archipelago of Svalbard lies halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole.",
      "Frozen, mountainous, and remote, it's home to hundreds of polar bears and a couple of sparse settlements.",
      "One of those is Longyearbyen, the world's northernmost town, and just outside the settlement, in a decommissioned coal mine, is The Arctic World Archive (AWA) - an  underground vault for data.",
      "Customers pay to have their data stored on film and kept in the vault, for potentially hundreds of years.",
      "\"This is a place to make sure that information survives technology obsolescence, time and ageing. That's our mission,\" says founder Rune Bjerkestrand, leading the way inside.",
      "Switching on head-torches we descended a dark passageway and followed the old rail tracks 300 metres into the mountainside, until we reached the archive's metal door.",
      "Inside the vault, stands a shipping container stacked with silver packets, each containing reels of film, on which the data is stored.",
      "\"It's a lot of memories, a lot of heritage,\" Mr Bjerkestrand says.",
      "\"It's anything from digitised art pieces, literature, music, motion picture, you name it.\"",
      "Since the archive's launch eight years ago, more than 100 deposits have been made by institutions, companies and individuals, from 30-plus countries.",
      "Among the many digitised artefacts are 3D scans and models of the Taj Mahal; tranches of ancient manuscripts from the Vatican Library; satellite observations of Earth from space; and Norway's treasured painting, the Scream, by Edvard Munck.",
      "The AWA is a commercial operation and relies on technology provided by Norwegian data preservation company, Piql, which Mr Bjerkestrand also heads.",
      "It was inspired by the Global Seed Vault, a seed bank that's located only a few hundred metres away, a repository where crops can be recovered after natural or manmade disasters.",
      "\"Today, there are a lot of risks to information and data,\" said Mr Bjerkstand. \"There is terrorism, war, cyber hackers.\"",
      "According to him, Svalbard is the perfect place, for hosting a secure data storage facility.",
      "\"It's far away from everything! Far away from wars, crisis, terrorism, disasters. What could be safer!\"",
      "Underground it's dark, dry and chilly, with temperatures remaining sub-zero all year-round; conditions which Mr Bjerkestrand claims are ideal for keeping the film safe for centuries.",
      "Should global warming cause the thick Arctic permafrost to thaw, the vault is still robust enough to preserve its contents he says.",
      "At the back of the chamber, another large metal box contains GitHub's Code Vault.",
      "The software developer has archived hundreds of reels of open source code here, which are the building blocks underpinning computer operating systems, software, websites and apps.",
      "Programming languages, AI tools, and every active public repository on its platform, written by its 150 million users, are also stored here.",
      "\"It's incredibly important for humanity to secure the future of software, it's become so critical to our day to day lives,\" Githhub's chief operating officer, Kyle Daigle tells the BBC.",
      "His firm has explored a variety of long-term storage solutions, he said, and there are challenges. \"Some of our existing mechanisms can be stored for a very long time, but you need technology to read them.\"",
      "At Piql's headquarters in southern Norway, data files are encoded onto photosensitive film.",
      "\"Data is a sequence of bits and bytes,\" explains senior product developer, Alexey Mantsev, as film ran through a spool at his fingertips.",
      "\"We convert the sequence of the bits which come from our clients data into images. Every image [or frame] is about eight million pixels.\"",
      "Once these images are exposed and developed, the processed film appears grey, but viewed more closely, it's similar to a mass of tiny QR codes.",
      "The information can't be deleted or changed, and is easily retrievable explains Mr Mantsev.",
      "\"We can scan it back, and decode the data just the same way as reading data from a hard drive, but we will be reading data from the film.\"",
      "One key question arising with long-term storage methods, is whether people will understand what has been preserved and how to recover it, centuries into the future.",
      "That's a scenario Piql has also thought about, and so a guide that can be magnified and read optically, is printed onto the film, as well.",
      "Every day more data is being used and generated than ever before, but experts have long warned of a potential \"digital Dark Age\", as technological advances render previous software and hardware obsolete.",
      "That could mean the files and formats we use now, face a similar fate to the floppy disks and DVD drives of the past.",
      "Many firms offer long-term data storage.",
      "Cassettes of magnetic tape known as LTO (Linear Tape Open), are the most common form, but newer innovations promise to revolutionise how we preserve information.",
      "For example, Microsoft's Project Silica has developed 2mm-thick panes of glass, onto which chunks of data is transferred by powerful lasers.",
      "Meanwhile a team of scientists from the University of Southhampton have created a so-called 5D memory crystal, which has saved a record of the human genome.",
      "That's also been placed in the Memory of Mankind repository, another vault safeguarding historic documents, hidden in a salt mine in Austria.",
      "The Arctic World Archive receives deposits three times a year, and as the BBC visited, recordings of endangered languages and the manuscripts of the composer Chopin, were among the latest reels placed in the vault.",
      "Photographer, Christian Clauwers, who's been documenting South Pacific Islands threatened by sea level rise, was also adding his work.",

    "story": [
      "Even before his name was announced from the balcony of St Peter's Basilica, the crowds below were chanting \"Viva il Papa\" - Long live the Pope.",
      "Robert Prevost, 69, will be the 267th occupant of the throne of St Peter and he will be known as Leo XIV.",
      "He is the first American to fill the role of Pope, although he is considered as much a cardinal from Latin America because of the many years he spent as a missionary in Peru, before becoming a bishop there.",
      "Born in Chicago in 1955 to parents of Spanish and Franco-Italian descent, Prevost served as an altar boy and was ordained as a priest in 1982. Although he moved to Peru three years later, he returned regularly to the US to serve as a pastor and a prior in his home city.",
      "He has Peruvian nationality and is fondly remembered as a figure who worked with marginalised communities and helped build bridges.",
      "He spent 10 years as a local parish pastor and as a teacher at a seminary in Trujillo in northwestern Peru.",

      "In his first words as Pope, Leo XIV spoke fondly of his predecessor Francis.",
      "\"We still hear in our ears the weak but always courageous voice of Pope Francis who blessed us,\" he said.",
      "\"United and hand in hand with God, let us advance together,\" he told cheering crowds.",
      "He also spoke of his role in the Augustinian Order. He was 30 when he moved to Peru as part of an Augustinian mission.",
      "Francis made him Bishop of Chiclayo in Peru a year after becoming Pope.",
      "He is well known to cardinals because of his high-profile role as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops in Latin America which has the important task of selecting and supervising bishops.",
      "He became archbishop at the same time in January 2023 and within a few months  Francis made him a cardinal.",
      "As 80% of the cardinals who took part in the conclave were appointed by Francis, it is not all that surprising that someone like Prevost was elected, even if he was only recently appointed.",
      "What are Pope Leo's views?",
      "He will be seen as a figure who favoured the continuity of Francis' reforms in the Catholic Church.",
      "Prevost is believed to have shared Francis' views on migrants, the poor and the environment.",
      "A former roommate of his, Reverend John Lydon, described Prevost to the BBC as \"outgoing\", \"down to earth\" and \"very concerned with the poor\".",
      "On his personal background, Prevost told Italian network RAI before the conclave that he grew up in a family of immigrants.",
      "\"I was born in the United States...But my grandparents were all immigrants, French, Spanish...I was raised in a very Catholic family, both of my parents were very engaged in the parish,\" he said.",
      "Although Prevost is an American, and will be fully aware of the divisions within the Catholic Church, his Latin American background also represents continuity after a Pope who came from Argentina.",
      "The Vatican described him as the second pope from the Americas, after Pope Francis, as well as the the first Augustinian pope.",
      "During his time in Peru he has not escaped the sexual abuse scandals that have clouded the Church, however his diocese fervently denied he had been involved in any attempted cover-up.",
      "Before the conclave, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said that during gatherings of the College of Cardinals in the days before the conclave they emphasised the need for a pope with \"a prophetic spirit capable of leading a Church that does not close in on itself but knows how to go out and bring light to a world marked by despair\".",
      "In choosing the name Leo, Prevost has signified a commitment to dynamic social issues, according to experts.",
      "The first pope to use the name Leo, whose papacy ended in 461, met Attila the Hun and persuaded him not to attack Rome. The last Pope Leo led the Church from 1878 to 1903 and wrote an influential treatise on worker rights.",
      "Former Archbishop of Boston Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley wrote on his blog that the new pontiff \"has chosen a name widely associated with the social justice legacy of Pope Leo XIII, who was pontiff at a time of epic upheaval in the world, the time of the industrial revolution, the beginning of Marxism, and widespread immigration\".",
      "Speaking last year about climate change, Prevost said that it was time to move \"from words to action\".",
      "\"Dominion over nature\" should not become \"tyrannical,\" he said. He called on mankind to build a \"relationship of reciprocity\" with the environment.",
      "He also spoke about the Vatican's commitment to the environment, noting the installation of solar panels in Rome and the adoption of electric vehicles.",
      "He has supported Pope Francis' decision to allow women to join the Dicastery for Bishops for the first time, giving them input on those appointments.",
      "\"On several occasions we have seen that their point of view is an enrichment,\" he told Vatican News in 2023.",
      "In 2024, he told the Catholic News Service that their presence \"contributes significantly to the process of discernment in looking for who we hope are the best candidates to serve the Church in episcopal ministry\"."

India says it has clear evidence linking Pakistan-based terrorists and external actors to the attack - a claim Pakistan flatly denies. Islamabad has also pointed out that India has not offered any evidence to support its claim.",

      "\"This seems to mirror Israel's doctrine that deterrence requires periodic, repeated strikes. But if we assume that hitting back alone will deter terrorism, we risk giving Pakistan every incentive to retaliate - and that can quickly spiral out of control.\"",
      "Could this spiral into a broader conflict?",
      "The majority of experts agree that a retaliation from Pakistan is inevitable - and diplomacy will come into play.",
      "\"Pakistan's response is sure to come. The challenge would be to manage the next level of escalation. This is where crisis diplomacy will matter,\" says Mr Bisaria.",
      "\"Pakistan will be getting advice to exercise restraint. But the key will be the diplomacy after the Pakistani response to ensure that both countries don't rapidly climb the ladder of escalation.\"",
      "India and Pakistan are in crisis again - here's how they de-escalated in the past",
      "India and Pakistan are in crisis again - here's how they de-escalated in the past",
      "Pakistan-based experts like Ejaz Hussain, a Lahore-based political and military analyst, say Indian surgical strikes targeting locations such as Muridke and Bahawalpur were \"largely anticipated given the prevailing tensions\".",
      "Dr Hussain believes retaliatory strikes are likely.",
      "\"Given the Pakistani military's media rhetoric and stated resolve to settle the scores, retaliatory action, possibly in the form of surgical strikes across the border, appears likely in the coming days,\" he told the BBC.",
      "But Dr Hussain worries that surgical strikes on both sides could \"escalate into a limited conventional war\".",
      "Christopher Clary of the University at Albany in the US believes given the scale of India's strikes, \"visible damage at key sites\", and reported casualties, Pakistan is highly likely to retaliate.",
      "\"Doing otherwise essentially would give India permission to strike Pakistan whenever Delhi feels aggrieved and would run contrary to the Pakistan military's commitment to retaliating with 'quid pro quo plus',\" Mr Clary, who studies the politics of South Asia, told the BBC.",
      "\"Given India's stated targets of groups and facilities associated with terrorism and militancy in India, I think it is likely - but far from certain - that Pakistan will confine itself to attacks on Indian military targets,\" he said.",
      "Despite the rising tensions, some experts still hold out hope for de-escalation.",
      "\"There is a decent chance we escape this crisis with just one round of reciprocal standoff strikes and a period of heightened firing along the Line of Control,\" says Mr Clary.",
      "However, the risk of further escalation remains high, making this the \"most dangerous\" India-Pakistan crisis since 2002 - and even more perilous than the 2016 and 2019 standoffs, he adds.",
      "Is Pakistani retaliation now inevitable?",
      "Experts in Pakistan note that despite a lack of war hysteria leading up to India's strike, the situation could quickly shift.",
      "\"We have a deeply fractured political society, with the country's most popular leader behind bars. Imran Khan's imprisonment triggered a strong anti-military public backlash,\" says Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst and a former correspondent of Jane's Defence Weekly.",
      "\"Today, the Pakistani public is far less eager to support the military compared to 2016 or 2019 - the usual wave of war hysteria is noticeably absent. But if public opinion shifts in central Punjab where anti-India feelings are more prevalent, we could see increased civilian pressure on the military to take action. And the military will regain popularity because of this conflict.\"",
      "Dr Hussain echoes a similar sentiment.",
      "\"I believe the current standoff with India presents an opportunity for the Pakistani military to regain public support, particularly from the urban middle classes who have recently criticised it for perceived political interference,\" he says.",
      "\"The military's active defence posture is already being amplified through mainstream and social media, with some outlets claiming that six or seven Indian jets were shot down.",
      "\"Although these claims warrant independent verification, they serve to bolster the military's image among segments of the public that conventionally rally around national defence narratives in times of external threat.\"",
      "Can India and Pakistan step back from the brink?",
      "India is once again walking a fine line between escalation and restraint.",
      "Shortly after the attack in Pahalgam, India swiftly retaliated by closing the main border crossing, suspending a water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals. Troops on both sides have exchanged small-arms fire, and India barred all Pakistani aircraft from its airspace, mirroring Pakistan's earlier move. In response, Pakistan suspended a 1972 peace treaty and took its own retaliatory measures.",
      "This mirrors India's actions after the 2019 Pulwama attack, when it swiftly revoked Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, imposed heavy tariffs and suspended key trade and transport links.",
      "The crisis had escalated when India launched air strikes on Balakot, followed by retaliatory Pakistani air raids and the capture of Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, further heightening tensions. However, diplomatic channels eventually led to a de-escalation, with Pakistan releasing the pilot in a goodwill gesture.",
      "\"India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance.... This, with India having achieved a strategic and military objective and Pakistan having claimed a notion of victory for its domestic audience,\" Mr Bisaria told me last week."

      "A US judge in Boston ordered a temporary block on the Trump administration's plan to deport migrants to Libya, saying it would \"clearly violate\" a prior order he made that ensures their right to due process.",
      "The order came after two US officials told BBC partner CBS News that the US may soon start deporting migrants to Libya as part of its crackdown on immigration.",
      "In response to the deportations report, Libyan Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh wrote in a statement on X that his country refused \"to be a destination for the deportation of migrants under any pretext.\"",

      "US District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston responded late on Wednesday afternoon by issuing an order that restricts the Trump administration's ability to quickly deport the migrants.",
      "In his ruling, Judge Murphy said the deportations \"blatantly\" defy an injunction he had previously issued that protects the due process rights of migrants subject to final deportation orders.",
      "That earlier ruling requires officials to provide migrants with a written notice in their language and a meaningful opportunity to file a claim to protect them from removal.",
      "Asked whether he was aware of the plan to deport migrants to Libya, President Donald Trump said on Wednesday: \"I don't know. You'll have to ask homeland security.\"",
      "Libya is thought to be one of several countries asked to accept migrant deportations by Trump's administration.",

      "The country is considered a bright spot for the Roman Catholic church, where faith is strong, its rituals woven into the fabric of society.",
      "Yet the church is facing headwinds there. Its doctrines on divorce and family planning are being challenged by politicians, and newer charismatic churches are winning converts.",
      "Pope Francis helped restore morale in the Philippines church, though he did not offer answers to these challenges beyond being more welcoming of diversity and urging the clergy to be more responsive to the needs of the poor.",
      "But those on the activist wing of the church did feel encouraged by his support.",
      "For Cardinal David that support was critical when he faced his greatest test, during the war on drugs declared by former President Rodrigo Duterte in 2016.",
      "He took me to see a plaque he had erected in front of his cathedral in memory of Kian Delos Santos, a 17 year-old boy from his diocese who was gunned down by police in August 2017.",
      "Kian was just one of many thousands who died in Duterte's campaign \u2013 estimates range from 6,300 to 30,000. What made his case different from most was that the usual police justification, that he was armed and had resisted arrest, was contradicted by eyewitnesses and security camera videos.",
      "The police officers had murdered him as he pleaded for his life. Three officers were eventually convicted of the murder, a rare instance of accountability in the drug war.",

      "He began offering sanctuary to those who feared they were on police hit lists, and then drug-rehabilitation programmes, in the hope this might protect them.",
      "He also did something the church as a whole did not do for several months: he openly criticised the drug war as illegal and immoral.",
      "As a result, he received many death threats. President Duterte accused him of taking drugs, and talked about decapitating him. The government also filed sedition charges against him, though these were eventually dropped.",
      "In those difficult years Cardinal David found he had a powerful backer, in Rome.",
      "On a visit to the city in 2019 Pope Francis had taken him aside to give him a special blessing, saying he knew what was happening in his diocese and urging him to stay safe.",
      "When they met again in 2023, and he reminded the Pope that he was still alive, he says the pontiff laughed and told him: \"You have not been called to martyrdom yet!\"",
      "The role of the Roman Catholic church in the Philippines has changed over its 500-year history in the archipelago.",
      "It was closely associated with the Spanish conquest, Spanish friars acting as de facto colonial administrators and the church becoming a big landowner. When the US replaced Spain as the colonial ruler in 1898, enforcing a separation of church and state, the political influence of the Catholic clergy waned.",
      "But the church retained the allegiance of most of the population; even today, after inroads made by charismatic protestant churches, nearly 80% of Filipinos identify as Roman Catholic.",
      "Since independence in 1946 the church has had an uneasy relationship with power. Its deep roots and establishment status have made it an influential player, wooed by political factions but also needing their support to protect its interests.",
      "Attitudes began changing in the 1970s and 80s, the time when a young Pablo David and many other senior church figures today were studying to enter the priesthood.",
      "This was the era of \"liberation theology\", which came out of Latin America and argued that it was the duty of the clergy to fight against the pervasive poverty and injustice all around them.",
      "When then-President Marcos, father of the current president of the Philippines, declared martial law in 1972 and began jailing and killing his critics, some priests even went underground to join the armed resistance.",
      "But the church hierarchy continued what it called \"critical collaboration\" with the Marcos dictatorship.",
      "That changed dramatically in February 1986, when the then-Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Jaime Sin, called on people to come out on the streets and oppose Marcos, sparking the famous \"people power\" uprising which deposed the president.",
      "Cardinal Sin would reprise that role in 2001 when he helped overthrow another beleaguered president, Joseph Estrada.",
      "After that, though, church leaders were accused of cosying up to Estrada's successor, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, partly to gain her support in opposing growing political and social pressure to expand access to family planning and legalise divorce.",
      "And they were reluctant to condemn President Duterte's drug war because, despite the appalling human cost, it remained popular with the Filipino public, at least away from the poorer areas where the killings took place.",
      "Nearly 40 years after its pivotal role in overthrowing the Marcos regime, the church's influence once again seems to be waning, as it did a century ago.",
      "For instance, the Church's fervent opposition could not prevent the Philippines Congress from passing the Reproductive Health Law of 2012 that made family planning easily accessible.",
      "This is despite the fact that many Filipino Catholics remain conservative on issues like gender and divorce, says Jayeel Cornelio, a sociologist who has written extensively on Catholicism in the Philippines.",
      "The church's defeat over family planning, he says, is indicative of its diminished sway over national politics.",
      "\"The Catholic church was practically sidelined during the Duterte presidency. When Ferdinand 'Bongbong' Marcos ran for president in 2022, many Catholic leaders and institutions expressed their dissent and even endorsed the opposition. But Marcos still won.\"",
      "Many Filipinos welcome this, including, it seems, Cardinal David.",
      "\"It is not the business of the church to govern, neither is it the business of government to run a church\", he said.",
      "\"But we can complement one another - I cannot say we will be apolitical. So long as we stick to our role as a moral and spiritual leader, we can give guidance, even about political and economic matters.\"",
      "Even that more limited view of the church's proper role, though, has run into opposition.",
      "Thirteen years after overcoming ecclesiastical objections to the Reproductive Health Bill, the Philippines Congress is now trying to get a bill passed which would legalise divorce, something else the church disagrees with.",
      "\"I do not expect them to change their official doctrine, but in my job as a lawmaker, I try to address the problems that Filipinos face, and I don't want them to meddle in my work. It is against our constitution to legislate in favour of any religion,\" says Geraldine Roman, the first transgender member of Congress in the Philippines.",
      "A practicing Catholic, she credits Pope Francis with creating a more welcoming environment for LGBTQ+ people with his \"who am I to judge\" statement.",
      "\"Nobody misgenders me in my church now,\" she says.",
      "But she objects to the Catholic church lobbying against the divorce bill, which she argues will free thousands of Filipino women trapped in abusive marriages.",
      "\"The church is free to try to indoctrinate Catholics into sticking it out in their marriages. But in the end, it is the decision of the couple, and not even the church can meddle in that decision.\"",
      "Other challenges include a congregation which is increasingly disengaged. While the number of Roman Catholics has fallen only slightly in the past three decades, the number attending mass at least once a week has dropped by half, to just over one third of those surveyed recently.",
      "Then there are the various scandals associated with the Catholic church, especially the sexual abuse of minors, which critics say Pope Francis, while he did tackle the issue, did not do enough to address.",
      "Cardinal David recalled how President Duterte \"loved to wave\" a book called \"Altar of Secrets\", an expose of alleged scandals in the Filipino church, and how he would say, \"oh, those hypocrites. Don't listen to them. They don't practice what they what they preach. They are abusers. I must say some people swallowed it hook, line and sinker. So I am not surprised that our moral credibility has been challenged.\"",
      "But, he adds, defensiveness is not the way the Church can win back its credibility.",
      "\"It should be humility. As Pope Francis advised, dare to be vulnerable. Dare to be criticised. Try not to remain on that pedestal where people cannot reach you, show your humanity.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxnxg379ylo",
    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 23:13:03 GMT",
    "summary": "More than 100,000 men, women and children were reportedly forcibly disappeared by Bashar al-Assad's regime.",
    "story": [
      "\"These,\" says Dr Anas al-Hourani, \"are from a mixed mass grave.\"",
      "The head of the newly-opened Syrian Identification Centre is standing next to two tables, covered in femurs. There are 32 of the human thigh bones on each laminated white tablecloth. They have been neatly aligned and numbered.",
      "Sorting is the first task for this new link in the long chain from crime to justice in Syria. A \"mixed mass grave\" means that corpses were thrown one on top of another.",
      "The chances are, these bones belong to some of the hundreds of thousands believed to have been killed by the regimes of the ousted president Bashar al-Assad and his father, Hafez, who together ruled Syria for more than five decades.",
      "If so, says Dr al-Hourani, they were among the more recent victims: they died no more than a year ago.",
      "Dr al-Hourani is a forensic odontologist: teeth can tell you so much more about a body, he says, at least when it comes to identifying who the person was.",
      "But with a femur the lab workers in the basement of this squat grey office building in Damascus can begin the task: they can learn the height, the sex, the age, what sort of job they had; they might also be able to see whether the victim was tortured.",
      "The gold standard in identification is of course DNA analysis. But, he says, there is just one DNA testing centre in Syria. Many were destroyed during the country's civil war. And \"because of sanctions, a lot of the precursor chemicals that we need for the tests are currently not available\".",
      "They've also been informed that \"parts of the instruments could be used for aviation and so for military purposes\". In other words, they could be deemed \"dual use\", and so proscribed by many Western countries from export to Syria.",
      "Add to that, the cost: $250 (\u00a3187) for a single test. And, says Dr al-Hourani, \"in a mixed mass grave, you have to do about 20 tests to gather all the parts of one body\". The lab relies entirely on funding from the International Committee of the Red Cross.",
      "The new government of Islamist rebels-turned-rulers says that what they call \"transitional justice\" is one of their priorities.",
      "Many Syrians who have lost relatives, and lost all trace of them, have told the BBC that they remain unimpressed and frustrated: they want to see more effort from the people who finally chased Bashar al-Assad from power last December after 13 years of war.",
      "During those long years of conflict, hundreds of thousands were killed, and millions displaced. And, by one estimate, more than 130,000 people were forcibly disappeared.",
      "At the current rate, it can take months to identify just one victim from a mixed mass grave. \"This,\" says Dr al-Hourani, \"will be the work of many, many years.\"",

      "Eleven of those \"mixed mass graves\" are slung around a beautiful, barren hilltop outside Damascus. The BBC are the first international media to see this site. The graves are quite visible now. In the years since they were dug, their surface has sunk into the dry, stony earth.",
      "Accompanying us is Hussein Alawi al-Manfi, or Abu Ali, as he also calls himself. He was a driver in the Syrian military. \"My cargo,\" says Abu Ali, \"was human bodies.\"",
      "This compact man with a salt and pepper beard was tracked down thanks to the tireless investigative work of Mouaz Mustafa, the Syrian-American executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a US-based advocacy group. He had persuaded Abu Ali to join us, to bear witness to what Mouaz calls \"the worst crimes of the 21st Century\".",
      "Abu Ali transported lorry loads of corpses to multiple sites for more than 10 years. At this location, he came, on average, twice a week for roughly two years at the start of the demonstrations and then the war, between 2011 and 2013.",
      "The routine was always the same. He'd head to a military or security installation. \"I had a 16m (52ft) trailer. It wasn't always filled to the brim. But I'd have, I guess, an average of 150 to 200 bodies in each load.\"",
      "Of his cargo, he says he is convinced they were civilians. Their bodies were \"mangled and tortured\". The only identification he could see were numbers written on the cadaver or stuck to the chest or forehead. The numbers identified where they had died.",
      "There were a lot, he said, from \"215\" - a notorious military intelligence detention centre in Damascus known as \"Branch 215\". It is a place we will re-visit in this story.",
      "Abu Ali's trailer did not have a hydraulic lift to tip and dump his load. When he backed up to a trench, soldiers would pull the bodies into the hole one after another. Then a front-loader tractor would \"flatten them out, compress them in, fill in the grave.\"",
      "Three men with weathered faces from a neighbouring village have arrived. They corroborate the story of the regular visits by military lorries to this remote spot.",
      "And as for the man behind the wheel: how could he do this for week after week, year after year? What was he telling himself each time he climbed into his cab?",
      "Abu Ali says he learned to be a mute servant of the state. \"You can't say anything good or bad.\"",
      "As the soldiers dumped the corpses into the freshly excavated pits, \"I would just walk away and look at the stars. Or look down towards Damascus.\"",
      "'They broke his arms and beat his back'",
      "Damascus is where Malak Aoude has recently returned, after years as a refugee in Turkey. Syria may have been freed of the chokehold of the Assads' dynastic dictatorship. Malak is still serving a life sentence.",
      "For the past 13 years, she has been locked into a daily routine of pain and longing. It was 2012, a year after some of the people of Syria had dared to raise a protest against their president, that her two boys were disappeared.",
      "Mohammed was still a teenager when he was conscripted into Assad's army, as the demonstrations spread and the regime's deadly crackdown sparked a full-blown war.",
      "He hated what he was seeing, his mother says. Mohammed started absconding, and even went on the demos himself. But he was tracked down.",
      "\"They broke his arms and beat his back,\" says his mother. \"He spent three days unconscious in hospital.\"",
      "Mohammed went AWOL again. \"I reported him missing,\" says Malak. \"But I was hiding him.\"",
      "In May 2012, 19-year-old's Mohammed luck ran out. He was caught along with a group of friends. They were shot. Malak says there was no formal notification. But she has always assumed he was killed.",
      "Six months later, Mohammed's younger brother Maher was dragged from school by officers. It was Maher's second arrest. He'd gone to the protests in 2011, aged 14. That had led to his first arrest. When he was let out of detention, a month later, he was in his underwear, covered, says his mother, in cigarette burns, wounds and lice. \"He was terrified.\"",
      "Malak thinks Maher was disappeared from school in 2012 because the authorities had found that she had been hiding his older brother. Now, for the first time in 13 years, Malak returns to that school, desperate to get any clue about what happened to Maher.",
      "The new headteacher produces a couple of battered red ledgers. Malak traces the rows of names with her finger, and then finds her son's name. December 2012, the record flatly states: Maher has been excluded from school because he has failed to turn up for lessons for two weeks.",
      "There is no explanation that it is the state which has disappeared him. There is something else, though: a folder with Maher's school records has been found. Its cover is adorned with a photograph of a wise Bashar al-Assad, gazing thoughtfully into the distance. Malak picks up a pen from the headteacher's desk and scribbles over the photo. Six months ago, that gesture could have been lethal.",
      "For years, the only scraps Malak had to cling to were two men who say they saw Maher in \"Branch 215\" - that same military detention centre which produced so many corpses for Abu Ali to transport.",
      "One of the witnesses told Malak that her boy had told him something about his parents that, his mother says, only he could have known. It was definitely him. \"He asked this man to tell me he was doing fine.\" Malak heaves and leaks tears, stuffs a tattered tissue into the corners of her eyes.",
      "For Malak, like so many Syrians, the fall of Assad was not just a day of joy, but of hope. \"I thought there was a 90% chance Maher would walk out of prison. I was waiting for him.\"",
      "But she has not even been able to find her son's name on the prison lists. And so the throb of pain continues to course through her. \"I feel lost and confused,\" she says.",
      "Her own younger brother, Mahmoud, had been killed by a tank firing on civilians in 2013.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly8y1kglkpo",
    "published": "Thu, 08 May 2025 00:07:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Why ex-bank boss Tidjane Thiam has been barred from seeking the Ivorian presidency - and the potential fallout.",
    "story": [
      "Even a stellar international business career cannot prepare you for the hard realities of politics in Ivory Coast, where some are questioning the democratic credentials of the West African nation most famous for being the producer of much of the world's cocoa and some of its finest footballers.",
      "That is the painful lesson Tidjane Thiam is learning as he waits to see whether deal-making in the corridors of power and popular pressure from the street can rescue his bid to become president of Ivory Coast.",
      "Seemingly relentless progress towards the election set for this October came to a juddering halt on 22 April when a judge ruled that the 62-year-old had lost his Ivorian citizenship by taking French nationality decades previously and not revoking it until too late to qualify for this year's vote.",
      "Moving back to Ivory Coast in 2022 after more than two decades in global finance, Thiam had immediately been seen as a potential contender to succeed current head of state Alassane Ouattara who, at 83, is now in the final year of his third term of office.",
      "A scion of a traditional noble family and a great nephew of the country's revered founding President, F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny, he had impressed as a top government official and minister in the 1990s, overseeing infrastructure development and radical economic reforms.",
      "A military coup then pushed Thiam to seek a fresh career abroad, which culminated in high-profile stints as chief executive of UK insurance giant Prudential and then the banking group Credit Suisse.",
      "But returning home at last, three years ago, he embarked on a steady advance towards the next Ivorian presidential election.",
      "After the death in 2023 of former President Henri Konan B\u00e9di\u00e9, long-serving leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Ivory Coast (PDCI), Thiam was perfectly positioned to take his place and then on 17 April this year he was chosen as the party's candidate for the upcoming presidential race.",
      "That was no guarantee of victory, and especially if - as seems quite plausible Ouattara opts to run for a fourth term, backed by all the assets and advantages of incumbency and a track record of four successive years of annual economic growth above 6%.",
      "However, Thiam stood out as the prime alternative.",
      "As an opponent of the ruling Rally of Houphou\u00ebtists for Democracy and Peace (RHDP), he offered Ivorian voters the chance to change their government.",
      "Yet with his centrist politics and solid technocratic credentials, his candidacy offered reassuring competence and the prospect of continuing the impressive economic progress that Ouattara has piloted since 2011.",
      "Now that potential trajectory is blocked. If the court decision stands - and Ivorian law offers no option of appeal for this particular issue - Thiam will be out of October's contest.",
      "It is a race from which past court convictions have already excluded three other prominent opposition figures - former President Laurent Gbagbo, former Prime Minister Guillaume Soro and a former minister, Charles Bl\u00e9 Goud\u00e9 - all central actors in the political crises and civil conflicts that brutally paralysed the progress of Ivory Coast between 1999 and 2011.",
      "The prospect now is that Ouattara or any chosen RHDP successor candidate will approach the election without facing any heavyweight political challenge.",
      "That can only deepen Ivorians' already widespread popular disillusionment with the country's political establishment.",
      "This is against the wider context of a West Africa where the radical anti-politics rhetoric of the soldiers who have seized power in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger already finds a sympathetic audience among many disenchanted young people.",
      "That really matters in societies where, typically, three-quarters of the population is under 35.",
      "Amidst this crisis for West African democracy, there have been some moments of encouragement.",
      "In Liberia in 2023 and in Senegal and Ghana last year, incumbent governments were voted out, in free and fair elections whose results were accepted by all contestants without argument.",
      "The Senegalese result, in particular, owed much to the massive enthusiastic mobilisation of young people.",
      "Many hoped that Ivory Coast could offer a further positive example of democratic choice and the offer of change, and an example that might be all the more influential because the country is a prosperous regional powerhouse.",
      "It is the economic engine of the CFA franc single currency bloc and besides the cocoa industry, it is also a key hub for business services and finance and a leading political voice in the regional grouping, the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas).",
      "What happens in Ivory Coast really matters and is widely noticed, across West Africa and indeed, also right across francophone Africa more generally.",
      "Ouattara is one of the continent's most prominent statesmen, commanding broad respect internationally too.",
      "And yet now the run-up to the country's crucial next presidential election has become ensnared in a return version of the identity politics that so soured the bitter disputes and instability of the 1990s and 2000s.",
      "Back then, the governments of first B\u00e9di\u00e9 and then Gbagbo used the contentious \"ivoirit\u00e9\", meaning \"Ivorian-ness\" law to shut Ouattara out of standing for the presidency on the grounds that his family allegedly had foreign origins.",
      "It was only in 2007 that the government scrapped the ban on his candidacy and only in 2016 - when he was already in office - that a new constitution at last ended the requirement that the stated parents of presidential candidates be native-born Ivorians.",
      "The poisonous mobilisation of identity issues had been a major contributing factor to the civil wars, street violence and northern separatist partition that brutally scarred Ivory Coast for more than a decade, up to 2011, at a cost of thousands of lives.",
      "Today the country feels far from such large-scale conflict.",
      "There is no popular appetite for a return to confrontation and politicians are staying well away from the incendiary rhetoric of the past.",
      "But the Thiam saga shows how identity issues, even in a more legalistic form and in this hopefully more peaceful era, can still weigh heavily.",
      "Ivory Coast only permits dual nationality under certain limited conditions.",
      "So in its 22 April ruling, an Abidjan court declared that, under the terms of a little-used post-independence law, Thiam had automatically lost his Ivorian citizenship almost four decades ago when he acquired French nationality - after several years' study in Paris.",
      "Although he officially surrendered that this February, and thus automatically recovered his original citizenship, this was too late for inclusion on this year's register of eligible voters or candidates.",
      "In vain, his lawyers had argued that, through his father, Thiam had French nationality from birth - which, if accepted, would exempt him from the dual nationality ban.",
      "Seeking to highlight the absurdity and inconsistencies of the situation, he argued that, logically, the country should now hand back its prized 2024 Africa Cup of Nations football title because many of the players also have French nationality.",
      "\"If we apply the law the way [that] they just applied it to me, we have to give the cup back to Nigeria - because half of the team was not Ivorian,\" he told the BBC.",
      "And Thursday could bring yet another setback in a scheduled court hearing where a judge may now rule that Thiam cannot, as a non-national, lead the PDCI.",
      "The past two weeks have seen continuing political and legal debate over this whole saga, with the Thiam camp hoping that a combination of popular pressure and discreet political negotiation will lead to a compromise that lets him back into the presidential race, perhaps along with the other excluded contenders.",
      "And Ouattara, should he chose not to run, might want to safeguard his impressive track record and secure his international reputation by intervening with some kind of deal that allows Thiam to run.",
      "With months to go before the polls, there is still time for that. But no-one is counting on it.",

    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 22:45:28 GMT",
    "summary": "It was the opposition leader's home state that delivered Labor its win, with the red wave taking out his own seat.",
    "story": [
      "For the past three years, when peers of Australia's former Liberal Party leader Peter Dutton were grilled over his divisive persona, they'd often profess his celebrity status in the north.",
      "\"Peter is one of us\u2026 He's very popular in Queensland,\" said the leader of the Nationals, the Liberal's coalition partner, earlier this year.",
      "But on election night, it was Dutton's home state that delivered Labor its election win, with the red landslide ousting the veteran MP from his own seat of Dickson.",
      "While votes are still being counted, Labor could pick up as many electorates in Queensland as it did across every other state and territory combined.",
      "And that's thanks, in no small part, to a new bloc of young voters and women who are disillusioned with the Coalition, and attribute the party's emphatic loss to the \"Dutton effect\".",
      "As 65-year-old coalition voter Sue, who didn't share her last name, bluntly puts it: \"This is where [Dutton's] from\u2026 People know him and they don't like him.\"",
      "Losing the heartland",
      "The Moreton Bay region, about an hour north of Brisbane, is supposed to be Dutton heartland. Before Australia's federal election on 3 May, all three seats here were Liberal-held - though only by small leads, with Dutton's electorate of Dickson having the narrowest in the state.",
      "Dutton's family have deep roots here, with his dairy farming great-grandparents having settled in the area in the 1860s.",
      "When he first entered parliament 24 years ago, the region was made up of urban pockets and industrial estates surrounded by swathes of semi-rural land. Not quite metropolitan or rural, is how the former police officer described it in his maiden speech as MP.",
      "Now Brisbane is one of the fastest growing cities in Australia, and these outer northern suburbs are one of the main places it is squeezing people in. Residential development has exploded, and more  families, priced out of locations closer to the city, have moved in to Moreton Bay.",
      "Full of the \"quiet Australians\" Dutton said would deliver him the election, outer-suburban neighbourhoods like these were at the heart of the Coalition's strategy.",
      "The average household in Moreton Bay earns less than both the state and national average, with many of them relying on the health, trade and hospitality sectors for work. The Coalition hoped promises to cut fuel expenses, improve housing affordability and back small businesses would woo voters concerned about the cost of living.",
      "Many Moreton Bay residents, like campaign volunteer Kenneth King, also felt Dutton's links to the area would give them a boost.",
      "\"I've known Peter Dutton for a lot of years,\" the Dickson local told the BBC on polling day. \"He's always been someone of high character, serious about effective policies and a lot of empathy for ordinary Australians.\"",
      "\"He's very well respected in the community\u2026 People know him.\"",
      "But there's a difference between being well known and well liked, says Aleysha, a swing voter in the neighbouring electorate of Petrie, who declined to give her surname.",
      "\"I don't know whether he appeals to the everyday person,\" the 26-year-old nurse says. \"He doesn't put himself in the people's shoes.\"",
      "Her vote over the years has gone to a range of parties from right across the political spectrum \u2013 except the Greens, she adds with a quick laugh.",
      "\"I don't sit with any party. Being a Christian, it's whatever party aligns closest to my values,\" she says, adding that the future of her two young children is the other major consideration.",
      "This election, that meant her vote went to Coalition incumbent Luke Howarth, who she knows personally from her church.",
      "But while she's praying for a miracle, with the final votes still being counted, she's not surprised to find Howarth may be on his way out.",
      "She says Labor ran very visible campaigns in the area, but tells the BBC that it was driving past the image of Howarth and his leader on billboards which stuck in her mind.",
      "\"Unfortunately I think that's what did it,\" she says.",
      "\"Peter Dutton's face behind him was a huge turnoff - for me personally too.\"",
      "Sue, who lives in the same electorate and is generally a conservative voter, says this election she was torn at the ballot box.",
      "\"I had a huge hesitation over it,\" she says. \"I don't like Albanese; I think he's like, weak.",
      "\"[But] Dutton's an unattractive personality... He thinks he's presenting himself as strong, but he presents himself as a bit of a bully.\"",

      "Won by Coalition MP Terry Young on a margin of 3% last election, it is now too close to call.",
      "Mr Cutler, a former Labor party staffer, believes Labor ran very strong local campaigns. But he also thinks Dutton's policy flip-flopping and the aura of instability that projected was potent.",

      "For her, the last straw was his instrumental role in the defeat of the Voice to Parliament referendum, which sought to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution and simultaneously establish a parliamentary advisory body for them.",
      "\"I think he has caused a lot of harm to a lot of minority groups across the scale,\" she says.",
      "For others in the electorate though, the last straw was watching Dutton fly to a fundraiser in Sydney as the area in and around Dickson was hit by Cyclone Alfred in February.",
      "April didn't feel like Labor Party's offering was strong either, especially on climate action, so she decided to campaign for Ellie Smith, the so-called 'teal' independent running in the seat.",
      "Disappointment - borderline embarrassment - that Dutton was from her local area had crystallised into determination: \"I felt like it was a duty in a way\u2026 our responsibility to get him out.\"",
      "Ultimately, the Coalition lost at least six seats to Labor in Queensland \u2013 all bar one in Brisbane. And while they are a few votes ahead in Longman as the count continues, they could still lose that too.",
      "Wildcard Queensland",
      "Queensland has long been a bit of a political wildcard, and often finds itself in the \"spotlight\" at federal elections, says Frank Mols.",
      "The University of Queensland politics lecturer points out the state helped deliver Kevin Rudd's historic election win in 2007 and Scott Morrison's \"miracle\" victory in 2019. Last election, as a record number of people across the nation voted for candidates outside the two major parties, Queensland surprised the nation by giving the Greens three seats - up from none.",
      "There are a couple of factors that make the state more \"volatile\" and likely to deliver upsets, Dr Mols says.",
      "Firstly, it is the only state or territory, except for the island of Tasmania, where more than half of the population live outside the capital city of Brisbane.",
      "\"We talk about Queensland always being two elections, one in the south-east corner, and then the rest - and they often get very different patterns.\"",
      "There's also more political fragmentation in the state, Dr Mols says, which combined with Australia's preferential voting system can make political equations here tighter, and trends harder to predict.",
      "But he \u2013 like many of the voters the BBC spoke to \u2013 largely puts last weekend's surprise for the Coalition down to Dutton and his broadly-criticised campaign performance.",
      "While there's a tendency to attribute success or failure to policy issues, more often its really about voters' emotional response to candidates and leaders, Dr Mols says.",
      "\"If you do the barbecue test, is Dutton a person you would walk up to? Is he somebody you would warm to or gravitate towards?",
      "\"You can wonder: was Peter Dutton, in hindsight, the Labor Party's best asset?\"",
      "But Dutton may have had the opposite effect for the Greens Party, which has lost at least two of the three seats it gained in Brisbane in 2022. Their party leader, Adam Bandt, also appears to have been defeated in Melbourne, an electorate he'd held for 15 years.",
      "\"Perhaps in desperation, [Dutton] was gravitating towards culture war issues, sort of echoing Trumpian themes, if you like, and that has been punished,\" Dr Mols says. \"But also the Greens\u2026 who were perhaps seen as being at the other end of that shouting match, have not done well.\"",
      "Dr Mols also believes that desperation to keep Dutton out may have seen some former Greens voters prioritise Labor this time - though he points out more centrist Teal independents appear to have bucked that trend.",
      "In any case, he doesn't see the result in Queensland as a groundswell of love for Labor. The state was still the only jurisdiction in Australia where there were more first preference votes for the Coalition than Labor.",
      "\"There has to be enough of a swing towards a party, but it's often that preferencing that actually tilts it over the line,\" he says.",
      "\"This is more of a Liberal loss.\"",
      "For many Coalition voters, that loss is deeply felt. Rick describes it as a \"real rout\".",
      "But among others, like Aleysha, there is an inexplicable element of mirth.",
      "\"I think it's quite funny, that he slipped as much as he did,\" she says. \"And I can't tell you why.\"",

    "summary": "Pope Francis's efforts to shake up the workings of the Church should be built on by the next pope, according to some - but his critics are less convinced",
    "story": [
      "The Vatican's Santa Marta guesthouse has 128 rooms. From 7 May, it will be filled with cardinals participating in the conclave to elect the next Pope. But one room in the guesthouse is still sealed with a red ribbon, as it has been since its occupant died there on Easter Monday.",
      "That suite will only be reopened when the new pope is chosen. The ribbon remains a tangible reminder of the man whose shoes the cardinals are looking to fill \u2013 but Pope Francis' presence looms large over this conclave in many profound ways.",
      "He spent 12 years in the role and appointed around 80% of the cardinals who will select his successor. He also looked to radically shake up the workings of the Catholic Church, moving its centre of gravity away from its hierarchy at the Vatican in the direction of the rank-and-file faithful all over the world, and focused on the poor and marginalised.",
      "My conversations with cardinals and those assessing the needs of the Church in the days leading to this papal election almost always end up looking at what is required through the prism of what Pope Francis did in the role.",
      "While in recent days there appears to have been a growing coalescence around the idea that Francis' work should be built on, some of his critics remain far from convinced. So might there be enough of them to sway the vote as the Church attempts to reconcile the different outlooks and realities it faces around the globe?",
      "A most diverse conclave",
      "During the two weeks that followed the Pope's death, the cardinals met almost daily at the Vatican for pre-conclave gatherings known as general congregations.",
      "While the conclave in the Sistine Chapel is limited to cardinals who haven't yet reached the age of 80 (133 will participate in this one), these preliminary meetings are open to all 252 cardinals. Each attendee was given up to five minutes to air their views, though we know that some took longer.",
      "It was during such a meeting ahead of the last conclave of 2013, in a speech lasting less than four minutes, that Pope Francis - then known as Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina - made an impact, talking of a need to connect with those in the far reaches of the Catholic world.",
      "As Pope, he made a conscious drive to appoint cardinals from such places. It is why this is the most diverse conclave there has ever been. For the first time Cape Verde, Haiti, South Sudan, Tonga, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea and Rwanda will be represented.",
      "That diversity has already made its mark: the pre-conclave meetings are said to have brought to the fore just how different the needs of the Church appear to be depending on where in the world they are viewed.",
      "In Europe, for example, a primary consideration for some might be finding ways to reinvigorate and make relevant the mission of the Church in the face of shrinking congregations, whereas elsewhere - in African or Asian countries - concerns may revolve around social issues, poverty and conflict resolution.",
      "A prospective pope is likely to be one who has at least shown recognition of those very different realities.",
      "Spiritual leader, statesman, global influencer",
      "The official titles that the new pope will inherit gives a sense of the breadth of the role: Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Sovereign of the State of Vatican City among them.",
      "While some relate to the deeply spiritual, the last of those titles suggests the need for a statesman too, given that the pope is leader of a country, albeit the world's smallest.",
      "\"Unlike your average state, the agenda of the Vatican is driven to an extent by where the pope reigning at the time puts their emphasis,\" says Chris Trott, British ambassador to the Holy See. \"On the face of it a very tiny state, [but it is] one that punches many, many times above its weight.",
      "\"And Pope Francis had 50 million followers on Twitter, so [it is] a very, very small state and an incredible global influencer.\"",
      "Pope Francis chose to amplify this part of the role, becoming a powerful global spokesman on behalf of those on the margins, including the poor and victims of war.",
      "He also tried to play the role of peacemaker, though not everyone thought he was successful in that regard, in relation to China and Russia in particular.",
      "According to Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the most senior Catholic figure in England and Wales, this expansion of the role is one reason so many even outside the faith are invested in the outcome of the conclave.",
      "\"There is a sense that the Pope in the person of Pope Francis became a figure who addressed everybody in the world\u2026 religious people and even those who do not have a religious affiliation,\" he says.",
      "\"I'm more and more aware that it's not just Catholics who are interested in this.\"",
      "Confusion around Pope Francis' vision",
      "For many voting cardinals, it is primarily issues within the Catholic Church that are under the spotlight, which brings about the question of the type of pope they want as a manager, and someone who runs the Church's administrative body and its ministries.",
      "While Pope Francis worked on improving the way the Church deals with the huge issues of sexual abuse and of financial corruption, it is his successor who will have to ensure that reforms are evenly applied across the Catholic world.",
      "Even supporters of Pope Francis' efforts to make changes to the way the Church relates to its rank-and-file believers, and the way he built bridges with those outside the faith, were sometimes left confused about how exactly he envisioned things should work.",
      "Pope Francis changed the tone on social issues through comments he made, talking openly about subjects ranging from climate change to financial transparency within the Vatican. But throughout his papacy, some were unclear about what he meant or how it would be applied.",
      "One mission he had was to take some of the power and decision-making away from the Vatican hierarchy and into the hands of rank-and-file Catholics.",
      "Over nearly four years, at great effort, he commissioned what was, in effect, a poll of many of the world's Catholics to find out what mattered to them. Lay people were invited to participate in the most recent bishop's conference where the results of the survey were discussed.",
      "The biggest issues raised related to greater roles for women in the running of the church and welcoming LGBT+ Catholics. But the meeting ended in some confusion, with little in the form of tangible steps forward and little clarity as to how lay people will help steer the future direction of the Church.",
      "So, there is a general keenness for greater clarity from the new pope.",
      "An ugly divide: supporters and detractors",
      "Throughout his pontificate, some vocal traditionalists opposed what they saw as Pope Francis straying from Church teaching and long-standing tradition.",
      "In the pre-conclave meetings of cardinals, a number of those over the age of 80 (who because of their age would not be involved in voting) took the opportunity to play their part.",
      "Most contributions remained secret, but one that was reported was that of 83-year-old Italian cardinal, Beniamino Stella. He criticised Pope Francis for \"imposing his own ideas\" by attempting to move Church governance away from the clergy.",
      "And yet during the homily, or religious speech, at Pope Francis' funeral, what appeared to resonate with the public in attendance \u2013 judging by the volume of the applause \u2013 was talk of the themes Francis chose to champion: the dignity of migrants, an end to war, and the environment.",
      "This applause would have been heard loud and clear by the rows of cardinals.",
      "In some senses, Pope Francis did have clarity in focusing on the Church being relevant to people in their daily lives and, indeed, their struggles. He was clear about connecting with the world outside the faith too.",
      "\"There is a sense that in the voice of the pope, there's a voice of something that is needed,\" says Cardinal Nichols. \"For some people it's a moral compass, for some people it's the sense of being accepted, for some people it's the insistence that we must look at things from the point of view of the poorest.",
      "\"That's a voice that has fallen silent and our task is to find someone who can carry that forward.\"",
      "From the death of Pope Francis to the moment cardinals checked into the Santa Marta guesthouse and its overflow residences, there appeared to be a trend towards a desire for continuity of what Pope Francis had achieved.",
      "Though perhaps that vision of continuity is one that could bring along more of his sceptics, in a way that was pragmatic. The word \"unity\" has been talked of a lot, after a period where the divides between supporters and detractors of the Pope's vision could sometimes become ugly.",
      "But in the end, when they step into the Sistine Chapel, the holiest of voting chambers, for all the pragmatism they may have taken into consideration before they cast their ballot, they will be urged to let God and the Holy Spirit guide them.",

    "story": [
      "In an exclusive and remarkably candid interview - the first since he left office - Joe Biden discusses what he really thinks of his successor's first 100 days, plus his fears for the future if the Atlantic Alliance collapses",
      "It is hard to believe that the man I greet in the Delaware hotel where he launched his political career more than half a century ago was the \"leader of the free world\" little over 100 days ago.",
      "Joe Biden is still surrounded by all the trappings of power \u2013 the black SUVs, the security guys with curly earpieces, the sniffer dogs sent ahead to sweep the room for explosives. And yet he has spent the last three months watching much of what he believes in being swept away by his successor.",
      "Donald Trump has deployed the name Biden again and again - it is his political weapon of choice. One recent analysis showed that Trump said or wrote the name Biden at least 580 times in those first 100 days in office. Having claimed that rises in share prices were \"Trump's stock market\" at work, he later blamed sharp falls in share prices on \"Biden's stock market\".",
      "Until this week, President Biden himself (former presidents keep their titles after they leave office) has largely observed the convention that former presidents do not criticise their successors at the start of their time in office. But from the moment we shake hands it is clear that he is determined to have his say too.",
      "In a dark blue suit, the former president arrives smiling and relaxed but with the determined air of a man on a mission. It's his first interview since leaving the White House, and he seems most angry about Donald Trump's treatment of America's allies - in particular Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky.",

      "Five key takeaways from the interview",
      "Political Thinking with Nick Robinson: Listen to the full interview on BBC Sounds, or watch on BBC iPlayer or on YouTube",
      "\"I found it beneath America, the way that took place,\" he says of the explosive Oval Office row between Trump and Zelensky in February. \"And the way we talk about now that, 'it's the Gulf of America', 'maybe we're going to have to take back Panama', 'maybe we need to acquire Greenland, 'maybe Canada should be a [51st state].' What the hell's going on here?",
      "\"What President ever talks like that? That's not who we are. We're about freedom, democracy, opportunity - not about confiscation.\"",
      "After just over 100 action-packed days of Trump there was no shortage of targets for President Biden to choose from.",
      "But his main concern appears to be on the international stage, rather than the domestic one: that is, the threat he believes now faces the alliance between the United States and Europe which, as he puts it, secured peace, freedom and democracy for eight decades.",
      "\"Grave concerns\" about the Atlantic Alliance",
      "Just before our interview, which took place days before the 80th anniversary of VE Day, Biden took a large gold coin out of his pocket and pressed it into my hand. It was a souvenir of last year's D-Day commemoration. Biden believes that the speech he delivered on that beach in Normandy is one of his most important. In it, he declared that the men who fought and died \"knew \u2013 beyond any doubt \u2013 that there are things worth fighting and dying for\".",
      "I ask him whether he feels that message about sacrifice is in danger of being forgotten in America. Not by the people, he replies but, yes, by the leadership. It is, he says, a \"grave concern\" that the Atlantic Alliance is seen to be dying.",
      "\"I think it would change the modern history of the world if that occurs,\" he argues.",
      "\"We're the only nation in a position to have the capacity to bring people together, [to] lead the world. Otherwise you're going to have China and the former Soviet Union, Russia, stepping up.\"",
      "Now more than ever before that Alliance is being questioned. One leading former NATO figure told the BBC this week that the VE Day celebrations felt more like a funeral. President Trump has complained that the United States is being \"ripped off\" by her allies, Vice President JD Vance has said that  America is \"bailing out\" Europe whilst Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has insisted that Europe is \"free-loading\".",
      "Biden calls the pledge all members of Nato - the Atlantic Alliance - make \"to defend each and every inch of Nato territory with the full force of our collective power\" a \"sacred obligation\".",
      "\"I fear that our allies around the world are going to begin to doubt whether we're going to stay where we've always been for the last 80 years,\" Biden says.",
      "Under his presidency, both Finland and Sweden joined Nato - something he thinks made the alliance stronger.  \"We did all that - and in four years we've got a guy who wants to walk away from it all.",
      "\"I'm worried that Europe is going to lose confidence in the certainty of America, and the leadership of America in the world, to deal with not only Nato, but other matters that are of consequence.\"",
      "Biden, the \"addled old man\"?",
      "I meet President Biden in the place he has called home since he was a boy, the city of Wilmington in Delaware. It is an hour and a half Amtrak train ride from Washington DC, a journey he has been making for 50 years since becoming a Senator at the age of just 30. He has spent more years in government than any other president.",
      "He was 82 when he left the Oval Office. His age has invited no end of scrutiny - an \"at times addled old man\" is how the journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson describe him in their book, Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.",
      "His calamitous live TV debate performance last June prompted further questions, as Biden stumbled over his words, lost his thread mid-sentence and boasted, somewhat bafflingly, that \"We finally beat Medicare!\". He withdrew from the election campaign soon after.",
      "Today, Biden is still warm and charismatic, with the folksy charm that made him an election winner but he is a much slower, quieter and more hesitant version of the leader he was once. Meeting with him in person, I found it hard to imagine he could have served for another four years in the White House, taking him closer to the age of 90.",
      "I ask Biden if he's now had to think again about his decisions last year. He pulled out of the presidential race just 107 days before election day, leaving Kamala Harris limited time to put together her own campaign.",
      "\"I don't think it would have mattered,\" he says. \"We left at a time when we had a good candidate, she was fully funded.",
      "\"What we had set out to do, no-one thought we could do,\" he continues. \"And we had become so successful in our agenda, it was hard to say, 'No, I'm going to stop now'... It was a hard decision.\"",
      "One he regrets? Surely withdrawing earlier could have given someone else a greater chance?",
      "\"No, I think it was the right decision.\" He pauses. \"I think that\u2026 Well, it was just a difficult decision.\"",
      "Trump is \"not behaving like a Republican president\"",
      "Biden says he went into politics to fight injustice and to this day has lost none of his appetite for the fight. Last year at the D-Day celebrations he warned: \"We're living in a time when democracy is more at risk across the world than at any point since the end of World War Two.\"",
      "Today, he expands on this: \"Look at the number of European leaders and European countries that are wondering, Well what do I do now? What's the best route for me to take? Can I rely on the United States? Are they going to be there?\"",
      "\"Instead of democracy expanding around the world, [it's] receding. Democracy - every generation has to fight for it.\"",
      "Speaking in Chicago recently, Biden declared that \"nobody's king\" in America. I asked him if he thinks President Trump is behaving more like a monarch than a constitutionally limited president.",
      "He chooses his reply carefully. \"He's not behaving like a Republican president,\" he says.",
      "Though later in our interview, Biden admits he's less worried about the future of US democracy than he used to be, \"because I think the Republican Party is waking up to what Trump is about\".",
      "\"Anybody who thinks Putin's going to stop is foolish\"",
      "President Biden relished his role as the leading figure in Nato, deploying normally top secret intelligence to tell a sceptical world back in 2022 that Vladimir Putin was about to launch a full scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Since taking office President Trump has charted a different course, telling Ukraine that it must consider giving up territory to Russia if it wants the war to end.",
      "\"It is modern day appeasement,\" Biden says of Trump's approach.",
      "Putin, he says, sees Ukraine as \"part of Mother Russia. He believes he has historical rights to Ukraine... He can't stand the fact that [\u2026] the Soviet Union has collapsed. And anybody who thinks he's going to stop is just foolish.\"",
      "He fears that Trump's approach might signal to other European countries that it's time to give in to Russia.",
      "Yet Biden has faced accusations against him concerning the Ukraine War. Some in Kyiv and her allies, as well as some in the UK, claim that he gave President Zelensky just enough support to resist invasion but not enough to defeat Russia, perhaps out of fear that Putin would consider using nuclear weapons if cornered.",
      "When Putin was asked point blank on TV this week whether he would use nuclear weapons to win the war, he declared that he hoped that they would \"not be necessary,\" adding that he had the means to bring the war to what he called his \"logical conclusion\".",
      "I point out to Biden that it has been argued that he didn't have the courage to go all the way to give Ukraine the weapons it needed - to let Ukraine win.",
      "\"We gave them [Ukraine] everything they needed to provide for their independence,\" Biden argues. \"And we were prepared to respond more aggressively if in fact Putin moved again.\"",
      "He says he was keen to avoid the prospect of \"World War Three, with nuclear powers,\" adding: \"And we did avoid it.",
      "\"What would Putin do if things got really tough for him?\" he continues. \"Threaten the use of tactical nuclear weapons. This is not a game or roulette.\"",
      "Americans used to be steadfast in their support for Israel. Those days are gone",
      "Sir John Curtice: The map that shows Reform's triumph was much more than a protest vote",
      "What Trump really wants from Canada",
      "Biden's belief in the Atlantic Alliance - as the last living President born during World War Two - is clearly undiminished.",
      "When he first arrived in the Oval Office, Biden hung a portrait of America's wartime leader Franklin D. Roosevelt on the wall. He was born two and a half years before the defeat of the Nazis, into the world FDR helped to create - a world of American global leadership and solidarity. But the United States voted to reject Biden's policies and values and instead to endorse Donald Trump's call to put America First.",
      "The world is changing from what people like Joe Biden have taken for granted.",
      "\"Every generation has to fight to maintain democracy, every one,\" Biden says. \"Every one's going to be challenged.",
      "\"We've done it well for the last 80 years. And I'm worried there's the loss of understanding of the consequences of that.\"",

      "Why India and Pakistan fight over Kashmir",
      "BBC reports from Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administered Kashmir",
      "Pakistan's military said at least 31 people were killed and 57 injured in the strikes on Tuesday night. India's army said at least 15 civilians were killed and 43 injured by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.",
      "Pakistan's military says it shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone. India has yet to respond to these claims.",
      "Late on Wednesday, Sharif said the air force made its defence - which was a \"reply from our side to them\".",
      "Where did India hit?",
      "Delhi said in the early hours of Wednesday morning that nine different locations had been targeted in both Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan.",
      "It said these sites were \"terrorist infrastructure\" - places where attacks were \"planned and directed\".",
      "It emphasised that it had not hit any Pakistani military facilities, saying its \"actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature\".",
      "In the initial aftermath of the attacks, Pakistan said three different areas were hit: Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and Bahawalpur in the Pakistani province of Punjab. Pakistan's military spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif, later said six locations had been hit.",
      "Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told GeoTV in the early hours of Wednesday that the strikes hit civilian areas, adding that India's claim of \"targeting terrorist camps\" was false.",
      "Why did India launch the attack?",
      "The strikes come after weeks of rising tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours over the shootings in the picturesque resort town of Pahalgam.",
      "The 22 April attack by a group of militants saw 26 people killed, with survivors saying the militants were singling out Hindu men.",
      "It was the worst attack on civilians in the region in two decades, and the first major attack on civilians since India revoked Article 370, which gave Kashmir semi-autonomous status, in 2019.",
      "Following the decision, the region saw protests but also witnessed militancy wane and a huge increase in the number of tourists.",
      "The killings have sparked widespread anger in India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the country would hunt the suspects \"till the ends of the Earth\" and that those who planned and carried it out \"will be punished beyond their imagination\".",
      "However, India initially did not name any group it believed was behind the attack in Pahalgam.",
      "But Indian police alleged that two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, with Delhi accusing Pakistan of supporting militants - a charge Islamabad denies. It says it has nothing to do with the 22 April attacks.",
      "On 7 May, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group carried out the attack.",
      "In the two weeks since, both sides had taken tit-for-tat measures against each other - including expelling diplomats, suspending visas and closing border crossings.",
      "But many expected it would escalate to some sort of cross-border strike - as seen after the Pulwama attacks which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead in 2019.",
      "Why is Kashmir a flashpoint between India and Pakistan?",
      "Kashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947.",
      "The countries have fought two wars over it.",
      "But more recently, it has been attacks by militants which have brought the two countries to the brink. Indian-administered Kashmir has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, with militants targeting security forces and civilians alike.",
      "In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control \u2013 the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.",
      "In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.",
      "Neither spiralled, but the wider world remains alert to the danger of what could happen if it did. Attempts have been made by various nations and diplomats around the world to prevent this.",
      "UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres quickly called for \"maximum restraint\" - a sentiment echoed by the European Union and numerous countries, including Bangladesh.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged \"dialogue\" and \"de-escalation\".",
      "US President Donald Trump - who was one of the first to respond - told reporters at the White House that he hoped the fighting \"ends very quickly\". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, said he was keeping a close eye on developments."

    "story": [
      "Eighty miles from Moscow, a park echoes to the sound of explosions and gunfire.",
      "As plumes of thick grey smoke rise into the air, the Red Army storms across a bridge and battles for control of a tiny island. More Soviet soldiers are arriving by boat from across a lake.",
      "Once on the island they tear down a swastika and replace it with the hammer and sickle of the Soviet Union. Victory.",
      "A large crowd is watching from the safety of the shore. What they're witnessing is an historical re-enactment of one of the final battles for Berlin in 1945. It led to the capitulation of Nazi Germany and what Moscow still refers to as The Great Victory.",
      "The battle for Berlin, unfolding in front of me in the town of Dubna, is one of many events in Russia for the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory in World War Two.",
      "The anniversary is receiving enormous attention in a country where the national idea is built very much around the notion of Russia as victor and victim.",
      "\"I'm here because my grandfather fought in this war,\" one of the spectators, Katya, tells me.",
      "\"He went missing near Berlin. Much later we found out he'd been killed in January 1945.\"",
      "Eighty years on Katya's son is fighting in Ukraine.",
      "\"My son is in a war now. He's in the 'special military operation',\" she tells me.  \"He volunteered. I tried to talk him out of it. But he hasn't listened to anyone since he was a kid.",
      "'I'm my own tsar,' he told me. 'Go fight, then, if you're a tsar,' I replied. He and his friend went together. His friend was killed.\"",
      "Katya's family history is a story of different generations fighting on the front line.",
      "But in very different circumstances.",
      "In 1941, Hitler's Germany invaded the Soviet Union to try to conquer the world's largest country and secure world domination. Soviet soldiers (Katya's grandfather among them) fought to liberate their country from the Nazis. Victory for Moscow came at an enormous human cost: more than 27 million Soviet citizens were killed in what is known here as the Great Fatherland or Great Patriotic War.",
      "But in 2022 it was Russia that launched a large-scale invasion - of its neighbour. What the Kremlin still calls a \"special military operation\" was widely seen as an attempt to force Ukraine back into Russia's geo-political orbit. In March 2022, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution condemning Russia's \"aggression.\"",
      "And yet the Russian authorities portray the war in Ukraine as a continuation of World War Two. The official narrative here creates a parallel reality, in which Russia once again is fighting Nazism and fascism, in Ukraine and across Europe. Russia, the country which invaded Ukraine, presents itself as the victim of external aggression.",
      "\"Historically and sociologically, victory in the Great Patriotic War was always a cornerstone of Russian united consciousness,\" Novaya Gazeta columnist Andrei Kolesnikov explains, \"because there is no glue for the nation: only this event. It was always so, from Brezhnev's time until now.",
      "\"But what's happening now is something special. Now the Great Patriotic War is presented as just the first step in our permanent war with the West, against 'Eurofascism.' The Special Military Operation as the continuation of the Great Patriotic War: this is something new.\"",
      "In Russia, television plays a key role in spreading the official message that Europe couldn't be trusted then and cannot be trusted now. Recently, on Russian TV, I saw a documentary entitled \"Europe Against Russia. Hitler's Crusaders\". It was about how European countries had collaborated with the Nazis during World War Two.",
      "No mention of the 1939 non-aggression pact between Hitler and Stalin: under its secret protocol Germany and the USSR had carved up spheres of influence in eastern Europe.",
      "Last month a Russian TV presenter launched a tirade against German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, a staunch supporter of military support to Ukraine. The talk show host called Germany's leader \"a Nazi scumbag\" for comments about Russia. Addressing the Chancellor directly, the anchor said that Russians \"hold you and your comrades responsible for the killing of 27 million Soviet citizens.\"",
      "Iconography underpins the ideology. In the town of Khimki, near Moscow, a recently unveiled monument depicts a Red Army soldier side by side with a Russian who is fighting in Ukraine. Framed photos of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine have been placed below the two fighter figures.",
      "An inscription reads: \"By preserving the past we defend the future!\"",
      "Wars past and present: brought together in bronze.",
      "In the run up to Victory Day, Russia has been awash with reminders of The Great Victory. Last month a Soyuz rocket decorated to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome.",
      "Back down on earth, at a maternity hospital in the Siberian city of Kemerovo, newborn babies are being dressed in miniature Red Army caps and capes.",
      "On its Telegram channel, the hospital explained that battle clothes for babies served \"as a reminder of links between the generations, the courage of the defenders of the Fatherland and of how even the tiniest Russian citizen is part of a big history.\"",
      "In Moscow, the Russian word for 'Victory' - 'Pobeda' \u2013 is everywhere: on giant billboards, on posters in shop windows, even stuck to the side of road-sweepers. Underground, special \"victory trains\" on the Moscow Metro have been decked out with World War Two imagery and the words: \"Be proud!\" and \"Remember!\"",
      "Tanks have been rolling down Moscow's main street, Tverskaya, at rehearsals for the big 9 May parade on Red Square. In Soviet times, after 1945, military parades on Victory Day were rare. Under Vladimir Putin they have become a key element of what is now Russia's most sacred national holiday - a day not only for remembering the victims of World War Two, but for showcasing Russian military power and to unite the people around the idea of Russia as an unbeatable nation.",
      "The USSR was, indeed, victorious in the Great Patriotic War. But eighty years on, and despite confident pronouncements by Russian officials, victory eludes Moscow in Ukraine. The Kremlin's \"special military operation\" was only expected to last a few days, a few weeks maximum. After more than three years of war \u2013 and huge casualties on both sides - it's still unclear how and when the fighting will end.",
      "The Kremlin says 29 world leaders, including China's Xi Jinping, will be attending the Victory Day parade. According to Moscow, Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic and Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will be visiting Russia for the commemorations. Ensuring security for the military parade and guests on Red Square will already have been a top priority for the Kremlin. Even more so after two consecutive nights of Ukrainian drone attacks targeting Moscow.",
      "Back in Dubna, German resistance has crumbled and the Red Army is in full control. The re-enactment is over.",
      "Some of the spectators here believe the official portrayal of Russia as a besieged fortress threatened by the West.",
      "\"Both Britain and America have betrayed us and threaten us,\" Lidiya tells me. \"But we are resilient. You cannot defeat Russia.\"",
      "When I talk to 98-year-old Fyodor Melnikov, he doesn't get into politics. The military show has sparked painful memories for him. Fyodor's brother was killed in the Great Patriotic War.",
      "\"War is a terrifying thing,\" Fyodor tells me. \"People should be allowed to live freely. Let them work, let them live their lives, let them die naturally.\"",
      "Fyodor has written a poem about his late brother, about war. He recites it for me. In translation it sounds like this:",
      "\"A uniform I never wore,",
      "A battle I never saw.",
      "But in my mind's eye I see",
      "My brother going off to war.",
      "The only thing he said to me",
      "Before he went was this:",
      "'Live, little brother, be well.'",
      "I will bring victory home.\"",
      "On Friday, along with the whole of Russia, Fyodor Melnikov will be celebrating the 80th anniversary of The Great Victory of 1945.",
      "But it will be a day for remembering, too: friends and family who never returned.",
      "A day for acknowledging the cost of war.",

      "Pitt, 44, whose lawyers denied the allegations, was arrested Friday on nine counts, including first-degree sexual abuse, criminal sexual acts, assault, attempted assault and strangulation. The indictment cites four incidents between April 2020 and August 2021 at Pitt's home in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.",
      "Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez's office declined to comment Wednesday beyond the allegations listed in the indictment.",
      "Pitt's lawyer, Jason Goldman, said he already had exonerating evidence and expected the case to be dismissed.",
      "\"Unfortunately, we live in a world where somebody like Mr. Pitt \u2014 an accomplished professional who would never so much as contemplate these crimes \u2014 can be arrested on the uncorroborated word of an unreliable individual,\" Goldman said in a text message to The Associated Press.",
      "He added, \"In reality, this baseless claim is suspiciously raised some four or five years after the alleged incident, from a time when the two parties were in a completely consensual relationship.\"",
      "Pitt pleaded not guilty to the charges on Friday and posted $100,000 bail, Goldman said. He is due back in court in Brooklyn on June 17.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, which the woman in Pitt's case has not done.",
      "The indictment alleges Pitt forcibly touched his ex-girlfriend sexually in April 2020. In August 2020, the grand jury alleges Pitt forced oral sex on the woman and assaulted her with a 4-inch-by-4-inch piece of lumber.",
      "The indictment also says Pitt attacked her with a cinder block twice in June 2021 and choked her in August 2021.",

    "summary": "Jury selection has started in music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex-trafficking trial. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, the music mogul accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and otherwise exploiting women in recurring incidents over multiple decades, is standing trial in New York City this month. Jury selection began Monday, and opening statements are scheduled to follow on May 12.",
      "Combs, 55, faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has been jailed since September, when he was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and at his final pre-trial hearing, rejected a plea deal.",
      "As the trial gets underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know.",
      "Combs will be tried on 5 charges",
      "One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment.",
      "Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts \u2014 one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution \u2014 against him in early April.",
      "The indictment alleges Combs \"engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\" which was \"verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.\" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and the sex workers to be flown to him.",
      "The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \"Freak Offs,\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and sometimes lasted multiple days.",
      "Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment.",
      "In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct.",
      "According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors.",
      "If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him.",
      "His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "\"This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,\" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment.",
      "2016 hotel security video",
      "A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial.",
      "The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage.",
      "Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit.",
      "Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \"Freak Off.\" Combs lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\" between the two.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said.",
      "Jury selection",
      "Twelve jurors and six alternates will be chosen for the trial.",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions.",
      "They were also given a lengthy list of people and places and asked if they recognized any of the names, which included rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye; rapper Kid Cudi; actor Michael B. Jordan; actor Mike Myers; singer Aubrey O'Day; and Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of his accusers.",
      "It was not immediately clear how all the people on the list will be referenced, if at all, during the trial.",
      "Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors.",
      "In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not \"explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury\" nor acknowledge \"the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs.\"",
      "They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners.",
      "Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were \"utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\"",

      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris made an appearance at the 2025 Met Gala on Monday, days after her anticipated return to the public stage, where she delivered her first major speech since\u00a0losing the 2024 presidential election.",
      "It was Harris' first time at the benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. In an interview with Vogue published ahead of the blue carpet event, Harris emphasized the importance of art and how it intertwines with politics.",
      "\"Art has always had a significant impact on not just culture, but also our policies and politics,\" Harris told Vogue. \"Artistic expression \u2014 whether it's dance, music, visual arts or fashion \u2014 has a way of capturing the mood and language of the people without words. Art has the power to shape the conversation about where we are today and where we need to go.\"",
      "To embrace the 2025 Met Gala theme, inspired by the Met's exhibit \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,\" the former vice president wore a black-and-white Off-White gown designed by the brand's creative director IB Kamara, according to Vogue. Harris attended with her husband, Doug Emhoff, Vogue said.",
      "While politicians are no strangers to the Met Gala, many of them have been local New York City lawmakers in recent years, including Mayor Eric Adams and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In 2022, Hillary Clinton returned to fashion's biggest night 21 years after her debut. And in 1977, Ronald Reagan attended the Met Gala between his terms as governor of California and president of the United States.",
      "Harris may be eyeing a political return of her own.",
      "Speaking in San Francisco last week, in her first major public remarks since her 2024 presidential defeat, Harris blasted President Trump's economic agenda, including his tariffs. She also suggested she's been having conversations about her future, as California prepares to elect its next governor in 2026 and Democrats search for a presidential candidate to run in 2028.",
      "\"Everybody is asking me, 'Well, what've you been thinking about these days,'\" she said.",
      "Sources familiar with Harris' thinking told CBS News she's weighing a gubernatorial bid in her home state, a third run for the presidency or not seeking elected office.",

      "2017 Met Gala theme: \"Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: Art of the In-Between\"",
      "The 2017 event paid tribute to Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo and her Comme des Gar\u00e7ons avant-garde designs that play with the body's shape and form. Duality, a motif for the exhibit, highlighted almost four decades of her work. Guests brought to the event pops of red from Kawakubo's palette, intricate embellishments and sheer fabrics. Caroline Kennedy and Rihanna embraced more fantastical designs, pairing shape-shifting silhouettes with florals, inducing more authenticity to a much-subdued theme interpretation.",
      "2016 Met Gala theme: \"Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology\"",
      "The influence of technology in fashion turned the 2016 Met Gala into a spectacular display of metallics and cutting-edge designs. Many of the garnmets appeared too intricate and precise to be man-made, an ode to the artisans all over the world who piece together exquisite Haute Couture creations by pouring thousands of hours into each work. CBS News spent the day with supermodel and entrepreneur Karlie Kloss, who wore a sleek white Brandon Maxwell number that referenced classic men's tailoring paired with Ala\u00efa-esque angular cuts.",
      "2015 Met Gala theme \"China: Through the Looking Glass\"",
      "While the 2015 Met exhibit scoped a wide history of artifacts and influence from Asian art, the gala came down to just one word: Rihanna. Dawning a sunny yellow cape that cascaded down the steps of the Met, the singer and fashion icon elevated the meaning of attending fashion's biggest night. The couture garment designed by China's Guo Pei took two years to make, Rihanna told Vanity Fair. The look quickly comes to mind around the world when the first Monday in May is discussed.",
      "2014 Met Gala theme: \"Charles James: Beyond Fashion\"",
      "The Costume Institute has been celebrating those behind fashion since its inception, and in 1973 it began hosting the gala within the museum itself, Vogue recounts. Fashion authority Diana Vreeland brought to life \"The World of Balenciaga\" after exiting Vogue as editor-in-chief, and her tribute to Spanish designer Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga left a blueprint for other designer-centered celebrations that followed.",
      "In 2014, couturier Charles James' work went on display at the Met and guests embraced brilliant gowns with his grandiose touch. James' tailored and structural approach to the female form, mixed with modern fabrics, brought elegance and regalia to the occasion.",
      "2013 Met Gala theme: \"Punk: Chaos to Couture\"",
      "Anti-establishment influence inked its way into the Met's\u00a0history in 2013.\u00a0Started in the 1970's, the punk movement gave guests a reason to wear garments embellished with the spirit of teen disobedience and air of grungy D.I.Y. personal style. Madonna honored the era with fishnets, metal studs and silver chains adorning a Givenchy mini plaid blazer by Riccardo Tisci. Rebellion was also apparent in the hairstyles exhibited, most notably by singer Miley Cyrus, a fashion fanatic, whose short, spiked look paired perfectly with her risque fishnet Marc Jacobs gown.",
      "What was the first Met Gala theme?",
      "The Costume Institute started holding benefits in 1948, but it was Vreeland who brought themed galas to the next level as a Met consultant with \"The World of Balenciaga\" in 1973, according to Vogue.",
      "Full list of past Met Gala themes over the years",
      "Inspecting the art of the world's most famous designers and houses, declaring the impact of global cultures and movements, and defining the prevalence of certain style icons, the Met Gala has explored many themes throughout The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute history. Here's a look at the full list of Met Gala themes:",

      "Zendaya's first and second look, 2024 Met Gala",
      "Zendaya has become a favorite at the Met Gala, and last year she was a co-chair, alongside Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Hemsworth and, of course, Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour. The night's theme was \"Sleeping Beauties: Fashion Reawakened,\" and the dress code was \"Garden of Time.\"",
      "The \"Dune\" and \"Euphoria\" star opened the evening in an ocean blue gown by Maison Margiela with fitted a corset and layers of metallic fabric, styled with a feather headpiece and smokey makeup.",
      "Then hours later, she made a surprise return on the red carpet with a second look. She appeared in a never-before-worn Givenchy couture gown from the 1996 collection -- the year she was born -- along with a vintage Alexander McQueen hat adorned with a bouquet of roses.",
      "\"When it comes to the Met carpet, Zendaya is all about keeping us guessing-but one thing is for certain: She will always turn heads. Clearly, she did it again tonight,\" Vogue's Senior Fashion and Style Writer Christian Allaire wrote of her back-to-back looks.",

      "He wore a navy smoking jacket with red and white stitching, topped with a large beret and gold sunglasses.",
      "The Puerto Rican artist arrived on the red carpet carrying a floral bouquet made from the same fabric as his jacket. The blooms represented the flor de maga -- the national flower of Puerto Rico -- along with roses and the flax plant that Sleeping Beauty pricked her finger on in the fairy tale.",
      "His backless, all-white look from 2023, honoring\u00a0late designer Karl Lagerfeld, also gets an honorable mention on the list.",
      "Tyla's sand dress, 2024 Met Gala",

      "The Balmain   design was made up of three colors of sand and crystal studs.",
      "\"We were looking to do something creative, something completely different for my first Met Gala,\" the singer and songwriter told Vogue ahead of the event. \"So when Balmain showed me the idea and sketch, I just knew it was perfect. The idea was crazy, and I loved it.\"",
      "She also carried an hourglass clutch in a nod to \"the sands of time.\"",
      "Michaela Coel dripping in gold, 2023 Met Gala",
      "Michaela Coel was a co-chair for the 2023 Met Gala and she dazzled in a floor-length gown by Schiaparelli that was covered in crystals, accompanied by a large diamond necklace and chunky gold earrings.",
      "The \"I May Destroy You\" creator's skin was glowing, with the help of makeup artist Bernicia Boateng, who told Vogue she \"wanted her skin to beam and almost speak for her.\"",
      "\"Anna [Wintour] has been a real champion of me, she put me on the cover of American Vogue,\" Coel said in a behind-the-scenes interview as she got ready for the gala. \"She said that I am not afraid to be myself... and that's why she asked me to co-chair.\"",
      "Her fellow co-chairs included Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Roger Federer and Dua Lipa.",
      "Doja Cat goes full cat, 2023 Met Gala",
      "Love it or hate it, Doja Cat did not hold back for the 2023 Met Gala. It was her first time attending, and she fully embraced -- and embodied -- the theme, dressing up as Karl Lagerfeld's beloved cat, a Burmese named Choupette.",
      "Doja Cat wore an Oscar de la Renta gown with cat ears on the hood and a large diamond that dangled in front of her forehead. To complete her cat transformation, her makeup featured black cat eyeliner and made her nose look more cat-like.",
      "The Grammy winner famously stayed in character for her red carpet interview, answering every question with \"meow.\"",
      "Choupette, who Lagerfeld reportedly received as a gift from French model Baptiste Giabiconi, has her own Instagram account with more than a quarter million followers.",
      "Blake Lively's NYC inspired gown, 2022 Met Gala",
      "Blake Lively has been gracing the Met Gala for more than a decade, and she ramped up the drama in recent years. She wore a stunning Atelier  Versace gown for the 2022 Met Gala, drawing inspiration from New York City landmarks to fit the theme \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion.\"",
      "Lively made an entrance on The Met steps worthy of her \"Gossip Girl\" character Serena Van Der Woodsen. Her first look featured a metallic bodice and bow inspired by the Manhattan skyline and Empire State Building, then it transformed into a long blue-green train based on Grand Central's constellation ceiling. She also wore a seven-tier crown to symbolize the Statue of Liberty.",
      "Husband Ryan Reynolds was by her side to co-chair the event in a black velvet tuxedo by Ralph Lauren.",
      "Lively also made the best-dressed list with another Versace gown at the 2018 Met Gala in a jeweled bodice and detailed embroidery, paired with a halo headpiece.",

      "He started in a large, gold cape that was then removed to reveal a golden suit of armor underneath, which he later shed to show off a crystal-covered body suit.",
      "The fashion house called it a \"three-part LGBTQ+ American fairytale.\" The cape was meant to conceal his identity, the armor symbolized protection against prejudice, and finally the body suit represented \"living life as your true, unguarded self.\"",
      "The artist is known for his daring fashion choices, including his purple prom look at the MTV Awards just days before.",
      "Iman's latest iconic look, 2021 Met Gala",
      "Nobody does it quite like Iman. The supermodel has worn so many iconic looks over the years, but the 2021 Met Gala will go down as one of her best.",
      "Her outfit from Harris Reed, supported by Dolce & Gabbana, featured a gold strapless jumpsuit under a massive hoop skirt and matching headpiece made of feathers.",
      "Reed told Vogue they were inspired by 18th-century hooped cage skirts that could \"take up space in a way that says, 'I deserve to be here and I own it.'\"",
      "Iman first attended the Met Gala in 1981 with Calvin Klein and later appeared alongside her husband and fellow fashion icon, David Bowie.",
      "Maluma's red leather suit, 2021 Met Gala",
      "Maluma was the first reggaet\u00f3n artist to attend the Met Gala when he made his debut in 2019 and he continues to push the envelope.",
      "He joined Donatella Versace for the 2021 Met Gala in a red-hot leather suit with bejeweled accents and accessories.",
      "\"My favorite part of my outfit was everything,\" Maluma told Vogue. \"I loved the cowboy inspiration, as I ride horses, but the highlight was the belt... It was a signature Versace cowboy belt inspired by the late Gianni Versace's classic '90s looks.\"",
      "He also wore a 14-karat gold chain link glove with his nickname, Papi Juancho, written in stones.",
      "Zendaya's light-up Cinderella look, 2019 Met Gala",
      "First, there was Joan of Arc in 2018. Then, her Cinderella gown was among the highlights of the wacky and weird 2019 Met Gala, \"Camp: Notes on Fashion.\"",
      "With the wave of a wand from her stylist and fairy godfather Law Roach, the dress lit up The Met steps, literately. It magically changed from gray to blue, prompting a large cheer from the crowd.",
      "Roach said the gown, by Tommy Hilfiger, represented Zendaya's transformation from the Disney Channel to \"Euphoria\" and more adult roles.",
      "As for last year's looks, he said Zendaya wasn't even fitted until Saturday, two days before the big event.",
      "\"I haven't seen Zendaya's dress!\" he told The New York Times in an interview ahead of time. \"We've been on two press tours - 'Dune 2' and 'Challengers' - and doing two Vogue covers.\"",

      "Her sisters, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, wore coordinated sheer Versace dresses embellished with bright orange and purple feathers, respectively. Kylie was joined by her on-again-off-again boyfriend, Travis Scott.",
      "And of course it wouldn't be a Kardashian photo-op without mom, Kris Jenner. She had on a navy blue Tommy Hilfiger jumpsuit with oversized gray shoulders, plus a platinum blonde wig that was reportedly a last-minute suggestion from Kylie.",
      "The Kardashian sisters have been known for some hit-or-miss looks over the years, including Kim's infamous \"black-out\" look in 2021.",

      "Oh Billy Porter, where to begin. His 2019 Met Gala look was one for the ages.",
      "Porter entered the event lounging on a platform carried by six shirtless men. He then climbed down to spread a pair of giant, golden wings.",
      "In a behind-the-scenes interview before the big reveal, he told Vogue that \"Camp\" is often discounted or \"thought of as cheesy,\" but, \"when it's done properly, it's one of the highest forms of fashion and art.\"",
      "Porter enlisted New York City-based brand The Blonds to design the Ancient Egypt-inspired look.",
      "\"Given the massive collection of Egyptian art The Met has, it was also our way to pay respect to that,\" he said.",
      "Lady Gaga's many looks, 2019 Met Gala",
      "Before Lil Nas X and Blake Lively pulled off multiple outfits, Lady Gaga was the original shapeshifter at the 2019 Met Gala. It was almost like the star was born to take on the theme.",
      "Lady Gaga rocked four different looks all designed by her friend, Brandon Maxwell. First, she arrived in a massive pink dress with a 25-foot train and five dancers carrying umbrellas. As she entered The Met steps, her team unzipped the cape to reveal another black gown underneath.",
      "Then she unveiled another pink dress paired with large black sunglasses, appearing to apply makeup and pose for selfies. And finally, she shed that dress and stripped down to a black bra, panties, stockings and boots.",

      "Andre Leon Talley, a red carpet staple, 2015 Met Gala",

      "Supermodel Kate Moss was the darling of the 2009 Met Gala in a metallic mini dress and matching headwrap from Marc Jacobs. That year's theme was \"The Model as Muse: Embodying Fashion,\" and she couldn't have been more right for the part.",

    "summary": "The actor-playwright received two Tony nominations for the over-the-top comedy about Mary Todd Lincoln and her secret passion of becoming a cabaret star, while her husband, Abe, is trying to win the Civil War.",
    "story": [
      "\"Oh, Mary!\" may be Broadway's most unlikely offering this season, a wildly over-the-top, not-at-all historically accurate look at first lady Mary Todd Lincoln, written by and starring Cole Escola.",
      "Abraham Lincoln: \"For God's sake, Mary! How would it look for the first lady of the United States to be flitting about a stage right now in the ruins of war?\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"How would it look? Sensational!!\"",
      "It's a broad comedy about Mary's secret passion of becoming a cabaret star. Meanwhile, her husband, Abe, is just wrapping up the Civil War, and is more concerned with keeping the country together.",
      "Abraham Lincoln: \"No! It's inappropriate! We're at war!\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"With who?\"Abraham Lincoln: \"The south!\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"Of what?\"",
      "It's not a revival, it has no movie stars (\"Well, speak for yourself, Mo!\"), and it's a smash hit, breaking box office records.",
      "What does that say? \"Inflation is high,\" Escola laughed.",
      "Escola came up with the idea in 2009: \"I sent an email to myself that said, 'What if Abraham Lincoln's assassination wasn't such a bad thing for Mary Todd?' You know, like, Mary's starting over. Like, 'Now I'm single. I can date.' You know?\"",
      "But this fever dream Mary remained just a dream for years. \"I loved this idea so much, I didn't want it to get on paper and for it to disappoint me \u2013 to disappoint me, not just the audience, but, like, me,\" Escola said. \"There are certain ideas that you're just like, 'Oh, I don't wanna plant this seed, because what if it's an ugly flower?'\"",
      "Escola eventually wrote the play. \"Oh, Mary!\" opened to rapturous reviews downtown, quickly moved uptown to Broadway, and just this week earned five Tony nominations, including two for 38-year-old Escola (for best play and best actor).",
      "It's all a long way from rural Oregon, where Escola was raised. The family had little money, with a Vietnam veteran father, Escola says, who suffered from mental illness. \"When I was maybe five years old, my father chased us out of the home with a shotgun. He was having some sort of alcoholic manic break and thought that there were people after him. And so, he chased my mother and my brother and I out of the trailer, and then we moved out and didn't come back.\"",
      "The family moved in with Escola's grandmother. \"Then, her and I shared a bedroom, and I remember that's when she taught me to read. And she was in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's so she would repeat stories a lot. But I loved them. I loved her stories. I realize now, when she would tell these stories, we were, like, meeting in the middle of her memory. Like, she was living out the fantasy of her childhood, and I was also living out my fantasy of being a young girl on a farm in Alberta.\"",
      "I asked, \"And you didn't mind that she was repeating the stories?\"",
      "\"No, no,\" Escola replied. \"Because she would remember certain details in a new telling or, like, leave something out, and then I got to be, like, you know, 'And you were wearing a dress, right, Gramma?'\"",
      "\"And is it right that she gave you a Barbie when you were five?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She gave me my first Barbie. just completely took me at face value when I was doing something that wasn't what boys were supposed to do.\"",
      "Her understanding proved prescient. Escola now uses they/them pronouns. Asked to explain, Escola said, \"I have always felt not male, not female. And you know, it's funny, because recently I saw photos of me on Instagram. The comments were like, 'What is that? Like, that's not a man.' 'Well, it sure as hell ain't a woman, either.' And I was like, 'Exactly.' Like, you do get it.\"",
      "Likewise, Escola's comedic identity has never been in doubt.",
      "I asked, \"Comedically, have you always done your own thing?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"So, there was never a time where you thought, 'I need to be more like this person to make people respond to me'?\"",
      "\"No,\" said Escola. \"It would be like trying to speak German when I don't actually know any German. It has to make me laugh in order for it to even have a chance of making someone else laugh.\"",
      "Escola began performing in community theater back in Oregon, and eventually scraped together the money to make it to New York (\"It was New York or bust!\"), at first attending college and living at the 92nd Street Y. It was a short stint of only nine months. \"I had to drop out because they wouldn't let me take out any more loans. I guess I was so poor that they were like, 'You'll never be able to pay this back.'",
      "\"I felt like there was something wrong with me that I couldn't afford to go to school. That's the thing that makes me the most angry about being poor, just this innate sense that it's like a moral failing or an innate thing that's broken in you.\"",
      "Escola eventually did make it back to New York to stay, gaining a fan base with online videos, such as \"Mom Commercial\" (2015):",
      "\u2026 and then on TV, playing a range of deranged, yet delightful characters in shows like \"At Home with Amy Sedaris.\"",
      "And then along came Mary.",
      "I said, \"You don't come to see the show and go, 'Oh, there were layers and layers of development people that were saying, No, you've gotta tweak it for this audience and do this for that audience.'\"",
      "\"No,\" Escola said. \"There is something special about the fact that I wrote this for me and my friends, and for my audience that I've had in downtown venues and stuff. And the fact that it's successful is, I don't know, it makes it that much sweeter. It really does.\"",

    "summary": "When Alex Matisse founded East Fork Pottery, in Asheville, N.C., he didn't want to use the name of his great-grandfather, artist Henri Matisse. But after business took off, Alex decided it was time \u2013 and now graces his ceramics with the imagery of his famous forebear.",
    "story": [
      "As an apprentice to a potter, what Alex Matisse discovered shaped him like clay itself.\u00a0 \"When I walked in, I knew that this is what I was going to do,\" he said. \"We were told pots have skin and bones and skeletons and, like, a plate should have the fullness of the moon.\"",
      "Artful descriptions, much the way a painter might define their craft. In fact it was Henri Matisse who once said, \"I don't literally paint that table, but the emotion it produces upon me.\"",
      "When Alex founded East Fork Pottery in Asheville, North Carolina, back in 2009, he took the same view. He saw ceramics as a canvas. It came easily, like it was woven into his DNA \u2013 because it was. Alex is the great-grandson of artist Henri Matisse.",
      "I asked, \"What did you know of your great-grandfather when you were growing up?\"",
      "\"He was everywhere, kind of in the air that we breathed, around the house, on the walls,\" Alex replied.",
      "It was a famous last name he ran away from for years.\u00a0 \"I had a very grumpy relationship with it,\" he laughed. \"It was this kind of shadow thing that followed me around that I wanted to shake.\"",
      "Maybe it was stubbornness, or pride, but Alex was determined to make his own way. He convinced his soon-to-be-wife Connie to help him build a wood kiln on an old tobacco farm.",
      "I asked, \"Did she have the same passion for it that you did?\"",
      "\"No. She didn't have a passion for clay,\" Alex said.",
      "\"But she had a passion for you, so she kept going?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She stuck around,\" he laughed.",
      "And without anyone knowing who he really was, his business boomed. He could barely keep up with the demand. He realized, \"If we're gonna play in this world, something's gotta change. Like, we cannot keep doing it like we did.\"",
      "So, he decided to mechanize, at least partially. The pottery was still his, only he thought better, especially the colors.\u00a0 He was excited. \"And we sent out a postcard of these new pots that look, you know, they were plain, they had colors on them,\" he said. \"And nobody showed up. So overnight, we lost almost every single one of our customers. Like, they had thought we had lost our minds.\"",
      "And yet, he still refused to fall back on the Matisse name, and it turned out that belief in himself paid off.",
      "Today, he has legions of fans who call themselves \"Potheads.\" They buy, share and trade East Fork dinnerware online. On the secondary market, some of his early pieces can go for thousands of dollars.",
      "And so, with East Fork firmly established, about 18 months ago Alex decided it was time to use his own name. He, along with his sister and brother, poured over hundreds of works by their great-grandfather to find the ones that could be pottery perfect.",
      "\"We wanted something like the Blue Nude series that was instantly recognizable,\" Alex said. \"But then, I wanted some that spoke to me a little more personally.\"",
      "Decals were made of the chosen works, faithful to their great-grandfather's exacting details. Each one is carefully applied by hand, and inspected by hand over and over again.",
      "He says he doesn't wonder what his great-grandfather would think of his new collection. \"Oh, geez. No.\" Alex said, \"Because he was very serious. He was so focused on his work. Like, that's what he cared about.\"",
      "Henri Matisse once famously said, \"Creativity takes courage.\" His great-grandson Alex Matisse would certainly agree with that. His only caveat is that sometimes courage is all in the timing.",
      "\"There's not a heaviness to it,\" he said. \"It's just another layer. It's just another interesting part of my history, my family's history. And it feels great to celebrate it and share it.\"",

The center has been operating with an acting director since Marks left the FDA in March.",
      "\"Dr. Prasad brings the kind of scientific rigor, independence, and transparency we need at CBER \u2014 a significant step forward,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary posted on X on Tuesday.",

Officials have floated the possibility of requiring new randomized trials before approving future updates to COVID shots.",

      "Michael Rogers had worked for the FDA for more than three decades, culminating in a role as the agency's associate commissioner for inspections and investigations. Colleagues said they were surprised to learn that his final day in the office will be May 14.",
      "\"I have decided to retire. It was my decision, but it was time after 34 years,\" Rogers told CBS News in an email on Monday.",
      "Rogers has had a challenging tenure atop the agency's inspections workforce. He was the top official overseeing food inspections during the infant formula crisis in 2022,\u00a0 when the agency mishandled whistleblower complaints about a troubled formula plant linked to a deadly recall. He also oversaw a resulting reorganization of the FDA's inspections office in 2024.",
      "Two FDA officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Rogers had told colleagues privately that he was miserable in recent days, as the agency's inspections office has reeled from sweeping cuts to its ranks ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "The cuts have come as FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has publicly touted plans to expand foreign surprise inspections, despite the agency privately struggling to keep up with inspections due to layoffs, early retirements and resignations.",

      "\"We're also not going to have our inspectors hanging out for three or four weeks. They're going to get in and out, and we're going to do more inspections with the same resources as a result,\" Makary said.",
      "Multiple current and former FDA officials said they were perplexed by Makary's claim, given the push for longer trips in the past had been an efficiency measure intended to result in the agency being able to complete more inspections.",
      "Instead of spending money and wearing down staff to fly in and out of a country to do each inspection, officials said, the agency would combine multiple inspections into a single trip.",
      "\"So they're going to double or triple the foreign inspection flight costs and keep my people in a perpetual state of jet lag,\" one FDA official told CBS News.",
      "Multiple officials warned of a drain on morale for the agency's workforce, given long-running challenges with hiring and retaining investigators.",
      "\"No one is 'hanging out.' You inspect Monday to Friday. If you're lucky you have the weekend to recover,\" the official said.",
      "Officials also said it was not possible to increase the number of foreign inspections while also cutting down on the length of foreign trips without cutting corners on oversight.",
      "FDA officials and outside auditors have closely studied how long the agency takes to complete its oversight work, as it has struggled to cut down on a backlog of foreign inspections and complaints.",

    "story": [
      "Nearly all of the remaining staff at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health were laid off Friday, multiple officials and laid-off employees told CBS News, gutting programs ranging from approvals of new safety equipment to firefighter health.",
      "Much of the work at NIOSH, an arm of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had already stalled after an initial round of layoffs on April 1 at the agency ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "New requests for investigations of firefighter injuries and workplace health hazards had already stopped being accepted. A CDC plan to help Texas schools curb the spread of measles infections was also scrapped due to the layoffs.",

Some workers for those programs had been asked to temporarily return to work for another month or two, after pleas from members of Congress.",
      "Among the layoffs to NIOSH's World Trade Center Health Program were nurses and scientists, two CDC officials said. Staff dealing with enrollment, member services and other administrative duties were also cut.",
      "Layoff notices received by workers Friday were almost identical to those received in the initial round of Kennedy's cuts, which said that their duties \"have been identified as either unnecessary or virtually identical to duties being performed elsewhere in the agency.\"",
      "The main difference with Friday's layoff notices was the date they take effect: workers are being put on leave until an official separation from service on July 2, instead of in June.",
      "The layoffs also stopped work at the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. This NIOSH division had been the government body tasked with vetting safety equipment like N95 masks and breathing devices used by emergency workers.",
      "The laboratory's respirator approval program had been in the middle of processing around 100 applications for personal protective equipment, one laid-off official said.",
      "Stalled work includes changes needed to meet new standards issued by the National Fire Protection Association for this year. No equipment is currently certified to meet those standards, nor has the agency been able to issue refunds to application fees paid for by manufacturers.",

      "Speaking from the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said a \"breakthrough\" deal with the U.K. would include \"billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports,\" specifically agricultural products. He added that the U.K. would \"reduce or eliminate\" numerous nontariff barriers.",
      "The final details are being written and will be delivered in the coming weeks, the president said.",
      "\"We still have our 10% tariff on which will produce $6 billion of revenue for the United States,\" said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick during the White House briefing, referring to a\u00a010% tax on imported goods from all U.S. trade partners, including Britain, imposed by Mr. Trump in April.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the deal would boost trade between the two countries and create jobs.",
      "\"This is a really fantastic, historic day in which we can announce this deal between our two great countries,\" Starmer \u00a0said over the phone during the White House announcement. \"I think it's a real tribute to the history that we have of working so closely together.\"",
      "Britain says the deal will cut\u00a0tariffs\u00a0on U.K. cars from 27.5% to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, adding that the agreement sets a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles that can be imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff.",
      "News of a potential deal inflated investor confidence Thursday, with markets making gains in early trading. Following the trade deal announcement, the S&P 500 soared 55 points, or 1%, to 5,686 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 408 points, or 1% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.3%.",
      "More trade deals are also in the works, according to President Trump.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is traveling to Switzerland this weekend, where he will meet with a Chinese trade delegation. Mr. Trump imposed levies of as high as 145% on Chinese imports, leading the country to fire back with 125% tariffs on American goods.",
      "For businesses, consumers and investors, progress on the trade front can't come soon enough amid ongoing uncertainty on where the U.S. economy is headed. A 10% baseline tariff on most imported goods has been in effect since April 5, while so-called reciprocal tariffs against other countries \u2014 with the exception of China \u2014 are paused until July.",
      "Where do negotiations stand?",
      "The announcement Thursday of a deal with the U.K. marks what could be the first of other trade agreements, with Mr. Trump and his team in negotiation mode with foreign leaders from Canada,\u00a0Italy, India, Japan and other trading partners since announcing his\u00a0\"Liberation Day\" tariffs\u00a0on April 2.",
      "Mr. Trump has not specified when agreements with other countries would be announced, but said that more deals are to follow.",
      "\"We have many meetings planned today and tomorrow,\" the president said Thursday during the announcement from the Oval Office. \"And every country wants to be making deals.\"",
      "While testifying on Capitol Hill earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent addressed the timeline for trade deals: \"I'd be surprised if we don't have more than 80% or 90% of those wrapped up by the end of the end of the year. And that may be much sooner,\" he said, referring to countries with which the U.S. has trade deficits.",
      "Some experts, however, believe negotiations will take longer.",
      "Han-koo Yeo, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics believes that countries with whom the Trump administration is negotiating will have it in their interest to move slowly in their trade discussions. That's because of the longterm implications these deals will have, the former South Korean trade minister told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Negotiations will likely drag past May into June, according to Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, although some countries might be motivated to act quickly.",
      "\"Everyone facing negotiations has been told to submit letters with their 'best offers,'\" Bremmer said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch, \"and smaller countries that desperately want/need deals are complying.\"",
      "Who is the U.S. negotiating with?",
      "Bessent told the House committee Tuesday that the U.S. has 18 \"important trading relationships\" and is currently negotiating with 17 to reach deals. \"Many of our trading partners have approached us with very good offers and we are in the process of renegotiating those,\" he said.",
      "The Trump administration in recent weeks has discussed trade and tariffs with Canada, Italy, India and Japan.",
      "It's unclear which deals will be announced first, but Clayton Allen, who covers politics and policy in Washington for Eurasia Group, said to look for deals with Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and India \u2014 countries that have been engaged in trade negotiations with the U.S. the longest.",
      "Eurasia predicts a deal with Japan could come in mid-June.",
      "China absent from negotiations for now",
      "What Bessent did make clear to Congress on Tuesday is that the U.S. has not yet entered into active trade talks with China.\u00a0 President Trump in April said that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid tariff tensions, but\u00a0China denied\u00a0any talks between Beijing and Washington had taken place.",
      "The Treasury secretary, however, is set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend while conducting trade talks in Switzerland, the Trump administration\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday.",
      "A\u00a0post\u00a0from the Chinese Embassy on X confirmed the meeting. \"Based on full consideration of global expectations, China's interests, and the appeals of the U.S. business community and consumers, #China has decided to agree to engage with the #US side,\" the posts reads. \"As China's lead on China-U.S. economic and trade affairs, Vice Premier He Lifeng will hold talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during his visit to #Switzerland from May 9 to 12.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the embassy said in a statement Wednesday that the U.S. has reached out to China \"through various channels\" and that the talks are being held \"at the request of the U.S. side.\" The spokesperson added that China \"firmly\u2002oppose[s]\u2002the U.S. abuse of tariffs.\"",
      "In a press briefing on Thursday, Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong reiterated this stance, saying the U.S. \"needs to show sincerity to talk and be prepared to rectify its wrongdoing and cancel unilateral tariffs,\" according to\u00a0Bloomberg.",
      "What could trade agreements look like?",
      "The U.S.-U.K. trade pact gave the world its first glimpse at what future deals might look like. But as Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, points out not all trade deals will necessarily be created equal.",
      "\"For the rest of the world, this could offer something of a blueprint, but countries being threatened with even higher reciprocal tariffs would presumably have to offer more that the U.K., which only ever faced the 10% minimum,\" he said in a research note.",
      "Mr. Trump also signaled on Thursday that other countries should not expect to get the same treatment as the U.K. Asked whether the baseline 10% tariff on imported British goods would be a template for future trade deals, he said the answer is \"no.\"",
      "\"That's a low number,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"Many, some will be much higher.\"",
      "While it's hard to predict what other potential tariff deals might include, Yeo, who has helped orchestrate several bilateral and mulitlateral trade negotiations in the past, said such agreements would likely be nonbinding \"gentlemen's agreements\" or memorandums of understanding.",
      "In other words, the U.S. could come to an agreement with a trading partner only to renege later on by issuing additional tariffs.",
      "\"The framework deal is only as good as the nice piece of paper that you write it down on,\" said Eurasia's Allen. \"Trade deals are very, very complex animals, and you're going to get probably top line agreement on some key issues of concern with a promise to come back and negotiate other things,\" he said.",
      "Asked by Ohio Rep. Dave Joyce about the format of the deals, Bessent on Tuesday said, \"I expect that we can see a substantial reduction in the tariffs that we are being charged, as well as nontariff barriers, currency manipulation and the subsidies of both labor and capital investment.\"",

      "The Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan policy institute based in Washington, D.C., notes that the economic fallout from the Trump administration's tariffs will fall largely on low- and middle-income consumers. The levies could cost households an average of $5,200 every year,\u00a0according to the nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Inflation ahead?",
      "Manufacturers expect their prices to increase 3.6% over the next 12 months, up from 2.3% in the last quarter of 2024, according to a recent survey from the National Association of Manufacturers, which cites manufacturers' concerns over trade.",
      "\"Nobody has the profitability to be able to eat the tariffs,\" David Loftus, CEO of the Electronic Component Industry Association, an industry trade group, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So the manufacturers pass to the distributors, who pass to the customers.\"",
      "A recent\u00a0Gallup poll found that nearly 90% of Americans expect tariffs to drive up prices this year. For now, tariffs have yet to budge prices \u2014 the Consumer Price Index in March\u00a0rose 2.4% on an annual basis, down from 2.8% in February.",
      "Yet many experts say that U.S. tariffs, coupled with retaliatory measures from other countries, are likely to boost consumer prices in the months ahead.",
      "\"With the new tariffs now in place, we look for a shift up in inflation, adding a headwind to already slowing consumer activity and economic growth,\" Nationwide economist Daniel Vielhaber told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that core inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index, which tracks consumer spending, to rise this year to 3.8%, up from 2.6% in March. Electronics and apparel are likely to see the sharpest price increases, according to the investment bank.",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers, which must pay the fees to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass on most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices, according to economists.",
      "Mr. Trump has staunchly defended the tariffs as a way to restore what he calls fairness to global trade, reinvigorate U.S. manufacturers and generate federal revenues. When asked in a May 4 interview on\u00a0NBC's\u00a0\"Meet the Press\" whether higher duties on imports will drive up prices, he replied, \"No. I think tariffs are going to be great for us because it's going to make us rich.\"",
      "The president has also doubled down on his messaging that foreign exporters, not U.S. consumers, will absorb higher tariff costs. \"China probably will eat those tariffs,\" Mr. Trump said in an April 29\u00a0interview\u00a0with ABC News about the U.S. imposing tariffs of as high as 145% on Chinese goods.",
      "At the same time, Mr. Trump has seemingly acknowledged that stepped-up tariffs could result in higher costs for some goods, such as toys. \"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\" he said in an\u00a0April 30 Cabinet meeting. \"And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.\"",
      "Some companies already hiking prices",
      "After Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a 10% baseline tariff on U.S. imports, along with higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of other nations, a flurry of companies across a range of industries have announced that they will increase prices to offset higher costs.",
      "For example, power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker said in an April 30 earnings\u00a0call that they implemented a \"single-digit\" price increase on retail partners that month and that they're eyeing another price increase for later in the year.",
      "\"Given the magnitude of the current tariff rates, we are actively engaged with our channel partners about a second price increase, targeting implementation at the beginning of the third quarter,\" Chief Operating Officer Christopher Nelson said on the call.",
      "The CEO of consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, the maker of Tide, Old Spice, Tampax and other household brands, told CNBC\u00a0last month that price hikes are \"likely\" due to the uncertainty of tariffs. Adidas CEO Bjorn Goulden also told analysts in an April earnings call that there will be price increases in the U.S. market if U.S. duties on imported goods remain in place.",
      "\"So should the duties go away, again, there will, of course, not be price increases,\" he said. \"But I think we all agree that should these duties stay or even be higher, then, of course, it will cause a price increase in the market in general, not only in our category.\"",
      "Chinese online retailers Shein and Temu said in April that they planned to hike their prices, citing the U.S. eliminating a tariff loophole\u00a0for lower-cost goods. Relatedly, Temu has stopped shipping Chinese-made goods to customers in the U.S. following the May 2 expiration of the so-called de minimis exemption.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday announced the broad terms of a trade deal with Britain, which could lower the burden of his sweeping tariffs and potentially deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "The president said in remarks from the Oval Office that the two countries are \"affirming that reciprocity and fairness is an essential and vital principle of international trade.\"",
      "The deal is the first rolled out in Mr. Trump's second term and comes as the president has used tariffs \u2014 and the threat of the levies \u2014 as leverage to bring other countries to the table to negotiate trade deals with his administration.",
      "Mr. Trump said the details of the agreement are still being finalized and expects it to be finished in the coming weeks. But he said it includes \"billions of dollars\" of increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market, including for American agricultural products like beef and ethanol.",
      "Britain will also \"reduce or eliminate\" non-tariff barriers that Mr. Trump said discriminate against U.S. products, and fast-track American imports through U.K. customs, the president announced.",
      "He called the agreement a \"great deal for both our countries\" and said it is opening up access to Britain for U.S. products.",
      "\"It's going to be something very special for the U.K. and special for the United States,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Delivering brief remarks by speakerphone, Starmer said the framework will boost trade between the U.S. and the U.K., protect and create jobs and open market access. Starmer called it a \"historic day\" that is a \"real tribute to the history that we have of working so closely together.\"",
      "The 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports, which was unveiled by the president last month as part of his \"Liberation Day\" announcement, remains in place. But under the plan, the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, and additional vehicles will face 25% rates, according to the White House.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the deal will raise $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. as a result of the 10% tariff on imports from the U.K. As part of the agreement, Rolls Royce engines will not be subject to tariffs, and a British airline will buy $10 billion in Boeing planes, the commerce secretary said.",
      "Mr. Trump had teased the announcement Wednesday, writing on social media that he would unveil a \"major trade deal\" with a \"big, highly respected country,\" which he did not identify at the time. On Thursday morning, the president posted on Truth Social that it \"should be a very big and exciting day for the United States of America and the United Kingdom.\"",
      "\"The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,\" he added. \"Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!\"",
      "A social media post from Mr. Trump said the framework will raise $5 billion in new export opportunities for American farmers, ranchers and producers, and strengthen national security for both the U.S. and the U.K.",
      "\"This deal shows that if you respect America, and bring serious proposals to the table, America is OPEN FOR BUSINESS,\" the post said, teasing that there are \"many more to come.\"",
      "Starmer's office said the prime minister would give an \"update\" about U.S. trade talks later in the day.",
      "\"As you know, talks with the U.S. have been ongoing and you'll hear more from me about that later today,\" Starmer said at a defense conference in London.",
      "Mr. Trump placed a 10% tax on imports from Britain, as well as 25% tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum on the premise that doing so would foster more factory jobs domestically.",
      "A major goal of British negotiators has been to reduce or lift the U.S. import tax on U.K. cars and steel. The U.S. is the largest destination for British cars, accounting for more than a quarter of U.K. auto exports in 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics.",
      "Britain has also sought tariff exemptions for pharmaceuticals, while the U.S. wants greater access to the British market for agriculture products. Starmer's government has said it won't lower U.K. food standards to allow in chlorine-rinsed American chicken or hormone-treated beef.",
      "If a deal is announced, the British government will see it as a vindication of Starmer's emollient approach to Mr. Trump, which has avoided direct confrontation or criticism. Unlike the European Union, Britain didn't announce retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to Mr. Trump's import taxes.",
      "A trade deal with the United Kingdom would be symbolically important and a relief for British exporters. But an agreement would do little to address Mr. Trump's core concern about persistent trade deficits that prompted him to impose import taxes on countries around the world.",
      "The U.S. ran a $11.9 billion trade surplus in goods with the U.K. last year, according to the Census Bureau. The $68 billion in goods that the U.S. imported from the U.K. last year accounted for just 2% of all goods imported into the country.",
      "The U.S. is much more important to the U.K. economy. It was Britain's biggest trading partner last year, according to government statistics, though the bulk of Britain's exports to the U.S. are services rather than goods.",
      "Mr. Trump has shown a desire to strike a trade agreement with the U.K. since it voted in 2016 to leave the European Union. Yet as recently as Tuesday, Mr. Trump showed no awareness of the possible terms of the deal when asked about its possibility.",
      "\"They're offering us concessions?\" Mr. Trump remarked to reporters. \"I hope so. ... They do want to make a deal very badly.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has previously said that his leverage in talks would be U.S. consumers, but he appeared to suggest that the U.K. would also start buying more American-made goods.",
      "\"I think that the United Kingdom, like every other country, they want to ... go shopping in the United States of America,\" he said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week that the administration is moving forward with \"all deliberate speed\" to reach agreements with 17 trading partners. He said he anticipates \"agreements in principle,\" and after they're reached, the administration \"will paper them over\" in the coming months.",
      "Mr. Trump said during his Oval Office remarks that there are \"numerous deals\" in the works. Bessent is set to travel to Switzerland on Thursday for a trip that will include a meeting with Chinese officials. The president said he is open to speaking with Chinese President Xi Jinping after the meeting.",
      "A trade deal with the U.S. is one of several that Starmer's government is seeking to reach. On Tuesday, Britain and India announced a trade after three years of negotiations. The U.K. is also trying to lift some of the barriers to trade with the European Union imposed when Britain left the bloc in 2020.",

      "Mr. Trump's post on his Truth Social app is the latest in a string of criticisms he's launched at Powell for holding rates steady this year. Meanwhile, the Bank of England on Thursday cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25% amid concerns over the potential shock to global growth emanating from the tariff policies of the Trump administration.",
      "The Federal Reserve's last rate cut was made in December 2024, when the central bank lowered the rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%, where it still stands.",
      "In a press conference yesterday, Powell articulated the Fed's reasoning for holding steady, including that economic data \u2014 for now \u2014 shows that the U.S. is in relatively good shape. The Fed chair also noted that its policymakers want to hold off on making any moves until the effects of Mr. Trump's economic policies become clearer, such as the impact of his broad tariffs on inflation and economic growth.",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday inaccurately claimed there is \"virtually NO INFLATION.\" Inflation rose 2.4% on an annual basis in March, which reflects a cooler pace than in the prior months yet is still above the Fed's stated goal of reaching a 2% annual pace.",

      "By the numbers",
      "The Fed said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since the central bank last moved to lower short-term rates in December.",

      "The Fed, which has a dual mandate to keep inflation low while maintaining a healthy job market, on Wednesday signaled that economic risks are on the rise.",
      "Concerns that Mr. Trump's tariffs could spur both higher inflation and unemployment were highlighted by Fed chair Jerome Powell in a press conference to talk about the central bank's decision. But Powell noted that while consumer and business sentiment has sharply dropped, the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs haven't yet materialized in hard economic data.",
      "\"We've judged that the risk to higher inflation and unemployment has risen\" since March, when the Fed last met, Powell said. But, he added, \"We can't say which way this will shake out.\"",
      "Because of the uncertainty of the economy's path under the Trump administration's trade policies, the central bank wants to take a wait-and-see approach, Powell added. At the benchmark rate's current level, the Fed has the flexibility to cut rates if unemployment rises, or hike rates if inflation reignites due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, he noted.",
      "At the same time, Powell noted there are concerns that the Fed could face a situation where its dual mandate is in tension, which could occur if inflation and unemployment simultaneously spike. In that scenario, the central bank would need to focus on which side of the mandate is the farthest from the Fed's goal, and prioritize taming that part of the economy, he added.",
      "\"This would be a complicated and challenging judgment we would have to make,\" Powell said. \"If the two goals are in tension \u2014 if unemployment is moving up in an uncomfortable way, and so is inflation \u2014 we would look at how far they are\" from the Fed's targets, and focus first on the economic issue that's under greater stress, he added.",

      "\"The Fed still sees the economy on solid footing, but acknowledges upside risk to both sides of their mandate \u2014 unemployment and inflation \u2014 because of tariffs,\" Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in an email. \"With stagflation risks rising, the Fed's communications will emphasize patience until there is enough clarity in the data.\"",

      "The Fed's to hold interest rates steady comes amid pressure from Mr. Trump to cut interest rates, with the president\u00a0writing\u00a0on social media last month that the central bank has been \"TOO LATE AND WRONG\" for holding off on further reductions.",
      "The latest Fed statement offers no clues on when it might consider easing monetary policy, according to Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "\"We continue to expect that, with tariffs likely to generate a modest slowdown in GDP growth to around 1.5%, the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged for all of this year,\" he said in a report.",
      "Economists are forecasting that Mr. Trump's tariffs will boost inflation later this year. That could provide the Fed with the impetus to cut rates, although inflation\u00a0cooled in March.",
      "Given more subdued inflation and a buoyant job market, most economists had\u00a0projected\u00a0that the Fed would maintain interest rates at today's meeting, despite some headwinds such as eroding\u00a0consumer confidence\u00a0and a sharp decline in\u00a0first-quarter\u00a0U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"For the time being the Fed remains in a holding pattern as it waits for uncertainty to clear,\" said Ashish Shah, CIO of public investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email after the Fed's announcement.",
      "Shah added, \"Recent better-than-feared jobs data has supported the Fed's on-hold stance, and the onus is on the labor market to weaken sufficiently to bring a resumption of its easing cycle.\"",

      "President Trump slammed Gavin Newsom on Tuesday just hours after the California governor asked for collaboration on a massive film tax credit.",
      "\"California built the film industry \u2014 and we're ready to bring even more jobs home.  We've proven what strong state incentives can do,\" Newsom's post on X said. \"Now it's time for a real federal partnership to Make America Film Again.\"",
      "His request came after the president announced over the weekend that he would impose 100% tariffs on all films produced outside the U.S. In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the nation's movie industry was \"DYING a very fast death.\"",
      "The film industry has taken multiple hits in recent years, notably the COVID pandemic in 2020 and the Hollywood strikes in 2023. Production has failed to return to pre-pandemic levels since\u00a0experiencing a 22% drop in the first quarter of 2025 from 2024 levels.",
      "Last year, Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass proposed an increase in California's annual film tax credit\u00a0from $330 million to $750 million.",
      "Mr. Trump spoke about Newsom and many other topics when questioned by reporters during an Oval Office meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday. A day earlier, during a meeting with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and others to announce that the NFL draft would be held in Washington in 2027, the president also talked about Newsom and Hollywood.",
      "He said the American film industry has been \"decimated\" by other countries and the \"grossly incompetent\" Newsom, which he said caused the film industry to \"abandon\" the U.S. But he vowed that \"we'll get it back.\" He said he'll be meeting with some film industry executives to \"make sure they're happy with\" the prospective tariffs.",
      "The president referred to the California High-Speed Rail\u00a0project, which would run between San Francisco and Los Angeles.",
      "\"A little train going from San Francisco to Los Angeles that's being run by Gavin Newscum, the governor of California. Ever heard of Gavin Newscum?\" Mr. Trump said. \"That train is the worst cost overrun thing I've ever seen. ... It's hundreds of billions for a stupid project that should've never been built.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did have some brief but kind words for Newsom in the midst of his barrage.",
      "\"And Gavin, you know, I always like Gavin, had a good relationship with him,\" he said.",
      "He also touched on the January wild fires, claiming that he gave water to California.",
      "\"I just got him a lot of water. I sent in people to open up that water, because he refused to do it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If they would have had that water and if they would have done what I said to do, they wouldn't have had the fires in Los Angeles, those fires would have been put out very quickly,\"",
      "The president visited Los Angeles in late-January with the first lady, weeks after two massive fires devastated opposite ends of Los Angeles County. He was greeted by Newsom when he landed at the airport.",
      "\"I don't think you can realize how rough it is, how devastating is until you see it,\" Mr. Trump said at the time. \"I mean, I saw a lot of bad things on television, but the extent of it, the side of it, we flew over it in a helicopter. We flew to a few of the areas, and it is devastation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's comments ended with a challenge for the Golden State's governor.",
      "\"I'd love him to run for president on the other side. I'd love to see that, but I don't think he's going to be running because that one project alone, well, that and the fires and a lot of other things pretty much put him out of the race,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Top advisers have sent President Trump a plan to create a government-run investment fund, a request the president made earlier this year \u2014 but the White House has rejected parts of the proposal, CBS News has learned.",
      "Mr. Trump asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to jointly develop a proposal for a U.S. sovereign wealth fund by early May.",
      "It has been submitted, multiple sources told CBS News on Wednesday. However, the White House had concerns about the approach taken by Treasury, one of the sources said.",
      "Details on the mechanics of the fund continue to be debated, and no announcement is imminent, one source said.",
      "\"In accordance with President Trump's executive order, the Treasury and Commerce Departments have formulated plans for a Sovereign Wealth Fund, but no final decisions have yet been made,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"The Administration remains committed to using every tool available to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard America's national and economic security.\"",
      "A Treasury spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "Trump has teased a \"very big announcement\" before he leaves for the Middle East next week, but it's unrelated to the proposed sovereign wealth fund, two sources said. \"It's going to be a truly earth-shattering and positive development for this country and for the people of this country,\" he said in the Oval Office on Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump has not determined how proceeds from the sovereign wealth fund would be spent, sources said. In the past, he has suggested the fund could own a stake in TikTok, the popular social media platform that faces a U.S. ban unless China-based parent company ByteDance divests from it.",
      "Sovereign wealth funds typically invest assets from a country's natural resources with an aim to make returns that would provide a public windfall. Some of the best-known funds are financed by revenue from gas or oil, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Norway's sovereign wealth fund. These funds can help insulate countries from swings in the value of natural resources, provide funds for government expenditures and allow future generations to benefit from current oil and gas revenue.",
      "In February, Mr. Trump issued an executive order that directed the Treasury and Commerce secretaries, in close coordination with the National Economic Council's Kevin Hassett, to draft a plan for the sovereign wealth fund within 90 days.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-maha-food-box-replace-csfp-low-income-seniors/",
    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 17:31:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has a new plan to get \"healthy\" food to low-income seniors, but an anti-hunger advocate fears many will miss out.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's proposed budget for next year could include big changes for a small food aid program that helps low-income senior citizens supplement their diets. Under the plan, funding for the program \u2014 called the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) \u2014 would be cut, and seniors instead would receive what the Trump administration is calling \"MAHA food boxes\" filled with products sourced directly from farmers.",
      "The food boxes \u2014 whose name stems from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s pledge to \"Make America Healthy Again\" \u2014 could eventually also be rolled out to either \"supplant or complement current USDA programs,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The agency didn't disclose what other government programs could integrate use of the MAHA food boxes.",
      "The USDA administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, more commonly known as food stamps. The agency also oversees other food aid programs such as Women, Infants and Children, which is aimed at pregnant women and kids, as well as the National School Lunch program.",
      "\"Unlike the current approach using food banks, which provide those in need with shelf-stable foods that are high in sodium and other harmful ingredients, MAHA boxes would be filled with commodities sourced from domestic farmers and given directly to American households,\" the Trump budget proposal notes.",
      "The CSFP helps about 730,000 low-income seniors annually through its $389 million budget, according to the USDA. By comparison, the food-stamp program spent about $100 billion last year to provide assistance to 41 million Americans, according to the USDA.",
      "\"We have no details\"",
      "The CSFP is essential for low-income seniors who are struggling to put food on the table, said George Matysik, executive director of Share Food Program, a nonprofit\u00a0in Philadelphia. He expressed concern about the Trump administration's plans to replace the CSFP with food boxes, noting the logistical complexity of getting perishable food from farmers directly to older Americans.",
      "Another question is whether the foods included in the food boxes would meet the needs of seniors who often need shelf-stable foods because many struggle to get to the store, Matysik said.",
      "\"What we do know is that the program that we currently have is working, and seniors have come to rely on us,\" he said. \"We have no details [about logistics of the MAHA food boxes], and this has been a continued challenge that we've had with this administration, where decisions are sort of made overnight.\"",
      "Share Food Program relies on $4.5 million in CSFP funding to provide 32-pound food boxes to more than 7,000 seniors in the Philadelphia region who earn less than roughly $23,000 per year. Matysik disagreed with the Trump administration's claims that the program provides unhealthy foods to seniors, noting the boxes typically contain products such as canned vegetables, lean proteins and pastas.",
      "\"For seniors, a lot of times it can be hard to make it out to the grocery store \u2014 it can be hard to get those core items that folks need,\" he added. \"What we do at Share Food Program is take it directly to the doorstep of about 4,500 seniors, so not only are we providing that nutrition, but we're making it easy on the seniors.\"",
      "The Trump budget proposal represents a wish list for the current administration, and it isn't certain that funding for the CSFP would be cut.",
      "But the plan comes amid a larger push by the Trump administration to reduce spending on similar programs, such as a decision in March to cut two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks and instead have them source food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "The Kennedy effect",
      "The MAHA food boxes would provide a twofold benefit, the USDA said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"MAHA boxes would be more wholesome foods, and similar to the Farmers to Families Food Box, fresh foods,\" the agency said. It added that \"the most obvious\" benefit would be \"the removal of administrative middlemen from the distribution of food.\"",
      "The Farmers to Families Food Box, a pandemic food program that ran from May 2020 to May 2021, relied on more than 200 contractors to deliver millions of boxes to needy families, according to a 2021 analysis from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The study found that the 21 biggest contractors were collectively awarded $3 billion to deliver the boxes.",
      "MAHA, meanwhile, is part of a push by Kennedy to promote natural foods and alternative medicines. As head of HHS, he's pressing the food industry to stop using\u00a0synthetic food dyes\u00a0and has pledged to remove processed foods from school lunches.",
      "The USDA has signaled its openness to the MAHA platform, with Secretary Brooke Rollins saying she plans to approve a plan from Arkansas to ban the use of food stamps for purchasing sodas and candy. Anti-hunger advocates have said such restrictions can be stigmatizing for low-income Americans.",
      "In the meantime, Matysik said he's worried about the future of the CSFP program and the seniors who rely on it.",
      "\"Our seniors in particular are already hurting,\" he said. \"We're hearing about cuts to the SNAP program. We're seeing about cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. We're really worried about our senior citizens in this funding environment from our federal government right now.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats are rebelling against a crypto regulation bill, putting the first-of-its-kind legislation in jeopardy ahead of a possible key vote on it later this week.",
      "The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but has since bled Democratic support amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency.",
      "The bill passed through the committee weeks before the announcement earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. The deal involves the firm buying $2 billion worth of a stablecoin offered by World Liberty Financial, and using it to invest in crypto exchange Binance.",
      "The news set off alarm bells for Democrats, who are now pushing for legislation that bans elected officials and their families from buying or selling crypto assets, including stablecoins.",
      "Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told his members that they should not commit to voting for the GENIUS Act as a way to leverage changes, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Talks between Republicans and Democrats about potential changes are ongoing.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has signaled openness to modifications, but told reporters Tuesday \"we need to start moving forward.\" A procedural vote is expected Thursday, despite the opposition, and needs at least 60 votes.",
      "Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said the stablecoin bill advanced out of the committee with the caveat that improvements would be made before it was brought up for a floor vote. But Republicans moved ahead without addressing Democrats' concerns on provisions involving anti-money laundering, national security and consumer protections, Gallego said.",
      "\"I think the purpose of that was really to put Democrats in a bad position and try to force us to vote for it,\" Gallego told MeidasTouch in an interview posted Wednesday.",
      "\"You can't try to f*** us and then say, hey, deal with it,\" Gallego added. \"That's just not going to work, especially when you still need our votes.\"",

      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has circulated a fact sheet to all Senate Democrats laying out how she says the stablecoin bill falls short on safeguarding against corruption, as well as protecting consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "The fact sheet's lead recommendation is for elected officials and their families to be barred from owning, buying, selling or otherwise participating in stablecoin business ventures.",
      "\"Congress is writing laws that will sharply increase or decrease the value of stablecoin businesses, and the public should know that no one is making decisions to further their own financial interests, including the President of the United States. The current version of the GENIUS Act contains no such restrictions,\" it says.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Warren said, \"Democrats who both support and oppose the GENIUS Act agree that green lighting Donald Trump's corrupt stablecoin deals is wrong. We need to make sure we fix this in the bill, or else the GENIUS Act will simply facilitate Trump's crypto corruption.\"",
      "The request aligns with a separate bill introduced by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon on Tuesday. The bill, titled the End Crypto Corruption Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior officials in the Executive Branch and their immediate families from financially benefiting from crypto assets.",
      "\"Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,\" Merkley said in a statement. \"This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let's end this corruption immediately.\"",
      "The bill is cosponsored by 10 other Democrats, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, who were the original cosponsors of the GENIUS Act.",
      "On Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, will hold a roundtable with crypto experts to highlight the GENIUS Act's \"serious risks\" to the U.S. economy.",
      "The Trump family's venture into crypto products has increased their wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a recent report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole.",
      "The president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth \u2014 or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, which launched in October 2024.",
      "In response to the criticism, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News in a statement that Mr. Trump's \"assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest.\"",
      "\"Stablecoin legislation should be passed on a bipartisan basis. President Trump is dedicated to making America the crypto capital of the world and revolutionizing our digital financial technology,\" she said.",

Its blue stickers on appliances, inform shoppers that those products meet energy efficiency standards set by the EPA.

    "story": [
      "After nearly 20 years of delays, the Real ID deadline is finally here. Beginning May 7, Americans planning to travel domestically are required to use the enhanced form of identification. The Transportation Security Administration said it will no longer accept IDs that don't comply with Real ID requirements.",
      "The TSA said it's seeing about 81% compliance at airport checkpoints, meaning roughly four out of five travelers are showing up with a Real ID-compliant driver's license or\u00a0another valid form of identification.",
      "If you still need to update your ID, you're not alone.\u00a0CBS News data shows that dozens of states are behind on compliance. You can still travel without a Real ID, but will need to bring another acceptable form of identification, as outlined by the TSA.",
      "Here's what you need to know as the Real ID requirements takes effect on Wednesday.",
      "What is a Real ID?",
      "The Real ID is a federally compliant license, learner permit or nondriver ID card issued by state driver's license agencies. You can tell if a state-issued license or ID card is a Real ID if it has a black or gold star in the upper right corner.",
      "The symbol might look slightly different depending on the state from where it's issued: California, for example, puts its star symbol inside a golden bear.",
      "Who needs a Real ID?",
      "Real or Enhanced IDs are required for those over 18 who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification, unless they want to bring a valid U.S. passport.",
      "When will I need to use a Real ID?",
      "Americans will need to show Real IDs to access certain federal facilities \u2014 including TSA checkpoints \u2014 enter nuclear power plants and board commercial aircraft, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).",
      "Am I required to get a Real ID?",
      "Real or Enhanced IDs are only required for those over 18 without a valid U.S. passport who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification.",
      "That's said, Real IDs are considered a more secure form of identification than a classic driver's license.",
      "The requirement for Real IDs was established by Congress in 2005, following the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that the Federal Government \"set standards for the issuance of sources of identification, such as driver's licenses,\" according to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The deadline for implementation has been delayed several times, although some states started issuing Real IDs as far back as 2009.",
      "You can find more details on Real ID on the DHS' website.",
      "Can I use an Enhanced ID instead of a Real ID?",
      "Five states \u2014 Washington, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Vermont \u2014 issue what is called an\u00a0Enhanced Driver's License\u00a0(EDL), or Enhanced ID. This is considered an acceptable alternative to a Real ID card.",
      "Whereas Real IDs have a star emblem, Enhanced IDs have an image of the U.S. flag in the top right corner or the word \"Enhanced\" at the top of the card.",
      "Both Real IDs and Enhanced IDs are federal documents that allow holders to fly domestically.",
      "Enhanced IDs also allow you to travel from the U.S. to Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean through a land or sea port of entry, without a passport \u2014 something you can't do with a regular Real ID.",
      "How much does a Real ID cost?",
      "Prices vary by state. In\u00a0New York, for example, there is no additional fee for a Real ID beyond the normal transactional cost you pay for a standard license, ID or renewal. Pennsylvania, however, charges a \"one-time $30 Real ID fee\" on top of standard renewal fees. New York charges an additional $30 fee for Enhanced IDs.",
      "It's best to check your state's Real ID guidelines for an accurate estimate of how much you'll pay. The same goes for Enhanced IDs.",
      "How do I get a Real ID? Can I apply for one online?",
      "Each state has a driver's licensing agency that issues Real IDs. To find out how to apply where you live, visit the DHS website and click on your state of residence for specific instructions. DHS recommends that you visit your state's driver's licensing agency website to find out exactly what documentation you'll need to brings in order to obtain a Real ID.",
      "Be sure to plan ahead as some states have longer wait times for DMV appointments.",
      "What if I am planning to travel this week but I don't have a Real ID yet?",
      "A TSA spokesperson told CBS News Philadelphia that if travelers show up to the airport next Wednesday without a Real ID they may still be able to fly, but getting on board the plane may take longer than usual. The transportation agency recommends that people without a Real ID arrive at the airport three hours early to ensure enough time to get through security.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's plan to trim the IRS workforce has resulted in almost one-third of its tax auditors leaving the agency through March, according to a report from the U.S. Treasury Department's watchdog.",
      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has sought to trim the federal workforce through a combination of layoffs and so-called deferred resignation. Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla,\u00a0said\u00a0on the electric vehicle maker's April 22 earnings call that DOGE's efforts \"in addressing waste and fraud\" will \"get the country back on track.\"",
      "The IRS has been a focus of DOGE's cost-cutting efforts, with plans to trim as much as 40% of its workforce this year. Through March, those efforts have resulted in the tax agency losing about 11% of its workforce, the May 2 report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found.",
      "But revenue agents \u2014 the IRS workers who perform audits \u2014 have seen a much bigger hit, with 31% of those workers, or about 3,600 auditors, taking either the deferred resignation plan or getting fired in the first three months of 2025, the report found. Losing a large share of auditors could impact the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue, given that these agents typically handle cases involving wealthy taxpayers or corporations, experts say.",
      "\"You lose the very staff trained to keep high-end taxpayers and corporate tax payers in compliance,\" noted Emily DiVito, senior adviser on economic policy at the left-leaning Groundwork Collaborative and a former policy adviser at the U.S. Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS.",
      "She added, \"You can see some behavioral effects when taxpayers, especially those that really don't want to pay their bills, come to accept there is very little risk to not paying at all, or even filing.\"",
      "Reached for comment, a Treasury spokeswoman said, \"The Biden Administration grew the IRS from 79,431 to 102,309 personnel. Under new leadership, approximately the same number of employees have left the IRS, with a vast majority leaving voluntarily through the Deferred Resignation Program. The roll back of wasteful Biden-era hiring surges, and consolidation of critical support functions are vital to improve both efficiency and quality of service. The Secretary is committed to ensuring that efficiency is realized while providing the collections, privacy, and customer service the American people deserve.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately return a request for comment about the TIGTA report.",
      "While the TIGTA report didn't explain why auditor departures outpaced that of overall cuts at the IRS, the tax agency had made an effort under the Biden administration to hire more auditors in order to beef up revenue collection. In February 2024, the IRS had said it expected to collect hundreds of billions in additional taxes after using funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to hire more auditors.",
      "Because the DOGE cuts have focused on firing so-called \"probationary workers,\" or junior federal employees who typically have less than a year or two on the job, there may have been more newly hired auditors who were impacted by the reductions, DeVito said.",
      "Reducing federal revenue?",
      "Auditing wealthy Americans and corporations can be lucrative for the federal government. In fiscal year 2023, auditors recommended an additional $32 billion in tax assessments, the TIGTA report said.",
      "And every $1 spent on auditing the top 0.1% of earners can return about $26 in tax revenue, according to an analysis from Better IRS, an advocacy group for free tax filing.",
      "The cuts to the IRS' auditing force raises questions about the effectiveness of DOGE's efforts, given that the tax agency is responsible for collecting the bulk of the nation's revenue, DeVito added.",
      "The combination of individual and corporate income taxes provides about 60 cents for every $1 in federal revenue, with the remaining 40 cents coming from payroll taxes and fees, such as paying admission to national parks, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "DOGE's cost-cutting efforts may end up costing almost as much as they've saved, according to an analysis last month from the nonpartisan research group the Partnership for Public Service.",
      "DOGE claims to have saved $165 billion, but the Partnership for Public Service estimates that the savings have come at a cost of $135 billion due to paid leave, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers and lost productivity. That figure also excludes the impact of multiple lawsuits filed against DOGE's actions, as well as lost tax revenue due to IRS cuts, the group said.",
      "The IRS could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, according to an\u00a0estimate\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "\"The argument from DOGE is to save money \u2014 that if we don't have as big of a federal workforce, then we are saving the government money,\" DeVito said. But given the potential to lose out on tax revenue, the IRS reduction \"simply doesn't make sense,\" she said.",

      "\"China is not paying these tariffs,\" Arnold said. \"We have an account with U.S. customs where they automatically deduct once a month, the import duty, from our account. And so, it's not only import duty, but these tariffs are deducted.\"",
      "The company cancelled its new orders from China for April, and it doesn't have any plans to place new orders in May.",

      "\"We had already shifted some of our business, almost half our business, to several of the countries on that list,\" Kamler   said. \"And we're getting out of China and now we're still getting slammed. It's just completely unfair.\"",

      "\"I can't even calculate that high,\" Kamler   said about what he thinks a bike would cost to produce here. \"I'll just tell you one quick story. There was a company that came to us a couple years ago. They wanted to make handlebars for us. Now we used to make our own handlebar for about a dollar-and- a-half, and we saved some money by buying it from Asia. And this company took three months to give me the quotation for a simple BMX handlebar. And the price came back at $12. I said, '$12? It's about 80 cents of steel. How could you be?' 'Well, there's a lot of work.' And I said, 'OK, thank you, you can lose my number.' So, you can take that (as) kind of (an) example\u2026I mean, a $100-bicycle here would be a $1,000 if all the parts were made here right now.\"",

      "In a social media post Tuesday night, the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. confirmed the Switzerland meeting, writing that China \"has decided to agree to engage with the\u00a0#US\u00a0side.\"",

      "\"The world has been coming to the U.S., and China has been the missing piece,\" Bessent said on Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle.\"",
      "Hours before the U.S.-China meetings were announced, Bessent told lawmakers in a hearing that the U.S. had \"not engaged in negotiations\" with China yet.",

    "published": "Tue, 06 May 2025 19:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Many investments Mr. Trump claims credit for predate his return to office or are based on vague future pledges. Here's a fact check of his claims.",
    "story": [
      "After President Trump was pressed on rising consumer prices and slowing economic growth, he defended his tariff policies by claiming they had spurred record investment in the United States.",
      "\"I think we probably have close to $9 trillion of investments coming into this country,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview on\u00a0NBC's Meet the Press that aired Sunday. \"If you look at other presidents, there's never been anything like that.\"",
      "He has also repeatedly claimed that he secured more investment in his first two months than President Biden did in four years.",
      "Neither claim is supported by evidence, CBS News Confirmed found. While companies have announced hundreds of billions of dollars in planned investments since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, the White House has not provided data showing the total approaches $9 trillion.",
      "Additionally, a CBS News review found that some investments highlighted by the White House were announced before Mr. Trump's reelection. The comparison to the Biden administration is also misleading: the president is citing future investments pledges, while contrasting them with a narrower list of projects that were in the works or completed by the end of his predecessor's term.",
      "Here's a breakdown of the claims.",
      "Some investments Trump claims credit for were announced under Biden",
      "The White House on April 29 said Mr. Trump had secured $5 trillion of U.S. investment in his first 100 days, and published a partial list titled \"The Trump Effect\" \u2014 which it said demonstrated \"his America First economic policies have sparked trillions of dollars in new investment.\"",
      "That list totals closer to $2 trillion from private companies, and around $5 trillion if commitments from foreign countries are included. The basis for the president's $9 trillion claim is unclear and the administration has not explained the discrepancy.",
      "A closer look at the White House list also shows some of the investments had been announced before Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The list initially included a $4.1 billion commitment from Novelis, a Georgia-based aluminum company, to build a plant in southern Alabama. But construction for that project began in October 2022 and the $4.1 billion total investment was detailed in the company's February 2024 financial report. CBS News asked the White House on May 5 why the project was included; the administration did not answer the question, but by midday May 6 the project had been removed from the website.",
      "The Trump administration also claimed credit for a $1.5 billion pledge by Corning to invest in its solar products facility in Michigan. A company spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that $900 million of this funding was announced months before Mr. Trump assumed office. On April 29, Corning announced an additional $600 million investment, bringing the total to $1.5 billion.",
      "Likewise, the White House listed Johnson & Johnson's commitment to spend $55 billion over the next four years, but a company spokesperson confirmed that total includes a $2 billion investment \u2014 announced last October \u2014 in a facility in Wilson, North Carolina.",
      "The list also includes the Stargate Project, a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative announced by Open AI and Japan-based Softbank on Jan. 21, which had been in development for at least a year before Mr. Trump's inauguration. The companies said $100 billion would be deployed \"immediately,\" but offered few specifics on how or where the money would be spent.",
      "Comparing to investments under Biden",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he attracted more investment in two months than Biden did in four years, suggesting he brought in trillions in a matter of weeks while casting doubt that the former president secured even $1 trillion during his term.",
      "But there's no clear evidence to support his claim. A White House spokesperson said the president was referring to a December 2024 report from the Biden White House, which said the private sector committed at least $1 trillion to clean energy and manufacturing projects during Biden's term.",
      "However, Biden's list of investments highlighted \"a selection of private-sector investments in 21st century industries\" including green energy, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals, based on project announcements in specific locations or factories under construction. The data on Biden's \"Investing in America\" spreadsheet also showed projects that closely resemble some on Mr. Trump's list.",
      "By comparison, the Trump administration's list includes broader, less specific investment pledges across a variety of industries \u2014 many without clear timelines or locations.",
      "For example, Mr. Trump's list highlights Apple's recent $500 billion pledge to U.S. manufacturing and training. However, as previously reported by The Washington Post, Apple also announced a $430 billion investment early in Biden's term, including a North Carolina engineering hub that was paused in 2024, and the Biden administration's report does not include any Apple investments in its tally.",
      "However, experts caution that announcements about planned investments don't guarantee action.",
      "\"Companies often will make announcements to essentially curry favor with an incoming administration to show how committed they are to the United States,\" said Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S. \"It's not unusual whether it was President Trump or President Biden or President Obama.\"",
      "Presidents from both parties have claimed credit for projects started under their predecessors. For instance, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced investments during Mr. Trump's first term, some of which contributed to the construction of manufacturing facilities highlighted by the Biden White House investment report.",
      "During his term, Biden signed major pieces of legislation, including the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which included $24 billion in tax credits to attract private investors in hopes of driving domestic manufacturing commitments.",
      "Such incentives may continue to fuel further projects during Mr. Trump's term, according to Nigro, provided they remain in place \u2014 but the long-term impact of federal policy, including under both Biden and Mr. Trump, may take years to assess.",
      "\"It's very hard to attach these new investments that have been announced as being tied directly to policies of the Trump administration. It's frankly just too early,\" Nigro said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has been pushing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, writing on social media last month that the central bank has been \"TOO LATE AND WRONG\" in holding off on further reductions. Now, the Fed is set to meet on Wednesday to make its next rate decision \u2014 but Mr. Trump may need to wait longer to get his cuts.",
      "The Federal Reserve is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady at its May 7 meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch. The group pegs the likelihood at 97% that the Fed will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the same level that it's been at since December, when the central bank made its most recent reduction.",
      "The Fed's meeting comes at a time when the U.S. economy is sending mixed signals, with GDP unexpectedly falling into negative territory in the first quarter, while job growth topped forecasts in April. At the same time, Wall Street economists are hiking their recession risk\u00a0for the U.S. economy due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have hit imports from China with a 145% import duty \u2014 costs that are largely passed onto American consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "The Fed has signaled it will take a wait-and-see approach, with Powell saying at a speech last month that the central bank can stay patient while tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out.",
      "\"The Fed and investors find themselves in a no man's land waiting to see whether economic policies drive prices higher and growth lower,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X, in an email.",
      "He added, \"The reality is that corporate earnings have been pretty strong, the U.S. economy barreling along and the biggest cause for concern is sentiment. There isn't a good reason to change rates at this point, and the Fed is likely to reiterate the need for more data with three rate cuts priced in for 2025, at this point starting in the summer.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Fed's next meeting.",
      "What date is the Fed's next meeting?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-member group that sets rate decisions, will meet on May 6-7, with the Fed announcing the FOMC's decision on May 7.",
      "What time is the Fed rate announcement?",
      "The Fed will announce the rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on May 7, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to discuss the committee's decision at a press conference at 2:30 p.m. EST that day.",
      "What are the odds of a Fed rate cut?",
      "Very slim, with economists projecting 97% odds that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "\"Criticism from President Trump will not trigger a Fed policy response \u2014 neither an early cut without evidence of labor market deterioration, nor a stubborn refusal to cut once the labor market does soften, provided long-term inflation expectations remain anchored,\" noted Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius in a May 6 research note.",
      "When is the Fed expected to cut rates?",
      "Consumers eager for relief on borrowing costs are likely going to face a wait, according to economists.",
      "Following the May 7 meeting, the Fed will next meet on June 18, with economists currently expecting the central bank to also hold steady then, according to CME FedWatch. Its polling finds a 70% likelihood that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at 4.25% to 4.5% at that meeting.",
      "However, it's more likely the Fed could slash rates at its July 30 meeting, with the probability of a rate cut sitting currently at 80%, FedWatch notes.",
      "But some economists expect the central bank to hold off even longer.",
      "\"We think the Federal Reserve will aggressively cut interest rates next year, as tariff-induced inflation begins to fade and the labor market shows more troubling signs,\" noted Oxford Economics Chief U.S. Economist Ryan Sweet, who says he believes the first cut will occur in December.",
      "Why does Trump want a rate cut now?",
      "Mr. Trump argues that inflation has steadily cooled and high borrowing costs are no longer needed to restrain price increases. The Fed sharply ramped up its short-term rate in 2022 and 2023 as pandemic-era inflation spiked.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social that there is \"NO INFLATION\" and claimed that grocery and egg prices have fallen, and that gas has dropped to $1.98 a gallon.",
      "But those claims are not entirely true: Grocery prices have jumped 0.5% in two of the past three months and are up 2.4% from a year ago. Gas and oil prices have declined \u2014 gas costs are down 10% from a year ago \u2014 continuing a longer-running trend that has continued in part because of fears the economy will weaken. Still, AAA says gas prices nationwide average $3.18 a gallon.",
      "What does the Fed's decision mean for your money?",
      "Borrowers who are looking for relief on loan and credit card rates will have a wait ahead of them, experts say.",
      "\"There's just so much uncertainty in the economy now,\" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst for LendingTree, in an email. \"No one quite knows what the next few months will look like, but what does seem clear is that Americans are going to have wait at least a little longer for the Fed to cut rates.\"",
      "Schulz predicts that credit card rates could tick higher in the next few months, as well as auto loan rates.",
      "\"Banks are nervous about all of the uncertainty in the economy and what it means for consumers,\" he noted. \"When that happens, banks try to minimize risk as much as possible, and one of the ways they do that is to raise interest rates on credit cards.\"",
      "Because of that, consumers should focus on shopping around for the best rates they can find, as well as considering transferring existing high-interest credit card debt to 0% balance transfer cards, Schulz added.",

      "Grand Theft Auto 6 has dropped a surprise second trailer just days after Rockstar Games said it's\u00a0pushing back the game's much-anticipated release until May 2026.",
      "The second trailer provides more details about the game's storyline, which involves its first-ever female protagonist, Lucia. The roughly 3-minute clip shows her partner, Jason, as he meets her when she's released from prison. The two are shown engaging in some criminal activities, such as holding up a business while wearing masks and carrying weapons.",
      "\"Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them,\" states Rockstar's description for the second trailer. \"But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida \u2014 forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.\"",
      "The game, known as GTA to fans, had originally been slated for a 2025 release, but Rockstar said last week that it would push that back to May 26, 2026.",
      "Fans have already been waiting more than a decade for a new title, with the most recent version of the game, GTA 5, released in 2013. With GTA 5 having sold more than 200 million copies, expectations are high for GTA 6, with Wedbush Securities forecasting sales of $6.35 billion in sales for fiscal year 2026.",
      "GTA 6's main characters",
      "The second trailer, which was released about 17 months after the game's first trailer, introduces more of the backstory between its main characters, Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos.",
      "Jason is described as growing up \"around grifters and crooks,\" but after some time in the Army, he moved to the Keys to work for local drug runners. Lucia, meanwhile, ended up in the Leonida Penitentiary after \"fighting for her family,\" the website says.",
      "Other characters include Cal Hampton, a friend of Jason's, and Boobie Ike, who has used his street smarts to build a business empire including \"real estate, a strip club and a recording studio,\" the site says.",

    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 05:00:19 -0400",
    "summary": "In recent weeks, Social Security has been plagued by problems related to technology, system errors, and even the marking of living people as dead.",
    "story": [
      "Rennie Glasgow, who has served 15 years at the Social Security Administration, is seeing something new on the job: dead people.",
      "They're not really dead, of course. In four instances over the past few weeks, he told KFF Health News, his Schenectady, New York, office has seen people come in for whom \"there is no information on the record, just that they are dead.\" So employees have to \"resurrect\" them \u2014 affirm that they're living, so they can receive their benefits.",
      "Revivals were \"sporadic\" before, and there's been an uptick in such cases across upstate New York, said Glasgow. He is also an official with the American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represented 42,000 Social Security employees just before the start of President Trump's second term.",
      "Martin O'Malley, who led the Social Security Administration toward the end of the Biden administration, said in an interview that he had heard similar stories during a recent town hall in Racine, Wisconsin. \"In that room of 200 people, two people raised their hands and said they each had a friend who was wrongly marked as deceased when they're very much alive,\" he said.",
      "It's more than just an inconvenience, because other institutions rely on Social Security numbers to do business, Glasgow said. Being declared dead \"impacts their bank account. This impacts their insurance. This impacts their ability to work. This impacts their ability to get anything done in society.\"",
      "\"They are terminating people's financial lives,\" O'Malley said.",
      "Though it's just one of the things advocates and lawyers worry about, these erroneous deaths come after a pair of initiatives from new leadership at the SSA to alter or update its databases of the living and the dead.",
      "Holders of millions of Social Security numbers have been marked as deceased. Separately, according to The Washington Post and The New York Times, thousands of numbers belonging to immigrants have been purged, cutting them off from banks and commerce, in an effort to encourage these people to \"self-deport.\"",
      "Glasgow said SSA employees received an agency email in April about the purge, instructing them how to resurrect beneficiaries wrongly marked dead. \"Why don't you just do due diligence to make sure what you're doing in the first place is correct?\" he said.",
      "The incorrectly marked deaths are just a piece of the Trump administration's crash program purporting to root out fraud, modernize technology, and secure the program's future.",
      "But KFF Health News' interviews with more than a dozen beneficiaries, advocates, lawyers, current and former employees, and lawmakers suggest the overhaul is making the agency worse at its primary job: sending checks to seniors, orphans, widows, and those with disabilities.",
      "Philadelphian Lisa Seda, who has cancer, has been struggling for weeks to sort out her 24-year-old niece's difficulties with Social Security's disability insurance program. There are two problems: first, trying to change her niece's address; second, trying to figure out why the program is deducting roughly $400 a month for Medicare premiums, when her disability lawyer \u2014 whose firm has a policy against speaking on the record \u2014 believes they could be zero.",
      "Since March, sometimes Social Security has direct-deposited payments to her niece's bank account and other times mailed checks to her old address. Attempting to sort that out has been a morass of long phone calls on hold and in-person trips seeking an appointment.",
      "Before 2025, getting the agency to process changes was usually straightforward, her lawyer said. Not anymore.",
      "The need is dire. If the agency halts the niece's disability payments, \"then she will be homeless,\" Seda recalled telling an agency employee. \"I don't know if I'm going to survive this cancer or not, but there is nobody else to help her.\"",
      "Some of the problems are technological. According to whistleblower information provided to Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, the agency's efforts to process certain data have been failing more frequently. When that happens, \"it can delay or even stop payments to Social Security recipients,\" the committee recently told the agency's inspector general.",
      "While tech experts and former Social Security officials warn about the potential for a complete system crash, day-to-day decay can be an insidious and serious problem, said Kathleen Romig, formerly of the Social Security Administration and its advisory board and currently the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Beneficiaries could struggle to get appointments or the money they're owed, she said.",
      "For its more than 70 million beneficiaries nationwide, Social Security is crucial. More than a third of recipients said they wouldn't be able to afford necessities if the checks stopped coming, according to a January survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance.",
      "Advocates and lawyers say lately Social Security is failing to deliver, to a degree that's nearly unprecedented in their experience.",
      "Carolyn Villers, executive director of the Massachusetts Senior Action Council, said two of her members' March payments were several days late. \"For one member that meant not being able to pay rent on time,\" she said. \"The delayed payment is not something I've heard in the last 20 years.\"",
      "When KFF Health News presented the agency with questions, Social Security officials passed them off to the White House. White House spokesperson Elizabeth Huston referred to Mr. Trump's \"resounding mandate\" to make government more efficient.",
      "\"He has promised to protect social security, and every recipient will continue to receive their benefits,\" Huston said in an email. She did not provide specific, on-the-record responses to questions.",
      "Complaints about missed payments are mushrooming. The Arizona attorney general's office had received approximately 40 complaints related to delayed or disrupted payments by early April, spokesperson Richie Taylor told KFF Health News.",
      "A Connecticut agency assisting people on Medicare said complaints related to Social Security \u2014 which often helps administer payments and enroll patients in the government insurance program primarily for those over age 65 \u2014 had nearly doubled in March compared with last year.",
      "Lawyers representing beneficiaries say that, while the historically underfunded agency has always had its share of errors and inefficiencies, it's getting worse as experienced employees have been let go.",
      "\"We're seeing more mistakes being made,\" said James Ratchford, a lawyer in West Virginia with 17 years' experience representing Social Security beneficiaries. \"We're seeing more things get dropped.\"",
      "What gets dropped, sometimes, are records of basic transactions. Kim Beavers of Independence, Missouri, tried to complete a periodic ritual in February: filling out a disability update form saying she remains unable to work. But her scheduled payments in March and April didn't show.",
      "She got an in-person appointment to untangle the problem \u2014 only to be told there was no record of her submission, despite her showing printouts of the relevant documents to the agency representative. Beavers has a new appointment scheduled for May, she said.",
      "Social Security employees frequently cite missing records to explain their inability to solve problems when they meet with lawyers and beneficiaries. A disability lawyer whose firm's policy does not allow them to be named had a particularly puzzling case: One client, a longtime Social Security disability recipient, had her benefits reassessed. After winning on appeal, the lawyer went back to the agency to have the payments restored \u2014 the recipient had been going without since February. But there was nothing there.",
      "\"To be told they've never been paid benefits before is just chaos, right? Unconditional chaos,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Researchers and lawyers say they have a suspicion about what's behind the problems at Social Security: the Elon Musk-led effort to revamp the agency.",
      "Some 7,000 SSA employees have reportedly been let go; O'Malley has estimated that 3,000 more would leave the agency. \"As the workloads go up, the demoralization becomes deeper, and people burn out and leave,\" he predicted in an April hearing held by House Democrats. \"It's going to mean that if you go to a field office, you're going to see a heck of a lot more empty, closed windows.\"",
      "The departures have hit the agency's regional payment centers hard. These centers help process and adjudicate some cases. It's the type of behind-the-scenes work in which \"the problems surface first,\" Romig said. But if the staff doesn't have enough time, \"those things languish.\"",
      "Languishing can mean, in some cases, getting dropped by important programs like Medicare. Social Security often automatically deducts premiums, or otherwise administers payments, for the health program.",
      "Lately, Melanie Lambert, a senior advocate at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, has seen an increasing number of cases in which the agency determines beneficiaries owe money to Medicare. The cash is sent to the payment centers, she said. And the checks \"just sit there.\"",
      "Beneficiaries lose Medicare, and \"those terminations also tend to happen sooner than they should, based on Social Security's own rules,\" putting people into a bureaucratic maze, Lambert said.",
      "Employees' technology is more often on the fritz. \"There's issues every single day with our system. Every day, at a certain time, our system would go down automatically,\" said Glasgow, of Social Security's Schenectady office. Those problems began in mid-March, he said.",
      "The new problems leave Glasgow suspecting the worst. \"It's more work for less bodies, which will eventually hype up the inefficiency of our job and make us, make the agency, look as though it's underperforming, and then a closer step to the privatization of the agency,\" he said.",

      "\"I am pleased to announce that Judge Jeanine Pirro will be appointed interim United States Attorney for the District of Columbia,\" Trump wrote. \"Jeanine is incredibly well qualified for this position, and is considered one of the Top District Attorneys in the History of the State of New York. She is in a class by herself.\"",
      "Pirro, a former judge and district attorney for Westchester County in New York, takes the helm of one of the largest federal prosecutor's offices in the country. It's been two decades she has held a position in law enforcement.",
      "She ran for the Republican nomination for a Senate seat in New York in 2006, but ended her bid to run for attorney general in the state instead, which she ended up losing to Democrat Andrew Cuomo.",
      "Pirro went on to host her own show on Fox News and was a co-host of \"The Five\" when Mr. Trump announced her appointment.",
      "False statements she repeated about voter fraud in the 2020 election, which Mr. Trump lost to former President Joe Biden, were part of a lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems against the cable news giant. Fox settled the case and acknowledged that \"certain claims\" that the network aired were false.",
      "Pirro's friendship with Mr. Trump stretches back decades, and she has been a staunch defender of the president amid the numerous investigations that have plagued his political career.",
      "In the final hours of Mr. Trump's first term, the president pardoned Pirro's ex-husband, Albert Pirro, who was convicted of tax evasion and conspiracy while his wife was district attorney.",
      "In a statement, a Fox spokesperson praised Pirro for her contributions to the network.",
      "\"Jeanine Pirro has been a wonderful addition to The Five over the last three years and a longtime beloved host across FOX News Media who contributed greatly to our success throughout her 14-year tenure. We wish her all the best in her new role in Washington,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Mr. Trump said he was \"disappointed\" about withdrawing Martin's nomination, but recognized that \"it would be hard\" to get him confirmed after he lost the support of at least one Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said his opposition to Martin, a \"Stop the Steal\" activist who defended Jan. 6 rioters, was related to the Capitol riot.",
      "Martin could only serve as the interim pick until May 20, when his 120-day term expired.",
      "Mr. Trump said later Thursday that Martin would take on a new role at the Justice Department, focusing on the alleged \"weaponization\" of the government during the Biden administration and pardons.",

      "Former President Joe Biden said Thursday he takes some responsibility for President Trump's election victory last year, but broadly defended his record and his late departure from the campaign.",
      "In an interview with \"The View,\" the former president was asked if he takes any responsibility for \"not hearing\" voters' concerns on immigration or inflation, or for Mr. Trump's 2024 win over former Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "\"Yes, I do,\" Biden said. \"Because look, I was in charge and he won, so I take responsibility.\"",
      "Biden went on to defend his record in office, blaming Mr. Trump for tanking a bipartisan border security bill\u00a0last year. The former president conceded he should have done more to \"advertise\" his agenda, including accomplishments that he said could bear results years after he left office.",
      "Biden says he could've defeated Trump \u2014 and wasn't surprised by Harris' loss",
      "The former president said he thinks he could have beaten Mr. Trump if he had remained in the race \u2014 comments he's made in prior interviews.",
      "But Biden said he wasn't surprised that Harris lost.",
      "\"Not because I didn't think the vice president was the most qualified person to be president,\" but because her opponents \"went \u2026 the sexist route,\" he said. Biden also blamed the \"phenomenal negative impact\" of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The former president said he remains in touch with Harris and that \"she's got a difficult decision to make about what she's going to do,\" likely referring to another possible run for office. Biden said he hopes Harris \"stays engaged,\" but \"we have a lot of really good candidates as well.\"",
      "Biden defends his record",
      "Throughout the interview on Thursday, Biden pushed back on criticism over his handling of the 2024 election, including his late exit from the race after a rocky debate with Mr. Trump\u00a0supercharged concerns about Biden's age.",
      "Biden said the \"only reason I got out of the race was because I didn't want to have a divided Democratic party.\"",
      "He denied allegations that his cognitive abilities had faded in office, saying, \"there's nothing to sustain that\" and arguing he accomplished a lot in the final months of his term. Biden conceded that he had a \"bad, bad night\" during his debate with Mr. Trump, but argued polls still only showed him trailing Mr. Trump by single digits.",
      "He also pushed back on reporting that after dropping out of the race, he privately urged Harris not to break with him. The former president said he \"did not advise her\" to say in an October appearance on \"The View\" she couldn't think of any differences between her and Biden, and claimed the line \u2014 which was heavily used in Trump campaign ads \u2014 was misinterpreted.",
      "Biden lashes out against Trump",
      "Biden was also critical of Mr. Trump, saying \"he's had the worst 100 days any president's ever had\" and blasted Mr. Trump's foreign policy views \u2014 echoing some of Biden's criticism in an interview with the BBC that aired Wednesday. When asked why Mr. Trump remains \"fixated\" on him, Biden said, \"I beat him,\" referring to Biden's 2020 election victory.",

    "summary": "A three-judge panel permanently blocked Alabama from using a state-drawn map that they said flouted their directive to draw a plan that was fair to Black voters.",
    "story": [
      "Federal judges ruled Thursday that Alabama intentionally diluted the voting strength of Black residents when it drew congressional lines, and said the state must continue using a court-ordered map that led to the election of the state's second Black congressman.",
      "A three-judge panel permanently blocked Alabama from using a state-drawn map that they said flouted their directive to draw a plan that was fair to Black voters. The decision was not a surprise because the panel ruled against the state twice previously and put a new map in place for last year's elections.",
      "The judges said that the map drawn by the Alabama Legislature in 2023 violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, just like the one previously drawn by the state.",
      "\"The long and short of it is that the 2023 Plan unlawfully dilutes Black voting strength by consigning it to one majority-Black district,\" the judges wrote, adding that Alabama should have a second district with a substantial percentage of Black voters.",
      "The judges chided what it called Alabama's \"deliberate decision to ignore\" their order to draw a second district where Black voters had an opportunity to elect a candidate of their choosing. \"The Legislature knew what federal law required and purposefully refused to provide it, in a strategic attempt to checkmate the injunction that ordered it,\" they wrote.",
      "The Thursday ruling came after a February trial over the state map.",
      "\"Today's decision is a testament to the persistence and resilience of Black voters in Alabama, including our clients,\" said Deuel Ross, deputy director of litigation at the Legal Defense Fund. \"Alabama's unprecedented defiance of the Supreme Court and the lower court orders harkens back to the darkest days of American history.\"",
      "In the Supreme Court's June 2023 decision in Allen v. Milligan, the 5-4 court declined to further weaken the landmark law, and instead affirmed a lower court opinion that found it substantially likely that Alabama's map violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The decision had come as a surprise as the high court has weakened the Voting Rights Act in recent years, first in 2013 and then in 2021.",
      "Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall's office did not immediately issue a comment on the decision. The state is expected to appeal.",
      "Judges scheduled a hearing on plaintiffs' request to again make Alabama subject to the preclearance requirement of the Voting Rights Act.",
      "The long-running case began in 2021. Black voters and civil rights groups sued over Alabama's congressional map. Black residents account for about 27% of the state's population but were the majority in just one of the state's seven congressional districts. The lawsuits accused Alabama of packing Black voters into a single majority-Black district and splintering other Black communities to limit their influence elsewhere.",
      "A panel made up of three federal judges said\u00a0in September 2023 that Alabama should have two districts where Black voters have an opportunity to elect their preferred candidates. Because of racially polarized voting in the state, that map would need to include a second district where Black voters are the majority or \"something quite close,\" the judges wrote.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 May 2025 17:21:13 -0400",
    "summary": "A recent dip in overdose deaths\u200b has been credited in part to wider naloxone access.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has proposed cutting a $56 million grant that teaches first responders how to use the lifesaving overdose reversal drug naloxone, which experts say could reverse progress the United States has made in lowering opioid overdose deaths.",
      "A recent dip in\u00a0overdose deaths has been credited in part to wider naloxone access. The medication was made\u00a0available for over-the-counter purchase in 2023 and is\u00a0standard for first responders to carry. It's even popped up\u00a0in some classrooms.",
      "Naloxone, also sold under the brand name Narcan, is available in injectable and nasal spray form. It is an opioid antagonist that attaches to receptors in the brain, reversing and blocking the effects of other opioids, including fentanyl.",
      "The grant money can be used by state and local organizations for training people on how to use naloxone, as well as administering and distributing the medication. Grantees are expected to establish protocols to refer patients to treatment or support services and provide other safety information about illicit drugs and overdoses. The grant is administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",
      "\"While some skeptics may think that naloxone - and harm reduction more generally - enable people, there is decades of research that show giving people the information and tools they need helps keep people safe,\" medical anthropologist Jennifer Syvertsen said in an emailed statement. \"Naloxone simply enables people to breathe.\"",
      "Wider cuts could \"dismantle essential services\"",
      "The proposed cut comes as the Trump administration proposes cutting $33.3 billion from the Health and Human Services budget in 2026,\u00a0according to the Associated Press. The cuts would eliminate SAMHSA, the AP\u00a0reported in March.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who referenced his\u00a0history of heroin addiction\u00a0during his confirmation hearings, has proposed that the administration be absorbed into a new office. HHS has also\u00a0faced mass layoffs.",
      "These combined cuts could \"dismantle essential services,\" Hanna Sharif-Kazemi, the federal policy manager for the Drug Policy Alliance, told CBS News. The DPA is a non-profit agency based in New York City that seeks to reduce overdose deaths with harm reduction and evidence-based methodology.",
      "\"We believe it's going to exacerbate the overdose crisis at a time when nearly 90,000 people died from overdoses last year,\" Sharif-Kazemi said.",
      "The loss of federal funding, Sharif-Kazemi said, can exacerbate the budget issues that state and local agencies already face.",
      "\"Without federal funding, states may be forced to reduce essential services in other sectors, like health care, education and public safety, or they would fail to compensate for the loss in overdose prevention funding, which would put more lives at risk,\" Sharif-Kazemi said. \"Those cuts to overdose prevention programs are going to undermine proven strategies that we know save lives.\"",
      "How can the federal government support overdose prevention efforts?",
      "During his second term, Mr. Trump has focused on fentanyl entering the United States. He has enacted tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico with the goal of making the countries fight fentanyl trafficking. Little fentanyl enters the U.S. over the northern border. Precursor chemicals, or the ingredients for fentanyl and other illicit drugs, are largely manufactured in China and shipped overseas, usually to Mexico. The fentanyl is then produced, typically in Mexico, and brought to the United States for distribution.",
      "Sharif-Kazemi said the best way to build on the progress made in reducing overdose deaths is to continue and even expand federal funding for overdose prevention efforts. That could include expanded access to naloxone, she said, as well as better access to medication-assisted treatment, which Trump has previously pushed for, and the expansion of rehabilitation facilities. It could also include more funding for harm reduction strategies, like testing strips that allow people to check if drugs are contaminated with fentanyl.",
      "Recent years have also seen a push for overdose prevention centers, where people who use drugs can do so under the supervision of trained medical professionals. Those medical professionals can then monitor the drug users, and administer naloxone or other medications if necessary. OnPoint NYC operates two such sites in New York City. The organization said in January\u00a0that its staff have reversed over 1,700 opioid overdoses since November 2021.",
      "\"We know the 90,000 people that we lost to overdose last year were denied the care and support they needed,\" Sharif-Kazemi said. \"These are all tools that we know actually can save people's lives. Ultimately, if the Trump administration was really worried about making sure that people entered recovery, we need to make sure they stay alive and are able to actually enter recovery.\"",

      "President Trump announced Thursday that his administration wants to replace the technology at thousands of air traffic control sites across the country and build six new coordination centers. Mr. Trump called into a news conference that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy was holding to unveil the plan for a new air traffic control system.",
      "\"After decades of originally \u2014 and we're taking about a long time ago \u2014 reliable service, air traffic control is long overdue for, not an overhaul really, for a remaking,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's got to be brought up to a modern standard.\"",
      "The president also said he was confident that the current system remains \"extremely safe\" ahead of the summer travel season.",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration wanted to replace the technology at more than 4,600 air traffic control sites and build six new air traffic coordination centers. Officials said the plan also called for buying 25,000 new radios, replacing over 600 radars and installing 4,000 new high-speed network connections.",
      "A coalition of aviation industry groups said that the plan required a minimum of about $30 billion. Last week, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee passed a proposal that would spend $12.5 billion on improving the air traffic control system. The aviation coalition said Thursday that at least $18.5 billion in additional emergency funding would need to be spent on improvements over three years. Duffy told reporters the final number would be up to Congress, which is currently controlled by Republicans.",
      "\"It's going to be billions, lots of billions,\" said Duffy, who was a congressman representing Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019.",
      "Duffy also said the administration believes implementing the plan would take up to four years.",
      "The proposals come months after January's deadly midair collision between an Army helicopter and a commercial airliner over Washington, D.C., which is under investigation. Duffy was asked if the proposals could have prevented the collision.",
      "\"This is different,\" Duffy said. \"It could have had an impact in saving lives \u2026 We had 85 near-misses at DCA (Reagan National Airport), and I think all the airline CEOs would tell you, all of industry would tell you this was dangerous, and we should have seen that it was going to cost lives if we don't stop cross-traffic in the D.C. area. Now it's my job to say, what other risks do I see?\"",
      "The announcement comes as Newark Liberty International Airport  in New Jersey continues to deal with disruptions following an outage last week. Air traffic controllers directing flights into Newark lost communications and their screens went blank for about 90 seconds on April 28.",
      "\"We don't have a radar, so I don't know where you are,\" one controller was heard saying on a recorded transmission.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said the outage lasted about 30 seconds, and it took another 30-60 seconds for planes to reappear on controllers' screens.",
      "Duffy spoke about the outage during Thursday's event, saying that the main communication line went down and a backup line didn't switch on. He said the incident was an example for why the system needs to be modernized.",
      "\"If we don't actually accomplish the mission that we're announcing today, you will see Newarks not just in Newark, you'll see Newarks in other parts of the country because it's an aging system,\" Duffy said.",
      "Several controllers went on trauma leave in the wake of the outage, which appears to at least in part be due to a fried copper wire. There have also been more than 4,000 delays and over 1,000 cancellations in and out of Newark.",
      "In an interview before Duffy's announcement, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian told CBS News he fully supports upgrading the air traffic control system.",
      "\"I'm not saying that the working conditions are acceptable, and I think that the controllers do an amazing job in terms of managing,\" Bastian said in an interview for \"CBS Sunday Morning.\"",
      "Bastian said it's safe to get on an airplane, but he also said the air traffic control system can't operate in its current form for much longer.",

Many of the details shared in the files were already known.",
      "The documents also include a 2012 letter by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urging the Obama administration to reopen a probe into his father's death.",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the documents \"have been sitting in various storage facilities across the federal government for decades and had never been digitized or accessible to the public before.\" They were digitized by ODNI \u2014 which is led by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard \u2014 and posted on the National Archives website.",

      "A staffer at a gun range told FBI agents that on June 4, 1968, the day before the shooting, he encountered a man he later identified from a photo as Sirhan.

      "A few of those records make reference to common conspiracy theories about the assassination, including mentions of witnesses seeing a woman in a polka-dot dress or somebody shouting \"we shot him.\" Other witnesses said they didn't see anybody matching that description.",

He was 24 years old when he was arrested shortly after the shooting. Sirhan has\u00a0admitted\u00a0to killing the senator at various points, sometimes claiming it was due to the senator's support for Israel, though at other times, Sirhan has said he is innocent or said he couldn't remember the incident.",
      "Sirhan has been incarcerated in California for decades, and multiple requests for parole have been unsuccessful. The state's parole board\u00a0endorsed his 2021 bid for parole, but California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0rejected the request.",

They often cite conflicting eyewitness testimonies or the alleged presence of extra bullets \u2014 though many others have backed the view that Sirhan acted alone.",
      "One of the skeptics is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was 14 years old when his father was assassinated. He has\u00a0argued\u00a0Sirhan wasn't responsible for the killing, and met with him in prison before backing his 2021 request for parole.",

      "Approximately half of the AmeriCorps programs terminated in a controversial decision by the Trump Administration are projects that serve states and communities President Trump won in the 2024 election, according to a review of the list of terminated AmeriCorps grant programs.",
      "CBS News has obtained the list of more than 1,000 Americorps grant programs terminated in recent weeks by the Administration.",
      "The wide-ranging list includes a child abuse prevention organization in Missouri, tutors for children in rural Alaska, a group that provides life-saving flood relief in West Virginia and an organization that has helped provide nearly 1 million volunteer service hours in Michigan.",
      "Some of the impacted groups told CBS News the Trump administration's halting of some funding for AmeriCorps projects threatens the future of help in some of America's most impoverished counties and rural areas, many of which voted overwhelmingly for Trump last year.",
      "AmeriCorps is the federal agency that helps support and launch national service projects and volunteerism.\u00a0 It began in the 1960s as an offshoot of the Peace Corps and evolved in the decades since as a critical provider of funding and support to build new infrastructure in needy areas, assist with disaster relief, offer services to senior citizens, rural and inner-city health programs and education services in low socio-economic communities and cities.",
      "Some of the organizations that have had their funding abruptly stripped by the Trump administration said the termination of grant money has caused \"damage and chaos\" and have \"upended\" the lives of participants who have been contributing to community assistance projects.",
      "In a new lawsuit filed by some of the impacted organizations, the groups argue AmeriCorps' full-time staff is also at risk of being decimated.\u00a0 The suit said the organizations \"have nearly all found themselves placed on administrative leave and given layoff notices stating they will be terminated from employment effective June 24.\"",
      "The list of impacted programs obtained by CBS News shows more than 100 grants have been cut in the states with the highest poverty levels:\u00a0 Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Kentucky, West Virginia, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Alabama.",
      "The cuts include funding for a child abuse prevention program in Independence, Missouri and several more in California.",
      "A $345,000 food pantry grant has been cut in Alexandria, Louisiana.\u00a0 A similar amount was cancelled for a rural health project in the small farm community of Lake Village, Arkansas.",
      "CBS News has learned the reductions will impact programs that have served nearly 10,000 people in Alaska this year, including education services for children.",
      "Katie Abbott, executive director of the Serve Alaska State Service Commission, told CBS News that \"students in Sitka schools will lose their tutors and classroom support. Kids in Ouzinkie will lose their dance and culture coach.\"",
      "She continued that some \"high school seniors will no longer be able to serve as AmeriCorps members in schools in order to explore and learn workforce skills and future careers.\"",
      "In Portsmouth, Ohio, Shawnee State University will lose funding for its program to support teacher education and early literacy.\u00a0 A university spokesperson told CBS News that they had received notification last week that it has been terminated and will not continue.\tThe terminated grant program at Shawnee State was for nearly $756,000.",
      "In Detroit, grant money for Americorps \"urban safety\" projects was also cancelled.\tThe projects, which were coordinated with the assistance of Wayne State University included the boarding-up of vacant homes and clearing of vacant lots to improve public safety and reduce crime threats.",
      "In a statement, Ramona Washington, the director of Wayne State University's Urban Safety Program, said the termination of $1.3 million in funding \"halted vital outreach and community support efforts carried out by WSU faculty, staff, students, and AmeriCorps members.\"",
      "\"Our students, who serve as AmeriCorps members, have helped lead community-engaged research and service-learning initiatives that improve urban public safety and public health. Without this support, the progress we've made in building safer, healthier neighborhoods is at serious risk,\" Washington said.",
      "A Wayne State University spokesperson told CBS News the organization's Americorps activities also included \"outreach in Detroit Police Precincts to connect with victims of domestic violence and assist with navigating the process of personal protection orders.\"",
      "The cuts also include money for a Boys and Girls Club program in West Palm Beach, Florida, which is home to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, according to the list obtained by CBS News from a source familiar with the cuts.",
      "The High Rocks Educational Corporation in Lewisburg, West Virginia also lost AmeriCorps funding. An organization spokeswoman told CBS News the cuts could have a dramatic impact on its ability to help young people opportunities in the state and could exacerbate the declining youth population in the Mountain State.",
      "The organization was also vital in helping Greenbrier County respond to and recover from the calamitous flooding in White Sulpher Springs in 2016.\tThe list obtained by CBS News showed High Rocks was receiving a $1.4 million dollar grant through an AmeriCorps program. West Virginia has some of the neediest communities and highest per capita usage of AmeriCorps programs and funds, according to multiple sources.",
      "There have been at least two lawsuits filed over the terminations. A handful of impacted organizations and nonprofits have filed a federal civil lawsuit in Maryland seeking a court order to halt the dismantling of AmeriCorps.",
      "One of the organizations that filed the suit, the Red Cloud Indian School in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, said it had received funding for 26 years to help respond to a \"critical teacher shortage\" in one of the nation's poorest regions. CBS News has learned the program was receiving a $395,621 grant.",
      "In the civil lawsuit, some of the grant recipients argue, \"These sweeping actions have forced the early dismissal of participants, halted ongoing projects at organizations across the country, and jeopardized critical support for communities nationwide, with particularly severe impacts on rural areas where AmeriCorps programs have traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support.\"",
      "Nearly two dozen state attorneys general, including Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown, have also filed a separate federal lawsuit to avert the cutting of AmeriCorps.",
      "According to published reports, a White House spokeswoman defended the reductions at AmeriCorps, saying last week that \"AmeriCorps has failed eight consecutive audits and is entrusted with over $1 billion in taxpayer dollars every year. It is a target-rich environment for President Trump's agenda to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse.\"",
      "AmeriCorps administrators did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the list of programs cut.",
      "Rep. Gwen Moore, a Wisconsin Democrat, told CBS News, \"Our communities will directly be impacted by this Administration's mass layoffs because these needs won't go away. I know the value of AmeriCorps firsthand, and I have led my fellow AmeriCorps colleagues in a letter to President Trump, calling for him to reverse their mass layoffs and protect this workforce to ensure they can continue serving our districts.\"",

      "The Trump administration previously sought to implement the \"most favored nation\" idea during Mr. Trump's first term, tying some high-cost Medicare drugs administered by health care providers to \"the lowest price that drug manufacturers receive in other countries.\"",
      "Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday that in the coming days, he'd reveal \"a truly earth-shattering and positive development for this country and for the people of this country.\"",
      "\"The President will make a big and historic announcement on Monday. Until then, everyone can keep guessing!,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Court orders sought by the drug industry and others blocked the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from implementing the proposal in Mr. Trump's first term, saying that the government failed to go through the proper rulemaking steps to create and implement the policy, which was finalized in late 2020.",
      "\"While there's nothing unlawful per se about rushing to enact policy in the final days of a presidential administration (indeed, it's a time-honored tradition), executive branch officials may not circumvent clear legal requirements in the eleventh hour to achieve goals they couldn't accomplish in the normal course,\" a federal judge in California ruled in 2020.",
      "The Biden administration abandoned the proposal in 2022, blaming court orders blocking the model and concerns raised by stakeholders, including fears that it could cut off some Medicare beneficiaries from drugs and strain providers.",
      "Mr. Trump's Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hinted at the possibility of the policy returning on Tuesday, pointing to higher prices in Europe for the blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic. The drug is also used for weight loss under a different brand name, Wegovy.",
      "\"Right now the big impediment is really price. And we're negotiating that with the drug companies and seeing if we can at least launch some pilot programs, or if we can get the price low enough, we can make it available at government cost to everybody,\" he said in an interview with Newsmax.",
      "Kennedy defended a decision by the Trump administration last month not to cover weight loss drugs in Medicare and Medicaid, scrapping a proposal touted by the Biden administration. The Trump administration is continuing to negotiate the cost of Ozempic in Medicare under talks launched by the Biden administration, but only for its uses to treat diabetes and other health conditions.",
      "While drugs like Ozempic are \"miracle drugs in many ways,\" Kennedy warned that their cost was prohibitively expensive.",
      "\"If we made that so that Medicaid, Medicare paid for it, and that private insurance companies had to pay for it, we would double the cost of health insurance to most employers in this country. And that would really be destructive,\" he said.",

      "REP. MIKE TURNER: Thanks for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I have a lot of national security topics to get to you, but at the heart of so much is America's economic strength, and so I want to ask you about what President Trump said this week about the cost, the impact of his China tariffs on the supply of goods in the United States. Take a listen.",
      "[START SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Somebody said, oh, the shelves are going to be open.",
      "Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know. And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.",
      "[END SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do your constituents back in Ohio, really want to hear the message that they need fewer Christmas presents this year. I mean he's acknowledging less supply, higher prices.",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I think there's going to be a lot that has to be- be shaken out here. And we certainly are seeing, I think, some reaction now in China also. That means that, you know, the President's goal is that these nations, that of which he's putting tariffs on the table, and tariffs which are a punishment for having behaved poorly taken advantage of the United States economically, will come to the table and negotiate better economic deals than the United States has been experiencing. Those- those deals are beginning to be offered. The White House is beginning to negotiate those. China is beginning to signal that they're willing to come to the table. So even though the President is making those statements at the same time, we're seeing that the President taking that step of saying we want a better economic deal is beginning to work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in the meantime, China said it may restrict exports of materials used by General Dynamics, which makes tanks, including in your state of Ohio.* Are you concerned that the trade war won't just impact people's purchasing of toys, but preparedness, tanks and military readiness?",
      "REP. TURNER: I think we're all concerned of the effects on the supply chain, and certainly we've got to make certain that this works through the entire processes, and that we are concerned of the effects of the economy. I think the President is going to be looking at that. Congress is going to be looking at that. But the real concern here is- is that we do have to look long term as to how this protects our overall economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Beijing has not yet launched those talks. We'll be watching for them if they do get underway. Let's get to the other news of the week, the reshuffling at the top of the national security apparatus. It has long been clear there are divides within the Administration on certain topics. Iran is one of them. Russia is another one of them. Mike Waltz, who you served with, viewed as a traditional Republican hawk. I say this because when he was on this program previously, he laid out in pretty clear terms that the US goal in these negotiations with Iran are dismantlement of its nuclear program. Not limits on enrichment, not verification. But those are the things that the envoy negotiating with Iran have said. We're seeing policy differences from within the President's own administration here. Has Congress been given details on what the goal is and what the plan is?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I mean, the goal is simply stated that we do not have a nuclear Iran, and certainly the President is leaning strongly in that from his first term with the maximum pressure campaign, the President was clear that both in non-nuclear Iran and also making certain that we have that the nefarious activities of Iran working through their proxies, the terrorist groups and organizations that that be stopped. So the President is very strong on an anti-Iran policy, including ensuring that there not be a nuclear Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the things that his envoy have described sound a lot like that, 2015 nuclear deal negotiated under President Obama with limits on enrichment, for example, and things like that. I know in the past, you voted for legislation that would give Congress more oversight over a deal with Iran. Do you expect President Trump to bring any kind of deal he brokers to Congress for approval?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I think we have to see what the deal is. I mean, currently there's just ongoing negotiations. We'll have to see how that evolves. Let's see what those terms are--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- You don't want--",
      "REP. TURNER: -- and really--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- any kind of review regardless?",
      "REP. TURNER: I mean, as it evolves, we'll have to see what those terms are and what in- and really what you know, what is achieved, and certainly there's a role for Congress to play as that goes forward. But I think we need to give them the opportunity for success.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Israeli Prime Minister issued a statement yesterday denying that he personally was talking to Mike Waltz about bombing Iran- military action against Iran. Of course, we know his aides could have those conversations. Is it appropriate work for the National Security Advisor to the President to be coordinating with Israel about military action against Iran, or was Mike Waltz possibly in the wrong here?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, first off, we don't know specifically that was occurring, but at the same time the National Security Council- the function of the National Security Council is to ensure that the President of United States has the greatest information possible. And Mike Waltz is, you know, has an incredible background and experience. He worked diligently to make certain he had a strong role in the national security team of the president. And I'm certainly glad that he's going to be retained and staying in a strong role in this administration, working directly with- with world leaders and heads of state is certainly an important role of- as the National Security Advisor to the President. Certainly, I think even as you and Ambassador, he'll continue to do that type of function.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it in the national security interest, though, to have the Secretary of State who also has, at least on paper, three other jobs now in this role, and for how long? I mean you're saying how important it is.",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I mean, it's certainly, certainly we know, certainly we know. You know, Henry Kissinger has has been in that position before--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Even he said that it was untenable. But he was in lockstep with his president.",
      "REP. TURNER: I think what's also very important here is that- that Marco Rubio, you know, from a policy perspective, is very strong in this administration. His signal of being, of it, being in this position, sends a signal of continuing the same policies in the administration. From a Trump team policy perspective, you know, him taking over this sends a signal of continuation and strength. That's excellent--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But the policy--",
      "REP. TURNER: -- Now, we've got to give- now we've got to give him the opportunity of, is he going to be able to build out the team in the National Security Council, and that certainly hope, hopefully, that- that he'll be able to do so and build up a strong team there that represents, really the opportunity to support President Trump and giving him the- the information and knowledge and the access to information and knowledge that he needs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a diplomatic way of saying there shouldn't be loyalty tests to the President. You want actual experts staffing the National Security Council. You don't want Laura Loomer, a far-right activist, making decisions on personnel.",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, at the same time, there does have to be loyalty to the President--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Of course--",
      "REP. TURNER: -- I mean, we saw in the President's first term--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- but also to the Constitution--",
      "REP. TURNER:-- that the President was betrayed during the first Trump impeachment by individuals who were at the National Security Council. So, Trump personally has an understanding that you have to have people in the National Security Council that are on Trump's team and the National Security Council being directly working with him and being in the White House, it's very, very important that they be personnel that work for and on behalf of the President.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are talking about national security council members who testified under oath that the President was withholding aid to Ukraine during the first administration for a political--",
      "REP. TURNER: And was shown to have wrongly being testified because I was part of that- that panel and they- they- their testimony was proven not to be accurate, that the President was not tying aid to Ukraine to- to the investigation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The premise of the impeachment. But your point is that looms large in the President's memory and interaction with the National Security Council now.",
      "REP. TURNER: The President needs to make certain that he has staff that are supportive of him in the National Security Council and his policies and make certain that they're providing him information. This is the heart of what does the President know that our adversaries are doing. When he's dealing with Russia, and what and policies with respect to Ukraine, he needs to know what Vladimir Putin is doing, and that's coming directly from the National Security Council.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Noted. The White House budget was released Friday. It is not the trillion dollar promise the President campaigned on. Susan Collins on Appropriations, Roger Wicker in the Senate Armed Services Committee says this is not adequate. And in fact, he said the intention is to shred to the bone our military capabilities and support to service members. Do you share your Republican senators' concerns?",
      "REP. TURNER: I think there's more work that can be done on the National Security portion of the President's budget.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You would like to see more defense spending that the White House is putting forward. I think there's",
      "REP. TURNER: I think there's going to be more debate, and I think there's more opportunity for increased investment. We really need to do more in the national security space. There are adversaries that we have that want to do America harm, and we need to be strong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Congressman Turner, thank you for joining us.",

      "\"Stablecoin legislation should be passed on a bipartisan basis. President Trump is dedicated to making America the crypto capital of the world and revolutionizing our digital financial technology,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader John Thune urged Senate Democrats to vote in favor of moving forward with the legislation earlier Thursday, stressing on the Senate floor that this is the sixth version of the legislation, drafted with inputs from both Republicans and Democrats. He said if senators want to further modify the bill, they should vote to move forward with the legislation.",
      "\"Once we're on the bill, we can discuss changes here on the floor,\" Thune said. \"We've had an open process here on this bill so far, so why stop now.\"",
      "The South Dakota Republican lauded the GENIUS Act, saying it provides \"clarity\" for innovators amid efforts to make the U.S. a leader on financial innovations and stablecoins, calling it the \"first step\" in bringing digital assets into the U.S. financial system \"by setting a clear framework for stablecoins.\" He noted it's \"by no means the last word on digital assets,\" adding that he \"expects the Senate to continue to work in this space.\"",
      "Ahead of the vote Thursday, Senate Democrats had aimed to push it back, seeking more time review the legislation. Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, requested unanimous consent to move the vote to Monday, combining it with another vote at that time. But the request was voted down.",
      "Thune, who changed his vote to no in a move that allows Senate Republicans to bring the legislation up again, criticized the opposition by Democrats following the vote, saying, \"I don't know what Democrats would change about the process this bill has gone through.\"",
      "\"Democrats have been accommodated every step of the way,\" he said, adding, \"frankly, I just don't get it.\"",

    "summary": "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in March that she would be revoking the legal status of migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to clear the way for it to end a program that allowed more than 500,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans to temporarily live and work in the United States.",
      "The request for emergency relief arose from a case challenging Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision to revoke a grant of parole that had been extended by the Biden administration to migrants from the four countries through a special parole program. The 532,000 people who were temporarily protected from deportation through the program, known as CHNV, were set to lose their legal status April 24.",
      "A federal district court judge halted the secretary's March notice, finding that the Immigration and Nationality Act did not give Noem the discretion to terminate parole en masse for the 532,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans. Instead, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani ruled that there had to be individualized decisions to end parole.",
      "A federal appeals court declined to allow Noem to move forward with the termination of the CHNV program, and the Trump administration has now filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court.",
      "In its request, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said that the district court did not have jurisdiction to enter its order because federal immigration law leaves parole-termination decisions to the discretion of the Homeland Security secretary. Sauer said the district court lacked the authority to \"usurp the Executive Branch's control of foreign policy and immigration.\"",
      "\"In doing so, the district court engaged in the very review Congress prohibited \u2014 needlessly upending critical immigration policies that are carefully calibrated to deter illegal entry, vitiating core Executive Branch prerogatives, and undoing democratically approved policies that featured heavily in the November election,\" he wrote.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security created special parole programs for certain nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuelan in late 2022 and early 2023. The Biden administration had said that the policy promoted legal immigration and dissuaded migrants from crossing the southern border.",
      "Under the CHNV program, 532,000 migrants were allowed to enter the U.S. after securing a sponsorship from individuals based in the U.S. After entering the country, the migrants were granted parole and could then work legally in the U.S. for two years.",
      "But the parole program was paused when President Trump returned for his second term in the White House. The policy was part of several others implemented in an effort by the Trump administration to crack down on immigration. Many aspects of Mr. Trump's immigration agenda have been challenged in federal court and temporarily blocked.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in March that beneficiaries of the parole program had 30 days to leave the U.S. or face arrest and deportation.",
      "A group of 23 individuals and a nonprofit organization challenged the termination of the CHNV parole program and prevailed before the U.S. district court in stopping the administration from terminating their legal protections.",
      "The Trump administration has with increasing frequency been turning to the Supreme Court for emergency relief as more than 200 legal challenges arising from the president's policies are moving through the federal courts.",

    "summary": "President Trump said in remarks from the Oval Office that the two countries are \"affirming that reciprocity and fairness is an essential and vital principle.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday announced the broad terms of a trade deal with Britain, which could lower the burden of his sweeping tariffs and potentially deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "The president said in remarks from the Oval Office that the two countries are \"affirming that reciprocity and fairness is an essential and vital principle of international trade.\"",
      "The deal is the first rolled out in Mr. Trump's second term and comes as the president has used tariffs \u2014 and the threat of the levies \u2014 as leverage to bring other countries to the table to negotiate trade deals with his administration.",
      "Mr. Trump said the details of the agreement are still being finalized and expects it to be finished in the coming weeks. But he said it includes \"billions of dollars\" of increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market, including for American agricultural products like beef and ethanol.",
      "Britain will also \"reduce or eliminate\" non-tariff barriers that Mr. Trump said discriminate against U.S. products, and fast-track American imports through U.K. customs, the president announced.",
      "He called the agreement a \"great deal for both our countries\" and said it is opening up access to Britain for U.S. products.",
      "\"It's going to be something very special for the U.K. and special for the United States,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Delivering brief remarks by speakerphone, Starmer said the framework will boost trade between the U.S. and the U.K., protect and create jobs and open market access. Starmer called it a \"historic day\" that is a \"real tribute to the history that we have of working so closely together.\"",
      "The 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports, which was unveiled by the president last month as part of his \"Liberation Day\" announcement, remains in place. But under the plan, the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, and additional vehicles will face 25% rates, according to the White House.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the deal will raise $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. as a result of the 10% tariff on imports from the U.K. As part of the agreement, Rolls Royce engines will not be subject to tariffs, and a British airline will buy $10 billion in Boeing planes, the commerce secretary said.",
      "Mr. Trump had teased the announcement Wednesday, writing on social media that he would unveil a \"major trade deal\" with a \"big, highly respected country,\" which he did not identify at the time. On Thursday morning, the president posted on Truth Social that it \"should be a very big and exciting day for the United States of America and the United Kingdom.\"",
      "\"The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,\" he added. \"Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!\"",
      "A social media post from Mr. Trump said the framework will raise $5 billion in new export opportunities for American farmers, ranchers and producers, and strengthen national security for both the U.S. and the U.K.",
      "\"This deal shows that if you respect America, and bring serious proposals to the table, America is OPEN FOR BUSINESS,\" the post said, teasing that there are \"many more to come.\"",
      "Starmer's office said the prime minister would give an \"update\" about U.S. trade talks later in the day.",
      "\"As you know, talks with the U.S. have been ongoing and you'll hear more from me about that later today,\" Starmer said at a defense conference in London.",
      "Mr. Trump placed a 10% tax on imports from Britain, as well as 25% tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum on the premise that doing so would foster more factory jobs domestically.",
      "A major goal of British negotiators has been to reduce or lift the U.S. import tax on U.K. cars and steel. The U.S. is the largest destination for British cars, accounting for more than a quarter of U.K. auto exports in 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics.",
      "Britain has also sought tariff exemptions for pharmaceuticals, while the U.S. wants greater access to the British market for agriculture products. Starmer's government has said it won't lower U.K. food standards to allow in chlorine-rinsed American chicken or hormone-treated beef.",
      "If a deal is announced, the British government will see it as a vindication of Starmer's emollient approach to Mr. Trump, which has avoided direct confrontation or criticism. Unlike the European Union, Britain didn't announce retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to Mr. Trump's import taxes.",
      "A trade deal with the United Kingdom would be symbolically important and a relief for British exporters. But an agreement would do little to address Mr. Trump's core concern about persistent trade deficits that prompted him to impose import taxes on countries around the world.",
      "The U.S. ran a $11.9 billion trade surplus in goods with the U.K. last year, according to the Census Bureau. The $68 billion in goods that the U.S. imported from the U.K. last year accounted for just 2% of all goods imported into the country.",
      "The U.S. is much more important to the U.K. economy. It was Britain's biggest trading partner last year, according to government statistics, though the bulk of Britain's exports to the U.S. are services rather than goods.",
      "Mr. Trump has shown a desire to strike a trade agreement with the U.K. since it voted in 2016 to leave the European Union. Yet as recently as Tuesday, Mr. Trump showed no awareness of the possible terms of the deal when asked about its possibility.",
      "\"They're offering us concessions?\" Mr. Trump remarked to reporters. \"I hope so. ... They do want to make a deal very badly.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has previously said that his leverage in talks would be U.S. consumers, but he appeared to suggest that the U.K. would also start buying more American-made goods.",
      "\"I think that the United Kingdom, like every other country, they want to ... go shopping in the United States of America,\" he said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week that the administration is moving forward with \"all deliberate speed\" to reach agreements with 17 trading partners. He said he anticipates \"agreements in principle,\" and after they're reached, the administration \"will paper them over\" in the coming months.",
      "Mr. Trump said during his Oval Office remarks that there are \"numerous deals\" in the works. Bessent is set to travel to Switzerland on Thursday for a trip that will include a meeting with Chinese officials. The president said he is open to speaking with Chinese President Xi Jinping after the meeting.",
      "A trade deal with the U.S. is one of several that Starmer's government is seeking to reach. On Tuesday, Britain and India announced a trade after three years of negotiations. The U.K. is also trying to lift some of the barriers to trade with the European Union imposed when Britain left the bloc in 2020.",

    "summary": "The bill would codify the name change, though it would carry no authority outside the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday passed a bill to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the \"Gulf of America,\" which would codify an executive order signed by President Trump on his first day in office.",
      "In a 211 to 206 vote, all but one Republican supporting the measure, which was introduced by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia in January and instructs federal agencies to update all documents and maps to reflect the name change within six months of enactment. It now goes to the Senate.",
      "Even if the name change is codified into U.S. law, however, other countries would be under no obligation to refer to the Gulf of Mexico by the new name. If it isn't codified, a future president could reverse Mr. Trump's executive order.",
      "Greene lauded the measure ahead of the vote Thursday morning, calling it \"one of the most important things that we can do this Congress,\" while claiming that Democrats are catering to Mexican cartels by opposing the name change.",
      "\"This is such an important thing to do for the American people,\" Greene said. \"The American people deserve pride in their country and they deserve pride in the waters that we own, that we protect with our military and our coastguard.\"",
      "Democrats have called the effort a waste of taxpayer dollars and said Congress should be spending its time on more serious issues. GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska was the sole Republican to oppose the measure.",
      "Bacon publicly disagreed with his Republican colleagues, telling CNN earlier this week that the effort to rename the body of water \"seems juvenile.\"",
      "\"We're the United States of America,\" he said. \"We're not Kaiser Wilhelm's Germany or Napoleon's France. I just \u2014 we're better than this. It just sounds like a sophomore thing to do.\"",
      "The vote came as House Republicans clash over slashing Medicaid and other social safety net programs to pay for Mr. Trump's tax, border security and energy agenda.",
      "\"Instead of debating that very important and destructive legislation, they are speaking up today about this deeply unserious bill to rename a body of water,\" Rep. Jared Huffman, a California Democrat, said ahead of the vote Thursday. \"A Congress that more and more appears to just be a joke, is now advancing a bill that literally started off as a joke.\"",
      "An estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that it would cost less than $500,000 over five years to update federal documents and maps. But during a House Rules Committee meeting Monday to advance the measure, Democrats noted that schools, libraries and municipalities would bear the costs of updating textbooks, signs and other materials.",
      "\"If a school district can't afford to purchase an entirely new map, you know what? A sticker would do,\" said Rep. Michelle Fischbach, a Minnesota Republican, on Monday. \"Just put that over the top and put 'Gulf of America.' I mean, there are a lot of simple ways to deal with this.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the White House has dug in on the name change, restricting Associated Press reporters' access to events over the news organization's decision to refer to the Gulf by its original name, while also acknowledging the \"Gulf of America\" name. The Associated Press sued over the restrictions and a federal judge ruled that the White House restore its access to the Oval Office, Air Force One and other spaces and events when they are open to other reporters.",
      "Whether the Senate will take up the measure remains unclear. Unlike the House, the bill would require support from a number of Democrats to move forward in the upper chamber. And Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told CBS News ahead of the House vote that he hasn't \"thought that far ahead.\"",
      "\"We've got a lot of other stuff we've got directly in front of us at the moment,\" Thune added.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump will nominate Dr. Casey Means, an ally of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and prominent advocate for his agenda, to serve as the U.S. surgeon general, the president announced Wednesday.",
      "Means replaces Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, whose nomination was withdrawn\u00a0by the White House a day before she was scheduled to appear at a Senate confirmation hearing.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that Means \"has impeccable \"MAHA\" credentials\" \u2014 referring to the acronym for \"Make America Healthy Again,\" a slogan used by Kennedy.",
      "\"Her academic achievements, together with her life's work, are absolutely outstanding,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"Dr. Casey Means has the potential to be one of the finest Surgeon Generals in United States History.\"",
      "The surgeon general oversees 6,000 members of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, and helps set the national agenda on public health. The nominee must be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Who is Casey Means?",
      "Means was close to Kennedy during the campaign, along with her brother, Calley Means, who played a key role in orchestrating Kennedy's endorsement of Mr. Trump, according to some of Kennedy allies who played a role in the transition.",
      "Casey Means has\u00a0written about\u00a0how, after attending Stanford Medical School and training to become a surgeon, she opted to leave \"traditional medicine\" to devote her life to \"tackling the root cause of why Americans are sick.\"",
      "She co-founded Levels, a health app that can connect to glucose monitors, and has built a large following online for writing about health and wellness.",
      "Both Means siblings soared to prominence in recent years after viral interviews decrying the influence of the food and drug industry. Their views align with Kennedy's claims that unhealthy food and lifestyle choices underpin a vast swath of Americans' health conditions.",
      "\"Not only is our life expectancy declining, but our health during those years of life is poorer than ever due to preventable chronic diseases. Maybe we need to re-think our approach,\" she wrote in her newsletter. \"...This is the devil's bargain that drives our economy: we have a set of food, chemical, and agriculture industries that profit trillions per year from people consuming and using as much cheap, additive, chemical-filled food and products as possible, and we have a $4.5 trillion healthcare system that profits off of the resultant diseases that emerge.\"",
      "The two siblings authored the bestseller \"Good Energy\" after their mother died of pancreatic cancer, saying that she had been \"simply prescribed pills and not set on a path of curiosity about how these conditions are connected and how the root cause can be reversed.\"",
      "An interview the two did with Tucker Carlson \u2014 ranked by Apple as the most-shared podcast episode of 2024 \u2014 was titled \"The Truth About Ozempic, the Pill, and How Big Pharma Keeps You Sick.\"",
      "\"She's qualified. She's energetic. She's been a good communicator, which is the role of surgeon general. She seems to have good ethical moorings. And she reflects this new thinking about where HHS should be. I think it's a bold pick,\" Dr. Robert Malone, another close ally of Kennedy, told CBS News.",
      "Casey and Calley Means have also earned skepticism from some of Kennedy's anti-vaccine base, who have grown frustrated with what they fear has been Kennedy's drifting attention away from what they hoped would be a ban of several vaccines and towards a crackdown on unhealthy foods and additives like synthetic food dyes.",
      "\"The nutritional agenda is a core part of MAHA. It may not be their core part of MAHA. But there's no doubt that it's a central part of the overall mission,\" he said.",
      "Malone acknowledged the perception among some of Kennedy's base that Means had not been \"sufficiently vocal, early enough, in rejecting the mRNA vaccine products,\" as he had been.",
      "Malone himself rose to prominence criticizing the shots while painting himself as the inventor of mRNA vaccines, a claim that other scientists rejected as misinformation. He was with Kennedy and Mr. Trump in Florida on election night.",
      "Means has said she backs Kennedy \"relentlessly pushing for vaccine safety\" and said she thought it was \"criminal\" to require vaccinations. She has also claimed \"the current extreme and growing vaccine schedule\" could be \"causing health declines in vulnerable children. This needs to be investigated,\" she wrote on her website last year.",
      "Calley Means now serves as a special government employee, advising Kennedy and backing state bills promoting his agenda.",
      "Casey Means was initially favored as one contender for the surgeon general pick, some of Kennedy's allies said, but was passed over for Dr. Nesheiwat. Some of Kennedy's allies said they believed Nesheiwat's appearances on Fox News and ties to former national security adviser Mike Waltz, who is married to Nesheiwat's sister Julia, played a role in the president's decision.",
      "Nesheiwat's nomination was withdrawn Wednesday amid concerns about how she portrayed her credentials. For example, as\u00a0CBS News previously reported, she has publicly listed an M.D. from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine, but she actually got her medical degree from the American University of the Caribbean.",

      "The deportations, expected to be operated by the U.S. military, could start as early as this week, the officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal government plans.",
      "Libya is one of several far-flung nations the U.S. government has been asking to accept deportations of migrants from third countries, CBS News reported earlier this week.",
      "The possibility of U.S. deportations to Libya, reported earlier Tuesday by Reuters, is a stunning proposition given the deep political and social turmoil the North African country finds itself in, as well as its human rights record.",
      "Since a civil war erupted in 2011, Libya has been plagued by armed conflict and political tumult. The country, itself a corridor for desperate migrants hoping to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean Sea, is divided into two factions. The western part of the country is overseen by a United Nations-backed government in Tripoli, while the east is controlled by a strongman.",
      "The State Department has a Level 4 travel advisory for Libya, warning Americans not to travel there because of \"crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict.\"",
      "Libya has also gained infamy over its treatment of migrants seeking to reach Europe, with both advocates and U.S. officials finding that detainees in the North African country face brutal conditions, due process violations and even torture in immigration detention centers.",
      "It's unclear who exactly would be deported to Libya under the plans being considered by the Trump administration and whether they would be detained by authorities there upon arrival.",
      "After CBS News and other news outlets reported on the planned deportations, the rival governing factions in Libya both denied brokering a deportation agreement with the U.S.",
      "On Wednesday, a group of advocates filed an emergency motion in the federal district court in Massachusetts seeking to block any deportations to Libya. The advocates said a group of migrant detainees from Mexico and Asia were potentially at risk of being deported to Libya, without an opportunity to contest their deportation or a notification to their lawyers.",
      "Federal judge Brian Murphy said that if the reports were true and the administration moved forward with the deportations to Libya, it would \"clearly violate\" a ruling he issued in April prohibiting the government from deporting migrants to third countries, without notifying their lawyers and allowing them to contest their deportation.",

      "Xinis gave the two sides until Monday to submit the filings \"addressing the legal and factual bases for the invocation of those privileges,\" including a request from Abrego Garcia's lawyers for the court to conduct a review of \"the withheld documents.\" The judge also set a hearing for May 16 at the courthouse in Greenbelt, Maryland.",
      "The Justice Department had indicated last month that it would invoke certain privileges to protect information regarding Abrego Garcia's removal from the U.S., citing in a filing the attorney-client privilege, state secrets privilege and certain executive privileges.",
      "Administration lawyers had said that a request for documents from Abrego Garcia's legal team about the terms of any arrangement regarding the government's use of El Salvador's notorious prison to house deportees from the U.S. \"calls for the immediate production of classified documents, as well as documents that defendants may elect to assert are subject to the protections of attorney-client privilege and the state secrets privilege.\"",
      "Xinis told a lawyer with the administration during a hearing last month that if they do assert privileges, they must provide justifications for each claim, and she will make a determination as to whether they can stand.",
      "The Trump administration has invoked the state secrets privilege before, in a case involving the deportations of Venezuelan migrants to the Salvadoran prison, called the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.",
      "In Abrego Garcia's case, Xinis had ordered the Trump administration to turn over documents to his lawyers and allowed them to conduct depositions with certain administration officials. Some of the records were initially due last month, but Xinis agreed to push back her deadlines after the Trump administration filed information with the court under seal. One day earlier, Xinis had accused the administration of showing a \"willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.\"",
      "Under the judge's latest order, the Trump administration had until Monday to answer and respond to outstanding discovery requests and provide information about their invocation of privileges. Depositions of four Homeland Security and State Department officials are to be completed by Friday, according to the order.",
      "Xinis allowed the expedited discovery process to begin last month after Abrego Garcia's legal team accused the Trump administration of failing to follow her order to facilitate his return to the U.S. The Supreme Court had agreed that the administration had to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody and \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"",
      "President Trump and other top administration officials have repeatedly said it is up to El Salvador whether to release Abrego Garcia, who had been held at CECOT. As of April 21, he was being held at\u00a0a lower-security facility\u00a0in Santa Ana, according to a declaration from a State Department official.",
      "Abrego Garcia, who was born in El Salvador, entered the U.S. illegally in 2011 and has been living in Maryland since then. He was granted a withholding of removal, a legal status, in 2019 that prevented the government from deporting him back to his home country of El Salvador because of a risk of persecution by local gangs.",
      "But Abrego Garcia was among the hundreds of migrants sent by the Trump administration to CECOT in March.",
      "A federal immigration official acknowledged that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but the administration has since declined to return him to the U.S. Instead, top administration officials have claimed Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13, citing allegations from a confidential informant. His lawyers, however, argue that Abrego Garcia is not a member of MS-13 or any other gang, and has never been charged or convicted of any crimes in the U.S., El Salvador or any other country.",

    "story": [
      "Top advisers have sent President Trump a plan to create a government-run investment fund, a request the president made earlier this year \u2014 but the White House has rejected parts of the proposal, CBS News has learned.",
      "Mr. Trump asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to jointly develop a proposal for a U.S. sovereign wealth fund by early May.",
      "It has been submitted, multiple sources told CBS News on Wednesday. However, the White House had concerns about the approach taken by Treasury, one of the sources said.",
      "Details on the mechanics of the fund continue to be debated, and no announcement is imminent, one source said.",
      "\"In accordance with President Trump's executive order, the Treasury and Commerce Departments have formulated plans for a Sovereign Wealth Fund, but no final decisions have yet been made,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"The Administration remains committed to using every tool available to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard America's national and economic security.\"",

      "Mr. Trump has not determined how proceeds from the sovereign wealth fund would be spent, sources said. In the past, he has suggested the fund could own a stake in TikTok, the popular social media platform that faces a U.S. ban unless China-based parent company ByteDance divests from it.",
      "Sovereign wealth funds typically invest assets from a country's natural resources with an aim to make returns that would provide a public windfall.

These funds can help insulate countries from swings in the value of natural resources, provide funds for government expenditures and allow future generations to benefit from current oil and gas revenue.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-maha-food-box-replace-csfp-low-income-seniors/",
    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 17:31:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has a new plan to get \"healthy\" food to low-income seniors, but an anti-hunger advocate fears many will miss out.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's proposed budget for next year could include big changes for a small food aid program that helps low-income senior citizens supplement their diets. Under the plan, funding for the program \u2014 called the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) \u2014 would be cut, and seniors instead would receive what the Trump administration is calling \"MAHA food boxes\" filled with products sourced directly from farmers.",
      "The food boxes \u2014 whose name stems from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s pledge to \"Make America Healthy Again\" \u2014 could eventually also be rolled out to either \"supplant or complement current USDA programs,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The agency didn't disclose what other government programs could integrate use of the MAHA food boxes.",
      "The USDA administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, more commonly known as food stamps. The agency also oversees other food aid programs such as Women, Infants and Children, which is aimed at pregnant women and kids, as well as the National School Lunch program.",
      "\"Unlike the current approach using food banks, which provide those in need with shelf-stable foods that are high in sodium and other harmful ingredients, MAHA boxes would be filled with commodities sourced from domestic farmers and given directly to American households,\" the Trump budget proposal notes.",
      "The CSFP helps about 730,000 low-income seniors annually through its $389 million budget, according to the USDA. By comparison, the food-stamp program spent about $100 billion last year to provide assistance to 41 million Americans, according to the USDA.",
      "\"We have no details\"",
      "The CSFP is essential for low-income seniors who are struggling to put food on the table, said George Matysik, executive director of Share Food Program, a nonprofit\u00a0in Philadelphia. He expressed concern about the Trump administration's plans to replace the CSFP with food boxes, noting the logistical complexity of getting perishable food from farmers directly to older Americans.",
      "Another question is whether the foods included in the food boxes would meet the needs of seniors who often need shelf-stable foods because many struggle to get to the store, Matysik said.",
      "\"What we do know is that the program that we currently have is working, and seniors have come to rely on us,\" he said. \"We have no details [about logistics of the MAHA food boxes], and this has been a continued challenge that we've had with this administration, where decisions are sort of made overnight.\"",
      "Share Food Program relies on $4.5 million in CSFP funding to provide 32-pound food boxes to more than 7,000 seniors in the Philadelphia region who earn less than roughly $23,000 per year. Matysik disagreed with the Trump administration's claims that the program provides unhealthy foods to seniors, noting the boxes typically contain products such as canned vegetables, lean proteins and pastas.",
      "\"For seniors, a lot of times it can be hard to make it out to the grocery store \u2014 it can be hard to get those core items that folks need,\" he added. \"What we do at Share Food Program is take it directly to the doorstep of about 4,500 seniors, so not only are we providing that nutrition, but we're making it easy on the seniors.\"",
      "The Trump budget proposal represents a wish list for the current administration, and it isn't certain that funding for the CSFP would be cut.",
      "But the plan comes amid a larger push by the Trump administration to reduce spending on similar programs, such as a decision in March to cut two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks and instead have them source food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "The Kennedy effect",
      "The MAHA food boxes would provide a twofold benefit, the USDA said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"MAHA boxes would be more wholesome foods, and similar to the Farmers to Families Food Box, fresh foods,\" the agency said. It added that \"the most obvious\" benefit would be \"the removal of administrative middlemen from the distribution of food.\"",
      "The Farmers to Families Food Box, a pandemic food program that ran from May 2020 to May 2021, relied on more than 200 contractors to deliver millions of boxes to needy families, according to a 2021 analysis from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The study found that the 21 biggest contractors were collectively awarded $3 billion to deliver the boxes.",
      "MAHA, meanwhile, is part of a push by Kennedy to promote natural foods and alternative medicines. As head of HHS, he's pressing the food industry to stop using\u00a0synthetic food dyes\u00a0and has pledged to remove processed foods from school lunches.",
      "The USDA has signaled its openness to the MAHA platform, with Secretary Brooke Rollins saying she plans to approve a plan from Arkansas to ban the use of food stamps for purchasing sodas and candy. Anti-hunger advocates have said such restrictions can be stigmatizing for low-income Americans.",
      "In the meantime, Matysik said he's worried about the future of the CSFP program and the seniors who rely on it.",
      "\"Our seniors in particular are already hurting,\" he said. \"We're hearing about cuts to the SNAP program. We're seeing about cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. We're really worried about our senior citizens in this funding environment from our federal government right now.\"",

      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 The strange reproductive habits of a large, carnivorous New Zealand snail were once shrouded in mystery. Now, footage of the snail laying an egg from its neck has been captured for the first time, the country's conservation agency said Wednesday.",
      "What looks like a tiny hen's egg is seen emerging from an opening below the head of the Powelliphanta augusta snail, a threatened species endemic to New Zealand.",
      "The video was taken at a facility on the South Island's West Coast, where conservation rangers attempting to save the species from extinction have cared for a population of the snails in chilled containers for nearly two decades.",
      "The conditions in the containers mimic the alpine weather in their only former habitat - a remote mountain they were named for, on the West Coast of the South Island, that has been engulfed by mining.",
      "Lisa Flanagan from the Department of Conservation, who has worked with the creatures for 12 years, said the species still holds surprises.",
      "\"It's remarkable that in all the time we've spent caring for the snails, this is the first time we've seen one lay an egg,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Like other snails, Powelliphanta augusta are hermaphrodites, which explains how the creatures can reproduce when encased in a hard shell. The invertebrate uses a genital pore on the right side of its body, just below the head, to simultaneously exchange sperm with another snail, which is stored until each creates an egg.",
      "Each snail takes eight years to reach sexual maturity, after which it lays about five eggs a year. The egg can take more than a year to hatch.",
      "\"Some of our captive snails are between 25 and 30 years old,\" said Flanagan. \"They're polar opposites to the pest garden snail we introduced to New Zealand, which is like a weed, with thousands of offspring each year and a short life.\"",
      "The dozens of species and subspecies of Powelliphanta snails are only found in New Zealand, mostly in rugged forest and grassland settings where they're threatened by habitat loss.",
      "They're carnivores that slurp up earthworms like noodles and are some of the world's largest snails with oversized, distinctive shells in a range of rich earth colors and swirling patterns.",
      "The Powelliphanta augusta was the center of public uproar and legal proceedings in the early 2000s, when an energy company's plans to mine for coal threatened to destroy the snails' habitat.",
      "Some 4,000 were removed from the site and relocated, while 2,000 more were housed in chilled storage in the West Coast town of Hokitika to ensure the preservation of the species, which is slow to breed and doesn't adapt well to new habitats.",
      "In 2011, some 800 of the snails accidentally died in a Department of Conservation refrigerator with faulty temperature control.",
      "But the species' slow survival continues: In March this year, there were nearly 1,900 snails and nearly 2,200 eggs in captivity, the conservation agency said.",

That represents a vast area, including the United States, South America, Africa, Australia, and most of Europe and Asia south of the Arctic Circle. Still, most of the Earth is covered by water so the risk to humans remains low.",
      "The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn't break apart, \"the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. \"But it cannot be completely excluded.\"",
      "Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics at Harvard & Smithsonian, told NPR that the spacecraft is making its \"final death plunge.\"",
      "\"I expect it'll have the usual one-in-several-thousand chance of hitting someone,\" McDowell wrote last month. \"No need for major concern, but you wouldn't want it bashing you on the head.\"",
      "Kosmos 482 launched in 1972",
      "The Soviet Union launched Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth's orbit because of a rocket malfunction.",
      "Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself \u2014 a spherical object about 3 feet in diameter \u2014 has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude.",
      "It's quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek.",
      "Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.",
      "It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, McDowell said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, \"it'll reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.\"",
      "The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America's Cape Horn. But since most of the planet is water, \"chances are good it will indeed end up in some ocean,\" Langbroek said.",
      "Space debris could impact planes",
      "Space junk crashing back back to Earth could be a growing problem for aircraft, researchers warned in a\u00a0recent study.",
      "The study's authors said that the probability of space debris hitting an airplane is small, but the risk is rising due to increases in both space debris reentries and flights.",
      "The study found that high-density regions close to major airports have an 0.8% chance per year of being affected by an uncontrolled rocket reentry, but in \"larger but still busy\" airspace areas like those found in the northeastern U.S. or around major cities in Asia, the risk rose to 26%.",
      "\"While the probability of a strike is low, the consequences could be catastrophic,\" the researchers said in the study, which was\u00a0published in Scientific Reports.",
      "Space junk has hit Earth recently",
      "Space debris has crashed back into Earth in recent months.",
      "In February, debris from a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that blasted off in the United States entered the Earth's atmosphere over Poland. Two chunks from an unidentified object \u2014 both measuring about 5 feet by 3 feet \u2014 were later found on the ground. Police said it was possible the objects came from the SpaceX rocket.",
      "Last New Year's Eve, fragments of metal, believed to be from a rocket, crashed into a village in Kenya.",
      "In March 2024, NASA faced a lawsuit\u00a0from a family whose Florida home was hit by a piece of falling metal.",
      "The month before that, the European Space Agency said a satellite \u2014 weighing as much as an adult male rhinoceros \u2014 made an\u00a0uncontrolled return to Earth, reentering the atmosphere over the north Pacific Ocean between Alaska and Hawaii. Most of the satellite burned up as it reentered Earth's atmosphere.",
      "Stijn Lemmens, senior space debris mitigation analyst at the European Space Agency, told the BBC that the \"re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs quite frequently,\" happening weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones. But objects typically burn up in the Earth's atmosphere before they reach the ground.",

      "Under optimal conditions, about 50 Eta Aquariid meteors can be seen per hour during the shower's peak. But light from the waxing moon will wash out the fainter meteors this year, according to Bill Cooke, who leads NASA's Meteoroid Environments Office. Viewers can expect 10-15 meteors per hour just before dawn on Tuesday morning.",

      "To catch the meteors at their peak, NASA advises going outside around 2 a.m. local time on Tuesday. The moon will set by around 3 a.m., leaving skies dark until dawn.",
      "The shower will be viewable in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres but the conditions will be better in the Southern Hemisphere.",

      "Meteors in the Eta Aquariids come from space debris that originated from Halley's comet. Halley sheds a layer of ice and dust into space each time it returns to the inner solar system. The shed space dust forms two meteor showers a year: the Eta Aquarids in May and the Orionids in October.",

      "Bill Gates wants to share all of his good fortune \u2014 literally.",
      "The billionaire businessman and philanthropist revealed exclusively to \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday that he will give away virtually all of his wealth over the next 20 years through the Gates Foundation. He says a total of $200 billion will go toward causes that will help save and improve lives around the world.",
      "\"By deciding to spend all this money in the next 20 years, we can get a lot more done,\" Gates said in an interview taped last week, days before he announced the initiative. He's confident the money will save \"tens of millions of lives.\"",
      "A change of plans",
      "It's a decision Gates did not take lightly, explaining in a letter posted online Thursday that he was inspired by a famous quote from Andrew Carnegie's 1889 essay \"The Gospel of Wealth,\" which argued \"the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.\"",
      "Gates said his net worth, which is currently $108 billion, will drop 99% over the next two decades.",
      "\"People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that 'he died rich' will not be one of them. There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold onto resources that could be used to help people,\" Gates wrote.",
      "So, he changed his plans. The Gates Foundation, which was originally supposed to shutter decades after his and ex-wife Melinda French Gates' deaths, will now close in 2045.",
      "The Gates Foundation, which is marking its 25th anniversary this year, has already spent $100 billion to help cut the global childhood mortality rate by investing in medical innovations. Gates said he's seen firsthand how impactful the distribution of vaccines for illnesses like diarrhea and pneumonia can be. That's why he's determined to \"double down.\"",
      "He has three main goals: stopping the deaths of mothers and children from preventable causes, eradicating deadly infectious diseases, and putting more countries on a path to prosperity \u2014 with a focus on improving education.",
      "Gates says more children could die due to Trump administration aid cuts",
      "But he's concerned progress could be stalled as the U.S. and European countries scale back on foreign aid and reduce humanitarian funding.",
      "In 2023, an estimated 4.8 million children died before reaching the age of 5, according to a UNICEF report released in March. Without substantial government assistance, Gates says that number will rise.",
      "\"So we should be going from 5 million children dying a year over the next five years to 4 million. And now with these cuts, if they're not reversed, we will go to over 6 million dying. So, instead of going down, we will go back up,\" Gates said.",
      "Gates said he's been in touch with President Trump and had a \"great discussion\" about some of his foundation's initiatives, including HIV prevention and polio, over dinner at Mar-a-Lago in December.",
      "\"Since then, some of the programs have been cut off,\" Gates said. \"And I'm hoping, both with the president or the Congress, to get them to restore some of those aid activities.\"",
      "On the first day of his second term, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to start the country's withdrawal from the World Health Organization. In March, the Trump administration revealed plans to shrink the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 a major overhaul that impacted thousands of employees. Part of his plans to slash federal spending also included the suspension of U.S. foreign aid assistance, essentially gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "Last week, a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget said Mr. Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 also includes \"enormous cuts to foreign aid,\" focusing more on \"targeted\" foreign aid in situations when it's in the interest of the U.S.",
      "The Gates Foundation isn't large enough to replace U.S. foreign aid. In fiscal 2024 alone, the U.S. federal government disbursed nearly $72 billion in foreign aid, according to the Pew Research Center, which cited ForeignAssistance.gov. The U.S. federal government spent four times more on global health than the Gates foundation, Gates said.",
      "\"You always want more money going into these things where you're saving lives for a few thousand dollars. And I will be an advocate for that,\" said Gates, praising global health initiatives spearheaded by former President George W. Bush \u2014 like his Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief launched in 2003 \u2014 which he says should be maintained.",
      "\"The last stage\" of a long career",

      "Gates first revealed his plan to give away virtually all of his wealth in an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" last week, saying he will take an \"equity, value-driven approach\" to the distribution of funds. It will go toward several causes, with a focus on global health and education. His ultimate goal: save tens of millions of lives, especially those of women and children suffering from HIV, malaria and other deadly illnesses.",

      "Gates said he won't miss the money, but he does hope he'll live long enough to see some of the positive ways it has helped hard-hit communities.",
      "\"I hope I'm still alive when we finish the 20 years, but I will save a little bit to be able to buy hamburgers \u2014 as much as I need,\" Gates joked.",

      "\"And after that, there will be other very wealthy people who can understand what the problems are, what's still left over,\" Gates said.",
      "\"And, in a way, it's wild that somebody can have as much money as I do,\" he added.",
      "More children will die due to aid cuts by Trump administration, Gates says",
      "As the U.S. and other European countries cut foreign aid budgets, health experts have voiced concerns about the implications for global health. In 2023, an estimated 4.8 million children died before reaching the age of 5, according to a UNICEF report released in March, marking a significant drop since 1990. Gates expects deaths could rise again, and it's something he wants to address.",
      "\"I will say, despite the challenges we have right now, which are huge and surprising, I'm very optimistic about the progress we can make over the next 20 years,\" Gates said. \"The next five, there will be setbacks because of these cutbacks, but we will get \u2013 and so the number 5 million might go up for a bit, which shouldn't happen. It's terrible. But, over time, we will get that number down even below 3 million.\"",
      "Gates urges U.S. leaders to consider the difference that maintaining foreign aid \u2014 roughly 1% of last year's federal budget\u00a0\u2014 can make.",
      "\"For 1%, if you can save lives for 1,000 times less than we save lives here, and if that creates stability in those countries, so they're thriving countries that will participate in the global economy,\" Gates explained. \"And we don't have to intervene with our military or anything, and the strategic relationship with them, where they see that we have helped them advance, and that that money is why you will be able to see a future pandemic early and stop it from spreading like COVID did all the way to the United States.\"",
      "Gates hopes the U.S. will follow his lead in helping some of the world's poorest nations, and said he will always advocate for governments to help.",
      "\"We never ask for more than 1% to go to helping the poorest. And I think cutting \u2014 when you're well below that 1%, cutting that I think \u2013 doesn't reflect the values I think we should stand for,\" said Gates, adding that the U.S. shouldn't cut money for vaccines or HIV medicines.",
      "Some of these topics came up during a three-hour dinner\u00a0between Gates and President Trump at Mar-a-Lago in December. Gates said they had a \"great discussion\" about polio and\u00a0 innovations in HIV prevention and working together to get an \"HIV cure sooner.\"",

      "Gates fears foreign aid cuts could lead to even more childhood deaths due to a lack of vaccines and HIV medicines that prevent mothers from infecting their babies.",
      "\"Instead of [deaths] going down, we will go back up,\" Gates said.",
      "The \"last chapter\" of Gates' career",
      "Gates is marking many significant milestones this year \u2014 the Gates Foundation turning 25 years old, Microsoft turning 50 and Gates himself turning 70.",
      "\"I'm stunned that I'm 70, because, when I was young, and I thought, hey, those old people don't\u2026 they're not very up to date on what's changing, what's important. And so here I am,\" said Gates, admitting that his \"Microsoft days were very intense.\"",
      "These days, he's spending his spare time playing pickleball and tennis, and reading. He also travels regularly to Africa and India as part of his work with the Gates Foundation, overseeing some of the programs he's partnered with to improve health and development.",
      "\"I get to travel and see the impact. And I'm not working. In my 20s, all I did was work,\" Gates said.",
      "Gates said he doesn't \"feel like a 70-year-old,\" but he wishes he had \"even more time.\"",
      "Toward the end of a letter he posted online Thursday explaining his decision to give away virtually all his wealth, Gates said he's beginning the \"last chapter\" of his career.",
      "\"And I hope I'm lucky enough that during the 20 years that we spend all of these resources that I will be able to both help guide it somewhat and see the work and make sure that others are going to step in to pick up whatever doesn't get done during these next 20 years,\" he told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Part of Gates' motivation stems from the generosity of his good friend Warren Buffett, who has donated billions to the Gates Foundation over the past 19 years. Buffett, who is now 94 and announced this month he'll be\u00a0stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, made lifetime pledges two decades ago to five charities \u2014 including the Gates Foundation \u2014 that will continue until his death. At the time, it was the\u00a0largest philanthropic pledge in history.",
      "\"I should make sure that it's well spent. Warren Buffett's generosity, that's always \u2014 I have felt a huge responsibility to make sure his generosity is highly impactful. And now this is the last stage of all that,\" Gates added.",
      "What Gates hopes the world says about him in 100 years",
      "When asked what he hopes the world says about him 100 years from now, Gates said he has \"no interest\" in creating a lasting name for himself.",
      "\"If I cared about that, maybe I'd make the foundation a foundation that lasts forever. And other people choose to do that,\" Gates said. \"That's fine. I don't think that's the way to have the most impact. Most of the things I work on will no longer be problems.\"",
      "He hopes people a century from now will be puzzled by some of the diseases he's working to eradicate, like tuberculosis, measles and malaria.",
      "\"I think we will treat all children's lives as having value, because the world will be rich enough and the innovation of tools to let you do that will be so strong, you know, the childhood death number should be very small and not different between different countries,\" Gates said.",
      "AI is a \"very empowering tool\" for future generations",
      "Another tool that Gates believes could help: artificial intelligence.",
      "\"In a certain sense, it's going to be so novel that none of us are ready for it. But some of the aspects of it are incredibly positive,\" said Gates, who said he's seen firsthand how AI-powered teaching assistant Khanmigo, built by the nonprofit Khan Academy, is being used by math teachers in New Jersey.",
      "While AI can help foster curiosity and be a \"very empowering tool,\" Gates said kids will continue to forge their own paths based on their unique interests.",
      "\"Kids will choose what they're interested in. They don't all have to be AI scientists,\" he said.",
      "While some may voice concerns over AI being a motivation killer, Gates argues the opposite. It could give you more freedom and time to spend on things you're passionate about.",
      "\"Well, that's called the 'embarrassment of riches' problem, that you won't have to work the long hours that you work today. You won't have a shortage of doctors and huge waiting lists,\" said Gates, adding that he hopes AI will help support countries, like Africa, that are facing doctor shortages.",
      "\"Society will get to decide: how do you spend time? And how quickly that comes, you would get pretty broad disagreement, but, in general, that's where we're headed. And so \u2014 we will have more freedom. It's a lot better than things going backwards,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "One of the largest websites dedicated to deepfake pornography announced that it has shut down after a critical service provider withdrew its support, effectively halting the site's operations.",
      "Mr. Deepfakes, created in 2018, has been described by researchers as \"the most prominent and mainstream marketplace\" for deepfake porn of celebrities, as well as individuals with no public presence. On Sunday, the website's landing page featured a \"Shutdown Notice,\" saying it would not be relaunching.",
      "The site allowed users to upload and view deepfake porn videos created using artificial intelligence. Forums on the site allowed users to buy and sell custom nonconsensual deepfake content, as well as discuss practices for making deepfakes.\u00a0 The owner of the site remains unknown.",
      "The shutdown comes just days after Congress passed the \"Take It Down Act,\" which makes it a federal crime to post nonconsensual sexual imagery, including explicit deepfakes. The legislation, backed by first lady Melania Trump, requires social media platforms and other websites to remove images and videos within 48 hours after a victim's request.",
      "While it's not clear if the website's termination was related to the Take It Down Act, it's the latest step in a crackdown on nonconsensual sexual imagery.",
      "Henry Ajder, an expert on AI and deepfakes, told CBS News that \"this is a moment to celebrate,\" describing the website as the \"central node\" of deepfake abuse.",
      "Ajder said the issue of nonconsensual deepfake imagery will not go away but disbanding the largest archive of deepfake porn is \"a step in the right direction.\" He said it makes the content less accessible and scatters the community of users, likely pushing them toward less mainstream platforms such as Telegram.",
      "\"I'm sure those communities will find a home somewhere else but it won't be this home and I don't think it'll be as big and as prominent. And I think that's critical,\" Ajder said.",

      "After less than 24 hours of seclusion in the Vatican, cardinals ended the 2025 papal conclave with the election of a new pontiff. The man chosen,\u00a0Cardinal Robert Prevost, will be known as Pope Leo XIV \u2014 the first pope ever from the United States.",
      "Here's what to know about him.",
      "Where is Pope Leo XIV from?",
      "Pope Leo XIV was born Robert Francis Prevost in Chicago, Illinois, in 1955. He is the first U.S. pope in the church's history, and is also a citizen of Peru, where he worked for many years.",
      "CBS News Chicago reports he grew up in south suburban Dolton and has two brothers. A woman who knew him in childhood says the Prevost family was very active in their church.",
      "\"His family was very, very devout Catholics. I will say that. The mom and dad both were,\" Linda Jorsch told the station. \"They never missed church, and they were very active within our parish. His mom was like a member of the Altar & Rosary Society. They were lectors in their church \u2014 very active, very devout family.\"",
      "He graduated from\u00a0Villanova University in Pennsylvania with a degree in mathematics, then studied theology at the Catholic Theological Union of Chicago, where he earned a Master's of Divinity.",
      "When he was 27, he was sent to Rome to study, and he was ordained as a priest in 1982. He went on to earn a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical College of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome.",
      "\"My experience of Cardinal Prevost was that he's not a showboat.\" a seminary classmate, Father Mark R. Francis, CSV, provincial of the Viatorians in the United States, told CBS News Chicago. \"He's very calm, but extremely intelligent, and extremely compassionate.\"",
      "Pope Leo XIV has voted in U.S. elections",
      "The new pope is registered to vote in the Chicago suburbs, and voting records obtained by CBS News show he's voted in several general elections \u2014 along with both Democratic and Republican primaries.",
      "He voted in the 2024 general election, as well as in the 2012, 2008, 2004 and 2000 cycles, according to the records. He also cast ballots in the 2016 and 2012 Republican presidential primaries, and voted in the 2008 and 2010 Democratic primaries.",
      "What is Pope Leo XIV's background in the church?",
      "After his ordination, Prevost went to work as a missionary Peru. He returned to the U.S. for a few years and then went back to Peru, where he ran an Augustinian seminary in Trujillo.",
      "In 2014, he was appointed apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Chiclayo in Peru by Pope Francis, according to the Vatican. A year later, he became a bishop.",
      "Pope Francis made him a cardinal in 2023.",
      "Before becoming pope, Prevost, who is 69, was the head of the church's Dicastery for Bishops, meaning he oversaw the selection of new bishops.",
      "Overall, he's considered a centrist, but on many social issues he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine.",
      "\"He kept a low profile on the most contentious, nerualgic, sensitive, controversial issues\" facing the church, said CBS News papal contributor Francis X. Rocca.",
      "Pope Leo XIV congratulated by President Trump, Chicago mayor",
      "President Trump posted a message on social media congratulating the first U.S.-born pope.",
      "\"Congratulations to Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was just named Pope. It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope. What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very  meaningful moment!\" he wrote.",
      "Former President Barack Obama also shared his best wishes for \"a fellow Chicagoan.\"",
      "\"Michelle and I send our congratulations to a fellow Chicagoan, His Holiness Pope Leo XIV. This is a historic day for the United States, and we will pray for him as he begins the sacred work of leading the Catholic Church and setting an example for so many, regardless of faith,\" Obama wrote.",
      "In\u00a0Prevost's hometown, Chicago, many people celebrated his election, with Mayor Brandon Johnson tweeting: \"Everything dope, including the Pope, comes from Chicago!\"",
      "\"Congratulations to the first American Pope Leo XIV! We hope to welcome you back home soon,\" Johnson wrote.",
      "Why did Pope Leo XIV choose his name?",
      "The first act of a new pope after he's elected is to choose a new name. This is to signify that his becoming pontiff is akin to a second birth, the Vatican said.",
      "Cardinal Prevost\u00a0chose the papal name Leo, one of the more popular choices in history, which has been used by 13 previous popes. The most recent one, Pope Leo XIII, served from 1878 to 1903.",
      "\"The name Leo harkens back to Pope Leo the Great,\" CBS News papal contributor Candida Moss explained. Also known as Pope Leo I, his papacy was from 440 to 461 and included a famous meeting with Attila the Hun where Leo dissuaded him from attacking Rome.",
      "\"What does this mean for our new pope? Well, it might mean that he too is going to stand up to oppressive political forces in the world,\" Moss said.",
      "She noted that Leo I was also known as \"a great intellectual and theological reformer.\"",
      "The name a new pope chooses often reflects attributes they hope to embody in their papacy.",
      "It will \"indicate a certain spirit and direction and vision of the new pope,\" said Dennis Doyle, a theologian and professor emeritus of religious studies at the University of Dayton.",
      "Pope Francis, for example, was the first pope in history to take that name, a nod to St. Francis of Assisi. In Catholic tradition, St. Francis of Assisi had a mystical vision of Jesus, who told him to rebuild his church. He also renounced his wealth and founded the Franciscan order of friars in 1290.",

      "Pulte claimed James received deals on mortgage terms by falsifying information related to multiple properties, over the course of decades. The allegations include listing a home in Norfolk, Virginia as her \"principal residence\" despite living and working in New York, buying a five-family property in Brooklyn with a loan that is only available for homes with four units or less, and an accusation that, in 1983, James' father signed mortgage documents stating they were husband and wife.",

      "Abbe Lowell \u2014 an attorney for James whose firm frequently represents clients that it believes have been unfairly targeted by the Trump administration \u2014 has also derided the investigation.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Lowell called the allegations \"baseless and long-discredited\" and said that the investigation \"appears to be the political retribution President Trump threatened to exact that AG Bondi assured the Senate would not occur on her watch. If prosecutors are genuinely interested in the truth, we are prepared to meet false claims with facts.\"",
      "Last month, Lowell sent a letter to the Department of Justice refuting the allegations laid out in Pulte's letter. In a letter to Bondi, Lowell called the allegations \"long-disproven\" and the investigation, \"the latest act of improper political retribution \u2014 this time directed at Ms. James \u2014 publicly instigated and endorsed by President Trump.\"",
      "In February 2024, a New York judge ordered Mr. Trump, his company and two of his adult sons to pay the State of New York about $364 million. The figure, with interest accumulated over more than a decade, currently totals more than $500 million. Trump has appealed the ruling.",
      "The ruling came after a lengthy civil trial in which James' office accused Mr. Trump of spearheading an effort to use fraudulent property valuations and estimates of Mr. Trump's net worth to obtain favorable loan rates and insurance deals he wouldn't otherwise have gotten received.",
      "The figure Mr. Trump was ordered to pay reflected the judge's calculation of how much Mr. Trump and his company benefited through the scheme.",
      "Mr. Trump has long raged against the case, and James \u2014 even suing her unsuccessfully in an effort to stop her fraud investigation before a suit could be filed by the state.",
      "Mr. Trump was forced to take the stand in November 2023 during the trial, lashing out at James during his hourslong testimony, and calling the fraud case \"a terrible, terrible thing.\"",

      "A three-judge panel permanently blocked Alabama from using a state-drawn map that they said flouted their directive to draw a plan that was fair to Black voters. The decision was not a surprise because the panel ruled against the state twice previously and put a new map in place for last year's elections.",

      "\"The long and short of it is that the 2023 Plan unlawfully dilutes Black voting strength by consigning it to one majority-Black district,\" the judges wrote, adding that Alabama should have a second district with a substantial percentage of Black voters.",
      "The judges chided what it called Alabama's \"deliberate decision to ignore\" their order to draw a second district where Black voters had an opportunity to elect a candidate of their choosing. \"The Legislature knew what federal law required and purposefully refused to provide it, in a strategic attempt to checkmate the injunction that ordered it,\" they wrote.",

      "In the Supreme Court's June 2023 decision in Allen v. Milligan, the 5-4 court declined to further weaken the landmark law, and instead affirmed a lower court opinion that found it substantially likely that Alabama's map violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

      "A panel made up of three federal judges said\u00a0in September 2023 that Alabama should have two districts where Black voters have an opportunity to elect their preferred candidates.

      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is traveling to Switzerland this weekend, where he will meet with a Chinese trade delegation. Mr. Trump imposed levies of as high as 145% on Chinese imports, leading the country to fire back with 125% tariffs on American goods.",
      "For businesses, consumers and investors, progress on the trade front can't come soon enough amid ongoing uncertainty on where the U.S. economy is headed. A 10% baseline tariff on most imported goods has been in effect since April 5, while so-called reciprocal tariffs against other countries \u2014 with the exception of China \u2014 are paused until July.",
      "Where do negotiations stand?",
      "The announcement Thursday of a deal with the U.K. marks what could be the first of other trade agreements, with Mr. Trump and his team in negotiation mode with foreign leaders from Canada,\u00a0Italy, India, Japan and other trading partners since announcing his\u00a0\"Liberation Day\" tariffs\u00a0on April 2.",
      "Mr. Trump has not specified when agreements with other countries would be announced, but said that more deals are to follow.",
      "\"We have many meetings planned today and tomorrow,\" the president said Thursday during the announcement from the Oval Office. \"And every country wants to be making deals.\"",
      "While testifying on Capitol Hill earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent addressed the timeline for trade deals: \"I'd be surprised if we don't have more than 80% or 90% of those wrapped up by the end of the end of the year. And that may be much sooner,\" he said, referring to countries with which the U.S. has trade deficits.",
      "Some experts, however, believe negotiations will take longer.",
      "Han-koo Yeo, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics believes that countries with whom the Trump administration is negotiating will have it in their interest to move slowly in their trade discussions. That's because of the longterm implications these deals will have, the former South Korean trade minister told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Negotiations will likely drag past May into June, according to Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, although some countries might be motivated to act quickly.",
      "\"Everyone facing negotiations has been told to submit letters with their 'best offers,'\" Bremmer said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch, \"and smaller countries that desperately want/need deals are complying.\"",
      "Who is the U.S. negotiating with?",
      "Bessent told the House committee Tuesday that the U.S. has 18 \"important trading relationships\" and is currently negotiating with 17 to reach deals. \"Many of our trading partners have approached us with very good offers and we are in the process of renegotiating those,\" he said.",
      "The Trump administration in recent weeks has discussed trade and tariffs with Canada, Italy, India and Japan.",
      "It's unclear which deals will be announced first, but Clayton Allen, who covers politics and policy in Washington for Eurasia Group, said to look for deals with Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and India \u2014 countries that have been engaged in trade negotiations with the U.S. the longest.",
      "Eurasia predicts a deal with Japan could come in mid-June.",
      "China absent from negotiations for now",
      "What Bessent did make clear to Congress on Tuesday is that the U.S. has not yet entered into active trade talks with China.\u00a0 President Trump in April said that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid tariff tensions, but\u00a0China denied\u00a0any talks between Beijing and Washington had taken place.",
      "The Treasury secretary, however, is set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend while conducting trade talks in Switzerland, the Trump administration\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday.",
      "A\u00a0post\u00a0from the Chinese Embassy on X confirmed the meeting. \"Based on full consideration of global expectations, China's interests, and the appeals of the U.S. business community and consumers, #China has decided to agree to engage with the #US side,\" the posts reads. \"As China's lead on China-U.S. economic and trade affairs, Vice Premier He Lifeng will hold talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during his visit to #Switzerland from May 9 to 12.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the embassy said in a statement Wednesday that the U.S. has reached out to China \"through various channels\" and that the talks are being held \"at the request of the U.S. side.\" The spokesperson added that China \"firmly\u2002oppose[s]\u2002the U.S. abuse of tariffs.\"",
      "In a press briefing on Thursday, Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong reiterated this stance, saying the U.S. \"needs to show sincerity to talk and be prepared to rectify its wrongdoing and cancel unilateral tariffs,\" according to\u00a0Bloomberg.",
      "What could trade agreements look like?",
      "The U.S.-U.K. trade pact gave the world its first glimpse at what future deals might look like. But as Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, points out not all trade deals will necessarily be created equal.",
      "\"For the rest of the world, this could offer something of a blueprint, but countries being threatened with even higher reciprocal tariffs would presumably have to offer more that the U.K., which only ever faced the 10% minimum,\" he said in a research note.",
      "Mr. Trump also signaled on Thursday that other countries should not expect to get the same treatment as the U.K. Asked whether the baseline 10% tariff on imported British goods would be a template for future trade deals, he said the answer is \"no.\"",
      "\"That's a low number,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"Many, some will be much higher.\"",
      "While it's hard to predict what other potential tariff deals might include, Yeo, who has helped orchestrate several bilateral and mulitlateral trade negotiations in the past, said such agreements would likely be nonbinding \"gentlemen's agreements\" or memorandums of understanding.",
      "In other words, the U.S. could come to an agreement with a trading partner only to renege later on by issuing additional tariffs.",
      "\"The framework deal is only as good as the nice piece of paper that you write it down on,\" said Eurasia's Allen. \"Trade deals are very, very complex animals, and you're going to get probably top line agreement on some key issues of concern with a promise to come back and negotiate other things,\" he said.",
      "Asked by Ohio Rep. Dave Joyce about the format of the deals, Bessent on Tuesday said, \"I expect that we can see a substantial reduction in the tariffs that we are being charged, as well as nontariff barriers, currency manipulation and the subsidies of both labor and capital investment.\"",

      "Rupnow is charged with \"contributing to the delinquency of a child\" and two counts of \"providing a dangerous weapon to a person under 18 resulting in death,\" Fryer said in a statement. All three charges are felonies.",
      "Rupnow purchased the firearm that was used in the shooting legally in Dane County, Madison Police Department Lt. Matt Nordquist said in a press conference. His 15-year-old daughter had regular access to a gun safe and multiple other weapons in the home, police said.",
      "Nordquist added that Rupnow has been cooperative with the investigation.",
      "On December 16, 2024, 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow killed two people and wounded at least six others in a shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin. Police said a \"combination of factors\" appeared to have led to the shooting, but have not shared details about Rupnow's motive. She died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.",
      "One student remains hospitalized almost five months after the shooting, police said",
      "Police determined the teen shooter had an obsession with mass violence, school shootings, and weapons, though a clear motive might never be revealed. She kept a journal with drawings and videos of mass violence. Police said they tracked online interactions that may have deepened her fascination with violence and shootings.",
      "A day after the attack, a judge issued a restraining order against a California man, Alexander Paffendorf, for his connection to the shooting.

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Thursday that his administration wants to replace the technology at thousands of air traffic control sites across the country and build six new coordination centers. Mr. Trump called into a news conference that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy was holding to unveil the plan for a new air traffic control system.",
      "\"After decades of originally \u2014 and we're taking about a long time ago \u2014 reliable service, air traffic control is long overdue for, not an overhaul really, for a remaking,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's got to be brought up to a modern standard.\"",
      "The president also said he was confident that the current system remains \"extremely safe\" ahead of the summer travel season.",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration wanted to replace the technology at more than 4,600 air traffic control sites and build six new air traffic coordination centers. Officials said the plan also called for buying 25,000 new radios, replacing over 600 radars and installing 4,000 new high-speed network connections.",
      "A coalition of aviation industry groups said that the plan required a minimum of about $30 billion. Last week, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee passed a proposal that would spend $12.5 billion on improving the air traffic control system. The aviation coalition said Thursday that at least $18.5 billion in additional emergency funding would need to be spent on improvements over three years. Duffy told reporters the final number would be up to Congress, which is currently controlled by Republicans.",
      "\"It's going to be billions, lots of billions,\" said Duffy, who was a congressman representing Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019.",
      "Duffy also said the administration believes implementing the plan would take up to four years.",
      "The proposals come months after January's deadly midair collision between an Army helicopter and a commercial airliner over Washington, D.C., which is under investigation. Duffy was asked if the proposals could have prevented the collision.",
      "\"This is different,\" Duffy said. \"It could have had an impact in saving lives \u2026 We had 85 near-misses at DCA (Reagan National Airport), and I think all the airline CEOs would tell you, all of industry would tell you this was dangerous, and we should have seen that it was going to cost lives if we don't stop cross-traffic in the D.C. area. Now it's my job to say, what other risks do I see?\"",
      "The announcement comes as Newark Liberty International Airport  in New Jersey continues to deal with disruptions following an outage last week. Air traffic controllers directing flights into Newark lost communications and their screens went blank for about 90 seconds on April 28.",
      "\"We don't have a radar, so I don't know where you are,\" one controller was heard saying on a recorded transmission.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said the outage lasted about 30 seconds, and it took another 30-60 seconds for planes to reappear on controllers' screens.",
      "Duffy spoke about the outage during Thursday's event, saying that the main communication line went down and a backup line didn't switch on. He said the incident was an example for why the system needs to be modernized.",
      "\"If we don't actually accomplish the mission that we're announcing today, you will see Newarks not just in Newark, you'll see Newarks in other parts of the country because it's an aging system,\" Duffy said.",
      "Several controllers went on trauma leave in the wake of the outage, which appears to at least in part be due to a fried copper wire. There have also been more than 4,000 delays and over 1,000 cancellations in and out of Newark.",
      "In an interview before Duffy's announcement, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian told CBS News he fully supports upgrading the air traffic control system.",
      "\"I'm not saying that the working conditions are acceptable, and I think that the controllers do an amazing job in terms of managing,\" Bastian said in an interview for \"CBS Sunday Morning.\"",
      "Bastian said it's safe to get on an airplane, but he also said the air traffic control system can't operate in its current form for much longer.",
      "\"What we need is a significant investment by our government in air traffic control modernization, which I know this administration and I know the secretary of transportation is committed to delivering,\" Bastian said.",

      "The releases were ordered by President Trump in January, with backing from the senator's son, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has claimed for years that his father's convicted killer Sirhan Sirhan might be innocent.",
      "According to a CBS News review, some of the newly published documents include witness interviews, FBI memos, Sirhan's mugshots, an interview with a gun store owner's wife who claimed to see Sirhan and transcripts of Los Angeles Police Department interviews with Sirhan. Many of the details shared in the files were already known.",
      "The documents also include a 2012 letter by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urging the Obama administration to reopen a probe into his father's death.",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the documents \"have been sitting in various storage facilities across the federal government for decades and had never been digitized or accessible to the public before.\" They were digitized by ODNI \u2014 which is led by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard \u2014 and posted on the National Archives website.",
      "\"Today's release is an important step toward maximum transparency, finding the truth, and sharing the truth,\" Gabbard said in a post on Truth Social.",
      "Mr. Trump has also ordered the release of documents on President John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination and Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1968 killing. Some John F. Kennedy files were released in March, but the King documents have not been released.",
      "What's in the RFK files \u2014 and will we learn anything new?",
      "ODNI said the documents posted Wednesday include \"never-before-seen details about the FBI's investigation into the assassination of RFK \u2014 including the discussion of potential leads by various FBI offices, internal FBI memos detailing the progress of the case, and more.\"",

      "But it's unclear whether the files will reveal new information about Robert F. Kennedy's killing.",
      "The senator's 1968 assassination was primarily investigated and prosecuted by authorities in Los Angeles. Documents from the local investigation \u2014 along with many records from a separate FBI probe \u2014 have been publicly available in California's state archives since the late 1980s. ODNI said some of the records that were published Wednesday had previously been handed over to the Los Angeles Police Department.",
      "Letter from RFK Jr. to former Attorney General Eric Holder",
      "Among the newly published documents is a letter Kennedy Jr. wrote in 2012 to then-Attorney General Eric Holder, asking for Holder to reopen the investigation into the assassination.",
      "Kennedy Jr. wrote in his letter that he was writing in support of a request to investigate made by Paul Schrade, \"a close friend and advisor to my father. He was standing beside my father when Daddy was killed and Paul was himself wounded by a bullet.\"",
      "Kennedy Jr.'s request focused on an audio analysis of the shooting that purported to suggest 13 shots fired, more than the eight rounds in Sirhan's handgun. this would offer proof there was a second gunman. The request includes an analysis that concluded, \"due to the poor quality of the recording (high background noise, distance of the microphone from the shooting source, initial recording made on a low grade recorder), an absolutely exact number of shot-sounds could not be determined.\"",
      "FBI probed leads ultimately deemed not credible",
      "FBI memos released Wednesday include some that described investigations into at least four people accused of having prior knowledge of the assassination: A person who claimed to have predicted the assassination, somebody who claimed to know about a co-conspirator, a person who claimed Sirhan had offered him $1 million to kill Kennedy, and somebody who burst into a congressional office and claimed that he'd given the orders to kill Kennedy.",
      "Many of these and other allegations were not treated as credible, and some of the people making the claims were described in the documents as unreliable.",
      "Sirhan went to a gun range two days before the assassination",
      "One FBI memo reveals Sirhan was surveilled in January 1968. It is unclear why, but there's no indication from the memo that the FBI developed concerning intelligence from the surveillance.",
      "The records lay out some details of the days and hours leading up to the assassination. The wife of a gun store owner identified Sirhan as among a group of people who on June 1, 1968 request information about \"armor-piercing ammunition,\" before Sirhan purchased ammo from the store.",
      "A staffer at a gun range told FBI agents that on June 4, 1968, the day before the shooting, he encountered a man he later identified from a photo as Sirhan. The man fired at targets with high accuracy and purchased ammunition, the staffer said. A woman with him also practiced shooting and was described as blonde and muscular.",
      "Statements from eyewitnesses",
      "Many of the documents detailed authorities' interviews with eyewitnesses, people who said they knew Sirhan and employees and guests at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, where Kennedy was shot.",
      "One witness said that on the night of the killing, Sirhan expressed anger toward rich people and said he thought that other people at the event were disdainful of him.",
      "Hours before the shooting, the witness said he met a man he later believed to be Sirhan outside the Ambassador Hotel, and chatted with him about Kennedy's presidential campaign.",
      "Sirhan ostensibly said, of Kennedy: \"Don't worry about him if he doesn't win, that son of a bitch, he's a millionaire and he doesn't need to win. H\u0435 just wants to go to the White House, but even if he wins he's not going to do anything for you or for me or for any of the poor people.\"",
      "Sirhan was \"disgusted\" with Kennedy and believed he was trying to \"buy the presidency,\" according to the witness.",
      "What did last month's RFK files say?",
      "The government released a trove of 10,000 records on Robert F. Kennedy last month. A\u00a0CBS News review\u00a0found the documents included handwritten notes from Sirhan \u2014 including ones in which Sirhan wrote \"RFK must be disposed of like his brother was\" \u2014 as well as FBI memos on Sirhan, crime scene and autopsy photos, witness interviews and other materials.",
      "A few of those records make reference to common conspiracy theories about the assassination, including mentions of witnesses seeing a woman in a polka-dot dress or somebody shouting \"we shot him.\" Other witnesses said they didn't see anybody matching that description.",
      "Many of the details in those files were already publicly known.",
      "Who killed RFK \u2014 and what has RFK Jr. said?",
      "Sirhan was convicted of killing Robert F. Kennedy \u2014 then a Democratic presidential primary candidate \u2014 at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. He was 24 years old when he was arrested shortly after the shooting. Sirhan has\u00a0admitted\u00a0to killing the senator at various points, sometimes claiming it was due to the senator's support for Israel, though at other times, Sirhan has said he is innocent or said he couldn't remember the incident.",
      "Sirhan has been incarcerated in California for decades, and multiple requests for parole have been unsuccessful. The state's parole board\u00a0endorsed his 2021 bid for parole, but California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0rejected the request.",
      "The case has drawn public fascination for decades, with some observers\u00a0claiming\u00a0Sirhan didn't fire the fatal shots or acted as part of a wider conspiracy. They often cite conflicting eyewitness testimonies or the alleged presence of extra bullets \u2014 though many others have backed the view that Sirhan acted alone.",
      "One of the skeptics is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was 14 years old when his father was assassinated. He has\u00a0argued\u00a0Sirhan wasn't responsible for the killing, and met with him in prison before backing his 2021 request for parole.",
      "However, other members of the Kennedy family have\u00a0staunchly opposed\u00a0Sirhan's release from prison.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 May 2025 16:33:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Companies are already moving to hike their prices as U.S. tariffs bite, a move economists say is likely to drive up inflation.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump claims that other countries and exporters to the U.S. will largely pick up the cost of tariffs. Yet recent data shows that companies are moving to pass along those added expenses to American consumers, which may push up prices.",
      "For example, 76% of Texas manufacturers said they plan to pass tariff-related costs to consumers, while 50% say they will absorb costs internally, according to recent\u00a0survey data\u00a0from Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Sl\u00f8k and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Large retailers have also warned that steep new levies on U.S. imports are likely to drive up prices.",
      "\"The bottom line is that inflation will be rising significantly over the next six months,\" Sl\u00f8k wrote in a recent blog post.",
      "Indeed, with businesses having to plan months in advance to account for tariffs, many companies are baking those costs into their pricing. In a recent EY survey of over 4,000 executives, two-thirds of respondents said they might have to pass tariff costs on to customers.",
      "The Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan policy institute based in Washington, D.C., notes that the economic fallout from the Trump administration's tariffs will fall largely on low- and middle-income consumers. The levies could cost households an average of $5,200 every year,\u00a0according to the nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Inflation ahead?",
      "Manufacturers expect their prices to increase 3.6% over the next 12 months, up from 2.3% in the last quarter of 2024, according to a recent survey from the National Association of Manufacturers, which cites manufacturers' concerns over trade.",
      "\"Nobody has the profitability to be able to eat the tariffs,\" David Loftus, CEO of the Electronic Component Industry Association, an industry trade group, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So the manufacturers pass to the distributors, who pass to the customers.\"",
      "A recent\u00a0Gallup poll found that nearly 90% of Americans expect tariffs to drive up prices this year. For now, tariffs have yet to budge prices \u2014 the Consumer Price Index in March\u00a0rose 2.4% on an annual basis, down from 2.8% in February.",
      "Yet many experts say that U.S. tariffs, coupled with retaliatory measures from other countries, are likely to boost consumer prices in the months ahead.",
      "\"With the new tariffs now in place, we look for a shift up in inflation, adding a headwind to already slowing consumer activity and economic growth,\" Nationwide economist Daniel Vielhaber told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that core inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index, which tracks consumer spending, to rise this year to 3.8%, up from 2.6% in March. Electronics and apparel are likely to see the sharpest price increases, according to the investment bank.",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers, which must pay the fees to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass on most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices, according to economists.",
      "Mr. Trump has staunchly defended the tariffs as a way to restore what he calls fairness to global trade, reinvigorate U.S. manufacturers and generate federal revenues. When asked in a May 4 interview on\u00a0NBC's\u00a0\"Meet the Press\" whether higher duties on imports will drive up prices, he replied, \"No. I think tariffs are going to be great for us because it's going to make us rich.\"",
      "The president has also doubled down on his messaging that foreign exporters, not U.S. consumers, will absorb higher tariff costs. \"China probably will eat those tariffs,\" Mr. Trump said in an April 29\u00a0interview\u00a0with ABC News about the U.S. imposing tariffs of as high as 145% on Chinese goods.",
      "At the same time, Mr. Trump has seemingly acknowledged that stepped-up tariffs could result in higher costs for some goods, such as toys. \"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\" he said in an\u00a0April 30 Cabinet meeting. \"And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.\"",
      "Some companies already hiking prices",
      "After Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a 10% baseline tariff on U.S. imports, along with higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of other nations, a flurry of companies across a range of industries have announced that they will increase prices to offset higher costs.",
      "For example, power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker said in an April 30 earnings\u00a0call that they implemented a \"single-digit\" price increase on retail partners that month and that they're eyeing another price increase for later in the year.",
      "\"Given the magnitude of the current tariff rates, we are actively engaged with our channel partners about a second price increase, targeting implementation at the beginning of the third quarter,\" Chief Operating Officer Christopher Nelson said on the call.",
      "The CEO of consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, the maker of Tide, Old Spice, Tampax and other household brands, told CNBC\u00a0last month that price hikes are \"likely\" due to the uncertainty of tariffs. Adidas CEO Bjorn Goulden also told analysts in an April earnings call that there will be price increases in the U.S. market if U.S. duties on imported goods remain in place.",
      "\"So should the duties go away, again, there will, of course, not be price increases,\" he said. \"But I think we all agree that should these duties stay or even be higher, then, of course, it will cause a price increase in the market in general, not only in our category.\"",
      "Chinese online retailers Shein and Temu said in April that they planned to hike their prices, citing the U.S. eliminating a tariff loophole\u00a0for lower-cost goods. Relatedly, Temu has stopped shipping Chinese-made goods to customers in the U.S. following the May 2 expiration of the so-called de minimis exemption.",

    "story": [
      "A man who was killed in a road rage incident in Arizona \"spoke\" during his killer's sentencing hearing after his family used artificial intelligence to create a video of him reading a victim impact statement.",
      "In what's believed to be a first in U.S. courts, the family of Chris Pelkey used AI to give him a voice. Pelkey was shot by Gabriel Paul Horcasitas on Nov. 13, 2021, as both drivers were stopped at a red light. According to records, Pelkey was shot after getting out of his truck and walking toward Horcasitas' car.",
      "The AI rendering of Pelkey told the shooter during the sentencing hearing last week that it was a shame they had to meet under those circumstances \u2014 and that the two of them probably could have been friends in another life.",
      "\"I believe in forgiveness and in God who forgives. I always have and I still do,\" Pelkey's avatar told Gabriel Paul Horcasitas.",
      "The AI version of Pelkey went on to share advice for people to make the most of each day and to love each other, not knowing how much time one might have left.",
      "While use of artificial intelligence within the court system is expanding, it's typically been reserved for administrative tasks, legal research and case preparation. In Arizona, it's helped inform the public of rulings in significant cases.",
      "But using AI to generate victim impact statements marks a new \u2014 and legal, at least in Arizona \u2014 tool for sharing information with the court outside the evidentiary phases.",
      "Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Todd Lang, who presided over the case, said that he \"loved that AI,\" according to CBS News partner BBC News. Lang also noted the video said something about Pelkey's family, who had expressed their anger over his death and had asked for Horcasitas to receive the maximum sentence. Family and friends also submitted nearly 50 letters to the judge, echoing the video's message.",
      "Horcasitas, 54, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 10.5 years in prison.",
      "Horcasitas' lawyer, Jason Lamm, told The Associated Press they filed a notice to appeal his sentence within hours of the hearing. Lamm said it's likely that the appellate court will weigh whether the judge improperly relied on the AI video when handing down the sentence.",
      "Pelkey's sister, Stacey Wales, raised the idea of her brother speaking for himself. For years, while the case worked its way through the legal system, Wales said she thought about what she would say at the sentencing hearing. She struggled to get words down on paper.",
      "But when she thought about what her brother would say to the shooter, knowing he would have forgiven him, the words poured out of her.",
      "\"We approached this with ethics and morals because this is a powerful tool,\" she told the BBC. \"Just like a hammer can be used to break a window or rip down a wall, it can also be used as a tool to build a house and that's how we used this technology.\"",
      "Pelkey was born in Poughkeepsie, New York, and later lived in Arizona,\u00a0according to his obituary. He was a veteran who served three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and was actively involved in his local church and went on local and international mission trips, the obituary said.",
      "AI in the courtroom",
      "In Arizona, victims can give their impact statements in any digital format, said victims' rights attorney Jessica Gattuso, who represented the family.",
      "Arizona Supreme Court Chief Justice Ann Timmer didn't address the road rage case specifically in an interview Wednesday. But she said the rise in popularity and accessibility to AI in recent years led to the creation of a committee to research best practices in the courts.",
      "Gary Marchant, a member of the committee and a law professor at Arizona State University, said he understands why Pelkey's family did it. But he warned the use of this technology could open the door to more people trying to introduce AI-generated evidence into courtrooms.",
      "\"There's a real concern among the judiciary and among lawyers that deepfake evidence will be increasingly used,\" he said. \"It's easy to create it and anyone can do it on a phone, and it could be incredibly influential because judges and juries, just like all of us, are used to believing what you see.\"",
      "Marchant pointed to a recent case in New York, where a man without a lawyer used an AI-generated avatar to argue his case in a lawsuit via video. It took only seconds for the judges to realize that the man addressing them from the video screen didn't exist at all.",

    "story": [
      "NOAA announced Thursday that it is decommissioning several databases, including its widely reported annual compilation of\u00a0billion-dollar weather and climate disasters.",
      "The announcement was made on NOAA's website under \"notice of change,\" which said it would no longer be updated due to \"evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes.\" The move was first reported\u00a0by CNN.",
      "The database is a popular tool, both for the government as well as the insurance industry, and media organizations often use it for reporting on the economic costs of extreme weather.",
      "According to a current NOAA employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of losing their job, part of the reason the billion-dollar database is being decommissioned is because it is \"not core\" to NOAA's mission, since its focus is on economics and an analysis of various datasets. Additionally, the lead researcher of the database resigned last month by taking a separation incentive package.",
      "More than 2,200 NOAA employees have been let go under the Trump administration, and the White House budget proposal would cut NOAA's funding by 30%.",
      "Criticism had been mounting against the billion-dollar database over the years, driven by\u00a0Roger Pielke Jr.,\u00a0a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and faculty at the University of Colorado-Boulder. Pielke argued it needs better metadata, review and documentation. He published\u00a0a paper in the journal Nature\u00a0last year about the database, saying it failed to meet NOAA's \"criteria of procedure and substance\" based on the agency's \"information quality and scientific integrity policies.\"",
      "In a phone interview with CBS News, Pielke said, \"I'm a huge fan of NOAA and the National Weather Service, they play a huge public service role, and I'm not happy with the sledgehammer that is being taken to the agency.\"",
      "He said having climatologists in charge of the data was problematic and resulted in some quality-control issues that could be addressed by proper economists. He also said the current dataset isn't fixable at NOAA, but that it would be very important for another federal agency to take disaster losses seriously and track the data.",
      "Several members of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology sent a letter to then-NOAA Administrator Dr. Rick Spinrad last fall sharing concerns that the database was misleading.",
      "\"The lack of updated, comprehensive data in these models raises considerable concern given that these reports have been cited by both Congress and the President as the justification for different federal government actions concerning climate change,\" they wrote, repeatedly citing Pielke's research in the letter.",
      "Spinrad says he doesn't necessarily disagree with Pielke's arguments, but believes it should be a collaboration between an office like the Bureau of Economic Analysis and NOAA.",
      "\"The fact of the matter is a large component of billion-dollar losses are based on environmental observations,\" he told CBS News in a phone interview. \"How do you separate out the differences between a liquid natural gas facility exploding and a tornado hitting a town? ... What constitutes the physical delineations that cause a problem? You need an environmental component and I'd feel better with a NOAA scientist doing that in conjunction with an economist.\"",
      "According to Spinrad, critics have also taken issue with how much of the damage to attribute to\u00a0climate change as compared to other factors such as development and population growth in urban areas.",
      "Spinrad said he previously suggested that the report should be broken into two parts: the data and the interpretation of the causes.",
      "Both Pielke and Spinrad agree that good data needs to be collected and published.",
      "\"Yanking down the database obfuscates the discussion on natural disasters, and for this to go away and not be part of the dialogue is a big problem. If you talk to the reinsurance industry and retail, so many sectors rely on this database,\" Spinrad said.",

    "summary": "Priests are required to report child abuse or neglect to Washington state law enforcement after learning about the crime through confessions.",
    "story": [
      "The Catholic Church and federal government reacted vehemently to new legislation in Washington state that requires priests to report child abuse or neglect to law enforcement after learning about the crime through confessions.",
      "Gov. Mike Ferguson signed the controversial bill into law last week, making it mandatory for all clergy to report child abuse, without exemptions for information disclosed during confession. Confessions were previously considered privileged.",
      "The Archdiocese of Seattle \u2014 which was made up of 160 priests and 90 permanent deacons\u00a0as of 2024\u00a0\u2014 said it will excommunicate priests who comply with the legislation. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice called the law \"anti-Catholic\" in a statement announcing a probe into the policy, just days before the Vatican selected the first pope from the United States.",
      "The Seattle Archdiocese in a statement, warned that breaking the confidence of confession is grounds for a priest to be kicked out of the church, essentially reiterating the rules already established for Catholic clergy.",
      "\"Catholic clergy may not violate the seal of confession \u2014 or they will be excommunicated from the Church,\" the Archdiocese said. \"All Catholics must know and be assured that their confessions remain sacred, secure, confidential and protected by the law of the Church.\"",
      "Too many victims",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice said it had opened a civil rights investigation into Washington's law, focusing on how it was developed and eventually passed. It suggested the legislation could be at odds with the First Amendment, with Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon saying the legislation \"demands that Catholic Priests violate their deeply held faith in order to obey the law.\"",
      "In the text of Washington's reporting law, \"clergy\" refers collectively to everyone ordained for religious duties in any religion, but confession as a practice is singled out because of the secrecy around it.",
      "Ferguson's office addressed the federal probe in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"We look forward to protecting Washington kids from sexual abuse in the face of this 'investigation' from the Trump Administration,\" the statement said.",
      "Washington lawmakers are not the first to try to mandate clergy members to report child abuse, especially as the Catholic Church has increasingly faced public reckonings over sex crimes since the turn of the century. Although a majority of U.S. states already have abuse reporting mandates in place for religious leaders, each of those laws includes a provision exempting information learned through confession.",
      "California tried in 2019 to propose a bill that would have required clergy to report abuse without that exemption, but the church fought its passage and the legislature eventually put it on hold.",
      "The legislation was originally proposed by Washington State Senator Noel Frame, whose jurisdiction includes Seattle. After two earlier attempts to pass this bill failed because of disagreements about whether confessions should be exempt from reporting mandates, the final version passed during the legislative session this spring.",
      "\"Far too many children have been victims of abuse,\" said Frame in a statement once the latest bill had passed in the state Senate. \"The Legislature has a duty to act and end the cycles of abuse that can repeat generation after generation. When kids ask for help, we need to be sure that they get help. It's time to pass this bill once and for all.\"",
      "The seal of confession",
      "Thomas Plante, a psychologist and professor who has worked with the church for decades and written extensively about child sexual abuse among clerics, said removing exemptions for confession could have unintentionally adverse effects.",
      "Plante told CBS News that the \"absolute\" confidentiality understood to apply in church confessions has, in his experience, encouraged people who have committed crimes to come clean to a priest who has then referred them to a psychologist such as himself.",
      "He said multiple patients were referred to him this way over his career, and he then reported the situation to authorities as a medical professional.",
      "\"The seal of confession, which is sort of a global thing that's been going on for several thousand years, is basically that anything you say under the seal is in complete confidence, and it gives people a place to talk about stuff they can't talk about anywhere else,\" Plante said. \"That's one advantage. People that are involved in a crime or abuse or anything else, they do have a place in the Catholic Church to talk about it with 100% confidentiality.\"",
      "Without that assurance, Plante said he suspects priests in Washington will stop offering confession and instead direct people to seek that service at churches in nearby states.",
      "\"And I think that would be a terrible tragedy,\" he said.",
      "Confession is a core principle in Catholicism. It calls for private conversations where congregants or laypeople divulge their wrongdoings to a priest, and, in turn, receive forgiveness on behalf of God. Anything said during the exchanges is kept secret.",
      "Technically, priests, through their religious oaths, are bound to a seal of confidentiality after hearing confessions, and the church forbids them from sharing the information learned in those sessions with others. Catholic doctrine explicitly prohibits them from notifying authorities even after someone has confessed to a crime.",
      "The Seattle Archdiocese said they agree \"with the goal of protecting children and preventing child abuse\" and are committed to reporting it, as long as the information is acquired in a setting outside of confession. It also accused the state of Washington of violating constitutional protections for religious establishment and free exercise of religion.",
      "\"With this law, the State of Washington is specifically targeting religious conduct by inserting the government into the Catholic tradition, namely, the highly defined ritual of the Sacrament of Reconciliation,\" the Archdiocese said.\"The state is now requiring priests to violate an essential element of the rite, the confidential communication between the priest and penitent in which the absolution of sin is offered.\"",
      "Washington's new law requires priests to share information from confession only if the person confessing admits to abusing a child.",
      "Last year, while Washington's current governor, Ferguson, was still the state's attorney general, he pushed to investigate Catholic church leadership in Seattle, Spokane and Yakima for allegedly using charitable funds to cover up allegations of child sex abuse by clergy. But the probe faced challenges as the church refused to cooperate, arguing it did not need to obey subpoenas for its records.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Senate Democrats sank a key procedural vote Thursday on a first-of-its-kind crypto regulation bill, after days of opposition amid growing ties between the digital asset industry and the Trump family.",
      "Known as the GENIUS Act, the legislation would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. The measure advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee with bipartisan support in March, but has since lost Democratic support amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency.",
      "In a 48 to 49 vote, the measure fell short of the 60 votes necessary to move forward. Two Republicans, Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri, joined with all Democrats in opposition.",
      "The bill's advancement out of committee came before the announcement earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. The deal involves the firm buying $2 billion worth of a stablecoin offered by World Liberty Financial, and using it to invest in crypto exchange Binance.",
      "The legislation had been pursued on a bipartisan basis, with a number of iterations. But Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, told reporters that Democrats hadn't seen a final version of the bill just hours ahead of the vote.",
      "Warren outlined a handful of \"problem\" areas within the latest iteration of the bill they have seen, including provisions that she argued would \"supercharge Donald Trump's corruption\" and undercut consumer protection laws.",
      "\"It runs a substantial risk of eventually blowing up the U.S. economy and putting us once more in a position where taxpayers have to bail out the billionaires while they end up paying for the risks that the rich people took on,\" Warren said.",
      "Warren acknowledged that there were some ongoing negotiations, but she said there was no agreement between Democrats and Republicans ahead of the vote. She said a version of the legislation that \"puts appropriate regulations in place on stablecoins\" could get a huge majority of the chamber, with significant support on both sides of the aisle.",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News in a statement earlier this week that Mr. Trump's \"assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to clear the way for it to end a program that allowed more than 500,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans to temporarily live and work in the United States.",
      "The request for emergency relief arose from a case challenging Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision to revoke a grant of parole that had been extended by the Biden administration to migrants from the four countries through a special parole program. The 532,000 people who were temporarily protected from deportation through the program, known as CHNV, were set to lose their legal status April 24.",
      "A federal district court judge halted the secretary's March notice, finding that the Immigration and Nationality Act did not give Noem the discretion to terminate parole en masse for the 532,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans. Instead, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani ruled that there had to be individualized decisions to end parole.",
      "A federal appeals court declined to allow Noem to move forward with the termination of the CHNV program, and the Trump administration has now filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court.",
      "In its request, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said that the district court did not have jurisdiction to enter its order because federal immigration law leaves parole-termination decisions to the discretion of the Homeland Security secretary. Sauer said the district court lacked the authority to \"usurp the Executive Branch's control of foreign policy and immigration.\"",
      "\"In doing so, the district court engaged in the very review Congress prohibited \u2014 needlessly upending critical immigration policies that are carefully calibrated to deter illegal entry, vitiating core Executive Branch prerogatives, and undoing democratically approved policies that featured heavily in the November election,\" he wrote.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security created special parole programs for certain nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuelan in late 2022 and early 2023. The Biden administration had said that the policy promoted legal immigration and dissuaded migrants from crossing the southern border.",
      "Under the CHNV program, 532,000 migrants were allowed to enter the U.S. after securing a sponsorship from individuals based in the U.S. After entering the country, the migrants were granted parole and could then work legally in the U.S. for two years.",
      "But the parole program was paused when President Trump returned for his second term in the White House. The policy was part of several others implemented in an effort by the Trump administration to crack down on immigration. Many aspects of Mr. Trump's immigration agenda have been challenged in federal court and temporarily blocked.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in March that beneficiaries of the parole program had 30 days to leave the U.S. or face arrest and deportation.",
      "A group of 23 individuals and a nonprofit organization challenged the termination of the CHNV parole program and prevailed before the U.S. district court in stopping the administration from terminating their legal protections.",
      "The Trump administration has with increasing frequency been turning to the Supreme Court for emergency relief as more than 200 legal challenges arising from the president's policies are moving through the federal courts.",

The group, which also includes lawyers and philanthropists, says the goal is to improve access to legal advice for immigrants and build long-term infrastructure within the justice system as it pertains to immigration law.",
      "Mahdawi, a green card holder who led protests against Israel's war in Gaza at Columbia University, spent 16 days in a state prison before a judge ordered him released on April 30. The Trump administration has said Mahdawi should be deported because his activism threatens its foreign policy goals, but the judge ruled that he has raised a \"substantial claim\" that the government arrested him to stifle speech with which it disagrees.",

      "He called himself a peacemaker and said his arrest is \"a red flag to everybody.\"",
      "Immigration authorities have detained college students from around the country since the first days of the Trump administration. Many of them participated in campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war, which has killed more than 52,000 Palestinians. Mahdawi was among the first to win his freedom after challenging his arrest.",
      "\"Justice is inevitable. We will not fear anyone because our fight is a fight for love, a fight for democracy, a fight for humanity,\" Mahdawi told supporters outside the courthouse last week.",
      "Mahdawi told CBS News he arrived for his citizenship appointment in Vermont in mid-April, took a citizenship test and signed a document that said he is willing to pledge allegiance to the Constitution. Toward the end of the process, he said immigration agents entered the office and detained him. Mahdawi said he doesn't know why they waited, instead of taking him into custody when he arrived.",
      "Members of Vermont's congressional delegation have spoken up on Mahdawi's behalf, as have state politicians. Vermont's House and Senate passed resolutions condemning the circumstances of his detention and advocating for his release and due process rights.",
      "Republican Gov. Phil Scott has said there is no justification for the manner in which Mahdawi was arrested, at an immigration office in Colchester.",
      "\"Law enforcement officers in this country should not operate in the shadows or hide behind masks,\" the governor said the next day. \"The power of the executive branch of the federal government is immense, but it is not infinite, and it is not absolute.\"",

At Columbia, he organized campus protests and co-founded the Palestinian Student Union with Mahmoud Khalil, another Palestinian permanent resident of the U.S. and graduate student who was arrested in March.",

The cardinal electors gathered for the papal conclave elected an American from among their own ranks on Thursday to serve as the new pontiff. Chicago-born\u00a0Cardinal Robert Prevost\u00a0was elected and accepted his fate as the next Bishop of Rome, leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics. He chose Leo XIV as his papal name.",
      "While the relative youth of the nation, fewer than 20 of the church's previous popes had served after the U.S. Declaration of Independence in 1776, one prominent U.S. bishop offered possible explanation for the lack of an American leader of the world's Catholics a day before his election.",

      "\"Cardinal George of Chicago, of happy memory, was one of my great mentors, and he said: 'Look, until America goes into political decline, there won't be an American pope.' And his point was, if America is kind of running the world politically, culturally, economically, they don't want America running the world religiously. So, I think there's some truth to that, that we're such a superpower and so dominant, they don't wanna give us, also, control over the church.\"",

      "As the conclave\u00a0is held to select a new pope, LGBTQ Catholics hope that the next leader of the church will continue the inclusion work Pope Francis started more than 20 years ago.",
      "Pope Francis, who died at 88 last month, was the first pontiff to be publicly inclusive of the LGBTQ Catholic community. He didn't change doctrine, but he changed the conversation by voicing support for legal civil unions, personally meeting with LGBTQ groups and extending blessings to individuals in same-sex unions.",
      "\"Francis was really a breath of fresh air, and a revolutionary in the way he was telling Church leaders to approach and relate to LGBTQ people,\" said Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, a Catholic outreach that educates about and advocates for LGBTQ persons.",
      "DeBernardo said the previous two popes before Francis held anti-gay views, probably the most strident in the Church's history. Under Francis, the papacy adopted a different tone toward the LGBTQ community.",
      "Some clergy and Catholics within the community hoped\u00a0the conclave\u00a0\u2014 in which\u00a0some front-runners appear to share Francis' inclusive views \u2014 will continue along his path.",
      "\"Who am I to judge?\"",
      "Just four months after Francis became pope in 2013, he created controversy when, during a July inflight press conference, he responded to a journalist's question about gay clergy members. He said: \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\" Francis' answer went against years of Catholic precedent.",
      "These words, which reverberated worldwide, set a very different tone from the previous relationship the Church had with gay clergy and members. His predecessors John Paul II and Benedict XVI were far less accepting of LGBTQ people. Benedict XVI published the first modern formal statement denouncing homosexuality in 1986.",
      "The treatise was written by Benedict while he was still a cardinal under Pope John Paul II. John Paul endorsed Benedict's message, and he also explicitly denounced legal recognition for same-sex marriage. Those sentiments prevailed in 2003 when the Vatican officially opposed same-sex unions.",
      "In response to the Vatican's hardline stances, LGBTQ people held protests during John Paul's 1987 U.S. visit. During his trip he stopped in multiple cities, but the resistance was most notable during his time in San Francisco. San Francisco was reeling from the AIDS epidemic and during the visit, the pope was met with activists holding protest signs and participating in candlelight processions and prayer vigils, hoping to enact change.",
      "In the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which is an official document that outlines Catholic beliefs, the Church still views homosexual acts as \"intrinsically immoral and contrary to the natural law.\" The text says that homosexual tendencies are \"objectively disordered.\"",
      "Cristina Traina, a professor in the Theology department at Fordham University, says the language used in the catechism to describe homosexuality doesn't easily translate into everyday life.",
      "\"You could read [\"objectively disordered\"] as just a technical term, but people read it as fundamentally evil and broken,\" Traina said. \"It's a technical term, but it certainly does not work pastorally.\"",
      "With his public comments, Pope Francis began to change the narrative. Francis called homosexuality \"a human fact,\" during a May 2024 interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell. He personally met with LGBTQ Catholic groups, including DeBernardo's New Ways Ministry, and he clarified that transgender people can be baptized and serve as godparents.",
      "Potential for continued progress",
      "Traina sees the potential for continued progress within the Church despite the death of Pope Francis, because attitudes among everyday Catholics have changed.",
      "\"These things change on the ground and in practice, and then they change at the Vatican, and that's the last thing that changes,\" Traina said.",
      "A 2020 study from UCLA's Williams Institute found that there were approximately 11.3 million LGBTQ adults in the U.S., and about 5.3 million of them are religious, including about 1.3 million who are Roman Catholics.",
      "Although 69%\u00a0of Americans support same-sex marriage, political figures such as Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic convert, continue to push for traditional family values and support laws allowing for religious exemptions to LGBTQ protections. While campaigning for his U.S. Senate seat in 2022, one of the laws he said he would vote \"no\" for is the Respect for Marriage Act, which provided federal protections for same-sex and interracial marriages.",
      "Teresa Thompson is a member of Catholic Lesbians at the Church of St. Francis Xavier in New York. Catholic Lesbians was founded in 1995 and has over 300 members.",
      "Thompson, who grew up Catholic, started to distance herself from religion during college, which also coincidentally was when she came out as a lesbian. Although her move away from religion was not due to her sexuality, she felt as though she couldn't return to Catholicism. That began to shift when Francis adopted a more compassionate tone toward LGBTQ people, and Thompson discovered communities that welcomed her.",
      "Ahead of the conclave, Thompson expressed hope that the next pope will continue the work Francis started.",
      "\"I think there's a sense of nervousness, not being sure what is going to happen,\" Thompson said. \"If we look at the structure of the College of Cardinals, Francis appointed so many cardinals that it seems unlikely we would \u2026 go back, but also, who's to say?\"",
      "Sister Jeannine Gramick, co-founder of New Ways Ministry, believes the next pope will mirror the path of Pope Francis rather than undo his legacy.",
      "\"My sense is that the cardinal electors will elect somebody who [will follow] in the footsteps of Pope Francis,\" Gramick said. \"So if that proves correct, then the changes that Pope Francis brought about will not be undone.\"",
      "In her conversations with LGBTQ Catholics, Gramick says that she senses a lot of hope for the future, and there is hope for a pope who will go even further than Francis did.",
      "\"[LGBTQ] people, they're looking for more changes, and I think the primary change they're looking for is to change the sexual ethics teaching of the church,\" Gramick said. \"The catechism has not been changed yet.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 08 May 2025 11:41:00 -0400",
    "summary": "34 million people live in one of these major U.S. cities that's sinking, new research shows. See if your area is on the list \u2014\u00a0and how quickly the land is moving.",
    "story": [
      "New York, Dallas, Seattle and 25 other major U.S. cities are sinking, threatening the structural integrity of buildings, roads, dams and other forms of infrastructure, new research found. The study's authors say it represents a looming threat to the infrastructure of these cities, which combined are home to some 34 million people.",
      "The study by Virginia Tech researchers, published in the journal Nature Cities on Thursday, used satellite-based radar measurements to visualize movement of the land underneath the nation's most populated cities, which they say is largely due to groundwater extraction.",
      "In all 28 of the cities they analyzed, at least 20% of urban areas are sinking, the researchers said. In 25 of the cities, they found at least 65% of the area is sinking, and more than 29,000 buildings are located in \"high and very high damage risk areas, indicating a greater likelihood of infrastructure damage.\"",
      "The cities with the most widespread sinking \u2014 impacting about 98% of their individual areas \u2014 are Chicago, Dallas, Columbus, Detroit, Fort Worth, Denver, New York, Indianapolis, Houston and Charlotte.",
      "Leonard Ohenhen, lead author of the study, said in a press release that when land shifts downward, even slightly, it can significantly compromise the structural integrity of buildings, roads, bridges and dams.",
      "\"A lot of small changes will build up over time, magnifying weak spots with urban systems and heighten flood risks,\" Ohenhen said.",
      "Manoochehr Shirzaei, an associate professor who works at Virginia Tech's Earth Observation and Innovation Lab, explained that the \"infrastructure can be silently compromised over time, with damage only becoming evident when it is severe or potentially catastrophic.\"",
      "\"This risk is often exacerbated in rapidly expanding urban centers,\" Shirzaei said.",
      "A major reason for this is groundwater extraction, they found, as rapidly growing cities demand more freshwater that must be drawn from aquifers. If that water is taken out faster than it can be replenished, the aquifer can crumble.",
      "Further compromising cities' structural integrity is the damage from extreme weather, amplified by climate change, which wasn't included in the study but nonetheless poses a threat. Experts have previously told CBS News that U.S. roads are not built to withstand rising global temperatures and excessive precipitation, which can cause them to buckle and collapse. The early April storms in the Midwest and South that killed at least two dozen people and caused widespread damage were made 14 times more likely due to higher temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, according to another study published this week.",
      "Repeated events such as these can degrade building materials and damage structures, further exacerbating the toll of the weakening ground below.",
      "Shel Winkley, a weather and climate engagement specialist with Climate Central and author of the April storms study, said their research shows \"It's really a moment for us to understand what this means not only now but for the future.\"",
      "Here are the cities analyzed in the study.",
      "Houston, Fort Worth and Dallas",
      "Researchers found that several cities in Texas, which they noted as the fastest-growing state, \"exhibit the highest measured subsidence rates among all cities,\" with an average sinking rate exceeding 4 millimeters every year.",
      "Houston was the fastest-sinking city out of those studied, with 42% of its land area subsiding faster than 5 mm per year and 12% subsiding faster than 10 mm per year, researchers found.",
      "However, the study says, \"it is essential to highlight that vertical land deformation often varies spatially within cities,\" and noted that some cities can experience \"hotspots\" with otherwise overall average land movement.",
      "\"From an urban risk perspective, the cities with the greatest spatial variability may experience the greatest hazard to urban infrastructure,\" the study says.",
      "New York City",
      "At least 10% of New York City is sinking, researchers found, but greater subsidence of more than 5mm per year has been found in LaGuardia Airport, one of the city's three major airports. LaGuardia recently underwent an $8 billion renovation and was named the best airport in the U.S. by Forbes Travel Guide in 2024.",
      "\"New York City alone accounts for 26% of the total subsiding population,\" the study says, \"with the other seven cities making up 5-8% of the population residing on subsiding land.\"",
      "San Francisco",
      "On the West Coast, vertical land motion \u2014 a term for how much the ground is sinking \u2014 may be at least partially influenced by tectonic activities, researchers found. Like other coastal cities included in the study, such as Los Angeles, San Diego and Jacksonville, San Francisco is also impacted by sea level rise. Much of the city was found to have at least a medium risk to its infrastructure damage due to sinking.",
      "\"Whereas natural processes influence urban land subsidence in the United States, most of the sinking land results from human-driven activities, with 80% of the subsidence associated with groundwater withdrawals.",
      "Chicago",
      "Chicago has an area-weighted vertical land movement of more than 2 millimeters per year, the researchers found. At least 10% of the city's area is sinking at a rate exceeding 3 mm per year.",
      "Other major cities",
      "Cities that are sinking between 1 and 2 millimeters every year include: Columbus, Ohio; Seattle; Detroit; Denver; Charlotte, North Carolina; Oklahoma City; Indianpolis; Washington, D.C., San Antonio, Texas; San Diego; Nashville, Tennessee; Los Angeles; and Las Vegas.",
      "Cities that are sinking at less than 1 mm per year, based on area-weighted vertical land movement, include: Portland, Oregon; Phoenix, Arizona; El Paso, Texas; Austin, Texas; Philadelphia and Boston.",
      "Three other cities \u2014 Memphis, Tennessee; San Jose, California; and Jacksonville, Florida \u2014 had a slightly positive vertical land movement, indicating a gain in elevation, the researchers found.",

The May 7 deadline for Americans to switch to the\u00a0federally compliant\u00a0identification comes after more than 20 years of being delayed. Real IDs will also be required to enter certain federal facilities.",
      "Despite the new security requirement, it was business as usual at many airports on Wednesday, with some airport websites reporting wait times at security checkpoints of just a few minutes.",
      "Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport's website, for example, showed wait times ranging from 5 to 16 minutes.",
      "At Chicago's O'Hare airport, wait times were actually lower than usual. Jim Spriggs, TSA's federal security director for Illinois, said 90% of O'Hare travelers were prepared for the Real ID deadline.",
      "\"Everything is normal operations,\" Acting TSA Director Adam Stahl told CBS News on Wednesday. \"We're of course enforcing the law while mitigating impacts to wait times.\"",
      "TSA employees at Newark Airport said they were pleasantly surprised by how prepared passengers were. Travelers at the New Jersey airport have experienced serious delays in recent days due to a mix of air traffic controller issues and staffing shortages.",

      "Still, officials advised travelers to arrive at least three hours before a domestic flight, especially if they don't have a Real ID. People without Real IDs can still fly, although they may face extra security hurdles.",
      "The agency said it's seeing about 81% Real ID-compliance at airports. According to a\u00a0CBS News analysis\u00a0from April, at least 17 states were less than 50% compliant with the law.",
      "Those without Real ID can still apply",
      "While the ID cards are required for domestic air travel as of Wednesday, officials have emphasized that May 7 is not the last day Americans can get a Real ID.",
      "\"This is the beginning, or hopefully the mid-part, the continuation of enrollment,\" Stahl told CBS News. \"So if any individuals don't have their real ID, they can continue to enroll and get a real ID in the coming weeks and months.\"",
      "State government offices that issue driver's licenses and state IDs have seen a significant increase in demand for Real ID, with some extending their office hours to meet the spike in applications.",

    "story": [
      "Bill Gates wants to share all of his good fortune \u2014 literally.",
      "The billionaire businessman and philanthropist revealed exclusively to \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday that he will give away virtually all of his wealth over the next 20 years through the Gates Foundation. He says a total of $200 billion will go toward causes that will help save and improve lives around the world.",
      "\"By deciding to spend all this money in the next 20 years, we can get a lot more done,\" Gates said in an interview taped last week, days before he announced the initiative. He's confident the money will save \"tens of millions of lives.\"",
      "A change of plans",
      "It's a decision Gates did not take lightly, explaining in a letter posted online Thursday that he was inspired by a famous quote from Andrew Carnegie's 1889 essay \"The Gospel of Wealth,\" which argued \"the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.\"",
      "Gates said his net worth, which is currently $108 billion, will drop 99% over the next two decades.",
      "\"People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that 'he died rich' will not be one of them. There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold onto resources that could be used to help people,\" Gates wrote.",
      "So, he changed his plans. The Gates Foundation, which was originally supposed to shutter decades after his and ex-wife Melinda French Gates' deaths, will now close in 2045.",
      "The Gates Foundation, which is marking its 25th anniversary this year, has already spent $100 billion to help cut the global childhood mortality rate by investing in medical innovations. Gates said he's seen firsthand how impactful the distribution of vaccines for illnesses like diarrhea and pneumonia can be. That's why he's determined to \"double down.\"",
      "He has three main goals: stopping the deaths of mothers and children from preventable causes, eradicating deadly infectious diseases, and putting more countries on a path to prosperity \u2014 with a focus on improving education.",
      "Gates says more children could die due to Trump administration aid cuts",
      "But he's concerned progress could be stalled as the U.S. and European countries scale back on foreign aid and reduce humanitarian funding.",
      "In 2023, an estimated 4.8 million children died before reaching the age of 5, according to a UNICEF report released in March. Without substantial government assistance, Gates says that number will rise.",
      "\"So we should be going from 5 million children dying a year over the next five years to 4 million. And now with these cuts, if they're not reversed, we will go to over 6 million dying. So, instead of going down, we will go back up,\" Gates said.",
      "Gates said he's been in touch with President Trump and had a \"great discussion\" about some of his foundation's initiatives, including HIV prevention and polio, over dinner at Mar-a-Lago in December.",
      "\"Since then, some of the programs have been cut off,\" Gates said. \"And I'm hoping, both with the president or the Congress, to get them to restore some of those aid activities.\"",
      "On the first day of his second term, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to start the country's withdrawal from the World Health Organization. In March, the Trump administration revealed plans to shrink the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 a major overhaul that impacted thousands of employees. Part of his plans to slash federal spending also included the suspension of U.S. foreign aid assistance, essentially gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "Last week, a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget said Mr. Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 also includes \"enormous cuts to foreign aid,\" focusing more on \"targeted\" foreign aid in situations when it's in the interest of the U.S.",
      "The Gates Foundation isn't large enough to replace U.S. foreign aid. In fiscal 2024 alone, the U.S. federal government disbursed nearly $72 billion in foreign aid, according to the Pew Research Center, which cited ForeignAssistance.gov. The U.S. federal government spent four times more on global health than the Gates foundation, Gates said.",
      "\"You always want more money going into these things where you're saving lives for a few thousand dollars. And I will be an advocate for that,\" said Gates, praising global health initiatives spearheaded by former President George W. Bush \u2014 like his Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief launched in 2003 \u2014 which he says should be maintained.",
      "\"The last stage\" of a long career",
      "Gates, who is turning 70 years old this fall, said this move marks the beginning of the \"last chapter\" in his career. But he certainly hopes he's around to see the impact it makes.",
      "\"Well, I wish I had even more time. But I have to say, 'OK, this is the last part of my life. And I'm a steward of these resources,'\" he told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"I should make sure that it's well spent. And now this is the last stage of all that.\"",
      "When asked if he'll miss his billion-dollar fortune, Gates chuckled.",

      "The Justice Department had indicated last month that it would invoke certain privileges to protect information regarding Abrego Garcia's removal from the U.S., citing in a filing the attorney-client privilege, state secrets privilege and certain executive privileges.",
      "Administration lawyers had said that a request for documents from Abrego Garcia's legal team about the terms of any arrangement regarding the government's use of El Salvador's notorious prison to house deportees from the U.S. \"calls for the immediate production of classified documents, as well as documents that defendants may elect to assert are subject to the protections of attorney-client privilege and the state secrets privilege.\"",

      "The Trump administration has invoked the state secrets privilege before, in a case involving the deportations of Venezuelan migrants to the Salvadoran prison, called the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.",
      "In Abrego Garcia's case, Xinis had ordered the Trump administration to turn over documents to his lawyers and allowed them to conduct depositions with certain administration officials. Some of the records were initially due last month, but Xinis agreed to push back her deadlines after the Trump administration filed information with the court under seal. One day earlier, Xinis had accused the administration of showing a \"willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.\"",
      "Under the judge's latest order, the Trump administration had until Monday to answer and respond to outstanding discovery requests and provide information about their invocation of privileges. Depositions of four Homeland Security and State Department officials are to be completed by Friday, according to the order.",
      "Xinis allowed the expedited discovery process to begin last month after Abrego Garcia's legal team accused the Trump administration of failing to follow her order to facilitate his return to the U.S. The Supreme Court had agreed that the administration had to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody and \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"",
      "President Trump and other top administration officials have repeatedly said it is up to El Salvador whether to release Abrego Garcia, who had been held at CECOT.

Relatively fewer, although sizable numbers, point to the church's political views and stands on issues like abortion and divorce, or church doctrine itself, as reasons they feel the church is out of touch with their needs. Those who think it is out of touch still mostly believe the Church respects women as much as men, just not to the extent that those who call it \"in touch\" do.",

    "summary": "A jury returned a verdict of not guilty in state court for three former Memphis police officers in the fatal 2023 beating of Tyre Nichols.",
    "story": [
      "Three former Memphis officers were acquitted Wednesday of all state charges, including second-degree murder, in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols after he ran away from a traffic stop, a death that sparked nationwide protests and prompted renewed calls for police reforms in the U.S.",
      "An out-of-town jury from a majority-White county took about 8 1/2 hours over two days to find Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith not guilty on all charges after a nine-day trial in state court in Memphis, which is majority-Black. After the jury's verdict was read, the defendants hugged their lawyers as relatives of the former officers cried. One relative yelled, \"Thank you, Jesus!\"",
      "Martin Zummach, Smith's attorney, told The Associated Press by text: \"It's easy to defend a good person. It's nerve racking to represent an innocent man.\"",
      "The three defendants still face the prospect of years in prison after they were convicted of federal charges, though they were acquitted of the most serious charges there, too. Two other former officers previously pleaded guilty in both state and federal court, including Emmitt Martin, who defense attorneys blamed for the majority of the violence.",
      "Bean and Smith are out on bond and under house arrest after their federal convictions. Haley is being held in federal prison.",
      "Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, fled a traffic stop after he was yanked out of his car, pepper-sprayed and hit with a Taser. The five officers, who are also Black, caught up with him and punched, kicked and hit Nichols with a police baton, struggling to handcuff him as he called out for his mother just steps from his home. Nichols died Jan. 10, 2023, three days after the beating.",
      "Footage of the beating captured by a police pole camera also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled with his injuries. The video prompted intense scrutiny of police in Memphis.",
      "Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents Nichols' family, issued a statement expressing outrage at the trial.",
      "\"Today's verdicts are a devastating miscarriage of justice,\" the statement reads. \"The world watched as Tyre Nichols was beaten to death by those sworn to protect and serve.\"",
      "Memphis District Attorney Steve Mulroy said he respects the jury but thinks the evidence was there for every charge that prosecutors brought.",
      "\"Was I surprised that there wasn't a single guilty verdict on any of the counts or any of the lesser-included offenses, given the overwhelming evidence that we presented? Yes, I was surprised. Do I have an explanation for it? No,\" he said.",
      "He said he spoke to Nichols' family briefly and, \"They were devastated. ... I think they were outraged, and we can understand why they would be outraged, given the evidence.\"",
      "Former Memphis officers Desmond Mills Jr. and Martin, who were also involved in the beating, did not stand trial in state court after they agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors. They also pleaded guilty in federal court, where sentencing for all five officers is pending.",
      "Mulroy referred to Martin and Mills in his comments after Wednesday's verdict, telling reporters that the two defendants who he said were \"most culpable\" in the case weren't in the courtroom.",
      "\"That doesn't mean that the remaining three defendants weren't culpable,\" he said. As for the acquittal, the DA said, \"It's hard to get inside the mind of the jury.\"",
      "At trial, defense attorneys emphasized that Martin kicked and punched Nichols several times in the head.",
      "The defense also seemed to score points with their use-of-force experts, who testified that the three officers on trial acted in compliance with police department policies and widely accepted law enforcement standards. Attorneys for Bean and Smith called character witnesses who testified that the men were good officers who did their job the right way.",
      "Mills testified for the prosecution, saying he regrets his failure to stop the beating, which led to Nichols' death from blunt force trauma. Nichols suffered tears and bleeding in the brain, Dr. Marco Ross, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy, said in court testimony.",
      "The three officers had been charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression. In addition to beating Nichols, prosecutors also said the officers failed to intervene and failed to tell medical personnel that Nichols had been hit repeatedly in the head.",
      "Mills acknowledged on the stand that he had a duty to intervene, but didn't. He admitted Nichols never punched or kicked any of the officers.",
      "But Mills also bolstered the defense's case when he said Nichols was actively resisting arrest and not complying with orders to present his hands to be cuffed. Under cross-examination, he indicated he would not have struck Nichols if Nichols had put his hands behind his back. He also agreed that an officer is not safe until a suspect is handcuffed and searched for a weapon.",
      "Zummach noted in closing arguments that credit and debit cards that did not belong to Nichols were found in his car when it was searched after the beating and said it was likely why Nichols ran from the traffic stop. Defense lawyers have argued that the fatal beating would not have taken place if Nichols had just allowed himself to be handcuffed.",
      "\"This is Emmitt Martin's and Tyre Nichols' doing,\" Zummach said.",
      "The jury for the state trial was chosen in Hamilton County, which includes Chattanooga, after Judge James Jones Jr. ordered the case be heard from people outside of Shelby County, which includes Memphis. Defense lawyers for the officers had argued that intense publicity made seating a fair jury difficult.",
      "Defense lawyers also claimed Bean and Smith could not see the strikes to Nichols' head because they were blinded by pepper spray and they had tunnel vision as they tried to restrain Nichols.",
      "But prosecutors sowed doubt on that claim by pointing to comments the defendants made after the beating. According to footage from the scene, Bean said Nichols was \"eating\" the blows and Smith said they hit Nichols with \"so many pieces,\" or punches. Smith also said \"hit him\" and Haley said \"beat that man,\" prosecutor Tanisha Johnson said.",
      "In December, the U.S. Justice Department said a 17-month investigation showed the Memphis Police Department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people.",
      "The five officers, the city of Memphis and the police chief are being sued by Nichols' family for $550 million. A trial has been scheduled for next year.",

      "\"The first thing that you would look for would be, which popes had that name before?\" he said. \"That would signify something about the direction that the pope wants to take.\"",
      "Leo has been chosen 13 times before.",
      "\"The name Leo harkens back to Pope Leo the Great,\" the first pope with the name Leo, CBS News papal contributor Candida Moss said Thursday.",
      "Also known as Pope Leo I, his papacy was from 440 to 461. He's famous for meeting with Attila the Hun and dissuading him from attacking Rome.",
      "\"What does this mean for our new pope? Well, it might mean that he too is going to stand up to oppressive political forces in the world,\" Moss said.",
      "Leo I is also known as \"a great intellectual and theological reformer,\" Moss said. He wrote Leo's Tome, a document that influenced the official doctrine defining Jesus Christ as both fully human and fully divine.",
      "\"Our new pope has a doctorate in canon law, so we might expect that he too is going to clarify the church's teachings on central issues,\" Moss said.",
      "Doyle also pointed to the last pope to use the name Leo, Pope Leo XIII, who was the head of the Catholic Church between 1878 and 1903.",
      "\"He is perhaps most famous for writing the Rerum Novarum,\" Doyle said, which translates to \"On New Things,\" but the Latin meaning is also \"On Revolutionary Changes.\"",
      "The Rerum Novarum addressed workers' rights and capitalism at the dawn of the industrial age and is considered the first Catholic social encyclical, laying the foundation for modern Catholic social thought.",
      "This could indicate that Pope Leo XIV is interested \"in promoting Catholic social teaching in today's world,\" Doyle said. \"Maybe Catholic social teaching, if taken seriously, could be something to help overcome polarization.\"",
      "The name Leo \"is a deep sign of commitment to social issues,\" Natalia Imperatori-Lee, the chair of religious studies at Manhattan University, told The Associated Press.",
      "Because of that, Pope Leo XIV's choice of name also suggests a continuation of much of Pope Francis' ministry.",
      "Pope Francis, whose birth name was Jorge Mario Bergoglio, chose a papal name that hadn't been chosen by a pope before, so in his case, \"you have to ask, well, are there any biblical figures or people in the tradition who have had that name?\" Doyle said.",

      "Pope Benedict XVI paid homage to Benedict XV, who led the church during World War I, but also to St. Benedict of Nursia, who founded the Benedictine Order and influenced the spread of Christianity throughout Europe.",
      "The name John, the most popular, could refer back to the Gospel of John, which is one of \"the most loved of the gospels,\" Doyle said. It can also refer to St. John the Baptist, the prophet who baptized Jesus.",
      "Have popes always changed their names?",
      "Not every pope in history has changed his name. Out of 266 popes before Pope Leo XIV, 129 have chosen new names, according to Vatican News.",
      "The practice became more ingrained around the 11th century, a period of German popes who chose names of early church bishops out of \"a desire to signify continuity,\" Rev. Roberto Regoli, a historian at Rome's Pontifical Gregorian University, told the AP.",

      "\"My experience of Cardinal Prevost was that he's not a showboat.\" a seminary classmate, Father Mark R. Francis, CSV, provincial of the Viatorians in the United States, told CBS News Chicago. \"He's very calm, but extremely intelligent, and extremely compassionate.\"",

      "What is Pope Leo XIV's background in the church?",
      "After his ordination, Prevost went to work as a missionary Peru. He returned to the U.S. for a few years and then went back to Peru, where he ran an Augustinian seminary in Trujillo.",
      "In 2014, he was appointed apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Chiclayo in Peru by Pope Francis, according to the Vatican. A year later, he became a bishop.",
      "Pope Francis made him a cardinal in 2023.",
      "Before becoming pope, Prevost, who is 69, was the head of the church's Dicastery for Bishops, meaning he oversaw the selection of new bishops.",
      "Overall, he's considered a centrist, but on many social issues he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine.",

      "For businesses, consumers and investors, progress on the trade front can't come soon enough amid ongoing uncertainty on where the U.S. economy is headed. A 10% baseline tariff on most imported goods has been in effect since April 5, while so-called reciprocal tariffs against other countries \u2014 with the exception of China \u2014 are paused until July.",
      "Where do negotiations stand?",
      "The announcement Thursday of a deal with the U.K. marks what could be the first of other trade agreements, with Mr. Trump and his team in negotiation mode with foreign leaders from Canada,\u00a0Italy, India, Japan and other trading partners since announcing his\u00a0\"Liberation Day\" tariffs\u00a0on April 2.",
      "Mr. Trump has not specified when agreements with other countries would be announced, but said that more deals are to follow.",
      "\"We have many meetings planned today and tomorrow,\" the president said Thursday during the announcement from the Oval Office. \"And every country wants to be making deals.\"",
      "While testifying on Capitol Hill earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent addressed the timeline for trade deals: \"I'd be surprised if we don't have more than 80% or 90% of those wrapped up by the end of the end of the year. And that may be much sooner,\" he said, referring to countries with which the U.S. has trade deficits.",
      "Some experts, however, believe negotiations will take longer.",
      "Han-koo Yeo, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics believes that countries with whom the Trump administration is negotiating will have it in their interest to move slowly in their trade discussions. That's because of the longterm implications these deals will have, the former South Korean trade minister told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Negotiations will likely drag past May into June, according to Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, although some countries might be motivated to act quickly.",
      "\"Everyone facing negotiations has been told to submit letters with their 'best offers,'\" Bremmer said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch, \"and smaller countries that desperately want/need deals are complying.\"",
      "Who is the U.S. negotiating with?",
      "Bessent told the House committee Tuesday that the U.S. has 18 \"important trading relationships\" and is currently negotiating with 17 to reach deals. \"Many of our trading partners have approached us with very good offers and we are in the process of renegotiating those,\" he said.",
      "The Trump administration in recent weeks has discussed trade and tariffs with Canada, Italy, India and Japan.",
      "It's unclear which deals will be announced first, but Clayton Allen, who covers politics and policy in Washington for Eurasia Group, said to look for deals with Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and India \u2014 countries that have been engaged in trade negotiations with the U.S. the longest.",
      "Eurasia predicts a deal with Japan could come in mid-June.",
      "China absent from negotiations for now",
      "What Bessent did make clear to Congress on Tuesday is that the U.S. has not yet entered into active trade talks with China.\u00a0 President Trump in April said that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid tariff tensions, but\u00a0China denied\u00a0any talks between Beijing and Washington had taken place.",
      "The Treasury secretary, however, is set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend while conducting trade talks in Switzerland, the Trump administration\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday.",
      "A\u00a0post\u00a0from the Chinese Embassy on X confirmed the meeting. \"Based on full consideration of global expectations, China's interests, and the appeals of the U.S. business community and consumers, #China has decided to agree to engage with the #US side,\" the posts reads. \"As China's lead on China-U.S. economic and trade affairs, Vice Premier He Lifeng will hold talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during his visit to #Switzerland from May 9 to 12.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the embassy said in a statement Wednesday that the U.S. has reached out to China \"through various channels\" and that the talks are being held \"at the request of the U.S. side.\" The spokesperson added that China \"firmly\u2002oppose[s]\u2002the U.S. abuse of tariffs.\"",
      "In a press briefing on Thursday, Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong reiterated this stance, saying the U.S. \"needs to show sincerity to talk and be prepared to rectify its wrongdoing and cancel unilateral tariffs,\" according to\u00a0Bloomberg.",
      "What could trade agreements look like?",
      "The U.S.-U.K. trade pact gave the world its first glimpse at what future deals might look like. But as Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, points out not all trade deals will necessarily be created equal.",
      "\"For the rest of the world, this could offer something of a blueprint, but countries being threatened with even higher reciprocal tariffs would presumably have to offer more that the U.K., which only ever faced the 10% minimum,\" he said in a research note.",
      "Mr. Trump also signaled on Thursday that other countries should not expect to get the same treatment as the U.K. Asked whether the baseline 10% tariff on imported British goods would be a template for future trade deals, he said the answer is \"no.\"",
      "\"That's a low number,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"Many, some will be much higher.\"",
      "While it's hard to predict what other potential tariff deals might include, Yeo, who has helped orchestrate several bilateral and mulitlateral trade negotiations in the past, said such agreements would likely be nonbinding \"gentlemen's agreements\" or memorandums of understanding.",
      "In other words, the U.S. could come to an agreement with a trading partner only to renege later on by issuing additional tariffs.",
      "\"The framework deal is only as good as the nice piece of paper that you write it down on,\" said Eurasia's Allen. \"Trade deals are very, very complex animals, and you're going to get probably top line agreement on some key issues of concern with a promise to come back and negotiate other things,\" he said.",
      "Asked by Ohio Rep. Dave Joyce about the format of the deals, Bessent on Tuesday said, \"I expect that we can see a substantial reduction in the tariffs that we are being charged, as well as nontariff barriers, currency manipulation and the subsidies of both labor and capital investment.\"",

Prevost \u2014 the first pope ever from the United States \u2014 chose Leo XIV as his papal name.",
      "The new pontiff's identity was revealed about an hour after white smoke emerged from the chimney above the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican, signaling that a new pope had been chosen with a decisive vote by the cardinal electors gathered for the papal conclave.",
      "After the white smoke brought an initial cheer, the crowd in St. Peter's Square erupted in applause again as it was announced that the Catholic Church, for the first time in its history, has a leader from the U.S.",

      "Who is the new pope?",
      "The Chicago-born pope is also a citizen of Peru, where he worked for many years. He was made a cardinal by Pope Francis in September 2023.",
      "His most recent role was as the head of the church's Dicastery for Bishops, meaning he oversaw the selection of new bishops.",
      "Overall, he's considered a centrist, but on many social issues he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine.",
      "How does the duration of the 2025 conclave compare to past conclaves?",
      "The conclave to choose a successor to Pope Francis began on Wednesday afternoon, local time. The 133 cardinal electors taking part in the process prayed together and took a vow of secrecy before the doors closed and the first round of votes were cast. As night fell, black smoke rose from the Sistine Chapel's chimney, indicating they had not yet agreed on a choice.",
      "On Thursday morning, the cardinals resumed the process for Day 2\u00a0and, yet again, before lunch time in Rome, black smoke signaled no decisive outcome from the morning's round of two votes. The white smoke came after another vote Thursday afternoon, local time \u2014 less than 24 hours after the conclave began.",
      "In recent history, conclaves have tended to only last a couple of days, and this year's followed suit.",
      "Some past conclaves, however, dragged on much longer. The longest one ever, in the 13th century, took almost three years to choose Pope Gregory X.",
      "The shortest conclave on record, in 1503, took just 10 hours to choose Pope Pius III.",
      "How long was the conclave that elected Pope Francis?",

      "Pope Francis, who died at 88 last month, was the first pontiff to be publicly inclusive of the LGBTQ Catholic community. He didn't change doctrine, but he changed the conversation by voicing support for legal civil unions, personally meeting with LGBTQ groups and extending blessings to individuals in same-sex unions.",
      "\"Francis was really a breath of fresh air, and a revolutionary in the way he was telling Church leaders to approach and relate to LGBTQ people,\" said Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, a Catholic outreach that educates about and advocates for LGBTQ persons.",
      "DeBernardo said the previous two popes before Francis held anti-gay views, probably the most strident in the Church's history. Under Francis, the papacy adopted a different tone toward the LGBTQ community.",
      "Some clergy and Catholics within the community hoped\u00a0the conclave\u00a0\u2014 in which\u00a0some front-runners appear to share Francis' inclusive views \u2014 will continue along his path.",
      "\"Who am I to judge?\"",
      "Just four months after Francis became pope in 2013, he created controversy when, during a July inflight press conference, he responded to a journalist's question about gay clergy members. He said: \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\" Francis' answer went against years of Catholic precedent.",
      "These words, which reverberated worldwide, set a very different tone from the previous relationship the Church had with gay clergy and members. His predecessors John Paul II and Benedict XVI were far less accepting of LGBTQ people. Benedict XVI published the first modern formal statement denouncing homosexuality in 1986.",
      "The treatise was written by Benedict while he was still a cardinal under Pope John Paul II. John Paul endorsed Benedict's message, and he also explicitly denounced legal recognition for same-sex marriage. Those sentiments prevailed in 2003 when the Vatican officially opposed same-sex unions.",
      "In response to the Vatican's hardline stances, LGBTQ people held protests during John Paul's 1987 U.S. visit. During his trip he stopped in multiple cities, but the resistance was most notable during his time in San Francisco. San Francisco was reeling from the AIDS epidemic and during the visit, the pope was met with activists holding protest signs and participating in candlelight processions and prayer vigils, hoping to enact change.",
      "In the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which is an official document that outlines Catholic beliefs, the Church still views homosexual acts as \"intrinsically immoral and contrary to the natural law.\" The text says that homosexual tendencies are \"objectively disordered.\"",
      "Cristina Traina, a professor in the Theology department at Fordham University, says the language used in the catechism to describe homosexuality doesn't easily translate into everyday life.",
      "\"You could read [\"objectively disordered\"] as just a technical term, but people read it as fundamentally evil and broken,\" Traina said. \"It's a technical term, but it certainly does not work pastorally.\"",
      "With his public comments, Pope Francis began to change the narrative. Francis called homosexuality \"a human fact,\" during a May 2024 interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell. He personally met with LGBTQ Catholic groups, including DeBernardo's New Ways Ministry, and he clarified that transgender people can be baptized and serve as godparents.",
      "Potential for continued progress",
      "Traina sees the potential for continued progress within the Church despite the death of Pope Francis, because attitudes among everyday Catholics have changed.",
      "\"These things change on the ground and in practice, and then they change at the Vatican, and that's the last thing that changes,\" Traina said.",
      "A 2020 study from UCLA's Williams Institute found that there were approximately 11.3 million LGBTQ adults in the U.S., and about 5.3 million of them are religious, including about 1.3 million who are Roman Catholics.",
      "Although 69%\u00a0of Americans support same-sex marriage, political figures such as Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic convert, continue to push for traditional family values and support laws allowing for religious exemptions to LGBTQ protections. While campaigning for his U.S. Senate seat in 2022, one of the laws he said he would vote \"no\" for is the Respect for Marriage Act, which provided federal protections for same-sex and interracial marriages.",
      "Teresa Thompson is a member of Catholic Lesbians at the Church of St. Francis Xavier in New York. Catholic Lesbians was founded in 1995 and has over 300 members.",
      "Thompson, who grew up Catholic, started to distance herself from religion during college, which also coincidentally was when she came out as a lesbian. Although her move away from religion was not due to her sexuality, she felt as though she couldn't return to Catholicism. That began to shift when Francis adopted a more compassionate tone toward LGBTQ people, and Thompson discovered communities that welcomed her.",
      "Ahead of the conclave, Thompson expressed hope that the next pope will continue the work Francis started.",
      "\"I think there's a sense of nervousness, not being sure what is going to happen,\" Thompson said. \"If we look at the structure of the College of Cardinals, Francis appointed so many cardinals that it seems unlikely we would \u2026 go back, but also, who's to say?\"",
      "Sister Jeannine Gramick, co-founder of New Ways Ministry, believes the next pope will mirror the path of Pope Francis rather than undo his legacy.",
      "\"My sense is that the cardinal electors will elect somebody who [will follow] in the footsteps of Pope Francis,\" Gramick said. \"So if that proves correct, then the changes that Pope Francis brought about will not be undone.\"",
      "In her conversations with LGBTQ Catholics, Gramick says that she senses a lot of hope for the future, and there is hope for a pope who will go even further than Francis did.",
      "\"[LGBTQ] people, they're looking for more changes, and I think the primary change they're looking for is to change the sexual ethics teaching of the church,\" Gramick said. \"The catechism has not been changed yet.\"",

      "\"I am voting for Cardinal Tagle to be the first Filipino pope,\" Thompson said. \"I think in character and ideas, he's very similar to Francis, and I used to live in the Philippines, so I also have a special place in my heart for the idea of a Filipino pope.\"",

      "Although Thompson is throwing her personal support behind Cardinal Tagle, she urges the electorate to set aside their political motivations while casting their votes.",
      "\"I really hope this will be a moment where leaders can practice what they preach,\" Thompson said. \"In Ignatian spirituality, there's a practice of making decisions through discernment, [where you] let go ... of your preconceived notions [and] allow the Holy Spirit to guide you. ...

      "Update: American\u00a0Cardinal Robert Prevost has been chosen as the new pope and took the name Leo XIV \u2014 the first pope in history from the United States.",
      "Pope Francis' death on April 21, the day after he made his last appearance on Easter Sunday, kicked off a series of traditions that culminated on Thursday with some of the Catholic Church's most senior prelates voting to elect a new pope. A group of 133 cardinal electors \u2014 cardinals under the age of 80 \u2014 entered the Sistine Chapel on May 7 for the\u00a0conclave, holding a series of\u00a0secret ballots\u00a0to choose the next pontiff.",
      "\"Every papal conclave comes down, in some sense, to a referendum on the papacy that has just ended,\" John Allen, a longtime observer of the Vatican and editor of the Catholic news site Crux, said.",
      "While several of the likely front-runners going into the conclave represented continuity with the direction set\u00a0by Pope Francis, he said, others would signal \"a change in a slightly more traditional, conservative direction.\"",
      "No matter their leanings, Allen said, the cardinal electors would want someone who can equal Pope Francis' stature on the world stage. \"They want, in part, someone who can have the same capacity to make it absolutely impossible for the wider world to ignore what the Catholic Church has to say.\"",
      "Over the last 600 years \u2014 since 1378 \u2014 cardinals have been chosen for the position, although eligibility technically extends to any male Roman Catholic who has been baptized.",
      "\"This is the world's oldest democratic exercise. It is an election,\" Allen told CBS News.",
      "And while \"Catholics believe that all of this unfolds under the guidance of the Holy Spirit,\" Allen said \"the fact that this is a supernatural process doesn't make it any less human, and therefore, doesn't it make it any less political.\"",
      "Here is a look at some of the cardinals who were considered possible contenders to become pope:",
      "Cardinal Peter Erdo, archbishop of Budapest, Hungary",
      "Cardinal Peter Erdo, a 72-year-old canon lawyer, is the highest ranking Catholic leader in a country that is 80% Christian. He is known for his support of the pope's outreach to Orthodox Christians.",
      "Erdo is also on the conservative side of the European cultural divide. On migration, a key issue for Hungary, he has conveyed a balanced approach, recognizing the right to migrate but also the importance of ensuring political stability.",
      "Erdo is considered a traditionalist but is also respected by liberals, which could make him a unifying force within the church.",
      "Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo, archbishop of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo",
      "Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo, president of the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar, grew global attention for leading African bishops in unanimous rejection of \"Fiducia Supplicans,\" a declaration the Vatican issued in 2023 that included guidelines on the blessings of people in same-sex relationships.",
      "At 65 years old, he is known as a supporter of orthodoxy and defends priestly celibacy and the church's moral teachings. He is also known as a promoter of social justice and a champion of the poor and voiceless, and is outspoken in his criticism of the Congolese government.",
      "If elected he would be the first African chosen to lead the Catholic Church in more than 1,500 years. The last African pontiff was Pope Gelasius, who died in 496 after leading the church for a little over three years.",
      "Cardinal Mario Grech, secretary general for the Synod of Bishops",
      "Cardinal Mario Grech, 68, is a canon lawyer who has major influence on how synods in the church are run. Supporters have praised him for leading the charge in implementing a more consultative and inclusive approach to church governance.",
      "Grech comes from Malta, which is one of the smallest countries in the world.",
      "Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state",
      "Cardinal Pietro Parolin, 70, is second-in-command at the Vatican and a career diplomat who has consistently risen above any turbulence marking the pontificate.",
      "John Allen, the Crux editor, sees him as a front-runner.",
      "\"The point of reference for this conclave is almost certainly Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the man who was Pope Francis' Secretary of State \u2014 his right-hand man for 12 years.\"",
      "He is regarded as a moderate who, if elected, could repair rifts inside the church. He is also considered a progressive with a global vision.",
      "But while Parolin has garnered a lot of speculation as a contender heading into the conclave, Allen cautioned against any notion of a sure thing in papal politics.",
      "\"There's a famous Italian saying, that he who enters a conclave as a pope, exits a cardinal \u2014 meaning that if you're getting a lot of buzz, you're not going to be elected,\" he said.",
      "Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, Latin patriarch of Jerusalem",
      "Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, 60, is a pastoral candidate who has spoken out amid the Israel-Hamas war and visited Gaza during the conflict.",
      "He is a proponent of social justice and sees himself as a servant of the people. He is similar to Francis in his concern for migrants, interfaith dialogue and his disdain for clericalism.",
      "Cardinal Luis Tagle of the Philippines",
      "Cardinal Luis Tagle, 67, pro-prefect for the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, is known as the \"Asian Francis\" for his missionary spirit as well as his emphasis on caring for the poor and welcoming of LGBTQ and divorced and remarried Catholics.",
      "He is the former archbishop of Manila, in the Philippines, which is one of the most Catholic countries on the continent of Asia, and studied in the U.S. for seven years. His election would signal a continuation of Francis' pontificate.",
      "If elected he would become the first Asian pontiff in modern times.",
      "Cardinal Pablo Virgilio David of the Philippines",
      "Another Filipino, Cardinal Pablo Virgilio David, was also being spoken of ahead of the conclave as a potential new pontiff.",
      "David, often known as Cardinal Ambo, was one of the last cardinals appointed by Francis, gaining the rank only about five months ago.",
      "He attended the same school, led by Jesuit priests, as his compatriot Tagle during the 1970s. David gained notoriety for taking a firm and public stand against the alleged human rights abuses of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.",
      "In his role as a bishop, David focused much of his work on helping the poor and other social issues. His fellow Asian bishops chose him to lead a commission dedicated to making the church \"more inclusive,\" in his own words.",
      "Cardinal Robert Prevost of the United States",
      "Chicago-born Cardinal Robert Prevost is seen as having many of the qualities desired in a pope, and if elected, he would become the first U.S. pope in the church's history.",
      "Prevost is the head of the church's Dicastery for Bishops, meaning he oversees the selection of new bishops. It's a powerful position, and for any cardinal electors who may be turned off by his American nationality, it's not his only one. Prevost is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Peru, where he served for many years.",
      "Overall, he's considered a centrist, but on many social issues he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine.",
      "His age could also be a factor \u2014   at 69 some may consider him too young to hold the church's highest office.",
      "Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, archbishop of Bologna, Italy",
      "Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, 69, is the president of the Italian bishops conference. He is known as a \"street priest\" and missionary and wants a church that listens to the faithful and is willing to modernize. Zuppi is inclusive of same-sex couples, as well as people of different religions.",
      "Francis chose Zuppi as his envoy to Russia and Ukraine, as well as to the West Bank and Beijing, to promote peace.",
      "Cardinal Anders Arborelius, archbishop of Stockholm",
      "Cardinal Anders Arborelius, 75, was raised Lutheran and converted to Catholicism at the age of 20. He is the first ever cardinal from Scandinavia.",
      "He is also a traditionalist on the church's teaching on sexual ethics and gender, and has a strong concern for the environment.",
      "Arborelius has been a proponent of immigration into Sweden, calling for dialogue and integration instead of restrictions.",
      "Cardinal Gerald Cyprien Lacroix of Quebec",
      "Cardinal G\u00e9rald Cyprien Lacroix, Metropolitan Archbishop of Quebec, Canada, is 67 years old. Earlier in his career he spent years as a missionary and seminary professor in Colombia.",
      "He temporarily stepped back from his duties amid sexual abuse allegations, which he denied, and returned to his duties last year after a church-led investigation found no evidence of misconduct.",
      "Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana",
      "Conservative-leaning Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana would, like Ambongo, be the Catholic Church's first contemporary African pope if selected.",
      "But the Ghanaian, who was the first man from his country to be made a cardinal, is considered a less hard-line conservative than his Congolese counterpart.",
      "The 76-year-old has opposed the criminalization of homosexual relationships in Africa, including in his home country.",
      "In 2012, he was criticized for fear-mongering about Islam in Europe during a Vatican conference, and he later apologized.",
      "The following year, he told BBC News he didn't want the Catholic Church's top job, saying, \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope.\"",
      "Cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline of France",
      "At 66, French Cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline, the Archbishop of Marseille, is on the younger side compared to many of his fellow prelates. If chosen as the next pope, he would be the first Frenchman to hold the position since Gregory XI died in 1378.",
      "Aveline, who was born in Algeria under French colonial rule but grew up in Marseille, is considered a progressive on issues such as immigration, as was Pope Francis.",
      "He has spoken out about drug trafficking networks based in Marseille, and helped to establish an institution that encourages interfaith dialogue between Catholics, Muslims and Jews.",
      "Aveline was considered a favorite of Pope Francis, but some believe his chances as a papal candidate could be harmed by the fact that he doesn't speak Italian.",

      "The most senior members of the Catholic Church have begun the process of\u00a0choosing a successor\u00a0to the late Pope Francis. The cardinal electors gathered inside the Vatican's Sistine Chapel on Wednesday for the start of the secretive, centuries-old ritual known as the conclave to pick a new pontiff.",
      "Behind closed doors in the chapel, they will hold as many rounds of voting as prove necessary to select the 267th leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the process and how long it might take.",
      "When does the 2025 papal conclave start?",
      "The conclave\u00a0began on Wednesday \u2014 16 days after Pope Francis' death. The conclave continued Thursday after no pope was chosen in the first rounds of voting.",
      "It's one of the oldest methods of electing a head of state that's still in use today, and its basic protocols have barely changed for 800 years.",
      "In order to become a pope, a candidate need only be Catholic and male. However, for centuries, popes have only been chosen from among the Catholic cardinals, the church's most senior officials.",
      "The conclave takes place in the Sistine Chapel, behind sealed doors. Along with all Vatican staff involved in the process, the cardinal electors take an oath of secrecy, and the chapel is swept for listening devices.",
      "To be elected pope, a candidate must garner two-thirds of the votes plus one. If the first round isn't conclusive, voting continues into a second day.",
      "The 133 cardinal electors participating this time held their first round of voting Wednesday evening, local time, and did not agree on a new pope.",
      "From the second day onward, there are two rounds of voting each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.",
      "If there is no two-thirds majority after three days of voting, the process is paused for a day to allow time for the cardinals to pray and discuss their options.",
      "How long have conclaves taken to choose new popes in the past?",
      "There is no time limit set for how long a conclave can take. The cardinal electors continue to vote until a two-third-plus-one majority is achieved.",
      "The shortest conclave on record was in 1503, when it took the cardinals only 10 hours to choose Pope Pius III as the new pontiff.",
      "The longest conclave on record took nearly three years.",
      "The election of a successor to Pope Clement IV in 1268 dragged on for so long \u2014 about 1,000 days \u2014 that locals in the town of Viterbo, where it was held, locked the cardinals in the room where they had gathered until they reached a decision.",
      "That is where the name still used for the process of selecting a new pope \u2014 \"conclave,\" which translates to \"under lock and key\" \u2014 came from.",
      "After that marathon conclave, Pope Gregory X was finally elected in September of 1271.",
      "How long is the 2025 papal conclave expected to last?",
      "There is no way to predict how long a conclave will take, but guidance can perhaps be taken from recent history.",
      "The last three popes have been elected in two or three days.",
      "In 2013, Pope Francis was elected after five ballots held over two days. In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI was elected after four ballots. In 1978, Pope John Paul II was elected over two days after eight ballots.",
      "Vatican watcher John Allen, the editor of the Catholic news outlet Crux, believes this conclave may well follow that pattern, and we could expect a new pope to be named by the end of the week.",
      "Why does the papal conclave use white smoke?",
      "After each round of voting, the paper ballots are burned. If a pope has not been elected, black smoke rises from the chimney above the chapel. If a pope has been elected, white smoke rises.",
      "Initially, only black smoke was part of the conclave tradition, rising from the chimney as a result of ballots being burned after an unsuccessful round of voting.",
      "White smoke was first used in 1914, when Cardinals decided the light colored smoke should announce the selection of a new pope, Georgtown University reported.",
      "Now, to ensure the result of each ballot is clear, chemicals are burned alongside the ballots in each round to color the smoke black or white.",

      "In a 211 to 206 vote, all but one Republican supporting the measure, which was introduced by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia in January and instructs federal agencies to update all documents and maps to reflect the name change within six months of enactment. It now goes to the Senate.",
      "Even if the name change is codified into U.S. law, however, other countries would be under no obligation to refer to the Gulf of Mexico by the new name. If it isn't codified, a future president could reverse Mr. Trump's executive order.",
      "Greene lauded the measure ahead of the vote Thursday morning, calling it \"one of the most important things that we can do this Congress,\" while claiming that Democrats are catering to Mexican cartels by opposing the name change.",
      "\"This is such an important thing to do for the American people,\" Greene said. \"The American people deserve pride in their country and they deserve pride in the waters that we own, that we protect with our military and our coastguard.\"",
      "Democrats have called the effort a waste of taxpayer dollars and said Congress should be spending its time on more serious issues. GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska was the sole Republican to oppose the measure.",
      "Bacon publicly disagreed with his Republican colleagues, telling CNN earlier this week that the effort to rename the body of water \"seems juvenile.\"",
      "\"We're the United States of America,\" he said. \"We're not Kaiser Wilhelm's Germany or Napoleon's France. I just \u2014 we're better than this. It just sounds like a sophomore thing to do.\"",

      "An estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that it would cost less than $500,000 over five years to update federal documents and maps.

The Associated Press sued over the restrictions and a federal judge ruled that the White House restore its access to the Oval Office, Air Force One and other spaces and events when they are open to other reporters.",
      "Whether the Senate will take up the measure remains unclear. Unlike the House, the bill would require support from a number of Democrats to move forward in the upper chamber.

    "summary": "Bill Gates\u200b announced\u200b on Thursday that the Gates Foundation will close \"permanently\" at the end of 2045.",
    "story": [
      "Melinda French Gates entered some of the most powerful circles while leading the foundation she co-founded with her ex-husband, Bill Gates, who announced on Thursday that it will close \"permanently\" at the end of 2045.",
      "French Gates, who studied computer science and worked at Microsoft, the company Gates created, exited the Gates Foundation last year to pursue philanthropy and investment through her own organization, Pivotal Ventures, which she started in 2015. The foundation changed its name from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation after her departure, which she previously described an \"evolution\" rather than a sudden move.",
      "French Gates offered written responses to The Associated Press' questions about the foundation's 25th anniversary and its decision to close in 20 years. She said the former couple had always intended to spend down their resources.",
      "\"Ultimately, though,\" she wrote, \"the timeline was Bill's decision to make with the board of trustees.\" Bill Gates says he will give away virtually all of his wealth over the next 20 years through the foundation, telling \"CBS Mornings\" that he hopes to live long enough to see some of the positive ways it has helped communities.",
      "The foundation has focused on tackling global challenges, including poverty, disease and inequity.",
      "The following responses from French Gates have been edited for length.",
      "Q: What do you hope the foundation's legacy will be?",
      "A: To me, the greatest measure of success would be if long after the foundation closed, someone, somewhere, was living a life that looked different because we existed. We talked a lot there about unlocking virtuous cycles. I like to think that right now, the foundation's work is contributing to a child getting a vaccine or a woman opening her first bank account \u2014 and that decades from now, their families and communities are going to continue to look different, because of what that child and that woman unlocked for the people around them.",
      "Q: What specific areas did you influence at the foundation?",
      "A: I was excited for us to launch the\u00a0Giving Pledge\u00a0because I believe that the most responsible thing to do with great wealth is give it away \u2014 and that you have an obligation to society to give it away as effectively as possible. I think it's important for people in that position to set norms around giving generously and to learn as much as possible from each other about how to be effective in their philanthropy.",
      "(As for gender), for too long, global health and development efforts treated women and girls as secondary \u2014 if they were considered at all. Data wasn't collected on their experiences. Their specific health needs were often ignored.",
      "There were so many questions that needed to be asked: What is the cost of all the unpaid labor women do at home? Will mobile banking make a difference if women don't have equal access to cellphones? Why are so many infectious diseases especially dangerous for women?",
      "We opened a gender equality division, but not just that \u2014 we made gender equality a priority across all of our work. And we put a lot of resources into expanding access to contraception, starting with a big commitment we made in 2012.",
      "Q: Why did you invest in opening more offices in other countries?",
      "A: When you're doing this kind of work, it doesn't take long to see that solutions that seem great on paper may not work in reality. We funded community toilets in India that people \u2014 especially women \u2014wouldn't use because they were dangerous to go to at night. We funded vaccines in Vietnam that had to be kept cold, but came in packaging that didn't fit into the small refrigerators most people had there. We funded a simple pump to help East African farmers irrigate their land, but women \u2014 who account for half of all smallholder farmers \u2014 wouldn't buy it, because they didn't want to be seen swaying their hips in the way the pump required.",
      "There are many ways to learn about the cultural norms and logistical issues that determine whether a solution is feasible \u2014 and they all boil down to engaging people with local knowledge and lived experience, and trusting what they tell you.",
      "Q: Some foundation goals \u2014 like eradicating polio and controlling malaria \u2014 depend on the generosity of other countries and donors. How can you accomplish those goals given recent cuts to international aid?",
      "A: It's easy for people to forget \u2014 or maybe they didn't ever know \u2014 how hopeless the situation seemed around the year 2000, when malaria, tuberculosis and HIV were totally out of control. Since then, efforts funded, in large part, by development aid have saved more than 65 million lives from those diseases alone.",
      "No doubt the work has just gotten a lot harder, but we never thought it was going to be easy. And we still have the key ingredients of success. The pipeline of innovations has never been stronger. More lower-income countries are taking a leading role. As some donors announce cuts, others are stepping up.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/conclave-pope-smoke-black-white-history/",
    "published": "Thu, 08 May 2025 10:08:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's how the conclave creates black and white smoke and why the Catholic Church began using them to signal whether a new pope has been elected.",
    "story": [
      "Black smoke rising from the Sistine Chapel chimney on Wednesday and again Thursday morning indicated that a new pope had not yet been chosen to replace Pope Francis.",
      "Using smoke to communicate to the public whether a new pope has been elected is somewhat a recent tradition for the Catholic Church. Cardinal electors in the conclave, which originates from a Latin word meaning \"with key,\" are locked away with no contact to the outside world. So they use one of the oldest methods of long-distance communication: smoke signals.",
      "What black and white smoke means",
      "After the cardinals' votes are counted, the paper ballots are burned in a stove in the Sistine Chapel. Black smoke emerging from the chimney means the world's 1.4 billion Catholics don't yet have a new pope. White smoke means the cardinals have chosen a new leader of the church.",
      "Why the Vatican uses smoke to announce a pope",
      "Smoke signals have been used for communication for millennia, Clare Johnson, professor of Liturgical Studies and Sacramental Theology at Australian Catholic University wrote in an article published in\u00a0The Conversation. They have been used as a warning, a call to gather or to transmit news \u2014 and many Indigenous peoples use sophisticated techniques to indicate specific messages.",
      "\"These techniques can include changing the location of the fire (such as halfway up or at the top of a hill), adjusting the colour of smoke (using different types of foliage or damp/dry foliage) and the interruption or diversion of the smoke column at different intervals to produce particular patterns of smoke,\" Johnson wrote.",
      "Cardinals of the conclave have been burning ballots since at least 1417, according to the professor, but it wasn't until the 18th century that the Sistine Chapel had its first chimney installed. After that, smoke at certain times meant a new pope had not been elected and the absence of smoke indicated that the was a new pope, according to Johnson.",
      "The first time white smoke was the indicator that a new pope was elected was in 1914. The previous pope, Pius X, had mandated in 1904 that all papers related to the election, not just the ballots, be burned, \"thus producing a great deal more white smoke for the final ballot and making it truly visible,\" historian Frederic J. Baumgartner wrote in his book, \"Behind Locked Doors: A History of the Papal Elections.\"",
      "Johnson also noted, \"A stereotypical association of the colour of the smoke \u2014 white (positive) and black (negative) \u2014 lies behind the use of the two contrasting smoke colours.\"",
      "How the conclave creates black and white smoke",
      "Over the years, the conclave has used different methods to create black and white smoke.",
      "After some confusion in past conclaves, including in 1958, when smoke first appeared white and then became darker, the conclave began using chemicals to get the proper color.",
      "In 2013, former Vatican spokesperson Federico Lombardi\u00a0revealed that the cardinals added cartridges containing potassium perchlorate, anthracene \u2014 a component of coal tar \u2014 and sulfur to the burned ballots to create black smoke. And if a new pope has been elected, potassium chlorate, lactose and chloroform resin would be added to produce white smoke.",
      "Has a pope ever been elected on the first ballot?",
      "It is possible for a pope to be elected on the first ballot, but a pope hasn't received the two-third majority on the first ballot in recent elections.",
      "The shortest conclave on record was in 1503, when it took the cardinals only 10 hours to choose Pope Pius III as the new pontiff. The late Pope Francis was elected in two days with five ballots and the two popes before him had been elected in two or three days.",
      "The longest conclave on record dragged on for nearly three years. Pope Gregory X was finally elected in September of 1271 after about 1,000 days.",

      "The billionaire businessman and philanthropist revealed exclusively to \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday that he will give away virtually all of his wealth over the next 20 years through the Gates Foundation. He says a total of $200 billion will go toward causes that will help save and improve lives around the world.",
      "\"By deciding to spend all this money in the next 20 years, we can get a lot more done,\" Gates said in an interview taped last week, days before he announced the initiative. He's confident the money will save \"tens of millions of lives.\"",
      "A change of plans",
      "It's a decision Gates did not take lightly, explaining in a letter posted online Thursday that he was inspired by a famous quote from Andrew Carnegie's 1889 essay \"The Gospel of Wealth,\" which argued \"the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.\"",
      "Gates said his net worth, which is currently $108 billion, will drop 99% over the next two decades.",
      "\"People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that 'he died rich' will not be one of them. There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold onto resources that could be used to help people,\" Gates wrote.",
      "So, he changed his plans. The Gates Foundation, which was originally supposed to shutter decades after his and ex-wife Melinda French Gates' deaths, will now close in 2045.",
      "The Gates Foundation, which is marking its 25th anniversary this year, has already spent $100 billion to help cut the global childhood mortality rate by investing in medical innovations. Gates said he's seen firsthand how impactful the distribution of vaccines for illnesses like diarrhea and pneumonia can be. That's why he's determined to \"double down.\"",
      "He has three main goals: stopping the deaths of mothers and children from preventable causes, eradicating deadly infectious diseases, and putting more countries on a path to prosperity \u2014 with a focus on improving education.",
      "Gates says more children could die due to Trump administration aid cuts",
      "But he's concerned progress could be stalled as the U.S. and European countries scale back on foreign aid and reduce humanitarian funding.",
      "In 2023, an estimated 4.8 million children died before reaching the age of 5, according to a UNICEF report released in March. Without substantial government assistance, Gates says that number will rise.",
      "\"So we should be going from 5 million children dying a year over the next five years to 4 million. And now with these cuts, if they're not reversed, we will go to over 6 million dying. So, instead of going down, we will go back up,\" Gates said.",
      "Gates said he's been in touch with President Trump and had a \"great discussion\" about some of his foundation's initiatives, including HIV prevention and polio, over dinner at Mar-a-Lago in December.",
      "\"Since then, some of the programs have been cut off,\" Gates said. \"And I'm hoping, both with the president or the Congress, to get them to restore some of those aid activities.\"",
      "On the first day of his second term, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to start the country's withdrawal from the World Health Organization. In March, the Trump administration revealed plans to shrink the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 a major overhaul that impacted thousands of employees. Part of his plans to slash federal spending also included the suspension of U.S. foreign aid assistance, essentially gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "Last week, a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget said Mr. Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 also includes \"enormous cuts to foreign aid,\" focusing more on \"targeted\" foreign aid in situations when it's in the interest of the U.S.",
      "The Gates Foundation isn't large enough to replace U.S. foreign aid. In fiscal 2024 alone, the U.S. federal government disbursed nearly $72 billion in foreign aid, according to the Pew Research Center, which cited ForeignAssistance.gov. The U.S. federal government spent four times more on global health than the Gates foundation, Gates said.",
      "\"You always want more money going into these things where you're saving lives for a few thousand dollars. And I will be an advocate for that,\" said Gates, praising global health initiatives spearheaded by former President George W. Bush \u2014 like his Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief launched in 2003 \u2014 which he says should be maintained.",
      "\"The last stage\" of a long career",
      "Gates, who is turning 70 years old this fall, said this move marks the beginning of the \"last chapter\" in his career. But he certainly hopes he's around to see the impact it makes.",
      "\"Well, I wish I had even more time. But I have to say, 'OK, this is the last part of my life. And I'm a steward of these resources,'\" he told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"I should make sure that it's well spent. And now this is the last stage of all that.\"",

      "The Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus a half century ago is expected to plunge uncontrolled back to Earth within hours. The Aerospace Corporation's reentry prediction map\u00a0currently forecasts the object to come down at 03:37 UTC on Saturday, or 10:37 p.m. ET.",
      "It's too early to know where the half-ton mass of metal might come down or how much of it will survive reentry, according to space debris-tracking experts.",

      "Given its orbit, the spacecraft could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, Langbroek wrote in a\u00a0blog post.

Still, most of the Earth is covered by water so the risk to humans remains low.",

      "It's quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek.",

      "The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America's Cape Horn.

    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 The strange reproductive habits of a large, carnivorous New Zealand snail were once shrouded in mystery. Now, footage of the snail laying an egg from its neck has been captured for the first time, the country's conservation agency said Wednesday.",
      "What looks like a tiny hen's egg is seen emerging from an opening below the head of the Powelliphanta augusta snail, a threatened species endemic to New Zealand.",
      "The video was taken at a facility on the South Island's West Coast, where conservation rangers attempting to save the species from extinction have cared for a population of the snails in chilled containers for nearly two decades.",
      "The conditions in the containers mimic the alpine weather in their only former habitat - a remote mountain they were named for, on the West Coast of the South Island, that has been engulfed by mining.",
      "Lisa Flanagan from the Department of Conservation, who has worked with the creatures for 12 years, said the species still holds surprises.",
      "\"It's remarkable that in all the time we've spent caring for the snails, this is the first time we've seen one lay an egg,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Like other snails, Powelliphanta augusta are hermaphrodites, which explains how the creatures can reproduce when encased in a hard shell. The invertebrate uses a genital pore on the right side of its body, just below the head, to simultaneously exchange sperm with another snail, which is stored until each creates an egg.",
      "Each snail takes eight years to reach sexual maturity, after which it lays about five eggs a year. The egg can take more than a year to hatch.",
      "\"Some of our captive snails are between 25 and 30 years old,\" said Flanagan. \"They're polar opposites to the pest garden snail we introduced to New Zealand, which is like a weed, with thousands of offspring each year and a short life.\"",
      "The dozens of species and subspecies of Powelliphanta snails are only found in New Zealand, mostly in rugged forest and grassland settings where they're threatened by habitat loss.",
      "They're carnivores that slurp up earthworms like noodles and are some of the world's largest snails with oversized, distinctive shells in a range of rich earth colors and swirling patterns.",

    "story": [
      "Vatican City\u00a0\u2014 All the Vatican staff who will be involved in the 2025 conclave to pick the late Pope Francis' successor \u2014 from the cleaners to the cooks and custodians \u2014 have taken their oath of secrecy. The punishment for leaking information about the ancient Catholic Church ritual is immediate excommunication.",
      "The 133 cardinal electors tasked with electing the next pontiff\u00a0took their own oaths on Wednesday, inside the Sistine Chapel, as the conclave officially got underway.",
      "In the days prior, they were seen going in and out of meetings to discuss the merits of the men among their own ranks \u2014 any one of whom could be chosen as the next pope, the leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics.",
      "Among the issues that differentiate the presumed frontrunners for the job are some extremely controversial topics for Catholics, including exactly how far the church should open its doors \u2014 if at all \u2014 to people like Andrea Rubera, his husband, and their three children.",
      "Rubera, who has been in his same-sex relationship for years, told CBS News that \"when Pope Francis died, I cried.\"",
      "A decade ago, Rubera and his husband were struggling over whether they could raise their kids Catholic. Then he got a phone call.",
      "\"So I answered, and it was: 'Mr. Rubera, are you busy at the moment, because I see you are you are not answering my calls, and this is Pope Francis.'\"",
      "He recalled his surprise as the late pontiff asked if he could make time to talk. He did, and Francis encouraged the couple to behave like any other Catholic family. Rubera said he's worried that the next pope may not be as eager to welcome him and his family into the church.",
      "\"My personal fear is that our lives, our families, our rights, could be ... canceled,\" he said.",
      "Another big issue facing the next pope will be the role of women in the church. There has been fierce debate within the Catholic community for years about whether women should be allowed to become deacons, and eventually even priests. That door, even during the relatively progressive reign of Pope Francis, remained firmly closed.",
      "But Kate McElwee, executive director of the Women's Ordination Conference, told CBS News that, \"on this question, women are not going to wait much longer.\"",
      "\"Certainly there's a tipping point that we're facing,\" she said, predicting that if the Catholic Church doesn't offer new opportunities soon, \"I think women will vote with their feet \u2014 they will no longer go and participate in the life of the church.\"",
      "When the new pope is chosen behind the closed doors of the conclave, he'll adopt his chosen papal name and then be taken to an antechamber in the Sistine Chapel to put on his papal white robes.",
      "That fitting room is called \"La Stanza delle Lacrime,\" or, in English, \"the room of tears\" \u2014 for all the popes who have cried there over the centuries as the gravity of their calling sinks in.",

      "The industrialization of credential theft",
      "In 2024, cybersecurity researchers at Fortinet observed a staggering surge in stolen login data being traded on the dark web. Over 1.7 billion credentials were harvested not from old breaches but through active infections on users\u2019 devices.",
      "At the heart of this epidemic is a class of malware called infostealers, which are programs designed specifically to extract sensitive information like usernames, passwords, browser cookies, email logins, crypto wallets and session tokens. Unlike large-scale data breaches that target centralized databases, infostealers operate on individual machines. They don\u2019t break into a company\u2019s servers; they compromise the end user, often without the victim ever noticing.",
      "These logs are then aggregated and sold by initial access brokers, intermediaries who sell compromised credentials and access tokens to other cybercriminal groups, including ransomware operators. The market has matured to the point where access to a corporate VPN, an admin dashboard or even a personal bank account can be purchased at scale, with verified functionality and region-specific pricing.",
      "Fortinet\u2019s 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report identified a 500% increase in credential logs from infostealer infections over the past year. Among the most widespread and dangerous infostealers identified in the report are RedLine, Vidar and Raccoon.",

      "How infostealers work",
      "Infostealers are typically distributed through phishing emails, malicious browser extensions, fake software installers or cracked applications. Once installed on a device, they scan browser databases, autofill records, saved passwords and local files for any credential-related data. Many also look for digital wallets, FTP credentials and cloud service logins.",
      "Crucially, many infostealers also exfiltrate session tokens and authentication cookies, meaning that even users who rely on multifactor authentication are not entirely safe. With a stolen session token, an attacker can bypass multifactor authentication entirely and assume control of the session without ever needing to log in manually.",
      "Once collected, the data is uploaded to a command and control server. From there, it's either used directly by attackers or bundled into logs and sold on forums. These logs can include everything from the victim\u2019s IP address and geolocation to their browser fingerprint and full credential list, giving attackers everything they need to carry out further exploitation or impersonation.",

      "With infostealer malware becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are five effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager. Our No. 1 pick has a\u00a0built-in\u00a0Data Breach Scanner that lets you check if your information has been exposed in known breaches.\u00a0Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "5. Consider a personal data removal service: These services can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, reducing your risk of identity theft, spam and targeted scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

They\u2019re evidence of an evolving, industrialized cybercrime economy built on the backs of unsuspecting users and quietly infected devices.

      "The display sits at just an inch thick but packs a punch with 5K resolution (5,120 x 2,880 pixels) at 60 Hz, delivering up to 16 inches of virtual depth and 8-bit color. The result? Real-time 3D visuals that look and feel like they\u2019re actually present in the room.",
      "But what really sets this display apart is its ability to create a shared 3D experience. Unlike traditional VR or AR setups that require each participant to wear a headset, the Looking Glass 27 can project up to 100 unique perspectives across a 53-degree viewing cone. This means a team can gather around a single screen and see the same digital object from different angles, just as they would with a real-world prototype or artifact.",

Content creation starts on a computer running Unity, but the finished product can be deployed on an iPad, which also powers the display and serves as its interface. This approach reduces system costs by about 35% compared to previous models and makes deployment far more flexible. The display also supports Blender, Unreal Engine, WebXR and Looking Glass\u2019 own Studio and Bridge tools, making it compatible with a wide range of 3D workflows.",
      "The display is designed for versatility. It can sit on a desk or be mounted on a wall, and it\u2019s available in both portrait and landscape configurations (though you\u2019ll need to pick one when ordering).

Imagine medical students exploring a virtual anatomy lesson together or design teams collaborating on a 3D prototype without the hassle of headsets.

      "Good news for Fred and other retired military members: Defense Department-issued IDs, including Common Access Cards, Uniformed Services ID cards and older retiree and family member cards, are still accepted by TSA for domestic airline travel. This includes cards with \"INDEF\" (indefinite) expiration dates, despite past confusion and software glitches.",
      "However, travelers have reported occasional issues at some airports, where TSA's system may misread the \"INDEF\" date as expired. In those cases, TSA officers may ask for another acceptable form of ID, such as a REAL ID-compliant driver's license or a passport. If you have no other ID, a supervisor may review your document and allow you to proceed, but expect possible delays.",
      "The bottom line is that military retiree and dependent ID cards remain valid for flying domestically as of today. If you have experienced problems in the past, it's wise to bring a backup form of ID if possible.",
      "HOW TO MINIMIZE YOUR DIGITAL FOOTPRINT WHEN YOU TRAVEL",
      "What happens if you don't have a REAL ID yet?",
      "If you show up at the airport today with a standard driver's license that isn't REAL ID compliant, and you don't have a passport or other approved ID, you could face delays, extra screening or even be denied entry at the security checkpoint. TSA is urging travelers to check their IDs before heading to the airport.",
      "However, if you have a valid Global Entry card, you do not need to obtain a REAL ID-compliant driver's license to fly domestically after May 7, 2025. The Global Entry card is a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Trusted Traveler card that meets federal identification standards and is explicitly accepted by TSA as an alternative to a REAL ID. This means you can use your Global Entry card at TSA checkpoints to verify your identity when flying within the United States. Other DHS Trusted Traveler cards, like NEXUS, SENTRI and FAST, are also accepted as alternatives.",
      "Important:\u00a0Although the Global Entry card is officially accepted, some travelers have reported occasional confusion among TSA agents. To avoid delays, consider carrying an additional form of ID, such as a U.S. passport or passport card.",

      "How safe are these trucks?",
      "The safety of autonomous trucks is a primary concern.\u00a0Aurora's 2025 Driverless Safety Report outlines five key principles to ensure safe operation: proficiency, fail-safety, continuous improvement, resilience and trustworthiness. The company uses high-resolution cameras, radar and lidar to understand the environment, with their FirstLight lidar detecting objects from over 1,470 feet away, offering nearly nine seconds of reaction time at highway speeds.",
      "Aurora's fail-safe system includes multiple redundancies, while the company's approach to continuous improvement involves regular software updates and incident reviews. They've driven over 2.6 million miles autonomously, hauling over 9,500 commercial freight loads with a nearly 100% on-time rate and no major safety incidents.",

      "What this means for the future",
      "There are undeniable upsides. Autonomous trucks could operate 24/7, slash delivery times, reduce costs and help address the growing driver shortage. They may even improve road safety by eliminating accidents caused by human error. But risks remain. Public trust in driverless tech is still shaky. Many worry about what happens to jobs when machines take the wheel. The Teamsters are particularly vocal about this.",
      "\"Tens of millions of people turn a key for a living, but companies like Aurora couldn't care less if they lose their livelihoods. Eliminating all driving jobs would be disastrous for our communities and the middle class,\" McQuaid said.",
      "That said, a\u00a0Department of Transportation (DOT) study from the Trump administration projected long-haul autonomous trucking could increase U.S. employment by 26,400-35,100 jobs per year as new logistics and tech roles emerge. Aurora, for its part, claims both\u00a0human drivers and AVs are needed to meet demand.",
      "Still, consistent federal regulation is lacking. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy has called for nationwide standards: \"We can't fall behind China or other countries. After safety, we need to give a wide runway for innovation.\"",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple\u2019s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.",
      "Apple's AirPlay was designed to make life easier, letting users stream music, photos and videos from iPhones and MacBooks to TVs, speakers and other compatible devices with just a tap. But now, cybersecurity researchers have revealed that this same convenience may be opening the door to hackers. A new set of vulnerabilities, collectively called AirBorne, could turn AirPlay-enabled gadgets into stealthy entry points for malware and network infiltration.",

      "A person holding an iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Researchers at Tel Aviv-based cybersecurity firm Oligo\u00a0recently disclosed AirBorne, a group of security flaws in Apple's proprietary AirPlay protocol. These bugs exist primarily in the AirPlay software development kit (SDK) used by third-party manufacturers to bring AirPlay support to smart TVs, speakers and other media devices. The security flaws mean if a hacker is on the same Wi-Fi network as a vulnerable device, they can hijack it without ever touching the device.",
      "From there, attackers could move laterally within a home or corporate network, silently hopping from one device to another. They might install malware or ransomware, disrupt operations or even lock users out of their own systems. In some cases, compromised devices could be added to a botnet, a network of hijacked machines working in unison for larger attacks. And because many smart gadgets come equipped with microphones, hackers could even turn them into tools for eavesdropping and surveillance.",

      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "What is Apple doing about the AirBorne bugs?",
      "Apple has already patched the AirBorne bugs on its own devices and issued updates to third-party vendors. However, researchers warn that many third-party AirPlay-enabled products, possibly tens of millions, may never receive a fix, either because they do not auto-update or because vendors are slow or unwilling to release security patches.",
      "A striking demonstration by Oligo showed how easily a Bose speaker was taken over to display the firm's logo, proving how simple it could be for a hacker to silently gain control. Though Bose was not specifically targeted, the example highlights the broader risk. Any unpatched device using AirPlay SDK could be a gateway for malicious actors.",
      "The researchers also discovered that Apple CarPlay is affected. While exploiting it would be harder and would require Bluetooth or USB pairing, more than 800 car and truck models are potentially vulnerable.",

      "Steps to update your iPhone\u2019s software (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO UPDATE ALL OF YOUR DEVICES AND KEEP THEM SAFE",
      "5 ways to protect yourself from AirPlay hackers",
      "1) Set up a separate Wi-Fi network for smart devices:\u00a0Most modern routers allow you to create multiple networks. Use this feature to keep your smart home devices such as AirPlay-enabled speakers, TVs or receivers on a dedicated \"IoT\" (Internet of Things) network. Keep this separate from your main devices, like phones, laptops and work computers. This segmentation ensures that even if a hacker gains access to a vulnerable smart device, they cannot easily reach more critical or sensitive devices on the primary network.",
      "2) Disable AirPlay when not actively using it:\u00a0AirPlay is designed to always be on and discoverable, which makes it convenient but also leaves it exposed. If you rarely use AirPlay or only use it occasionally, go into your device settings and turn it off completely. On Apple devices, AirPlay settings can be found under \"General\" or \"AirPlay & Handoff.\" For third-party devices, check their companion apps or manuals. Turning off AirPlay removes it as an open door for attackers.",
      "3) Avoid using AirPlay on public or unsecured Wi-Fi and use a VPN:\u00a0One of the key conditions for exploiting AirBorne vulnerabilities is that the attacker must be on the same Wi-Fi network as the target device. This makes public Wi-Fi networks in places like caf\u00e9s, airports, hotels or shared workspaces particularly risky. If you need to use your device in such environments, avoid casting, streaming or pairing with smart devices.",
      "Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Strengthen and secure your home Wi-Fi network:\u00a0Make it more difficult for attackers to gain access to your home network. Use a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi that is different from your other account credentials. Ensure that your router firmware is updated and that encryption is set to WPA2 or WPA3. Avoid older and less secure options like WEP or open networks. Turn off features like WPS, which are designed for easy setup but can also make your network more vulnerable. If possible, disable universal plug and play (UPnP) and similar features that make all devices on your network easily discoverable. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Limit device permissions and exposure:\u00a0Smart devices with AirPlay support often include features like microphones, auto-pairing and remote access. Review each device's settings and disable any features you do not actively use. For example, if your smart speaker has a microphone, but you never use voice commands, turn off the microphone or cover it. The fewer functions a device has exposed, the fewer opportunities a hacker has to exploit it. If your router supports it, use device-level firewall rules to limit which services or internet connections your smart gadgets can access.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Apple likes to market itself as the go-to for privacy and security, but the AirBorne vulnerabilities show that the company's devices are far from bulletproof. While they patched their own products, millions of third-party AirPlay devices are still wide open to attack. It's becoming clear that Apple's control over its ecosystem isn't as tight as they'd like you to believe. If they really want to be the privacy leader, they need to step up and fix these issues across the board, not just when it suits them.",

    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 10:00:33 -0400",
    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson reports that Tesla owners are facing threats as hackers weaponize leaked data. Are you next?",
    "story": [
      "A 35-year-old man is accused of arson after a Cybertruck was burned at a Tesla dealership in Mesa, Ariz., on April 28, 2025. (KSAZ-TV)",
      "The recent surge of attacks on Tesla owners, dealerships and charging stations has morphed into a broader campaign of intimidation, fueled by weaponized personal data. But the fallout isn't limited to Tesla owners alone.",
      "Sites like \"Dogequest\" have published names, addresses and phone numbers supposedly belonging to Tesla owners, yet many victims never owned a Tesla or sold theirs years ago. Some were misidentified due to errors in public records or outdated databases, turning ordinary people into targets for harassment and threats. The site's operators have even demanded proof of sale from anyone seeking removal, putting the burden on innocent people to clear their names.",
      "As the DOJ and FBI label these attacks as domestic terrorism and ramp up investigations, the chilling reality is that anyone, even those only suspected of owning a Tesla, can find themselves exposed and at risk.",
      "Join The FREE \"CyberGuy Report\":\u00a0Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free\u00a0\"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"\u00a0when you sign up.",
      "A Tesla supercharger (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How innocent people get caught in the crossfire",
      "On March 18, 2025, a hacker group launched \"Dogequest,\" a website featuring a searchable map of supposed Tesla owners and employees. The site didn't just list dealerships and charging stations; it exposed names, home addresses, phone numbers and emails, sometimes even in real time. The twist? Many of the people listed never owned a Tesla at all.",
      "The data fueling this attack came from public vehicle registration records and third-party databases, notorious for their inaccuracies. Some victims had sold their Teslas years ago. Others were never owners, just mistakenly linked by a typo, a recycled phone number or a database error. Yet they found themselves on a digital hit list, with their privacy and safety at risk.",
      "The real-world consequences",
      "This isn't just an online problem. Firebombings at showrooms, bullets through dealership windows and threats to families have all been linked to these doxxing campaigns. Law enforcement, including the DOJ, now calls it domestic terrorism. And because the data is so often wrong, anyone could be next, regardless of whether you've ever set foot in a Tesla.",
      "\"Doxxing\" affecting Tesla and non-Tesla owners alike (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why misidentification matters to everyone",
      "If you think you're safe because you don't own a Tesla, think again. The same flawed data sources that misidentified Tesla owners exist for countless other products, memberships and affiliations. Today, it's electric cars; tomorrow, it could be political donors, healthcare workers or anyone else whose data is bought and sold.",
      "HERTZ DATA BREACH EXPOSES CUSTOMER INFORMATION",
      "What you can do to protect yourself now",
      "Whether your personal data was exposed in a breach, leaked by someone with inside access or scraped from people-finder sites, you're at risk, not just if you own a Tesla, but even if you're misidentified. Here's how to reduce your exposure and protect yourself from becoming the next target of a doxxing attack.",
      "To help prevent your data from ending up in a breach or leak:",
      "Limit what data companies have on you in the first place. Fill in only the required fields, use email aliases and burner or VoIP numbers where possible, and use a P.O. Box in place of a street address. Provide fake details where it\u2019s practical and legal to do so.Delete accounts you no longer need. That online shopping account you used once five years ago? All that personal information is still sitting there, just waiting to be breached or leaked. Look for options like \"delete my data\" and \"delete data and close account\" rather than just \"close account.\"",

Look for options like \"delete my data\" and \"delete data and close account\" rather than just \"close account.\"",
      "Also known as people-search sites, these data brokers profit by compiling detailed personal profiles that are fully searchable and available to anyone for a small fee. They're among the most dangerous sources of exposed personal information online. Fortunately, they're also some of the easiest to tackle, especially with the help of a\u00a0personal data removal service.",
      "These services send legally binding opt-out requests to people-search sites and other data brokers on your behalf, ensuring your information is taken down. Some services,\u00a0like our No. 1 pick, even offer custom removal options, where privacy professionals handle complex cases that go beyond automated systems.",
      "While no service can guarantee complete data erasure from the internet, using a trusted removal service is a smart way to automate and maintain ongoing protection from hundreds of data-hungry sites over time.",
      "CHECK OUT MY TOP PICKS FOR DATA REMOVAL SERVICES HERE",
      "Hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Additional critical digital defenses to implement",
      "While removing your data from brokers and minimizing online footprints are essential first steps, true safety in this new era of weaponized information also requires securing our digital infrastructure against both physical and virtual threats. Here are a few steps you can take to protect your data.",
      "Use two-factor authentication: Protect your vehicle\u2019s account and associated emails with\u00a0authenticator apps rather than SMS, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks.",
      "Use a VPN: Mask your IP address when accessing your vehicle\u2019s apps on public Wi-Fi to prevent location tracking and man-in-the-middle attacks. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Cabin cam caution: Disable Cabin Camera Recording under Data Sharing unless essential. While Tesla claims footage isn\u2019t linked to identities by default, third-party app vulnerabilities could expose this data. Newer Teslas process cabin cam footage locally, but legacy models may still use cloud backups, so check your software version.",
      "Report doxxing or cyber harassment: If you\u2019ve been doxxed or targeted online, don\u2019t wait to take action. Report it to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3),\u00a0ic3.gov, or to local law enforcement, as many states have laws addressing doxxing, stalking and cyber harassment. File a police report with documented evidence (screenshots, URLs, timestamps). Also, for account-specific threats, contact Tesla customer service directly to report suspicious activity and secure your account.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The reality is unsettling but not hopeless, and while the threats of our hyper-connected world can feel overwhelming, you don\u2019t have to just hope you won\u2019t be targeted. You can take control by arming yourself with knowledge, using the right tools, building smart habits like checking your digital footprint, using removal tools and staying alert to new threats because the attackers are organized, and it\u2019s time we are, too.",

      "Kurt Knutsson discusses how a paper pill bottle could revolutionize pharmacy packaging and cut plastic waste drastically.",
      "Have you ever stopped to think about what happens to those little orange pill bottles after you finish your prescription? Every year, around 200 billion of these bottles are produced worldwide, and sadly most of them end up in landfills. In the U.S. alone, about 4 to 5 billion plastic pill bottles are thrown away each year.",
      "That\u2019s enough plastic to circle the Earth multiple times.",
      "While they might seem harmless, these bottles contribute significantly to the growing plastic pollution crisis because they\u2019re often not recycled properly.",

      "Paper Tully Tube pill bottles (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A paper bottle that\u2019s changing the game",
      "Plastic has become the go-to material for packaging, including in medicine, because it\u2019s cheap, durable and easy to produce. However, the environmental cost is huge, and the pharmaceutical industry has struggled to find a sustainable alternative.",
      "Enter the\u00a0Tully Tube, a revolutionary new pill bottle made mostly from 100% sustainably sourced paper. Developed by Parcel Health, this isn\u2019t just any paper bottle. It\u2019s the first one to meet the strict U.S. FDA regulations for food-contact packaging, making it safe to use for prescription medications.",
      "What makes the Tully Tube really impressive is how it balances sustainability with practicality. The body of the bottle is made from recyclable and compostable paper, which means it can break down naturally instead of piling up in landfills. The cap, which needs to be child-resistant for safety, is still made from plastic but uses recycled materials to reduce its environmental impact.",
      "Tully Tube (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "STOP SORTING YOUR GARBAGE WITH THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY",
      "How does it keep pills safe?",
      "You might be wondering how a paper bottle can protect pills from moisture, heat or damage during shipping. The Tully Tube uses a clever three-layer construction. It\u2019s coated with a food-safe compostable layer that keeps water and humidity out, ensuring your medication stays fresh and effective.",
      "When it\u2019s time to toss the bottle, a patented pull tab makes it easy to separate the paper body from the plastic cap and neck. This means the paper part can be composted or recycled, while the plastic pieces can be recycled separately. It\u2019s a simple but smart way to make sure every part of the bottle is handled properly at the end of its life.",
      "Tully Tube (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "IS THIS TECHNOLOGY THE ANSWER TO CLEANING UP OUR OCEAN'S PLASTIC PROBLEM?",
      "Why should pharmacies care?",
      "One of the biggest hurdles for sustainable packaging is cost. Fortunately, the Tully Tube is priced competitively with traditional plastic bottles, so pharmacies don\u2019t have to pay more to go green. Plus, because the paper surface is easier and cheaper to print on, pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies can customize the bottles with logos, designs or even characters to make the packaging more engaging for customers.",
      "From an environmental perspective, the Tully Tube reduces carbon emissions by about 30% compared to plastic bottles. That\u2019s a significant cut in greenhouse gases, especially when you consider the billions of bottles used every year.",
      "Tully Tube (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AUTONOMOUS TRASH-GOBBLING ROBO BOAT WAGES WAR ON WATERWAY WASTE",
      "Real-world impact",
      "UVA Health is already leading the way by rolling out Tully Tubes across its system. This move is expected to eliminate millions of plastic bottles from their waste stream, showcasing how sustainable packaging can work even in industries with strict safety and regulatory standards. Their example proves that eco-friendly alternatives aren\u2019t just theoretical, they\u2019re ready for real-world use today.",

It challenges the longstanding reliance on plastic in the pharmaceutical industry by offering a practical, safe and sustainable alternative. As more hospitals and pharmacies consider adopting this new packaging, the impact could be enormous.",

      "Data breaches have become alarmingly common and costly, putting sensitive information at risk. In fact, the number of data breaches in the United States jumped from 447 in 2012 to over 3,200 in 2023.",
      "Even firms entrusted with managing personal information are not immune. The latest example is VeriSource Services, a Texas-based employee benefits and HR administration provider that experienced a major data breach.",
      "The personal information of about 4 million people was exposed in this incident, and it took the company over a year to fully assess its impact, a critical failure for an organization specializing in data management, employee enrollment and HR support services that clients rely on to safeguard their most sensitive information.",

      "An illustration of a hacker at work\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happened at VeriSource?",
      "VeriSource discovered\u00a0the breach Feb. 28, 2024, when it noticed unusual activity disrupting some of its systems. The company later determined an unknown attacker had gained unauthorized access around Feb. 27, 2024, stealing data on or about that date.",
      "Somehow, it took VeriSource over a year to determine the full scope of the breach, including the identification all individuals who had their information exposed.",
      "According to the investigation, this was a criminal cyberattack carried out by external threat actors (hackers), as opposed to an insider mishandling data. The perpetrators accessed sensitive personal records stored by VeriSource. In a\u00a0sample notice filed with state authorities, VeriSource reported that the compromised information included individuals' full names, mailing addresses, dates of birth, gender and Social Security numbers (via\u00a0BleepingComputer).",

      "Impact on affected individuals",
      "For individuals whose data was exposed, this breach poses real risks. Information like your Social Security number, birth date and address can be misused for identity theft, such as opening fraudulent accounts or filing false tax returns in your name. Even beyond financial fraud, having such personal data in the wrong hands can lead to targeted phishing scams.",
      "What worries me the most is the delay in fully notifying everyone affected. VeriSource had sent out preliminary breach notices to about 55,000 people in May 2024 and then to another 112,000 people in September 2024. However, those early notifications covered only a small fraction of the approximately 4 million victims eventually identified. This means the majority of affected individuals did not learn of the breach until the final notification wave in April 2025, more than a year after the data was actually compromised.",
      "We reached out to VeriSource for a comment but did not hear back before our deadline.",

      "If you think you were affected by the VeriSource data breach or just want to be cautious, here are some steps you can take right now to stay safe from the data breach:",
      "1. Consider a personal data removal service:\u00a0VeriSource hackers have access to your name, Social Security number, mailing address and more, which they can easily use against you.\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to scam you. After the VeriSource breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the VeriSource breach, including Social Security numbers. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You can freeze your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus. They\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "4. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per yearor more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "5. Be wary of social engineering attacks and use strong antivirus software: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Also, never click on unexpected links or attachments in emails, texts or messages because they may contain malware or lead to phishing sites designed to steal your information.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "What stands out in the VeriSource breach isn\u2019t just the scale, but the silence. When a company sits on breach data for over a year, regardless of intent, it erodes trust in systems designed to protect workers. These aren\u2019t just compliance failures. They\u2019re human ones. Four million people had their most sensitive information exposed, and for many of them, the warning came far too late. This should be a moment of reckoning for how organizations define responsibility after a breach. A timely response isn\u2019t just good PR. It\u2019s a baseline expectation. And if it takes over a year to realize the full scope of a cyberattack, maybe the incident isn\u2019t the only vulnerability worth addressing.",

      "Yale New Haven Health is a nonprofit healthcare system based in New Haven, Connecticut. It includes five acute-care hospitals, a medical foundation, and a network of outpatient facilities and multispecialty centers across Connecticut, New York and Rhode Island.",

Reportedly, the number of affected individuals may still change as investigations continue. Importantly, electronic medical record systems and treatment information were not accessed, and no financial account, payment or employee HR information was involved.",
      "This is not the first time healthcare systems have been in the crosshairs of cybercriminals. In recent years, attacks on institutions like\u00a0UnitedHealth and\u00a0Ascension Health have led to months of operational disruption, massive financial costs and prolonged investigations.",

      "The breach could have serious consequences for those impacted. The stolen data includes highly sensitive information that can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, phishing attacks or targeted scams.

      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Yale New Haven Health data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, social security number, and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The Yale New Haven Health data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Yale New Haven Health hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses..",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know, and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "While Yale New Haven has been working with security experts to contain the breach and notify those affected, it is troubling that hackers were able to access the data of 5.5 million individuals before the organization detected the intrusion. The incident highlights a deeper issue, revealing gaps in the security infrastructure that many healthcare institutions are still not adequately addressing.",

      "Claire Shipman issued a statement to the campus community on Wednesday night addressing the hours-long incident at Butler Library, which she described as \"utterly unacceptable.\"",
      "A mob of protesters showed up at the library Wednesday afternoon, as students were studying for finals, reportedly to rally support for detained Mahmoud Khalil, the accused ringleader of pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia. They also continued to demand the university divest from Israel.",
      "Two groups caused \"substantial chaos\" and damaged the campus building while occupying one of the library's main reading rooms and breaching the building's front door, Shipman said, adding that the disruption left the university with \"no choice\" but to call the NYPD for assistance.",

      "\"These actions not only represented a violation of University policies, but they also posed a serious risk to our students and campus safety,\" Shipman said, in part.",
      "Columbia's acting president said she went to the library \"as the events were unfolding\" and was disappointed with what she saw, including one Columbia public safety officer being wheeled out on a gurney and another being treated for injuries.",
      "Shipman also said the reading room at the library was \"defaced and damaged in disturbing ways and with disturbing slogans.\"",

      "She also praised the response from professors, campus police and NYPD officers, describing their attempts to defuse the situation as \"orderly, professional, and extremely limited, with a focus on the students who refused to leave the reading room.\"",
      "Columbia is in the middle of its designated \"study days\" ahead of final examinations beginning on Friday, according to its academic calendar, and Shipman said she is \"heartbroken and incensed\" that this caused \"unnecessary stress and danger\" for those studying in the library.",

      "\"I have seen how much our community wants to take back our narrative, to do what they came to Columbia to do\u2014learn, thrive, and grow\u2014not take over a library,\" she said. \"Moreover, I am deeply disturbed at the idea that, at a moment when our international community feels particularly vulnerable, a small group of students would choose to make our institution a target.\"",
      "Shipman said the \"clear line between legitimate protest and actions that endanger others and disrupt\" the university's operations was crossed on Wednesday and she is confident \"disciplinary proceedings will reflect the severity of the actions.\"",
      "The protest prompted a response from NYC Mayor Eric Adams, who said the city stands with Jewish New Yorkers, which includes the Jewish student population at Columbia.",

      "The report, dubbed \"The Houthi Challenge: Forging a Strategy to Defeat the Iran-Backed Terror Group in Yemen\" by Ari Heistein for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) and research fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, highlighted that it is not only Iran that have helped facilitate the Houthi operational capabilities.",
      "While Tehran has backed the Houthis since at least 2014 \u2013 and possibly as early as 2009 during the war in Yemen \u2013 through training and advanced weapons like ballistic missiles, Oman has also played a role by allowing the group to operate from its territory and serving as a key smuggling route for Iranian arms.",

      "\"To hold them up as responsible intermediaries when they are in fact hosting the very group that we're trying to dismantle, there's very little logic [in] this position,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "The report found that Iranian arms are smuggled into Yemen through the port of Hodeidah \u2013 which was targeted in a series of Israeli strikes on major infrastructure in and around the Houthi-controlled capital of Sana\u2019a this week \u2013 but also through smaller ports or overland through Oman.",

      "\"More must be done to prevent bulk cash smuggling across the border between Oman and Yemen,\" Heistein found. \"Muscat must begin to feel pressure from the international community to address a threat finance challenge that has gone unchecked for too long.\"",
      "The report breaks down the varied steps that need to be taken to effectively undermine and counter the Houthis as repeated military strikes by first, Saudi Arabia starting in 2015, then recently by the U.S. and Israel, have not significantly degraded the terrorist group.",

      "Those steps include continued military action \u2013 similar to Israel\u2019s recent strikes on Yemen\u2019s Hodeidah port and Sana\u2019a International Airport, which are expected to have far-reaching economic impacts and increase internal pressure on the Houthis. But military action alone isn\u2019t enough; economic, diplomatic, and other soft power strategies are also needed to weaken the group, according to the report.",

Additionally, the organization noted a \"troubling\" pattern in antisemitic incidents per Jewish capita in the J7 countries, including more than 38 incidents per 1,000 Jewish residents in Germany in 2023. Additionally, in Australia, incidents per Jewish capita quadrupled from 2023 to 2024.",

The organization recommends more \"work and engagement\" in combatting antisemitism in academia.",
      "In 2023, Argentina saw a 44% increase in antisemitic incidents compared to 2022. Like many other countries included in the report, the country saw a rise in antisemitism and anti-Zionism following Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attacks.",
      "Additionally, DAIA noted that Argentinian President Javier Milei\u2019s strong support of Israel and the U.S. has led to \"an increase in antisemitic and other conspiratorial rhetoric.\"",
      "DAIA also found some bright spots in Argentina, noting that 60% of Argentinians, especially those aged 25-34, have a favorable view of Israel and just 7% favor boycotting Israeli products and businesses. This could be because Argentina has felt the impact of a terrorist organization that has also attacked Israel. Hezbollah carried out two deadly bombing attacks in Buenos Aires, one in 1992 at the Israeli Embassy and another in 1994 at the AMIA-DAIA Jewish Center.",

In the 12-month period the ECAJ studied, it found 2,062 antisemitic incidents compared to 495 incidents in the previous year.

This, according to the report, is 10 times higher than the response in 2017.",
      "The Australian federal government in 2024, as well as many state governments, banned hate symbols such as swastikas and the Nazi salute. Symbols of terrorist organizations were also banned. However, ECAJ said it does not believe these laws do enough to combat \"post-Oct. 7 sources of antisemitism.\"",
      "\"While these laws are welcomed, they are not addressing the post-October 7 sources of antisemitism in Australia which makes up the majority of incidents, nor will the laws counter anti-Jewish attitudes and incidents,\" ECAJ wrote in the report.",
      "The report on Canada was compiled by the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA). The organization said Canada\u2019s main challenges include increased threats of violence and \"anti- Israel actions taken by the federal government that display a double standard towards the Jewish state, such as the imposition of an arms embargo.\"",
      "While the data for 2024 is not yet available, CIJA noted that the 2023 statistics show \"disturbing trends.\" While Jews make up just 1% of the country\u2019s population, 19% of reported hate crimes were motivated by antisemitism. Additionally, hate crimes against Jews increased by 71% from 2022 to 2023, according to CIJA.",
      "In the report, CIJA called out the Canadian government\u2019s \"inaction\" on antisemitism. The organization called for action and legal reform to help fight rising antisemitism.",

      "Two of Amer Fakhoury\u2019s daughters, Guila and Zoya Fakhoury, told Fox News Digital that on May 1, a U.S. District Court judge found Iran responsible for Fakhoury\u2019s imprisonment.",

After his arrest, a newspaper linked with Hezbollah alleged that Fakhoury, formerly a member of the South Lebanon Army, had been the \"butcher\" of Khiam, a detention center where grave human rights abuses were reported to have taken place.",
      "Though he was released from a military prison in December 2019, it was only after the Lebanese Supreme Court dropped charges against Fakhoury in March 2020 that he was able to return to the U.S. By the time of his return, Fakhoury had lost 60 pounds and was suffering from late-stage lymphoma, along with rib fractures and other health complications. He died in September 2020 at the age of 57.",

      "Before he became Pope Leo XIV, Cardinal Robert Prevost occasionally posted on social media, including some messages that appeared to be critical of President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance and their worldview.",
      "His most recent activity on X came in mid-April, when he shared a post on his account from a Catholic commentator who called out Trump and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele for laughing about the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia of Maryland. The post linked to an article published by the Catholic Standard newspaper, in which Bishop Evelio Menjivar asked of Catholics about Abrego Garcia: \u201cIs your conscience not disturbed? How can you stay quiet?\u201d",

      "Other reposts from Prevost's X account have suggested he supports protecting immigrants, reducing gun violence and combating climate change.",
      "The day after the Las Vegas mass shooting in October 2017, Prevost shared a post from Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., that said: \"To my colleagues: your cowardice to act cannot be whitewashed by thoughts and prayers. None of this ends unless we do something to stop it.\"",
      "Also in 2017, Prevost reposted someone who was defending immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children, known as Dreamers.",
      "\"I stand with the #Dreamers and all people who are working toward an immigration system that is fair, just, and moral. #DefendDACA #DACA,\" the post said.",
      "In a matter of hours, his X account had added more than 200,000 followers.",
      "Still, the new pope has not been a prolific poster \u2014 and much of what he shared was fairly standard Catholic fare \u2014 so his social media posts don't give a complete picture of all his political views.",
      "Some conservative commentators have already seized on Prevost's posts and comments.",
      "Laura Loomer, a far-right commentator and close Trump ally, published a series of posts decrying Leo\u2019s politics. \u201cJust another Marxist puppet in the Vatican,\u201d she wrote.",

      "\"Let\u2019s just say, not so great tweets about having some willingness for open borders. We\u2019ll see kind of how he is on that. Also some George Floyd stuff that I\u2019m not too crazy about,\" he said in a video on X. \"But overall, it seems like he\u2019s a pro-life warrior. There\u2019s a lot yet to learn about this pope, but I hope that he will be a strong advocate for strong borders. And for sovereignty.\u201d",
      "In 2020, Prevost reposted tweets offering prayers and a message of support for Floyd, whose murder by a Minneapolis police officer led to a national reckoning on race relations and policing.",
      "Other Republicans, like former President George W. Bush, had more positive reactions. Bush said in a statement that it's a \"historic and hopeful moment for Catholics in America and for the faithful around the world.\"",
      "Former President Joe Biden, a Democrat and only the second Catholic to be elected to the White House, also voiced support for the new pope on X: \"Habemus papam \u2014 May God bless Pope Leo XIV of Illinois. Jill and I congratulate him and wish him success.\""

      "As President Donald Trump tiptoed away this week from the idea that he might try to win a third term, he opened the door to a fresh round of intrigue: Whom does he see as his successor?",
      "In practically the same breath in an interview with NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Trump suggested national security adviser and Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 in that order \u2014 as potential candidates.",

      "\u201cThey\u2019ve got a really good personal and professional relationship, so if they\u2019re both running, I have no doubt there will be a [conversation] about it beforehand,\u201d said a person familiar with their relationship, who, like others interviewed for this article, was granted anonymity to offer candid insights about a politically sensitive topic.",
      "Three people in Rubio\u2019s orbit who spoke with NBC News, cognizant of Vance\u2019s higher rank in the line of succession and of polling that reinforces his higher standing among Republican voters, see Vance as having right of first refusal on the Republican nomination in 2028.",
      "Among Vance\u2019s allies, too, there\u2019s no ill will. A person close to Vance emphasized that the two remain extremely close and didn\u2019t see a scenario in which Vance and Rubio would run against each other for president in 2028 at this point.",
      "But Rubio is, without question, ascending in Trump world. His rise was punctuated last week when Trump appointed him as his interim national security adviser. Rubio is the first person to hold both roles at the same time since Henry Kissinger in the mid-1970s.",
      "While internally there has long been an overwhelming sentiment that Vance will be the first in line to carry on Trump\u2019s political legacy, even some White House advisers are starting to see him and Rubio on an equal playing field in Trump\u2019s estimation.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump sees them as both very loyal and very talented, I think that\u2019s very fair to say,\u201d a senior Trump adviser said.",
      "The expanded portfolio is a signal that Rubio, according to four sources who have long advised him, is building a substantial footing that can position him well as the heir apparent to Trump \u2014 if Vance stumbles over the next three years.",
      "\u201cYou would still have to give the advantage to Vance because he is the sitting vice president,\u201d a Rubio ally said of the hypothetical 2028 showdown. \u201cBut everyone in Rubio\u2019s orbit is feeling really good about how things are playing out. If for any reason Vance isn\u2019t the guy or the electorate is seeking an alternative, there is no question that Rubio is in the pole position for that.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe is a guy who can speak MAGA but can also gather the confidence of your more traditional Republican,\u201d this person added.",
      "Another longtime Rubio ally allowed that \u201cVance is the guy for now, but as we have seen, for now isn\u2019t forever.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of time,\u201d this person added. \u201cImportant to remember it\u2019s early, but Rubio wears many hats now. That\u2019s not by mistake.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, neither Rubio nor Vance is shy about asserting his strengths in meetings with Trump. Just days before the \u201cMeet the Press\u201d shoutouts, Rubio sat next to Trump at an hourslong Cabinet meeting wearing a matching blue suit and red tie. At one point, Rubio said he had uncovered that a State Department office built a dossier on someone else seated at the table, identifying the person \u201cas purveyors of disinformation,\u201d which he said would soon be turned over.",
      "\u201cWas it me or Elon?\u201d Vance interrupted, referring to Trump adviser Elon Musk and drawing laughs with what amounted to a flex of his \u201cdeep state\u201d enmity.",
      "Trump\u2019s indulgence in succession talk barely 100 days into his second administration follows his indulgence of scenarios in which he would circumvent the Constitution to serve a third term. The latter has had a freezing effect on the GOP\u2019s 2028 field, with no prospective candidate daring to get too far ahead of him.",
      "But Trump backed away from the third-term talk in the \u201cMeet the Press\u201d interview, suggesting he would be comfortable going into the history books as an \u201ceight-year president.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo many people want me to do it. I have never had requests so strong as that,\u201d Trump said, referring to tactics that could circumvent the Constitution. \u201cBut it\u2019s something that, to the best of my knowledge, you\u2019re not allowed to do.\u201d",
      "Early polls taking stock of a potential 2028 Republican primary field show Vance with a wide plurality, assuming Trump doesn\u2019t try to run again, and Rubio in the single digits. A recent Economist/YouGov survey found that 43% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who responded picked Vance as their \u201cideal\u201d GOP nominee, followed by Donald Trump Jr. at 11%, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis at 8% and Rubio at 4%.",
      "Critics have for years tried to square the Rubio of the 2016 campaign \u2014 in which he ran as an establishment-friendly candidate known for his openness to immigration reform \u2014 with the Rubio they now see as embracing a MAGA doctrine. But those close to him say any so-called transformation wasn\u2019t some overnight phenomenon that took place once he was picked to be secretary of state.",
      "\u201cHe showed the one thing Trump values above any other quality,\u201d said a longtime Republican operative who has previously supported Rubio \u2014 \u201cloyalty to Trump while going out preaching the gospel of Trump.\u201d",
      "In the years leading up to Trump\u2019s second presidential bid, Rubio gravitated toward the school of right-wing thought that has risen in the party \u2014 attending National Conservatism conferences popular with then-colleagues like Vance and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who are in alignment on several key policy areas in which Trump has led the charge in shifting GOP orthodoxy.",
      "\u201cI think my instincts have always been where they are now,\u201d Rubio told NBC News in a 2021 interview. \u201cAs you\u2019re exposed to new facts, new realities, and as the world changes, so, too, does your public policy response to it.\u201d",
      "Vance and Rubio became friends when they served together in the Senate. They viewed each other as fellow converts to Trump\u2019s movement and as ideological peers on issues that Trump had reoriented Republicans around, like trade. A person close to Rubio said he and Vance are close and \u201cwere very much swimming in the same policy circles.\u201d",
      "Also key to Rubio\u2019s ascension in Trump\u2019s inner circle has been how much face time he has spent around Trump both in the White House and at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Four senior administration officials told NBC News that Rubio spends as much time as he can at the White House to be close to Trump, while a person close to him said he has become a regular at Mar-a-Lago, where Trump spends most weekends.",
      "To the extent that Vance and Rubio were rivals in Trump\u2019s running mate search last year, there was limited sniping between their teams and a mutual understanding that both were more in sync with Trumpism than then-North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, another finalist for the job.",
      "Their friendship has tightened in the Trump administration. Each has worked to cultivate and maintain relationships with tastemakers on the far right. Vance and Rubio both, for example, were among the guests at an inaugural ball hosted by Turning Point USA, the group led by influential far-right activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "The vice presidency might offer Vance more built-in steppingstones to the Oval Office. Like Rubio, he has been able to travel the globe, gaining the type of experience that can bolster a White House bid.",
      "Vance doesn\u2019t have the same constraints that Rubio, as a diplomat, faces when it comes to moonlighting in politics and campaigns. His hand is already seen in Ohio\u2019s race for governor, a key midterm contest next year that could elevate Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy. With Trump\u2019s blessing, Vance is finance chair for the Republican National Committee \u2014 a position that will keep him connected to some of the party\u2019s top donors between now and 2028.",
      "And while Trump seemed to put Vance and Rubio on an equal 2028 plane in the \u201cMeet the Press\u201d interview and stopped short of anointing Vance as the favorite, he indicated that the nomination could be Vance\u2019s to lose.",
      "\u201cMarco is great. There\u2019s a lot of them that are great,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI also see tremendous unity. But certainly you would say that somebody\u2019s the VP, if that person is outstanding, I guess that person would have an advantage.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President\u00a0Donald\u00a0Trump\u2019s fight against the Houthis\u00a0never dealt a crippling\u00a0blow to the militant group, but it has\u00a0cost\u00a0America\u00a0more than $1 billion since March, including the thousands of bombs and missiles\u00a0used in strikes,\u00a0along with seven drones\u00a0shot down\u00a0and two fighter jets that sank, according to two U.S. officials briefed on the cost.",
      "After weeks of operations by the U.S.,\u00a0the Houthis\u00a0seemed to still be able to strike outside Yemen,\u00a0launching an\u00a0attack that targeted Israel\u2019s main international airport just this week.\u00a0\u00a0But the surprise deal that Trump announced Tuesday, in which the U.S. would suspend strikes and other operations against the Iran-backed Houthis in exchange for the group halting its attacks on U.S. ships, might be enough to declare mission accomplished, for now.",
      "Details about the deal have been sparse. It is still unclear\u00a0how it was made, how long it might last and what it meant in the long term for a conflict that began weeks after Hamas\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which, like the Houthis, is backed by Iran \u2014 attacked Israel in October 2023.",
      "What is known is that the agreement, which was brokered in part through the Omani government, according to two U.S. officials,\u00a0pertains only to U.S. ships.\u00a0The Houthis are expected to continue firing on Israel and on other countries\u2019\u00a0ships.",
      "\u201cThe administration was clearly looking for an off-ramp for this campaign against the Houthis,\u201d\u00a0said one U.S. official\u00a0familiar with the military operations against the Houthis.",
      "The Defense Department did not immediately comment.",
      "Success in the fight since March was hard to\u00a0measure: U.S. drones sent to determine if targets had been hit were often shot down by the Houthis and there were no American forces on the ground in Yemen who could assess the effectiveness of the campaign for the Pentagon, the official said.",
      "But the effort\u00a0under Trump came at great cost and\u00a0was\u00a0depleting American stockpiles, the two U.S. officials said.",
      "Since March 15, when the Trump administration announced its\u00a0current\u00a0campaign against the Houthis,\u00a0known as Operation Rough Rider,\u00a0the Pentagon has expended\u00a0roughly 2,000 bombs and missiles worth\u00a0more than $775 million against the group, according to the two U.S. officials briefed on the cost. That\u00a0includes hundreds of 2,000-pound bombs; which can cost $85,000 apiece; at least 75\u00a0Tomahawks,\u00a0which run about $1.9 million apiece;\u00a0at least 20 AGM 158 air-launched cruise missiles at about $1.5 million per missile; and many other munitions.",
      "The U.S.\u00a0also\u00a0spent\u00a0at least\u00a0$10 million moving\u00a0at least two\u00a0Patriot\u00a0missile defense systems\u00a0and military supplies\u00a0to sustain the systems to the region by ship, according to a U.S. military tally\u00a0provided to NBC News. That does not include the\u00a0cost of equipment it moved by air. During\u00a0congressional testimony last month, Adm. Sam Paparo, who heads\u00a0U.S. Indo-Pacific Command,\u00a0said the military used 73 C-17 flights in moving a single Patriot air defense system from his region to the Middle East.\u00a0A C-17 costs about $27,000 per hour to fly, and the U.S. military moved two Patriot systems to the region.",
      "But there was mounting concern that the Trump administration\u2019s approach to fighting the Houthis would never be long term.",
      "\u201cWashington has little patience and a short attention span and was unlikely to commit the resources and high-level attention necessary to see this campaign through to a meaningful outcome,\u201d\u00a0said Dana Stroul, who was the top policy official for the region at the Pentagon during the Biden administration.",
      "If the agreement Trump announced Tuesday holds, it could allow the U.S. to justify suspending operations against the Houthis but it won\u2019t likely change the reality that the Houthis can still be disruptive to shipping in the Red Sea.",
      "\u201cThe Houthis will stop shooting at U.S. ships for some period of time,\u201d\u00a0said Stroul, now the research director at the Washington Institute.\u00a0\u201cBut they will not stop firing missiles at Israel, commercial shipping will not return, and nothing will change in the Yemen civil war,\u201d she said.",
      "Hesitation under Biden and Trump",
      "After the\u00a0Houthis\u00a0began attacking international shipping in the Red Sea\u00a0following\u00a0the Hamas attack on Israel in 2023, the Biden administration began a campaign against the Houthis to help restore what is called \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d \u2014 the ability of ships to move unmolested by hostile forces. Those operations\u00a0did little to degrade the group, critics of the Biden administration\u2019s approach have said.",
      "In March, Trump administration officials announced they would increase pressure on the group.\u00a0A second aircraft carrier and its attendant ships were brought into the region; NBC News reported last\u00a0month that a number of missile defense platforms, including\u00a0the\u00a0two Patriot mobile missile defense systems and a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, system, were also moved in.",
      "Under Trump, Army Gen. Michael \u201cErik\u201d Kurilla, who leads U.S. Central Command, was given wide-ranging authorities to go after the group.\u00a0Under then-President Joe Biden,\u00a0many of Kurilla\u2019s plans to attack the Houthis had not been approved.",
      "But there were divisions within the\u00a0Trump\u00a0administration over just how far the campaign against the Houthis should go.\u00a0NBC News has reported that Biden officials had\u00a0put together\u00a0a blueprint for devastating the Houthis that required a long-term commitment and felt they were in a position to put that blueprint into action at the start of this year but held off to avoid boxing in their successors and gave the plans to the incoming Trump administration.",
      "While Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth spoke publicly of their ambitions to decimate the Houthis, U.S. and foreign\u00a0officials said privately they didn\u2019t think Trump had the stomach or the long-term commitment required to get the job done.",
      "Divisions within the administration about the campaign\u00a0spilled into public view\u00a0after Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat with multiple top officials. The published logs of the group chat showed\u00a0Vice President JD Vance expressing\u00a0concern that Trump did not know what he was getting into and suggesting\u00a0the U.S. had no business deepening its role in the\u00a0area.",
      "If the Houthis hold up their end of the deal and refrain from attacking American ships, it will be enough for the Trump administration to justify ending its role in the fight against the group, Stroul said.",
      "\u201cWashington can send a ship through the Red Sea and claim freedom of navigation has been restored.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "In a recent episode of his highly influential podcast, Joe Rogan declared what he sees as the latest triumph in the cultural battle over language: the return of the \u201cR-word.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery time I see people that disagree with any that\u2019s happening, any gigantic world events, it\u2019s one of these retarded shows where they\u2019re screaming,\u201d he said April 10 on an episode of \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience,\u201d before he interrupted himself to go on a quick rant about the word.",
      "\u201cThe word \u2018retarded\u2019 is back, and it\u2019s one of the great cultural victories that I think is spurred on, probably, by podcasts,\u201d he added.",
      "Rogan is right, at least to those in some circles.",
      "Once relegated to the cultural dustbin, the so-called R-word has made a resurgence in recent months, used most commonly by people in right-leaning and anti-political correctness worlds, some of whom have tried for years to bring the slur from the social media undercurrents back into the mainstream.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk now frequently uses the word on X to disparage everyone from a Danish astronaut to Ben Stiller. In March, Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, used it in questioning the mental capacity of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s twins, only to later issue an apology. The FX show \u201cEnglish Teacher\u201d included a bit about how \u201cthe kids are not into being woke\u201d and they\u2019re \u201csaying the \u2018R-word\u2019 again.\u201d And a recent Netflix comedy special invoked the word repeatedly.",
      "While its use has percolated in the comedy world for years, only recently has the word \u2014 and discussion of its return \u2014 become more normalized. That is fueled in no small part by a sense that the tide has turned both culturally and politically against those seeking to keep the word out of the popular lexicon. But the battle lines are not as clear as one might think, with even some on the left softening their stance on the slur\u2019s rebrand while some on the right \u2014 most notably former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin \u2014 decry its return.",
      "Timothy Shriver, the chairman of Special Olympics International, noted that the word is used across the political spectrum.",
      "\u201cPeople on the left and people on the right have treated people with intellectual disabilities in subhuman ways, historically,\u201d Shriver said.",
      "Still, there are some political dynamics at play. Kenneth Luna, a linguistics professor at California State University, Northridge, who teaches a course on forbidden language, said the word has emerged as a cultural signifier, used by people on the cultural and political right to reinforce a group allegiance \u2014 and create further division.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this term, the politics of cruelty,\u201d Luna said. \u201cIt\u2019s a political ploy to marginalize opponents. But it also reinforces, if you think about it, this kind of in group loyalty.\u201d",
      "And it is not just right-leaning voters who are using the word. Business Insider reported that some liberal-identifying people are using it, among other canceled words, in response to feeling overly self-censored by the fear of saying something non-inclusive.",
      "Robbie Goodwin, 33, a comedian and podcaster who identifies as an anti-Trump social Democrat, said he has used the word in his comedy to describe something dumb but never to describe a disabled person or to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings.",
      "But in the last year, Goodwin said, he has noticed people abusing the word, and he believes\u00a0the joke is going away, partly because Rogan and Musk are using it as a signifier of their culture war.",
      "\u201cI never try to offend anyone, and it feels like they are getting off on the fact that it\u2019s offending someone and triggering the libs,\u201d Goodwin said in an interview, adding that he is \u201cgrossed out\u201d by Rogan\u2019s comments about the word\u2019s supposed cultural victory. \u201cI found myself using it less now, because I see unfunny people using it. It\u2019s so cringe.\u201d",
      "Some high-profile people have pushed back. Palin, not one to usually embrace the policing of language, criticized Ye in March for using the word.",
      "\u201cBTW, he & everyone else (especially \u2018Christian conservatives\u2019) thinking it\u2019s hip to ramp up use of the \u2018R\u2019 word\u2026 please unfollow me & know that my disrespect for you is insurmountable,\u201d wrote Palin, whose son Trig has Down syndrome.",
      "The word\u2019s return has also been particularly hurtful to people with intellectual disabilities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating, and it upsets me beyond words to hear anyone use the R-word. That word isn\u2019t in style; it\u2019s hurtful,\u201d said Novie Craven, a Special Olympics athlete and host of the podcast \u201cInclusion Revolution Radio.\u201d \u201cWhen that word is used, you\u2019re telling the world that people like me, people with intellectual disabilities, don\u2019t belong, can\u2019t achieve or aren\u2019t worth respect.\u201d",
      "Craven added: \u201cBut you don\u2019t know us. You don\u2019t live our lives. If you did, you\u2019d understand how wrong that word is. You should get to know us before you speak about us.\u201d",
      "Before it became an insult, the term \u201cmental retardation,\u201d derived from the Latin for \u201cto slow,\u201d was adopted in the mid-1990s by the medical community and the government to replace words like \u201cmoron,\u201d \u201cidiot\u201d and \u201cimbecile\u201d in describing people with intellectual disabilities. The term was shortened and sent into the mainstream lexicon, and by the 1990s and the early 2000s, it had become an insult.",
      "The first big move against the word came in 2003, when President George W. Bush renamed the President\u2019s Committee on Mental Retardation as the President\u2019s Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities. Seven years later, President Barack Obama signed \u201cRosa\u2019s Law,\u201d which changed the term to \u201cintellectual disability\u201d in federal language.",
      "For a time, the pejorative against the millions of people in the United States who have intellectual or developmental disabilities was largely deemed socially taboo thanks to movements like \u201cSpread the Word to End the Word.\u201d However, the word never quite disappeared the way some others have, and the rise of social media in the 2010s provided a new way to observe its use and its growing embrace by those particularly on the right as political polarization grew.",
      "Now, Musk is arguably doing more to bring the slur back than anyone else.",
      "Musk, as leader of the administration\u2019s efforts to shrink the federal government, also has a direct influence whenever he invokes the slur, which he recently hurled at Yale history professor Timothy Snyder and used in a derisive nickname for Trump adviser Peter Navarro.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m tempted to call this guy a retard but I won\u2019t because I\u2019ve used that word too many times,\u201d Musk wrote Feb. 22 on X in response to Snyder.",
      "A study in January by Montclair State University found a 207.5% increase in posts on X using the slur four days after Musk used it in a post, or 312,642 posts using the term.",
      "Musk did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Daniela Peterka-Benton, an associate professor of justice studies at Montclair State, said in the study\u2019s news release that the increase in the slur\u2019s use after Musk is an \u201cexample of how hate content has been normalized and boosted in the online space.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe online space has always held potential dangers for marginalized communities, and it appears to be getting worse,\u201d she said.",
      "And while Luna, the linguist, believes \u201call bets are off\u201d in this political environment, he does not think the slur\u2019s return to the mainstream will last as long as Rogan might hope.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty bad, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get worse in the sense that I don\u2019t see people widely using it at all times because it violates linguistic social norms,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just have to combat it right away.\u201d"

      "Now, for the first time, the pope's an American who has taken the name Leo XIV.",
      "And he's from the South Side of Chicago, home of the beleaguered White Sox, the Daley political dynasty and, until they decamped for Washington and eventually the White House, Michelle and Barack Obama.",
      "Leo, who has spent much of his career ministering in Peru and leading the Vatican\u2019s powerful office of bishops,\u00a0was born Robert Francis Prevost on Sept. 14, 1955, at what was then called Mercy Hospital, at the corner of South Prairie Avenue and 34th Street.",
      "But while Prevost made his debut in Chicago, his parents and two older brothers were already living just south of the sprawling city in a working-class suburb called Dolton.",
      "Home was a tidy brick house the Prevosts bought new in 1949 on East 141st Place.",
      "Prevost's father, Louis Prevost, served in the Navy during World War II and worked as a superintendent of schools in the south suburbs of Chicago.",
      "The future pope's mother, Mildred Martinez Prevost, was a librarian with a master's degree in education and two sisters who were nuns.",
      "But the focus of the family was St. Mary of the Assumption Parish on 137th Street, which was then a busy church and school that straddled the Chicago/Dolton border.",
      "It was there that the Prevost family regularly attended mass, which back then was still in Latin. And it was there that his classmates realized that Robert was already practicing what he would one day be preaching.",
      "\u201cWe used to pray with our hands, you know, our fingers pointing to heaven, and after a while you get tired of doing that, and you just want to fold them over,\u201d former classmate\u00a0Marianne Angarola, 69, told the Chicago Sun-Times. \u201cRobert Prevost never folded his hands over. He was just godly. Not in an in-your-face way. It was part of his aura, like he was hand-selected, and he embraced it. And he wasn\u2019t weird. He was nice.\u201d",
      "While most of the boys from St. Mary's went on to local Catholic high schools like Mendel College Prep, Prevost left home and attended St. Augustine Seminary High School, a boarding school in Holland, Michigan, that was run by priests from the Order of St. Augustine.",
      "Upon graduating, he headed east to Villanova University in Pennsylvania, a private Catholic college, where he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in math in 1977. By then, he had found his calling, and in 1978 he officially joined the Order of St. Augustine.",
      "Four years later, in June 1982, Prevost was ordained a priest after having studied theology at Catholic Theological Union of Chicago.\u00a0Then he was off to Rome, where he earned a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical College of St. Thomas Aquinas in 1987.",
      "He returned to Chicago, but only briefly, before he was dispatched in 1985 to Peru, where he served the order as a missionary and taught canon law in the diocesan seminary in the city of Trujillo for 10 years.",
      "By 1999, Prevost was back in Chicago and appointed leader of the Augustinian order's Midwestern region, which he oversaw until 2010.",
      "Part of his turf included Providence Catholic High School in New Lenox, and it was during his tenure that allegations surfaced that the school\u2019s president, the Rev. Richard McGrath, had abused at least one student and kept child pornography images on his phone.",
      "The Sun-Times reported last June that the Augustinians paid a $2\u202fmillion settlement to the abused student and that Prevost never explained why he did not remove McGrath from his post.",
      "By 2014, Prevost was back in Peru after Pope Francis appointed him apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Chiclayo and later the bishop of Chiclayo.",
      "But in Peru, he was once again accused of failing to investigate and punish a priest accused of sexually abusing three sisters from 2007 to 2015.",
      "The Diocese of Chiclayo denied a cover-up, and Prevost has never been personally accused of abusing members of his flock.",
      "The allegations also did not derail his rise through the ranks.",
      "Francis promoted him to archbishop in January 2023 and made him a cardinal a year later.",
      "In public statements, Prevost often echoed Francis with calls for \u201creaching out to the poor, to the neediest, to those on the margins.\u201d",
      "But while Francis promoted greater acceptance of LGBTQ people, Prevost in a 2012 took a less tolerant tone in an address to a group of bishops, to whom he complained that Western culture was fostering \"sympathy for beliefs and practices that are at odds with the gospel,\" The New York Times reported.",
      "Meanwhile, Prevost's other job as the person who runs the office that helps decide who will be appointed a bishop made him a contender for the top job at the Vatican, which he landed Thursday.",
      "Speaking in Spanish and Italian but not in English, Pope Leo stood on the balcony overlooking his cheering flock and thanked the pope who blazed the path for him. He also laid out a vision of the future that Francis would most likely have applauded.",
      "\u201cWe can be a missionary church, a church that builds bridges, that is always open to receive everyone \u2014 just like in this square, to welcome everyone, in charity, dialogue and love,\u201d\u00a0he said."

      "\u201cIt\u2019s like the social media-ification of podcasts now,\u201d said Adrienne Cruz, a podcast manager who represents four small podcasts.",
      "Traditionally, \u201cpodcasting has been such a good fertile ground for small creators,\u201d said Cruz. The medium, which first emerged in the mid-2000s, was a small, niche market until the industry\u2019s first big hit, \u201cSerial,\u201d helped propel it into the mainstream. In recent years, simpler, personality-driven shows have taken off, giving hosts like Joe Rogan massive success across platforms like Spotify, SiriusXM, YouTube and Apple.",

      "A spokesperson for Spotify declined to comment.",
      "In its blog post unveiling the feature, Spotify said it aims to \u201cgive creators more comprehensive insight into the scale and depth of their audience.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor creators, plays will be a key metric on the home dashboard, show overview, and individual episode analytics pages, offering a near-immediate snapshot of how content is performing based on active engagement,\u201d the streaming service said.",

      "Dr. Mikhail \u201cMike\u201d Varshavski, a physician who talks about medical issues and hosts \u201cThe Checkup with Doctor Mike,\u201d called the news \u201cAWESOME.\u201d",

      "Spotify said plays will be rounded to the nearest thousandth or millionth. For the first 24 hours after publishing, episodes will display a \u201cnew\u201d label instead of a play count as they build up initial listens. After that period, episodes with fewer than 1,000 plays will display <1K and will refresh approximately every hour.",

      "\u201cWhoever said Cubs on the radio got it wrong,\" John Prevost said. \"It\u2019s Sox.\"",

      "\u201cWhat has been a surprise, and it has been humbling, is how many people are encouraging me to run for Governor,\u201d Tressel said in the statement, after emphasizing how much he was enjoying his current job.",
      "\u201cI have not decided yet, but when I became Lieutenant Governor in February, Ellen told me that it seemed like God had more work for me to do, and she was right,\u201d Tressel added, referring to his wife. \u201cWhile I have not ruled out a run for Governor \u2014 and there will be a time in the future for those conversations \u2014 for now, I will remain focused on helping Ohioans get off the sidelines and into our workforce so they can reach their full potential.\u201d",

But term-limited Gov. Mike DeWine has been calling committee members urging them to hold off, citing the possibility that other candidates could jump in the race, NBC News reported this week.",
      "DeWine\u2019s effort has been viewed by many party insiders as a move to keep the state party from committing advertising and organizational resources to Ramaswamy before Tressel makes a decision.\u00a0The governor picked Tressel to be his deputy less than three months ago, immediately triggering speculation that he was grooming him for even higher office.",

      "Tressel, 72, won multiple national championships as a college football coach, first guiding the lower-division Youngstown State Penguins to four titles in the 1990s before jumping to the Big Ten and winning the 2002 national championship with the Ohio State Buckeyes in his second year as head coach there. He resigned from Ohio State\u00a0in 2011 with the football program mired in controversy and an NCAA investigation involving players selling memorabilia to a tattoo parlor.",

An outside group supportive of Ramaswamy has already spent millions to amplify Trump\u2019s endorsement in TV ads. And Vance has directed some of his top political advisers to help steer Ramaswamy\u2019s campaign.",

      "On the Democratic side, Dr. Amy Acton, who served as DeWine\u2019s health director in the early days of the Covid pandemic, has launched a campaign for governor. Former Sen.

      "Their firm opposition in the narrowly divided House spells trouble for GOP leaders as they hope to advance the tax part of their party-line bill for President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda through committee next week. They can ultimately afford to lose only three Republican votes on the House floor.",

Though Kaavia\u2019s long-awaited arrival was joyous, Union recently shared that using a surrogate had an extreme emotional cost.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll never have peace with it, ever,\u201d Union told\u00a0Marie Claire\u00a0in an interview published on May 7. \u201cIt\u2019s such a personal journey that I may never know full peace with the coulda, woulda, shouldas.\u201d",

She had previously shared that she struggled through years of failed IVF cycles and around\u00a0eight or nine miscarriages\u00a0(there were so many she lost count).",
      "\u201cSurrogacy felt like a cuckold; watching somebody do something I can\u2019t do. To be there for somebody else succeeding where I failed \u2014 it is a mind f--- for people who have had my journey and who feel similarly.\u201d",
      "Union knows that some people who haven\u2019t needed to consider surrogacy may judge her for doing so, but she hasn\u2019t heard negative feedback so far. She explained that \u201cnobody has the balls to say that s--- to my face, so I don\u2019t say s--- because nobody\u2019s said s---.\u201d",
      "Her own attitude may have played a part in the type of responses she has received.",

      "Regardless of the way Kaavia \u2014 or her\u00a0three stepchildren\u00a0from Wade\u2019s previous relationships \u2014 entered her life, Union seems to be thriving as a mother.",
      "\u201cNothing we have done as parents feels revolutionary or groundbreaking. It just feels like common sense, kindness, compassionate,\u201d she said.",
      "And it was all worth it. Union shared that becoming a mother has brought her \u201cunmitigated joy.\u201d"

      "Based on the play by Josefina L\u00f3pez, which was also adapted into a 2002 HBO film starring America Ferrera, \"Real Women Have Curves\" is set in a small sewing factory in East Los Angeles during the sweltering summer of 1987.",
      "At the center of the story is Ana Garc\u00eda, a bright, ambitious Mexican-American teenager caught between fulfilling her family's obligations and achieving her own dreams.",
      "She is the only American citizen in her family and works at the factory alongside her mother and other undocumented Latina women, hiding that she\u2019s been accepted to her dream college in New York on a full scholarship.",
      "The play, which L\u00f3pez drew from her own experiences growing up in L.A., doesn\u2019t shy away from the harsh realities faced by immigrant women \u2014 addressing fear of deportation and financial insecurity, while conversations about weight, looks and body image carry on in the background.",
      "In the musical adaptation, this same story is set to music and lyrics by Joy Huerta and Benjamin Velez, injecting vibrant sounds and rhythm into a narrative often presented in a much more somber tone.",
      "\u201cI love the music,\u201d Justina Machado tells TODAY.com. Machado earned a Tony Award nominee for originating the role of Carmen, the matriarch of the Garc\u00eda family in the musical.",

      "\u201cThat was the first big regional theater project that I had,\u201d Machado says.",
      "Years later, when director Sergio Trujillo first approached her with hopes she would tackle the blunt and strong-willed mother figure, Machado was hesitant.",
      "\u201cI could never see myself playing that role,\u201d Machado says. But after participating in a reading of the show, she says it just clicked. \u201cI just fell in love with the character. I fell in love with the women. I fell in love with the story. I fell in love with the music.\u201d",
      "That love radiates onstage, with Machado artfully portraying Carmen as a captivating and endearing figure, a bright and welcomed contrast to the harsher character we came to know in the film.",
      "She\u2019s charming, but Carmen still ascribes to stifling ideas of body image that her daughter fights against in the musical. Her constant commentary about her daughter\u2019s weight culminates in the musical\u2019s title song.",
      "Overcome by the summer heat inside the factory, which has only been intensified by an army of irons and garment steamers, the women strip down to their undergarments, confronting their insecurities and celebrating their bodies in the process.",
      "\u201cI have hesitation every night,\u201d Machado says of stripping down. \u201cBut I know how important that number is, and I know what it does for people.\u201d",
      "The relationships are the show\u2019s emotional heart. Mothers, daughters, coworkers and friends, all navigating personal and systemic obstacles together.",
      "\u201cThese women are working under horrible conditions,\u201d Machado says. \u201cThese women are scared that that La Migra is going to show up any second, and they\u2019re working in 100 degree weather, and they\u2019re still finding joy and love and compassion.\u201d",
      "Making her Broadway debut as Ana, Tatianna C\u00f3rdoba also shines in the coming-of-age tale.",
      "\u201cYou just have to listen to each other, react to each other, and if you like each other, that really helps, and we really like each other,\u201d Machado says about C\u00f3rdoba. \u201cShe\u2019s easy to love.\u201d",
      "The tension that anchors the emotional arc of the show, whether or not Ana will convince her parents to let her move to New York and go to Columbia University, resonates across cultural boundaries.",
      "\u201cPeople can be very strong in their opinions, and still have all the love for their child,\u201d Machado says. \u201cNo matter what ethnicity you are, what nationality you are, that is a universal story.\u201d",
      "\"Real Women Have Curves\" reclaims narratives long flattened or ignored, spotlighting the women who hold communities together under impossible circumstances. And it does so with music, a lot of laughter, and hope.",

      "Karol G's 2023 last album, \"Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito,\" was her most revealing to date.",
      "The first track sets a vulnerable tone, with lyrics translating to: \"Give me time / Because I'm not in my best moment / But I'm getting better little by little, yes / Today I'm down, but tomorrow will be more beautiful.\"",
      "Now, the Colombian superstar is opening up even further in the new Netflix documentary \"Ma\u00f1ana Fue Bonito,\" which translates to \"Tomorrow Was Beautiful,\" a reflection of the point of her career where she found herself at her highest professionally \u2014 despite being at one of her lowest personally.",
      "The film \u2014 which hits the streamer on May 8 \u2014 brings viewers inside the story of how the Grammy winner rose from a little girl in Medell\u00edn with dreams of singing to an international superstar.",
      "There are plenty of tears, but there is also a lot of laughter, celebration and triumph \u2014 especially after many on Karol's team advised her against a stadium tour, and she persisted anyway. She went on to become the first-ever Latina to headline a global stadium tour.",
      "Directed by Cristina Costantini (who also helmed \"Mucho, Mucho Amor\" about the life of famed astrologer Walter Mercado, and the upcoming \"Sally\" about astronaut Sally Ride), \u201cTomorrow Was Beautiful\" also touches on the singer's personal life. After a breakup from a very public relationship, her most recent album was beloved by fans for artfully capturing the realities of heartbreak. In the documentary, she opens up for the first time about the experience.",
      "\"Love can make you feel like the happiest person on Earth, but at the same time it can destroy you, your dreams, your whole world... everything you are,\" she says in the film.",
      "There's a lot of people feeling the same...and they don't have the words...but they can with my music, my testimony, my journey. And I love that.",
      "Karol G",
      "Ultimately, though, \u201cMa\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito\" the album, tour, and now the documentary are all about Karol learning to love herself again. And after initially keeping the details private, she's also slowly opening up about learning to fall in love again, too: This time, into a \"healthy relationship\" with fellow Colombian superstar Feid. In the doc, she credits him as the person she's most been able to visualize herself with. On TODAY May 6, she told the third hour anchors: \"He understands what I do, I understand what he does. He is a really special soul. It is a blessing to have him.\"",
      "When asked if she was nervous about opening up about her love life for the first time in the Netflix doc, she admits in an interview with TODAY.com that it was a hard decision to make.",
      "\"I had a relationship that was like, super public, and everybody was into it ... so to have that hard moment of the breakup, in front of millions of eyes, was difficult,\" she says.",
      "\"But I think now it has become something that is part of my journey. I think I healed in front of my fans with my music. I understood that there\u2019s a lot of people feeling the same, and they are not able to speak about it, or they don\u2019t have the words, but they can with my music \u2014 with my testimony, with my journey. And I love that.\"",
      "Her love life, however, wasn't the hardest part for Karol to open up about. That, she says, was the portion where she reveals the real reason why she almost quit music more than a decade ago. As she previously told TODAY, in 2012, she decided she was done with singing and moved to New York to study business and English.",
      "But in the documentary, she explains that what truly led her to become \"disillusioned\" and take a break from music was a manager who came on to her when she was only 16 years old.",
      "\"It broke my heart, because it was like ... you are putting me in a situation in which you're using my hopes and dreams and putting this condition on achieving them,\" she says in the film, before adding that she couldn't bring herself to tell her parents what happened at the time.",
      "She tells TODAY.com now the scene in the documentary was so difficult for her to record, she has still yet to watch \"Tomorrow Was Beautiful\" with anyone but herself. But it was important for her to share her experience in the hopes that it will help other women.",
      "\"When I started being surrounded by different women in this industry, I started noticing that there was a cycle \u2014 that a lot of us have experienced something similar,\" she says. \"I wanted to share this moment so women can feel OK knowing that they can say no, and they can open that door and they can leave. And to feel comfortable in that.\"",
      "With her documentary also comes another transition: A hair color change. Famous for rocking different shades throughout her career stages (blue for her \u201cKG0516\u201d album; red and then pink for  \u201cMa\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito\u201d), Karol G is now sporting brown.",
      "\"I just went back to my natural color of my hair, because there is so much going on right now, so much coming right now,\" she says. \"And I think I really wanted to be my most natural and original and authentic and genuine version of myself.\"",
      "Clearly, tomorrow really was beautiful. And the day after that will be, too."

Although the Wayfarer Foundation is closing, my personal commitment to giving remains strong, and I\u2019m dedicated to making an impact on society through the ongoing mission and work.\u201d",

      "The statement did not reference the lawsuits involving Baldoni, Lively and the production of the 2024 film \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d Both Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios were named in the federal lawsuit Lively filed on Dec. 31, 2024 in which she alleged there was a \u201cretaliatory campaign Wayfarer launched against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns,\u201d her attorney said in a statement to NBC News at the time. Producer Jamey Heath, crisis communications representative Melissa Nathan and publicist Jennifer Abel were also named in the lawsuit.",
      "Lively\u2019s lawsuit came about a week after she filed an 80-page sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni, accusing him of creating a hostile workplace on the set of the film.",
      "Baldoni\u2019s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said in a statement to TODAY.com on Dec. 21 that the allegations were \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d The \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d star and director then responded by suing The New York Times for libel following the newspaper\u2019s publication of an article detailing Lively\u2019s accusations. He also filed a lawsuit against Lively, husband Ryan Reynolds, Lively\u2019s rep Leslie Sloane and Sloane\u2019s PR firm on Jan. 16, 2025.",
      "In the 179-page complaint, Baldoni alleged that the parties engaged in defamation and disregarded contractual claims. He and his team also created a website about the lawsuit that included alleged texts between the two co-stars, as well as Reynolds and Baldoni.",
      "A trial for the legal back-and-forth has been set for March 9, 2026 in New York.",
      "Earlier in May, Lively appeared on an episode of \u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers\u201d to promote her new movie, \u201cAnother Simple Favor.\u201d She also briefly addressed her \u201cintense\u201d year.",
      "\u201cWhat I can say without going too into it is that this year has been full of the highest highs and the lowest lows of my life. I see so many women around afraid to speak, afraid to share their experiences. Fear is by design. It\u2019s what keeps us silent,\u201d she said.",
      "Lively continued, \u201cI acknowledge that many people don\u2019t have the opportunity to speak. I feel fortunate that I have been able to. It\u2019s the women who have had the ability to use their voice that have kept me strong and have helped me in my fight to make the world safer for women and girls. It\u2019s a pretty simple thing.\u201d"

      "Goggins, who also attended the annual fashion event, arrived separately.",

      "\"I loved working with Walton. It was the best thing ever,\" Wood added.",
      "Last month, \"SNL\" caught heat for airing a \"White Lotus\" parody that poked fun at Wood's appearance. Though Wood herself called the sketch \"mean and unfunny,\" Goggins, who played her love interest on the \"White Lotus,\" fanned rumors of a rift between the pair by responding positively to it.",
      "\u201cHahahahahhahaha Amazzzingggg,\u201d Goggins wrote in a since-deleted comment on the official \"SNL\" Instagram account.",
      "Speculation about a behind-the-scenes beef between Wood and Goggins heated up after eagle-eyed fans noticed the pair stopped following each other on Instagram after the season finale aired.",
      "Fans also noted that Goggins and Wood had discussed their characters\u2019 star-crossed love story on Instagram while no longer tagging each other.",

    "story": [
      "Netflix\u2019s \"The Four Seasons\" ended its first season with a funeral, a pregnancy reveal and enough midlife chaos to fill a therapy retreat.",
      "The bittersweet dramedy was co-created by Tina Fey, Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield, and inspired by a 1981 movie of the same name. It's sure to strike a chord with its dark humor, layered performances and honest look at long-term relationships and second acts.",
      "Netflix hasn't weighed in on the show's future. But if the show does return for a second season, which couples are likely to make it out intact \u2014 and which are hanging by a thread?",
      "We spoke with the cast and creators to break down what\u2019s next for each pairing.",
      "Danny and Claude",
      "Of all the couples, Danny (Colman Domingo) and Claude (Marco Calvani) might have the deepest emotional well to draw from.",
      "The two are in an open marriage, but secrets \u2014 namely Danny hiding a serious health condition and secretly taking a job in Austin \u2014 threaten to derail everything.",
      "Marco Calvani, who plays Claude, tells TODAY.com he\u2019s honored viewers see his character as the emotional anchor of the show \u2014 even if he didn\u2019t always feel that way.",
      "\u201cUsually I\u2019m described as eccentric or flamboyant \u2014 and Claude is all those things,\u201d he told me, laughing. \u201cBut at the heart of it, Claude\u2019s entire identity is tied to Danny. If Danny disappears, Claude fades. That fear fuels everything, even his joy.\u201d",
      "He also opened up about Claude\u2019s feeling of being an outsider.",
      "\u201cClaude is the last one to join this friend group. He\u2019s still trying to earn his place, and that\u2019s something I think many immigrants can relate to \u2014 no matter how accepted you are, you always feel like you have to prove you deserve a seat at the table.\u201d",
      "By the finale, the couple seems on the cusp of healing \u2014 Danny even begins to believe Claude\u2019s whimsical theory that Nick has become a butterfly.",
      "Season 2 could deepen this emotional journey \u2014 if Danny can stay honest, and Claude can feel heard.",
      "Kate and Jack",
      "Kate (Tina Fey) and Jack (Will Forte) have a marriage held together by sarcasm, snide remarks, and years of habit \u2014 not exactly a recipe for longevity. Jack literally kisses another woman mid-season, and Kate spends most of the show either rolling her eyes or rolling solo.",
      "But something shifts during a near-death moment on a frozen lake, when Jack pulls Kate to safety.",
      "They agree to stay married \u2014 for now \u2014 at the end of the season.",
      "Anne and Ginny",
      "If \"The Four Seasons\" was bold enough to kill off a major character and still tee up a second season, then it\u2019s certainly bold enough to build an emotional arc around two women who loved the same man \u2026 and are now, possibly, raising a baby together.",
      "Anne banning Ginny from the funeral felt inevitable. But by the end of her chaotic eulogy, Anne breaks down and admits: \u201cI just realized, I didn\u2019t know him at all.\u201d",
      "That honesty \u2014 and the vulnerability that follows \u2014 crack something open for Anne and Ginny's relationship.",

      "And Ginny\u2019s pregnancy reveal gives the story fresh stakes. Could Anne become a mentor, a rival or something in between? Either way, this unlikely duo could become the emotional heart of season two.",
      "Will There Be a Season 2 of 'The Four Seasons'?",
      "Netflix hasn\u2019t officially renewed \"The Four Seasons.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a love story to all sorts of long relationships \u2014 not just romantic ones,\u201d co-showrunner Tracey Wigfield says. \u201cWe wanted to show middle-aged people still figuring things out. Because that\u2019s real.\u201d"

      "Law enforcement sources say the man who crashed into Aniston's front gates on Monday was taken to a hospital.",

      "His most recent activity on X came in mid-April, when he shared a post on his account from a Catholic commentator who called out Trump and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele for laughing about the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia of Maryland.

Born prematurely, Yussuf is now suffering from acute malnutrition, with the family unable to obtain formula or medication as Israel\u2019s blockade of aid and goods reaching Gaza enters its third month.",
      "After Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that he would give an order to ramp up the military offensive in Gaza with a plan to seize the entire strip, Yussuf\u2019s future is increasingly uncertain. Palestinians and observers fear fresh bombings and displacement, and aid groups warn of a spiraling humanitarian crisis marked by scarce food supplies.",
      "Yussuf is among the 9,000 children in Gaza to have been admitted or treated for acute malnutrition since the war began, with UNICEF saying in March that it had seen a surge in cases. Dr. Ahmed al-Farrah, head of the pediatrics and obstetrics ward at Nasser Hospital, told NBC News last week that more than 50 children had died \"from starvation.\"",
      "\u201cIsn\u2019t it a sin for a child to die like this?\u201d Al-Najjar, 30, told NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground, her face wracked with grief.",
      "Across Gaza, Palestinians expressed anxiety as they learned of the plan unanimously approved by Israel's security Cabinet to seize the entire territory in what Netanyahu described as an effort to defeat Hamas.",
      "\u201cWe were hoping and waiting for a decision for Israel to end the war against us \u2014 not the decision to occupy Gaza and displace its people,\u201d Walid Abu Muhsin, a street vendor from Khan Younis, told NBC News\u2019 crew Monday.",
      "Inside Gaza and abroad, humanitarian and aid groups condemned the Netanyahu-led government's plans to control Gaza indefinitely and distribute aid to Gaza via \"Israeli hubs under conditions set by the Israeli military\" once Israel lifts its blockade.",
      "The two goals will \"inevitably lead to countless more civilians killed and the further destruction of Gaza,\" U.N. deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said in a briefing Monday in New York.",
      "More than 52,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the local Health Ministry, since Israel launched its offensive in the enclave following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, which marked a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Around 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage into Gaza in the attacks, with more than 50 people, both dead and alive, believed to remain in Hamas' captivity, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The families of hostages who remain held in Gaza have warned that a ramped-up offensive will only put the lives of their loved ones at further risk.",
      "Meanwhile, right-wing ministers in Netanyahu\u2019s fragile government coalition celebrated the plans for an expanded offensive, having advocated for such a move before and after the last ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which held for two months from Jan. 19 to March 18.",
      "Prior to that ceasefire, the Israeli military had taken control of around a third of Gaza.",
      "Even so, hopes remained in Gaza and Israel for a resumption of that truce ahead of a visit from President Donald Trump to the region planned for next week.",
      "While Trump has repeatedly touted a proposal for the U.S. to eventually take ownership of the Gaza Strip, Palestinians there implored him to take action to halt Israel\u2019s plans for an expanded offensive.",
      "Khan Younis resident Abu Muhsin, 55, asked \u201cWhere is Trump who calls for freedom and democracy?\u201d",
      "In Israel, meanwhile, Cabinet Minister Ze\u2019ev Elkin said Monday that a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d remained for talks to resume.",
      "From outside of his Cabinet, Netanyahu has faced growing criticism for resuming and expanding Israel's offensive in Gaza. The latest denunciation came from Eran Duvdevani, a prominent retired colonel who led a campaign by former and reserve Israeli paratroopers calling for an end to the war.",
      "Duvdevani told NBC News that a growing number of reservists were already rejecting calls to return to service in a war they increasingly view as politically motivated.",
      "He added that without a fresh truce between Israel and Hamas, Trump's intervention was likely the only thing that could stop an expanded offensive.",
      "\"This is the only way, to press Netanyahu,\" Duvdevani said in a phone interview early Tuesday. \"Nothing will happen if Trump will not press him.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a hearing for\u00a0Netanyahu's testimony in his ongoing public corruption trial ended early Tuesday, according to Israeli newspaper\u00a0The Times of\u00a0Israel. It came as the Israeli military issued an evacuation warning for Yemen\u2019s Sanaa Airport ahead of what appeared to be a pending attack."

      "\u201cWe know infiltration is happening, whole infrastructure has been there for years, so do we really need to provide exact proof?\u201d he said.",
      "Yusuf and others say the international community must play an active role in defusing the situation. But that has become more difficult since the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, where its presence had historically acted as a deterrent against India-Pakistan violence.",
      "Trump also appears to be preoccupied with securing trade deals, \u201cwhich is giving time for India and Pakistan to attack and counterattack,\u201d said Praveen Donthi, a New Delhi-based senior analyst at the International Crisis Group.",
      "Within Pakistan, Yusuf said, there is debate as to whether Pakistan should be satisfied with the downing of Indian military aircraft or deeper shelling of Indian-administered Kashmir.",
      "\u201cPakistan will not offer India a face-saver like we did in 2019 by voluntarily handing over the captured pilot,\u201d Yusuf said, referring to a dogfight between the two nations after a deadly attack on Indian security forces in Kashmir that also fueled worries of all-out war between the two nations.",
      "The stakes are now higher than ever, Donthi said.",
      "\u201cAll it takes is a miscalculation or a mistake, and we know both establishments have been under pressure to retaliate,\u201d he said.",
      "Even if the two countries were to de-escalate quickly, he said, this week\u2019s violence will have long-term repercussions, uniting \u201canti-India militants\u201d in Pakistan and increasing the likelihood of further attacks in India.",
      "India has been clear \u201cthat we are willing to raise the stakes,\u201d Hooda said.",
      "\u201cIf Pakistan wants to escalate it further, whatever the justification, we\u2019ll just have to wait and see,\u201d he said."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President JD Vance said Wednesday that the Trump administration believes Russia is \"asking for too much\" during talks to bring its war in Ukraine to an end.",
      "\u201cRight now, the Russians are asking for a certain set of requirements, a certain set of concessions, in order to end the conflict. We think they\u2019re asking for too much,\u201d Vance said at a Munich Leaders Meeting on international security policy in Washington, D.C.",
      "Asked about Vance\u2019s comments later Wednesday, President Donald Trump said, \u201cIt\u2019s possible that\u2019s right.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are getting to a point where some decisions are going to have to be made,\u201d said Trump, who has said repeatedly that U.S. may have to walk away from the negotiations if no progress has made.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not happy about it,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about it.\u201d",
      "Trump and other officials have intensified pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin in recent weeks.",
      "Vance, who has long criticized U.S. support for Ukraine and was involved in the February Oval Office blow-up with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Wednesday the Trump administration is continuing discussions with Kyiv on what it needs to bring the conflict to an end.",
      "\u201cWhat the president has said is that he will walk away if he thinks he\u2019s not making progress\u201d in talks with the two countries, said Vance, who last week predicted that the war was not going to end \"anytime soon.\"",
      "The vice president said at the event Wednesday that the U.S. would like to see direct talks between Russia and Ukraine as the next major step in the diplomatic process.",
      "\u201cObviously, the United States is happy to participate in those conversations, but it\u2019s very important for the Russians and the Ukrainians to start talking to one another,\u201d he said.",
      "Vance added that he thinks it would be \u201cprobably impossible\u201d for the U.S. to mediate the talks entirely, without at least some direct conversations between Russia and Ukraine to try to close the \u201cgulf\u201d in what the two countries are demanding. He said the U.S. has been frustrated with the negotiations because, he said, Russia and Ukraine \"hate each other so much\" that the first 30 minutes of any hourlong discussion, for example, is spent \"complaining about some historical grievance.\"",
      "The U.S. has participated in talks with Ukraine and European partners in recent weeks, but there don't appear to be formal talks underway at the moment.",
      "In an interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that aired over the weekend, Trump said he believed the U.S. was \"closer\" in making progress with one party, \"and maybe not as close with the other.\" He declined to say which side was the one making progress. At the same time, however, the president admitted that \"maybe it's not possible to do\" a deal.",
      "Asked how long he would give both countries before walking away from the talks, Trump said, \"Well, there will be a time when I will say, 'OK, keep going. Keep being stupid and keep fighting.'\"",
      "After the Oval Office spat, the administration has softened its approach toward Ukraine, especially as a deal to give the U.S. access to some of Ukraine's rare earth minerals finally came together.",
      "In late April, Trump expressed outrage at Putin after his military launched one of the most devastating attacks on Ukraine's major cities since the war began. \u201cVladimir, STOP!\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Russia's attacks have still continued, with its army launching four ballistic missiles and 142 drones at Ukraine overnight, according to Zelenskyy, who had said without providing details Tuesday that it planned to ramp up pressure on Russia.",
      "\"The coming weeks are expected to be very active for Ukraine in diplomacy,\" he said. \"We are planning new measures to increase pressure on Russia \u2014 to protect our people. I thank everyone who stands with Ukraine.\""
