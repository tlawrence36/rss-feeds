      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The main cause of Gene Hackman's death was heart disease, but he was also in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease and likely had not eaten for a long time, according to a new autopsy report.",
      "The report documents the 95-year-old actor\u2019s poor heart health, noting he had experienced congestive heart failure, an aortic valve replacement and an irregular heart beat. He was given a pacemaker in April 2019.",
      "Hackman\u2019s carbon monoxide concentration was less than 5% saturation, which is within the normal range. He tested negative for the hantavirus, which is a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings.",
      "Authorities have said Hackman\u2019s wife, Betsy Arakawa, likely died Feb. 11 at home from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Her autopsy report hasn\u2019t yet been released.",
      "A toxicology report says Hackman tested negative for alcohol and intoxicating drugs, but that he had a low concentration of acetone in his system that indicates prolonged fasting.",
      "Hackman appeared to have outlived Arakawa at home by about a week, possibly unaware of his wife's death. Hackman\u2019s pacemaker showed an abnormal heart rhythm on Feb. 18 \u2014 the day he likely died, according to the state's chief medical examiner.",
      "Records released earlier in the investigation showed Arakawa made phone calls and internet searches as she scoured for information on flu-like symptoms and breathing techniques.",
      "Recently released videos outline the scope of the investigation into the deaths of Hackman and Arakawa.",
      "Before they understood how Hackman and Arakawa died, authorities recorded themselves conducting interviews with workers and returning to Hackman\u2019s home to search for more evidence. Detectives searched the home in early March for Arakawa\u2019s laptop and other clues.",

      "The annual AFI Life Achievement Award presentation is always a starry night in Hollywood, but Saturday\u2019s ceremony at the Dolby Theatre brought together legendary stars from a seemingly bygone era of cinema to honor Francis Ford Coppola",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Steven Spielberg proclaimed \u201cThe Godfather\u201d the \u201cgreatest American film ever made,\u201d Robert De Niro teasingly bemoaned being cast in the sequel and not the original and Harrison Ford fought back tears reflecting on his role in the 1974 film, \u201cThe Conversation.\u201d",
      "At the center of it all was Francis Ford Coppola, who on Saturday received the AFI Life Achievement Award at a ceremony at Dolby Theatre that brought together legendary stars from a seemingly bygone era of cinema,",
      "A founding AFI trustee, Coppola\u2019s recognition from the organization was a kind of full circle moment for the \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d director.",
      "\u201cWhen I was a kid there was the Oscars and that was it. Now they\u2019re going to have an award show for the best award show,\u201d the 86-year-old said on the red carpet ahead of the show. \u201cBut this is a little different because it\u2019s a personal recognition of the people that you\u2019ve known all your life and your colleagues over many years, so it\u2019s like a homecoming in a way.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou, sir, are peerless. You have taken what came before and redefined the canon of American film,\u201d Spielberg said.",
      "Coppola sat between Spielberg and George Lucas, as actors and fellow filmmakers like Spike Lee, Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino and Morgan Freeman took turns gushing over the Oscar winner.",
      "\u201cDreamer of dreams on a dime, teller of tales that cost and lost millions. But tonight, (expletive) the bankers and the bank,\u201d Freeman said to laughs and cheers.",
      "Lucas, Coppola\u2019s longtime friend and colleague, presented him with the award. The pair have known each other for decades and cofounded their own production company, American Zoetrope, in 1969.",
      "\u201cYou rounded up a bunch of young film students, gathered us together. We moved to San Francisco, hoping to beat the system. And we did. Like the filmmakers from the dawn of the art form, we had no rules. We wrote them, and you were holding the pen,\u201d Lucas said.",
      "Coppola was mostly stoic throughout the ceremony as Hollywood sang his praises \u2014 until he accepted the award at the end of the night. He beamed as he approached the stage and thanked the room, which was filled with some of his family members as well as multigenerational A-listers.",
      "\u201cNow I understand here, this place that created me, my home, isn\u2019t really a place at all, but you \u2014 friends, colleagues, teachers, playmates, family, neighbors, all the beautiful faces are welcoming me back,\u201d he said. \u201cI am and will always be nothing more than one of you.\u201d",
      "Coppola was the 50th recipient of the award first handed out to John Ford in 1973.",
      "Guests were served wine from the Francis Ford Coppola Winery and after dinner \u2014 true to his Italian heritage \u2014 a trio of cannolis. Actors who have worked with Coppola painted a unified picture of him as a director, reminiscing on how they were invited to participate and educated about film in a way that empowered them.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very professorial. He talks about history and things and even older movies in the scene he\u2019s inspired by,\u201d said \u201cThe Godfather III\u201d star Andy Garcia. \u201cYou go into working with him in a movie, and you go in seeking an associate\u2019s degree and you would walk out with a master\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Coppola last year released his long-in development \u201cMegalopolis,\u201d a Roman epic set in a modern New York. The film drew mixed reviews from critics and flopped with audiences. Coppola, though, has maintained he was compelled to make \u201cMegalopolis\u201d as an artist, not as a businessman. He self-financed the film.",
      "\u201cFor a year in our culture when the importance of the arts is minimized, and our industry is seemingly out in the open that the only metric to judge a film\u2019s success is by how much money it makes, I hang on to individuals like Francis for inspiration, who live through their convictions,\u201d said Adam Driver, who starred in the film.",
      "Last year\u2019s AFI honoree was Nicole Kidman. Other recent recipients include John Williams, Mel Brooks, Denzel Washington and Julie Andrews.",

      "\u201cMe love you long time,\u201d a Vietnamese sex worker tells the U.S. troops, swiveling her hips as she hawks her services. \u201cYou party?\u201d The first female character in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Vietnam War classic \u201cFull Metal Jacket,\u201d she appears for just a moment \u2014 and halfway through the film.",
      "Likewise, it\u2019s an hour into Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d when a helicopter suddenly deposits three women onto a stage. They're scantily clad Playboy Bunnies, choppered in to rile up the troops. They, too, appear for just a few minutes.",
      "The Vietnam War produced some of the most unforgettable films of the late 1970s and 1980s, as top Hollywood filmmakers like Kubrick, Coppola, Oliver Stone and others grappled with its painful legacy. Few, however, had classic, or even three-dimensional, female characters \u2014 with the notable exception of \u201cComing Home,\u201d which won Jane Fonda an Oscar.",
      "But while these films were almost exclusively about how war dehumanized men \u2014 with female characters mere devices to tell that story \u2014 the opposite was often true of Vietnamese films about the conflict. Many of these were told from a female viewpoint \u2014 the stories of brave and loyal women, for example, left to hold families together.",
      "Here are some ways that classic Vietnam War films used female characters to tell their stories:",
      "Michael Cimino\u2019s multi-Oscar-winning \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d focuses on three lifelong buddies from a Pennsylvania steel town who go off to fight, with traumatic results.",
      "Since the 1978 drama starts and ends at home, there\u2019s room for a female character in Meryl Streep\u2019s Linda, girlfriend of Nick (Christopher Walken) who also connects with Michael (Robert De Niro). An early-career Streep was such a magnetic presence as Linda \u2014 earning an Oscar nomination \u2014 that it disguised a fairly thin role that mainly advanced the men's narrative.",
      "A rare contrast was Hal Ashby\u2019s \u201cComing Home\u201d the same year, in which Fonda and Jon Voight both won Oscars for the tale of a Marine wife embroiled in an intense affair with a wounded veteran at the rehab center where she volunteers.",
      "\u201cThis is the only Hollywood film set during the Vietnam War that\u2019s told from the point of view of a female character,\u201d says filmmaker Tony Bui, who also teaches Vietnam War cinema at Columbia University. \u201cThat's really saying something.\u201d",
      "Its tortured journey to the screen is a drama in itself, but 1979's \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d with Martin Sheen as an army captain tasked with assassinating a renegade U.S. colonel (Marlon Brando), is considered a masterpiece of the genre. As in many Hollywood Vietnam films, women are extras in villages, screaming and running from gunfire and deadly explosions \u2014 or killed brutally for no reason at all.",
      "Then there are the Playboy Bunnies, who gyrate to \u201cSuzy Q\u201d as the troops become increasingly frenzied with erotic excitement and eventually storm the stage.",
      "Lan Duong, assistant professor of cinema studies at the University of Southern California, sees Coppola trying to make a connection between sex, warfare and masculinity.",
      "\u201cWith American white women in particular, they\u2019re seen as part of the American mythology around manhood,\u201d Duong says. Full-blooded manhood with raging hormones, she says, is \u201cas American as apple pie.\u201d",
      "In 1986's \u201cPlatoon,\u201d Stone's Oscar-winning depiction of jungle warfare, representation of women comes in a horrific scene in which U.S. troops kills hundreds of innocent villagers, evoking the real-life My Lai massacre. During the slaughter, idealistic soldier Chris (Charlie Sheen) comes upon soldiers raping young women. \u201cShe\u2019s a human being!\u201d he screams. They reply: \u201cYou don\u2019t belong in \u2019Nam, man.\u201d",
      "These women are given no voice. They appear \u201conly in relation to the violence inflicted by men,\u201d Bui says.",
      "In Brian de Palma\u2019s \u201cCasualties of War\u201d (1989), the tragic rape victim actually becomes a central character in the plot. This does not mean, however, that we learn much of anything about this Vietnamese girl (Thuy Thu Le).",
      "Based on a real event, the film follows five soldiers whose leader (Sean Penn) devises a sickening plan: The group will kidnap a young girl for \u201crecreation\u201d during a mission.",
      "Only Pvt. Eriksson (Michael J. Fox) objects. The four others not only rape the girl, but eventually pump her with bullets. Eriksson takes the case to superiors, who advise him to drop it. But Eriksson persists, and the men earn punishment.",
      "Though important, this brutalized girl is again voiceless. \u201cShe goes from suffering, to suffering more, and then gets killed \u2014 that\u2019s her arc,\u201d says Bui, who includes the movie in a Criterion Channel collection he has curated on Vietnam films.",
      "Kubrick\u2019s memorable 1987 \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d contains two brief, stereotypical scenes involving sex workers. But the most interesting scene involving a female character comes during battle, where a sniper targeting U.S. troops turns out to be a terrified girl in pigtails. As she lies mortally wounded, she begs quietly, \u201cShoot me.\u201d The soldiers oblige.",
      "The stereotypical nature of the sex worker scenes is, for Bui, redeemed somewhat by the character of the sniper (Ngoc Le), whose courage is acknowledged.",
      "In Bui's own \u201cThree Seasons,\u201d a 1999 Vietnamese-American production, sex worker Lan (Diep Bui) is central to the story, an exploration of postwar life in Ho Chi Minh City. A cyclo driver falls in love with Lan and trails her around the city, trying to help her find a better life.",
      "Bui says his research has found that more than half of Vietnamese films about the conflict have female protagonists. One of the most famous, H\u1ea3i Ninh\u2019s landmark \u201cThe Little Girl of Hanoi\u201d (1974), follows a young girl (Lan H\u01b0\u01a1ng) searching for her family in bombed-out Hanoi.",
      "Another, \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh\u2019s \u201cWhen the Tenth Month Comes\u201d (1984), tells the story of Duyen (L\u00ea V\u00e2n), a young wife and mother in the rural north whose husband goes to war. Her ailing father-in-law asks frequently why the soldier has not written home. Duyen learns one day that her husband's been dead for a year and enlists a local schoolteacher to help her hide that by forging eloquent letters.",
      "The character is emblematic of the way Vietnamese culture has long portrayed the woman: fierce, loyal and resilient in the face of adversity, argues Duong.",
      "\u201cShe is beautiful. She\u2019s suffering. She\u2019s loyal to the memory of her dead husband,\u201d notes Duong. \u201cIt\u2019s been argued by \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh himself ... that she's a symbol for the nation itself. So it becomes a really rich metaphor for filmmakers.\u201d",
      "The risk, she adds, is that such characters, serving as symbols, can also lack dimension.",
      "Stone is one of the only directors to have explicitly addressed the minimal role of women in his Vietnam works, saying \u201cPlatoon\u201d was deliberately a male-driven narrative.",
      "But with his third and last Vietnam War film, \u201cHeaven & Earth\u201d (1993), Stone shifted to the perspective of a real-life Vietnamese woman: Le Ly (Hiep Thi Le), who endures rape and torture as a young woman, then moves to California with her troubled American military husband (Tommy Lee Jones).",
      "\u201cThere is some truth to the criticism of my treatment of women,\u201d Stone said while making the film. \u201cI have a lot to learn about everything, not just women.\u201d",
      "Making his point crystal clear, Stone dedicates the film at the end to his mother, Jacqueline Stone.",

      "Flares were lit, red smoke filled the air, Welsh flags were waved proudly and songs sung raucously.",
      "Wrexham was one step from the Premier League and nothing was going to stop this party.",

      "But everyone inside the club's historic Racecourse Ground knew what was coming, and within seconds of the whistle the field was a sea of red as Wrexham supporters celebrated wildly.",
      "The Welsh soccer team's remarkable rise under Hollywood owners Reynolds and Rob McElhenney has hit a new high \u2014 returning to the second tier for the first time since the 1981-82 campaign.",
      "It means that from next season it will be playing one level below the Premier League, something that was unthinkable just four years ago when it was a struggling non-league team.",
      "Reynolds and McElhenney were part of a full house of nearly 13,000 fans.",
      "\u201cThe stadium and atmosphere is incredible, it\u2019s a massive club and a big project, it will be a special week now,\u201d said striker Sam Smith, who scored two goals in the win.",
      "Who knows what's next for a team that has defied the odds since the actors bought it for $2.5 million in 2021 and turned it into a household name around the world.",
      "\u201cThe owners have come in and done an amazing job. I\u2019m so pleased for them because they deserve it,\u201d manager Phil Parkinson said. \u201cThey\u2019re invested in all the decisions, but they trust us in in our decision making and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve had success over the last three years.\u201d",
      "While celebrations greeted the final whistle, the party began much earlier after promotion rival Wycombe lost to Leyton Orient 1-0.",
      "Wrexham just needed victory then to clinch the second promotion place in League One.",
      "Reynolds posed for selfies with fans outside and served drinks behind the bar in a marquee set up outside the nearby Turf pub, which has earned world renown from the docuseries \u201cWelcome to Wrexham.\u201d",
      "Fans erupted in cheers after the final whistle of Wycombe\u2019s loss, which was shown on a big screen.",
      "Wrexham just needed to finish the job off against fourth-placed Charlton and eased nerves with two goals in the space of three minutes in the first half. Oliver Rathbone\u2019s long shot in the 15th minute was followed by Smith\u2019s volley.",
      "When Smith headed in a third in the 81st the outcome was in no doubt and Wrexham's fans serenaded the players with chants of \u201cWe are going up.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is for those supporters who followed the team in those 15 years in the (non-league) National League in really, really tough times, but stood strong behind their club and they deserve tonight,\u201d Parkinson said.",

      "Multiple artists and producers involved in the center\u2019s Tapestry of Pride schedule, which had been planned for June 5 to 8, told The Associated Press that their events had been quietly canceled or moved to other venues. And in the wake of the cancellations, Washington\u2019s Capital Pride Alliance has disassociated itself from the Kennedy Center.",
      "\u201cWe are a resilient community, and we have found other avenues to celebrate,\u201d said June Crenshaw, deputy director of the alliance. \u201cWe are finding another path to the celebration \u2026 but the fact that we have to maneuver in this way is disappointing.\u201d",
      "The Kennedy Center\u2019s website still lists Tapestry of Pride on its website with a general description and a link to the World Pride site. There are no other details.",
      "The Kennedy Center did not respond to a request from the AP for comment.",
      "The move comes on the heels of massive changes at the Kennedy Center, with President Donald Trump firing both the president and chairman in early February. Trump replaced most of the board with loyalists, who then elected him the new Kennedy Center chairman.",
      "The World Pride event, held every two years, starts in just under a month \u2014 running from May 17 through June 8 with performances and celebrations planned across the capital city. But Trump administration policies on transgender rights and comments about Kennedy Center drag performances have sparked concern about what kind of reception attendees will receive.",
      "\u201cI know that D.C. as a community will be very excited to be hosting World Pride, but I know the community is a little bit different than the government,\u201d said Michael Roest, founder and director of the International Pride Orchestra, which had its June 5 performance at the Kennedy Center abruptly canceled within days of Trump\u2019s takeover.",
      "Roest told the AP he was in the final stages of planning the Kennedy Center performance after months of emails and Zoom calls. He was waiting on a final contract when Trump posted on social media Feb. 7 of the leadership changes and his intention to transform the Kennedy Center\u2019s programming.",
      "Immediately the Kennedy Center became nonresponsive, Roest said. On Feb. 12, he said, he received a one-sentence email from a Kennedy Center staffer stating, \u201cWe are no longer able to advance your contract at this time.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey went from very eager to host to nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not since heard a word from anybody at the Kennedy Center, but that\u2019s not going to stop us.\u201d",
      "In the wake of the cancellation, Roest said he managed to move the International Pride Orchestra performance to the Strathmore theater in nearby Bethesda, Maryland.",
      "Crenshaw said some other events, including a drag story time and a display of parts of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, would be moved to the World Pride welcome center in Chinatown.",
      "Monica Alford, a veteran event planner with a long history of working with the Kennedy Center, was scheduled to organize an event June 8 as part of Tapestry of Pride, but said she also saw communication abruptly end within days of Trump\u2019s takeover.",
      "Alford organized the first ever drag brunch on the Kennedy Center rooftop in 2024, and said she regarded the institution \u2014 and its recent expansion known as The Reach \u2014 as \u201cmy home base\u201d and \u201ca safe space for the queer community\u201d",
      "She said she was still finalizing the details of her event, which she described as \u201cmeant to be family-friendly, just like the drag brunch was family-friendly and classy and sophisticated.\u201d",
      "She said she mourns the loss of the partnership she nurtured with the Kennedy Center.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing our community a disservice \u2014 not just the queer community but the entire community,\u201d she said.",
      "Roest said he never received an explanation as to why the performance was canceled so late in the planning stages. He said his orchestra would no longer consider performing at the Kennedy Center, and he believes most queer artists would make the same choice.",
      "\u201cThere would need to be a very, very public statement of inclusivity from the administration, from that board, for us to consider that,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise it is a hostile performance space.\u201d",

      "A former roommate of one of Harvey Weinstein's accusers has testified the woman told her in July 2006 that the then-movie mogul had forcibly performed oral sex on her",
      "NEW YORK -- Hovering in the doorway of her roommate's bedroom one evening in July 2006, TV production assistant Miriam Haley said Harvey Weinstein \u2014 her boss \u2014 had forcibly performed oral sex on her, her then-roommate testified Thursday at the ex-movie mogul's retrial.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018Miriam, that sounds like rape. I think you should call a lawyer,\u2019\u201d but a shaken Haley seemed disinclined to do so, recalled the ex-roommate, Elizabeth Entin.",
      "If secondhand, it was the first testimony jurors have gotten so far about any of the alleged sexual assaults at the heart of the retrial, which opened Wednesday. Haley and two other accusers are expected to testify later in the weekslong proceeding.",
      "Weinstein, 73, maintains that he has never sexually assaulted or raped anyone. His lawyers argue that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with the Oscar-winning producer in hopes of getting ahead in the entertainment business.",
      "Weinstein was transformed in 2017 from a Hollywood tycoon into the #MeToo movement's archvillain, after a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him became public.",
      "He was convicted in 2020 of raping Jessica Mann, who was once an aspiring actor, and sexually assaulting Haley, who worked on the Weinstein-produced \u201cProject Runway.\u201d But New York's highest court overturned his conviction last year, finding that the trial judge had allowed prejudicial testimony.",
      "The reversal led to the retrial, which includes an additional allegation of forcible oral sex on a different woman, former model Kaja Sokola. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.",
      "Entin was among the witnesses who are returning to the stand five years after testifying in the landmark #MeToo case. But prosecutors, some defense lawyers and the judge are different \u2014 and so are the contours of the testimony and evidence being elicited.",
      "For instance, this time Entin didn't give any details of what she said Haley told her about the alleged sexual assault.",
      "And Entin wasn't asked about a recollection that made for a memorable and rare light moment at the first trial \u2014 a time when she said Weinstein showed up uninvited and was chased around the women's apartment by Entin's pet Chihuahua.",
      "Farber had indicated he didn't think that having Entin describe the purported episode was fair game for the trial.",
      "In another measure of the looping trajectory of the case, Entin found herself testifying about what she has said and written about the first trial itself. The fashion startup founder and consultant has reflected on the case in a book, on podcasts and some interviews.",
      "Weinstein attorney Jennifer Bonjean confronted her with instances in which Entin referred to her participation in the first trial as her \u201c15 minutes of fame\u201d and compared gearing up for testifying to preparing for battle.",
      "Entin responded tensely that being cross-examined was a form of \u201cvery civilized battle.\u201d",
      "The voluble Entin said that her writing style was sometimes \u201cmildly hyperbolic,\u201d but that she'd been describing how she girded herself for a daunting experience.",
      "The Associated Press does not identify people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they agree to be named. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.",

      "The Vietnam War cast a long shadow across one of the most fertile periods of American filmmaking, and has led filmmakers for the half-century since to reckon with its complicated legacy.",
      "These 10 films, assembled to mark the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, range from indelible anti-war classics to Vietnamese portraits of resistance, capturing the vastness of the war\u2019s still-reverberating traumas.",
      "The war was more than a decade in and some eight years from its conclusion when a 25-year-old Martin Scorsese made this six-minute short. In it, a man simply shaves himself before a sink and a mirror. After a few knicks and cuts, he doesn\u2019t stop, continuing until his face is a bloody mess \u2014 a neat but gruesome metaphor to Vietnam.",
      "A young girl (Lan H\u01b0\u01a1ng) searches for her family in the bombed-out ruins of Hanoi in H\u1ea3i Ninh\u2019s landmark of Vietnamese cinema. It\u2019s a work of wartime propaganda (it begins with the intro: \u201chonoring the heroes of Hanoi who defeated the American imperialist B-52 bombing raid\u201d) but also of aching humanity. Set against the December 1972 bombing raids on Hanoi, \u201cThe Little Girl of Hanoi\u201d is cinema made in the very midst of war.",
      "Controversy greeted Peter Davis\u2019 landmark documentary around its release, but time has only proved how soberly clear-eyed it was. Newsreel clips and homefront interviews are contrasted with the horrors on the ground in Vietnam in this penetrating examination of the gulf between American policy and Vietnamese reality. Its title comes from President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s line, said when escalating the war, that \u201cthe ultimate victory will depend on the hearts and minds of the people who actually live out there.\u201d",
      "It's arguably the preeminent American film about the Vietnam War. No other movie more grandly or tragically charts the American evolution from innocence to disillusionment than Michael Cimino\u2019s devastating epic about working-class friends (Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Savage) from a Pennsylvania steel town drafted into war. The final sing-along scene to \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d after their lives have irrevocably changed, remains a powerfully poignant gut punch.",
      "Francis Ford Coppola wagered everything he had on his masterpiece \u2014 and nearly lost it. \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d which transposes Joseph Conrad\u2019s \u201cHeart of Darkness\u201d to the Vietnam War, is an epic of madness that teeters on the brink of hallucination. Shot in the Philippines and more faithful to Conrad than to Vietnam, \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d doesn\u2019t so much illuminate the chaos and moral confusion of the war as elevate it to grandiose nightmare.",
      "The 1980s saw a wave of Hollywood films about Vietnam, including \u201cFirst Blood,\u201d \u201cHamburger Hill,\u201d \u201cGood Morning Vietnam,\u201d \u201cCasualties of War\u201d and \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July.\u201d Foremost among them is the Oscar best picture-winning \u201cPlatoon,\u201d which Oliver Stone wrote based on his own experiences as an infantryman in Vietnam. Widely acclaimed for its realism, Stone\u2019s film remains among the most intensely vivid and visceral dramatizations of the war.",
      "Stanley Kubrick should be more often thought of as the supreme anti-war moviemaker. His devastating World War I film \u201cPaths of Glory\u201d and the subversive satire \u201cDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\u201d are classics in their own right. \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d carries those films\u2019 themes of dehumanization into an even more brutal place. Split between the harrowing boot-camp tyranny of R. Lee Ermey\u2019s drill instructor and the urban violence of the 1968 Tet Offensive, \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d fuses both ends of the war machine.",
      "How former soldiers lived with their experience in Vietnam has been a subject of many fine films, from Hal Ashby\u2019s \u201cComing Home\u201d (1978) to Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cDa 5 Bloods\u201d (2020). In Werner Herzog\u2019s nonfiction gem, he profiles the astonishing story of German-American pilot Dieter Dengler. In the film, which Herzog later remade as 2007\u2019s \u201cRescue Dawn\u201d with Christian Bale, Dengler recounts \u2014 and sometimes reenacts \u2014 his experience being shot down over Laos, being captured and tortured and then escaping into the jungle.",
      "Not long after the turn of the century, former U.S. defense secretary and Vietnam War architect Robert S. McNamara sat for interviews with documentarian Errol Morris. The result is a chilling reflection on the thinking that led to one of American\u2019s greatest follies. It\u2019s not a mea culpa but a thornier and more disquieting rumination on how rationalized ideology can lead to the deaths of millions \u2014 and still not yield an apology. Of McNamara\u2019s lessons, No. 1 is \u201cempathize with the enemy.\u201d",
      "Steven Spielberg\u2019s stirring film dramatizes the Washington Post\u2019s 1971 publishing of the Pentagon Papers, a collection of classified documents that chronicled America\u2019s 20-year involvement in Southeast Asia. While government analyst Daniel Ellsberg (a moving participant in \u201cHearts and Minds\u201d) could be considered the hero of this story, \u201cThe Post\u201d turns its focus to Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham (Meryl Streep) and the wartime role of the Fourth Estate.",

      "If you wanted to find the Vietnam War in American television shows, you mostly had to wait until it was long over",
      "The evening news brought the Vietnam War into American living rooms, but once the news was over, so was the war. Prime-time shows brought nary a mention of it as networks looked to bring uncontroversial content to the broadest possible audience. But the war simmered below the surface as subtext, and when enough years passed, television would finally take it on as a subject.",
      "\u201cGomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\u201d premiered on CBS six weeks after the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorized U.S. combat troops in Vietnam, and the daft comedy was among the chief images of the military in American homes through the peak of U.S. involvement in 1969. Naturally, the show about a country rube in the Marine Corps never directly mentioned the war. But most of the real-life Marines who marched in its introduction would soon be fighting in Vietnam. Star Jim Nabors later said watching that intro was difficult, knowing some of those men had died.",
      "It would take \u201cAll in the Family\u201d to bring the war into prime-time discourse. The Norman Lear-created CBS comedy owed its popularity to timely political bickering between cantankerous patriarch Archie Bunker (Carroll O\u2019Connor) and his liberal-minded son-in-law Michael \u201cMeathead\u201d Stivic (Rob Reiner). Vietnam was the sole subject of a landmark 1976 episode where a draft-dodging fugitive friend of Michael\u2019s comes to Christmas dinner, and an explosive argument ensues. \u201cWhen the hell are you going to admit that the war was wrong?!\u201d Michael shouts. A friend of Archie\u2019s whose son died in the war shocks him by taking his son-in-law\u2019s side.",
      "Set in the Korean War of the early 1950s, \u201cM(asterisk)A(asterisk)S(asterisk)H,\u201d the CBS dramedy about wisecracking U.S. Army doctors, was among the most popular shows in the country during the Vietnam War\u2019s final years. It was heavy with anti-military, anti-war sentiment, evoking the zeitgeist of a Vietnam-exhausted populace. \u201cWar isn\u2019t Hell,\u201d Hawkeye Pierce, played by Alan Alda, says in a typical line. \u201cThere are no innocent bystanders in Hell, but war is chock full of them.\u201d (The Robert Altman film the show stemmed from deliberately minimized references to Korea to maximize its unspoken commentary on Vietnam.)",
      "Television's first regular portrayal of Vietnam veterans came in the form of a cartoonish crew of daring mercenaries that reflected the era of Reagan and Rambo. NBC\u2019s \u201cThe A-Team,\u201d whose members included a mohawked-and-gold-chained Mr. T and a cigar-chomping George Peppard, were a \u201ccrack commando unit\u201d who were innocent fugitives from military justice and worked as mercenaries pulling off weekly capers. Explosions and jumping cars abounded. In a fourth-season episode, the team returns to Vietnam for a job. Peppard\u2019s Hannibal momentarily struggles with dark war memories before getting back to the lighthearted action.",
      "HBO aired and helped organize a 1987 charity concert dubbed \u201cWelcome Home\u201d that billed itself as the warm celebration Vietnam War veterans never got upon their return. Performers included James Brown, Linda Ronstadt and Stevie Wonder. The July Fourth concert was not a militaristic affair, and had a hate-the-war, love-the-troops vibe. Some of the most anti-war songs of the \u201960s were performed by artists like John Fogerty and Crosby, Stills & Nash. The event would be a harbinger of a wave of cultural nostalgia and reckoning as baby boomers began turning 40 and were in the mood to reflect.",
      "With \u201cTour of Duty,\u201d the Vietnam War finally came to prime time. The CBS series that premiered in 1987 showed actual combat and the young men who fought and died in it. It might have been called \u201cPlatoon: The Series,\u201d after the Vietnam film that had just won best picture at the Oscars. Surprisingly gory and gritty for a network show, it had all the hallmarks of the era\u2019s many Vietnam movies. But executives seeking lower costs and higher ratings \u2014 which never came \u2014 eventually moved production from Hawaii to California and introduced romances and soapy plotlines typical of TV dramas.",
      "And suddenly, there were two Vietnam series on TV. ABC\u2019s \u201cChina Beach\u201d was part-\u201cM(asterisk)A(asterisk)S(asterisk)H,\u201d part-\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d part-\u201cMad Men.\u201d Set in a wartime evacuation hospital \u2014 the title was the Americans\u2019 nickname for My Khe Beach in \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng \u2014 it focused on Army medics and civilians. It was festooned with \u201960s songs whose copyrights have kept the series off streaming services. Beloved by critics, \u201cChina Beach\u201d made a star and a best-actress Emmy winner of Dana Delany, but never found a mass audience. With its cancellation, network TV depictions of the war would disappear for years.",
      "\u201cThe Wonder Years\u201d was baby boomer nostalgia in its purest form. The ABC series, narrated by an adult Kevin Arnold (voiced by Daniel Stern, played as a child by Fred Savage), depicts his boyhood feelings and experiences with the backing of sentimental \u201960s songs. The specter of Vietnam dominates its first season, which sees Kevin\u2019s hero \u2014 the big brother of his neighbor and crush Winnie Cooper \u2014 die in the war. In a 2021 reboot, the story shifts to a Black family in Alabama, with narrator Dean Williams\u2019 brother a returning Vietnam vet who faces racism at home.",
      "The NBC miniseries \u201cThe \u201960s\u201d was a roundup of the decade\u2019s cliches that by then had been well-established in movies and TV. The 1999 two-night event was billed as \u201cthe movie event of a generation.\u201d Its subjects were three Chicago siblings who each go on very 1960s journeys. For Jerry O\u2019Connell\u2019s high-school quarterback character, that meant serving in Vietnam. He enlists in a gung-ho moment, but by the show\u2019s second night, he\u2019s back home with an Army jacket and long hair, drinking to bury his trauma. The show drew a big audience at a time when NBC was ratings king.",
      "The time-hopping, tear-jerking NBC family drama \u201cThis Is Us\u201d used the Vietnam War to delve into the psyche of Jack Pearson (Milo Ventimiglia), who refused to talk about his experience as a soldier with his wife and kids before his premature death. In dual plotlines that run through its third season, with the emotional themes and folk-acoustic soundtrack that are hallmarks of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d Jack is shown enlisting to try to protect his drafted younger brother. Decades later, his son Kevin (Justin Hartley) travels to Vietnam to find out what happened to his father and uncle.",
      "In a docuseries that ran over 10 nights on PBS, the Vietnam War got the same hallowed treatment Ken Burns brought nearly 30 years earlier to the Civil War. Burns and Lynn Novick's \u201cThe Vietnam War\" was not as soft or sentimental as his reputation might have suggested. It was a rare PBS show with a TV-MA rating, and its tone, with a modern soundtrack from composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, matched the messiness of the conflict. The show went to lengths to include a North Vietnamese perspective along with American and South Vietnamese vets and historians.",
      "It took until 2024 before a fictional television show would attempt a Vietnamese perspective of the war\u2019s end and its aftermath, though it brought mixed reactions from Vietnamese American viewers. HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Sympathizer\u201d was based on Viet Thanh Nguyen\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. The first two episodes of the black-comic limited series depict a harrowing flight during the fall of Saigon. Actors of Vietnamese descent played most of its main roles, including lead Hoa Xuande. But much of the attention given to it \u2014 and its only Emmy nomination \u2014 went to Robert Downey Jr. for his portrayal of four different white American men.",

      "Emphasizing the former studio boss's onetime influence in the movie industry, prosecutor Shannon Lucey said Weinstein used \u201cdream opportunities as weapons\u201d to prey on the three accusers in the case. He is charged with raping one and forcing oral sex on the other two.",
      "\u201cThe defendant wanted their bodies, and the more they resisted, the more forceful he got,\u201d Lucey said.",
      "The case is being retried because an appeals court threw out the landmark 2020 conviction.",

      "TV trucks lined the street, and reporters queued for hours to get a seat in the packed courtroom. His lawyers decried the \u201ccarnival-like atmosphere\u201d and fought unsuccessfully to get the trial moved from Manhattan.",
      "This time, over five days of jury selection, there was none of that.",
      "Those realities, coupled with the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling last year vacating his 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence \u2014 because the judge allowed testimony about allegations Weinstein was not charged with \u2014 are shaping everything from retrial legal strategy to the atmosphere in court.",
      "Weinstein, 73, is being retried on a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant, Miriam Haley, in 2006 and a third-degree rape charge for allegedly assaulting an aspiring actor, Jessica Mann, in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.",
      "Weinstein also faces a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcing oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006. Prosecutors said that the woman, who hasn\u2019t been named publicly, came forward days before his first trial but wasn\u2019t part of that case. They said they revisited her allegations when his conviction was thrown out.",
      "The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann have done.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone. His acquittals on the two most serious charges at his 2020 trial \u2014 predatory sexual assault and first-degree rape \u2014 still stand.",
      "Lindsay Goldbrum, a lawyer for the unnamed accuser, said Weinstein\u2019s retrial marks a \u201cpivotal moment in the fight for accountability in sex abuse cases\u201d and a \u201csignal to other survivors that the system is catching up \u2014 and that it\u2019s worth speaking out even when the odds seem insurmountable.\u201d",
      "This time around, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office is prosecuting Weinstein through its Special Victims Division, which specializes in such cases, after homicide veterans helmed the 2020 version. At the same time, Weinstein has added several lawyers to his defense team \u2014 including Jennifer Bonjean, who is involved in appealing his 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles. She helped Bill Cosby get his conviction overturned and defended R. Kelly in his sex crimes case.",
      "\u201cThis trial is not going to be all about #MeToo. It\u2019s going to be about the facts of what took place,\u201d Weinstein\u2019s lead attorney, Arthur Aidala, said recently. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a big deal. And that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d",
      "But there has already been some talk of #MeToo. A prosecutor asked prospective jurors whether they'd heard of the movement. Most said they had, but that it wouldn't affect them either way.",
      "Others went further.",
      "A woman opined that \u201cnot enough has been done\u201d as a result of #MeToo. A man explained that he had negative feelings about it because his high school classmates had been falsely accused of sexual assault.",
      "Another man said he viewed #MeToo like other social movements: \u201cIt\u2019s a pendulum. It swings way one way, then way the other way, and then it settles.\u201d",
      "None of them is on the jury.",

      "A woman pleaded not guilty Monday to fatally stabbing a Kansas City, Missouri, paramedic as she was being taken to a hospital in an ambulance.",
      "Shanetta Bossell, 39, was arrested Sunday after trying to drive off in the ambulance as others were tending to paramedic Graham Hoffman's chest wound, according to court records. She has been jailed on $1 million bond on charges of first-degree murder, armed criminal action, assault and resisting arrest. No attorney is listed for her in online court records.",
      "The 29-year-old paramedic had worked for the Kansas City Fire Department for three years and was remembered for his commitment to the job.",
      "\u201cOur community grieves his loss at such a young age with his entire life ahead of him,\u201d Clay County prosecuting attorney Zachary Thompson said at a news conference Sunday night.",
      "Police spotted Bossell walking along the shoulder of a highway early Sunday, her finger cut and bleeding, according to the probable cause affidavit. She had been freed on bond just two days earlier in a resisting arrest case that Thompson said involved an assault on a law enforcement officer.",
      "While en route to the hospital, the driver heard Hoffman frantically call for help, saying Bossell had a knife. The driver stopped and then rushed to the back. As he flung open the door, he heard Hoffman say, \"She stabbed me in the heart,\u201d the affidavit said.",
      "An officer who was following the ambulance then witnessed Bossell get into the vehicle's cab and attempt to put it into drive, according to the affidavit. The officer ultimately was able to wrestle her to the ground. But during the fray, she bit his arm, and he hit her in the head with his firearm to get her to let go, the affidavit said.",
      "A second ambulance arrived and the crew rushed Hoffman to the hospital, where he died later that afternoon.",
      "Thompson said any conviction on the murder charge could draw a life sentence without possibility of parole \u2014 or even a death sentence. But he did not elaborate on prosecution plans and said police continue to investigate what he described as a \u201chorrific\u201d crime.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet me be perfectly clear,\" he said. \"Our office will use all legal, moral, and ethical tools at our disposal to ensure justice for Graham, his family and the entire community.\u201d",

      "The Vietnam War ended 50 years ago but the disaster unleashed by American use of Agent Orange continues unabated",
      "DA NANG, Vietnam -- The Vietnam War ended on April 30, 1975, when the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon fell to Communist forces. But millions of people still face daily battles with its chemical legacy.",
      "Nguyen Thanh Hai, 34, is one of millions with disabilities linked to Agent Orange. Born with severe developmental challenges, it's a struggle for him to complete tasks others take for granted: buttoning the blue shirt he wears to a special school in Da Nang, practicing the alphabet, drawing shapes or forming simple sentences.",
      "Hai grew up in Da Nang, the site of a U.S. air base where departing troops left behind huge amounts of Agent Orange that have lingered for decades, leeching into food and water supplies in areas like Hai's village and affecting generations of residents.",
      "Across Vietnam, U.S. forces sprayed sprayed 72 million liters (19 million gallons) of defoliants during the war to strip the enemy's cover. More than half was Agent Orange, a blend of herbicides.",
      "Agent Orange was laced with dioxin, a type of chemical linked to cancer, birth defects and lasting environmental damage. Today, 3 million people, including many children, still suffer serious health issues associated with exposure to it.",
      "Vietnam has spent decades cleaning up the toxic legacy of the war, in part funded by belated U.S. assistance, but the work is far from complete. Now, millions in Vietnam are worried that the U.S. may abandon Agent Orange cleanup as President Donald Trump slashes foreign aid.",
      "When the war ended, the U.S. turned its back on Vietnam, eager to turn the page on a painful chapter in its history.",
      "But Vietnam was left with dozens of dioxin hotspots spread across 58 of its 63 provinces.",
      "Vietnam says the health impacts last generations, threatening the children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren of people exposed to the chemicals with health complications ranging from cancer to birth defects that affects the spine and nervous system.",
      "But the science about the human health impact \u2014 both to those exposed to Agent Orange and the generations that follow \u2014 remains unsettled. This is partly because when the two countries finally started working together in 2006, they focused on finding dioxin in the environment and clearing it instead of studying the still-contentious topic of its impact on human health, said Charles Bailey, co-author of the book \u201cFrom Enemies to Partners: Vietnam, the U.S. and Agent Orange.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe science of causality is still incomplete,\u201d said Bailey.",
      "Vietnam identifies Agent Orange victims by checking family history, where they lived, and a list of health problems linked to the poison. And Hai's disabilities were very likely linked to the spraying of the defoliant, added Bailey.",
      "The 34-year-old dreams of becoming a soldier like his grandfather, was unable to leave home for years, waiting alone while his family went out to work. It was only five years ago that he began attending a special school. \u201cI am happy here because I have many friends,\u201d he said. Other students at the school hope to become tailors or makers of incense sticks.",
      "The contamination also denuded Vietnam\u2019s natural defenses. Nearly half of its mangrove trees, which shield shores from strong storms, were destroyed. Much of its tropical forest was irrevocably damaged, while the herbicide also leached the soil of nutrients in some of Vietnam\u2019s most climate-vulnerable areas.",
      "In the decades after the war ended, the recovering country fenced off heavily contaminated sites like Da Nang airport and began providing support to impacted families.",
      "But the U.S. largely ignored growing evidence of health impacts \u2014 including on its own veterans \u2014 until the mid-2000s, when it and began funding cleanup in Vietnam. In 1991, the U.S. recognized that certain diseases could be related to exposure to Agent Orange and made veterans who had them eligible for benefits.",
      "Since 1991, it has spent over $155 million to aid people with disabilities in areas affected by Agent Orange or littered by unexploded bombs, according to the U.S. State Department. The two countries have also cooperated to recover war dead, with the U.S. aiding Vietnam\u2019s search for its own missing.",
      "Cleaning up Agent Orange is expensive and often dangerous. Heavily polluted soil needs to be unearthed and heated in large ovens to very high temperatures, while less contaminated soil can be buried in secure landfills.",
      "Despite years of work, large sites still need to cleared. In Da Nang, where an air base was contaminated during storage and transportation of Agent Orange, the U.S. completed a $110 million cleanup in 2018 but an area the size of 10 soccer fields still remains heavily contaminated.",
      "Cooperation on war legacy issues also laid a foundation for growing U.S.-Vietnam ties, culminating in 2023 when Vietnam elevated the U.S. to its highest diplomatic status of comprehensive strategic partner.",
      "\u201cThe United States considers Vietnam a key partner in advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific,\u201d former U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in Vietnam in 2023.",
      "But Donald Trump\u2019s cuts to USAID stalled key projects in Vietnam, and while many have resumed, doubts remain about U.S. reliability.",
      "Vietnam now has to negotiate a new reality where the U.S. president says the country can no longer afford to help other countries.",
      "The country can\u2019t handle the toxic chemicals that still persist without help, said Nguyen Van An, the chairman of Association for Victims of Agent Orange in Danang. \u201cWe always believe that the U.S. government and the manufacturers of this toxic chemical must have the responsibility to support the victims,\u201d he said.",
      "He said he hoped that any stoppages to ongoing projects due to shifting politics in Washington would be temporary.",
      "Insufficient data means that experts can't definitely say when the risk to human health will end. But the more urgent problem is if that cleanup efforts are interrupted, the now-exposed contaminated soil could get into waterways and harm more people.",
      "A 10-year project to clear the some 500,000 cubic meters (650,000 cubic yards) of dioxin-contaminated soil \u2014 enough to fill 40,000 trucks \u2014 at Bien Hoa airbase was launched in 2020. It stopped for a week in March and then restarted.",
      "But Bailey, who worked on issues related to the Agent Orange in Vietnam for years, said future USAID funding for the cleanup and a $30 million program for people with disabilities was uncertain.",
      "With federal cuts to USAID, most staffers in Vietnam are expected to be gone by later this year, leaving nobody to administer funding for remediation programs, even if it is not cut itself.",
      "\u201cThis basically leaves a very large mountain of contaminated soil. Only 30% of which has been dealt with and that is less contaminated,\u201d said Bailey.",
      "He added that less than half of the soil at Bien Hoa had been treated and much of the remaining soil was heavily contaminated and needed to be treated in an as-yet unbuilt incinerator.",
      "Tim Rieser, who was retired Sen. Patrick Leahy\u2019s foreign policy aide when the Vermont Democrat secured the original funding for Vietnam War remediation projects and is now a senior advisor to Sen. Peter Welch, said Congress still supports the programs but it would be hard for them to continue without staff.",
      "\"For more than 30 years, the U.S. and Vietnam have worked together to rebuild relations by dealing with the worst legacies of the war, like Agent Orange,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the Trump administration is mindlessly shutting everything down, with no concern for the impact of their actions on relations with an important partner in the Indo-Pacific.\u201d",
      "The U.S. embassy in Hanoi didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Chuck Searcy, an American Vietnam War veteran who has worked on humanitarian programs in the country since 1995, said he worries that trust built over years could erode very rapidly. He pointed out that those who benefit from U.S. funded projects to address war legacies are \u201cinnocent victims.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been victimized twice, once by the war and the consequences that they\u2019ve suffered. And now by having the rug pulled out from under them,\u201d he said.",

      "The Trump administration is expected to soon say whether it intends to stand by strict drinking water standards for forever chemicals set last year",
      "In pain so bad he couldn\u2019t stand, Chris Meek was rushed to the hospital with a life-threatening ruptured gallbladder. When he emerged from surgery, he learned he had kidney cancer that thankfully hadn\u2019t yet spread.",
      "Meek, a social studies teacher in Wilmington, North Carolina, was 47 at the time. But he remained confused for years about why, as someone seemingly not at risk, he had gotten cancer until Emily Donovan, a parent of students at his school, gave a guest talk about high levels of harmful forever chemicals known as PFAS in North Carolina's environment. When Donovan mentioned kidney cancer, the possible cause of Meek's diagnosis finally clicked.",
      "Until then, Meek said, he \u201chad no idea what PFAS was.\u201d",
      "Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight.",
      "In a decision with consequences for tens of millions of Americans, the Trump administration is expected to soon say whether it intends to stand by those strict standards and defend the limits against a water utility industry challenge in federal court.",
      "In North Carolina, runoff from a Chemours plant contaminated the Cape Fear River, creating a crisis for cities like Wilmington that use it for drinking water. Amid public outcry, Wilmington effectively eliminated it from tap water.",
      "Other U.S. communities \u2014 often near military bases or industrial sites \u2014 did the same when test results were frightening and public pressure, local leadership or state law forced PFAS-laden wells offline or prompted installation of expensive filtering systems, according to Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.",
      "The EPA said the PFAS found in North Carolina, often called GenX chemicals, can be toxic to the kidney. While other types of PFAS may raise kidney cancer risk, little research has focused on the link between kidney cancer and GenX, according to Sue Fenton, director of the Center for Human Health and the Environment at North Carolina State University. Chemours said evidence doesn't support arguments that GenX at low levels is a health threat. The company has sharply reduced PFAS discharges.",
      "So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the recently set EPA limits, but most aren't above by much. Forcing this group to reduce PFAS more than doubles the rule\u2019s health benefits but roughly triples its costs, the EPA has said.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s rule set standards for two common types of PFAS at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. Standards for several other PFAS chemicals were set, too, and utilities must meet those levels by 2029.",
      "Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -\u2013 among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has championed fossil fuels and the rollback of major clean air and water rules. His history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals in drinking water.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an issue that touches people in a very tangible way across the political spectrum, including in Lee Zeldin\u2019s former district,\" said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.",
      "Zeldin has offered clues about what the EPA could do. The agency estimated the rule would cost about $1.5 billion annually and Zeldin said recently that communities struggling to afford a fix for PFAS that are just above the standard might be handled differently than wealthy places with lots of it.",
      "\u201cWhat we are going to have to be is extremely thoughtful in figuring this out,\u201d he said.",
      "On Monday, the EPA said it will establish an agency lead for PFAS, develop wastewater limits for PFAS manufacturers and investigate sources that pose an immediate danger to drinking water, among other actions.",
      "Soon, the EPA must tell a federal appeals court in Washington whether the rule should stand or be rewritten, although weakening it could be complicated because the Safe Drinking Water Act prevents new rules from being looser than previous ones. The agency could, however, encourage exemptions and deadline extensions, according to Erik Olson, an attorney with the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council supporting the current standards in the court case.",
      "Consider Avondale, Arizona, outside of Phoenix, which produces PFAS results modestly above the limits. Officials have done detailed testing and are planning to enhance water treatment. All told, lowering PFAS may cost Avondale more than $120 million, according to Kirk Beaty, the city\u2019s public utility director.",
      "That\u2019s money a city like Avondale \u201cjust doesn\u2019t have sitting in a back room somewhere,\" Beaty said, adding he\u2019ll defer to federal experts to dictate what\u2019s acceptable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping we\u2019re a little further ahead of everybody else. If the regulation changes, well you know, we may let off the gas a little bit, we may not,\u201d he said, adding that it is hard to justify spending extra money to do more than what\u2019s required when the cost falls on residents.",
      "If the government decides higher amounts of PFAS are acceptable, that could confuse people, especially in areas where the public is already concerned.",
      "\u201cIf we enter into a gray area over what\u2019s healthy and what\u2019s not healthy, then utilities are at risk of being caught up in a debate for which they have no real responsibility nor expertise to decide on,\u201d said Karine Roug\u00e9, CEO for municipal water at Veolia North America, a water operations company.",
      "The American Water Works Association, an industry group, filed the court challenge to the new rule. It agrees that certain PFAS should be regulated but argues the EPA\u2019s standards go too far, underestimate costs and are \u201cneither feasible nor cost-effective.\u201d There are serious consequences for residents' water bills, it says.",
      "The burden of complying will fall heavily on small utilities that can least afford it. Many water providers already struggle to maintain their existing infrastructure, some experts say. On top of everything else, they face new requirements to replace lead pipes. The AWWA wants the EPA to extend the PFAS and lead deadlines by two years.",
      "There is money available to help. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS and utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters that help as well.",
      "Meek, who successfully recovered after surgery from cancer and is now 59, is planning to sue over his illness. He once didn\u2019t second-guess using tap water. Now he reaches for bottled water.",
      "Donovan, who introduced Meek to PFAS and helped start Clean Cape Fear, says if the government\u2019s standards are weakened, it\u2019ll relieve pressure on utilities to effectively treat the water.",
      "Previously, \u201cour local utilities could tell us publicly that the water met or exceeded all state and federal guidelines because there weren\u2019t any,\u201d she said.",

      "Colombia's capital has South America\u2019s only supervised room for drug use, aimed at reducing harm and preventing overdoses and now a topic of the International Conference on Harm Reduction, which has been taking place since Sunday in Bogota",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- The left arm of Christian Camilo Amaya is tattooed with a skull pierced by a syringe, which he says represents the use of cocaine and heroin. He frequently shot up on streets of Bogota, but he has recently switched to South America's only supervised room for drug use, aimed at reducing harm and preventing overdoses.",
      "Non-profit organization Accion Tecnica Social runs the supervised room named Cambie (or Change in English) in Colombia's capital. Since it opened in June 2023, 14 users had their overdoses treated with injections of naloxone, a drug that reverses overdoses. The last such case was a year ago.",
      "Amaya often carries a black plastic bag with more than a dozen used syringes, which he puts in a red container for biological waste, as protocols for using the room dictate. He denies being addicted to heroin, but argues the supervised room gives him syringes and training on hygienic injections and overdose prevention.",
      "\u201cI know what substances do to me, so I know I shouldn\u2019t be a frequent user for that very reason, to avoid becoming addicted,\u201d Amaya told The Associated Press in the unmarked drug use room in one of the city\u2019s impoverished neighborhoods.",
      "The initiative is one of the topics of the International Conference on Harm Reduction, which started Sunday in Bogota. It is the first time the conference has been held in Latin America in the past three decades, as the leftist administration of President Gustavo Petro pushes for a revision in the international drug control system of the United Nations.",
      "The supervised consumption room currently has 87 registered users, 26% of whom are Venezuelan migrants, who come to inject themselves or receive syringes, food, guidance on lower-risk injection techniques, or overdose management.",
      "Of the users who come to the room, 91% use heroin, 7% inject cocaine, and less than 2% use speedballs, a mixture of cocaine and heroin. Official data on heroin use in Colombia is scarce.",
      "The project was born in 2022 when organizers started contacting users directly to identify their needs. It received technical advice from other countries, especially Mexico.",
      "For David Moreno, who works at Cambie, the most difficult part of reversing an overdose is not injecting the naloxone but avoiding a follow-up overdose.",
      "\u201cOnce I had a user who would get very violent when she came back from an overdose. She would start hurting herself, then she would take off my jacket and tie it, and I\u2019d have to restrain her,\u201d said Moreno.",
      "\u201cWhen it happens, I am calm. But when the user leaves... Wow, my adrenaline rushes.\u201d",
      "Sam Rivera, the executive-director of OnPoint, a nonprofit organization in New York City that operates supervised injection centers, toured the small, nearly 65-foot room with three patient cubicles before AP's visit.",
      "\u201cI look at it as a mini version of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Rivera said. He argues the initiative is also good for public security.",
      "\u201cI always tell people to come visit an overdose prevention center. When you hear about it, it sounds dangerous or it sounds bad because it sounds like you\u2019re enabling people to use,\" he added. \u201cThese are people who are going to use. So instead of using outside, in danger, leaving these supplies in the street, everything happens inside, everything stays inside.\u201d",

      "Tampow is part of the team at Sensient Technologies Corp., one of the world\u2019s largest dyemakers, that is rushing to help the salad dressing manufacturer \u2014 along with thousands of other American businesses \u2014 meet demands to overhaul colors used to brighten products from cereals to sports drinks.",
      "\u201cMost of our customers have decided that this is finally the time when they\u2019re going to make that switch to a natural color,\u201d said Dave Gebhardt, Sensient\u2019s senior technical director. He joined a recent tour of the Sensient Colors factory in a north St. Louis neighborhood.",
      "Last week, U.S. health officials announced plans to persuade food companies to voluntarily eliminate petroleum-based artificial dyes by the end of 2026.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called them \u201cpoisonous compounds\u201d that endanger children\u2019s health and development, citing limited evidence of potential health risks.",
      "The federal push follows a flurry of state laws and a January decision to ban the artificial dye known as Red 3 \u2014 found in cakes, candies and some medications \u2014 because of cancer risks in lab animals. Social media influencers and ordinary consumers have ramped up calls for artificial colors to be removed from foods.",
      "The FDA allows about three dozen color additives, including eight remaining synthetic dyes. But making the change from the petroleum-based dyes to colors derived from vegetables, fruits, flowers and even insects won\u2019t be easy, fast or cheap, said Monica Giusti, an Ohio State University food color expert.",
      "\u201cStudy after study has shown that if all companies were to remove synthetic colors from their formulations, the supply of the natural alternatives would not be enough,\u201d Giusti said. \u201cWe are not really ready.\u201d",
      "It can take six months to a year to convert a single product from a synthetic dye to a natural one. And it could require three to four years to build up the supply of botanical products necessary for an industrywide shift, Sensient officials said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s 150 million pounds of beet juice sitting around waiting on the off chance the whole market may convert,\u201d said Paul Manning, the company's chief executive. \u201cTens of millions of pounds of these products need to be grown, pulled out of the ground, extracted.\u201d",
      "To make natural dyes, Sensient works with farmers and producers around the world to harvest the raw materials, which typically arrive at the plant as bulk concentrates. They\u2019re processed and blended into liquids, granules or powders and then sent to food companies to be added to final products.",
      "Natural dyes are harder to make and use than artificial colors. They are less consistent in color, less stable and subject to changes related to acidity, heat and light, Manning said. Blue is especially difficult. There aren't many natural sources of the color and those that exist can be hard to maintain during processing.",
      "Also, a natural color costs about 10 times more to make than the synthetic version, Manning estimated.",
      "\u201cHow do you get that same vividness, that same performance, that same level of safety in that product as you would in a synthetic product?\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complexity associated with that.\u201d",
      "Companies have long used the Red 3 synthetic dye to create what Sensient officials describe as \u201cthe Barbie pink.\u201d",
      "To create that color with a natural source might require the use of cochineal, an insect about the size of a peppercorn.",
      "The female insects release a vibrant red pigment, carminic acid, in their bodies and eggs. The bugs live only on prickly pear cactuses in Peru and elsewhere. About 70,000 cochineal insects are needed to produce 1 kilogram, about 2.2 pounds, of dye.",
      "\u201cIt's interesting how the most exotic colors are found in the most exotic places,\u201d said Norb Norbrega, who travels the world scouting new hues for Sensient.",
      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. About 1 in 5 food products in the U.S. contains added colors, whether natural or synthetic, Manning estimated. Many contain multiple colors.",
      "FDA requires a sample of each batch of synthetic colors to be submitted for testing and certification. Color additives derived from plant, animal or mineral sources are exempt, but have been evaluated by the agency.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that the approved dyes are safe when used according to regulations and that \u201cmost children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",
      "But critics note that added colors are a key component of ultraprocessed foods, which account for more than 70% of the U.S. diet and have been associated with a host of chronic health problems, including heart disease, diabetes and obesity.",
      "\u201cI am all for getting artificial food dyes out of the food supply,\u201d said Marion Nestle, a food policy expert. \u201cThey are strictly cosmetic, have no health or safety purpose, are markers of ultraprocessed foods and may be harmful to some children.\u201d",
      "Color is powerful driver of consumer behavior and changes can backfire, Giusti noted. In 2016, food giant General Mills removed artificial dyes from Trix cereal after requests from consumers, switching to natural sources including turmeric, strawberries and radishes.",
      "But the cereal lost its neon colors, resulting in more muted hues \u2014 and a consumer backlash. Trix fans said they missed the bright colors and familiar taste of the cereal. In 2017, the company switched back.",
      "\u201cWhen it\u2019s a product you already love, that you\u2019re used to consuming, and it changes slightly, then it may not really be the same experience,\u201d Giusti said. \u201cAnnouncing a regulatory change is one step, but then the implementation is another thing.\u201d",
      "Kennedy, the health secretary, said U.S. officials have an \u201cunderstanding\u201d with food companies to phase out artificial colors. Industry officials told The Associated Press that there is no formal agreement.",
      "However, several companies have said they plan to accelerate a shift to natural colors in some of their products.",
      "PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said most of its products are already free of artificial colors, and that its Lays and Tostitos brands will phase them out by the end of this year. He said the company plans to phase out artificial colors \u2014 or at least offer consumers a natural alternative \u2014 over the next few years.",
      "Representatives for General Mills said they\u2019re \u201ccommitted to continuing the conversation\u201d with the administration. WK Kellogg officials said they are reformulating cereals used in the nation\u2019s school lunch programs to eliminate the artificial dyes and will halt any new products containing them starting next January.",
      "Sensient officials wouldn\u2019t confirm which companies are seeking help making the switch, but they said they\u2019re ready for the surge.",
      "\u201cNow that there\u2019s a date, there\u2019s the timeline,\u201d Manning said. \u201cIt certainly requires action.\u201d",

      "With the world awash in stress and anxiety, nature can be the perfect spring antidote",
      "HALLE, Belgium -- Gilles Gui was looking for the magical purple bluebells that raise their heads each spring under the budding beech leaves of the Hallerbos forest, an annual explosion of color that draws crowds from around the world.",
      "And in these times full of stress and anxiety about wars, economic threats and other tensions, he found something else too: a sense of tranquility.",
      "\u201cI notice that there\u2019s a lot of silence in my head when I\u2019m done,\u201d Gui said. \u201cYeah, it helps me keep some peace in my mind, really just take my mind away from everything that\u2019s going on.\u201d",
      "Spending time in nature, experts have long said, can be a balm in troubled times.",
      "\u201cFrom a stroll through a city park to a day spent hiking in the wilderness, exposure to nature has been linked to a host of benefits, including improved attention, lower stress, better mood, reduced risk of psychiatric disorders, and even upticks in empathy and cooperation,\u201d a 2020 article of the American Psychological Association said.",
      "\u201cThese are extraordinary times,\u201d said Ignace Glorieux, a sociology professor at Brussels University, adding that the under-30 generation in particular is under pressure.",
      "\u201cThis is also the generation maybe that suffered most from the COVID crisis,\u201d Glorieux said. \u201cAnd now they come into a situation where there\u2019s a lot of international uncertainty. So especially this group, maybe more than (the older) generation, is suffering from that and feels very uncertain about their future.\u201d",
      "Gui, 26, knows what Glorieux is talking about. \u201cI do know of people my age who are worried and also with financial situations going on, who try to keep level heads, but it\u2019s very hard for them,\u201d he said.",
      "During the pandemic, the bluebell woods were closed off for fear that throngs of people would make it a hive of transmission instead of a haven of peace. Restrictions kept some parks under seal and mandated masks in some others.",
      "\u201cIt was a difficult period for everyone,\u201d said Mark Demesmaeker, a former member of the European Parliament, gardening enthusiast and city councilor in Halle, where he has walked the woods for decades. Now, at least, nature is there to welcome those with anxious minds.",
      "\u201cThese bluebells \u2014 but in other times of year as well, walking here, the forest valleys, the wildlife, the forest streams \u2014 you know, they work into your mind all year round. And it\u2019s really a big green hug that you get here,\u201d Demesmaeker said.",
      "That hug from nature is just about everywhere right now. Japan is awash in a sea of cherry blossoms, which mesmerize people around the world. Bluebell season also coincides with the prime tulip season in the Netherlands. The renowned Keukenhof garden there has become a playground for influencers and those seeking that ultimate selfie.",
      "The Keukenhof and the Dutch tourism board suggest good spots to \u201cmake your image come alive.\u201d",
      "To Glorieux, that's where 21st-century humans push it too far.",
      "\u201cWe have to be busy all the time, even in our leisure time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to perform.\"",
      "Instead, he advised, \u201cFocus! If you go out walking, focus on walking. If you go out jogging, focus only on jogging.\u201d",
      "Such advice was not wasted on Philippe Thiry, 64, a southern Belgian recently retired and ready to embrace the rest of his life. He had no phone as he set off in the sunshine to look for bluebells.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to use it here because I\u2019m here just to relax,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, just to see the flowers and to see, to listen to the birds.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Novavax's closely watched COVID-19 vaccine is on track for full approval after additional discussions with the Food and Drug Administration, the company said Wednesday.",
      "The news sent company shares soaring more than 21% in morning trading and appeared to resolve concerns that Trump administration officials might be holding up a decision on the shot.",
      "Novavax makes the nation\u2019s only traditional protein-based COVID-19 vaccine. It is still being sold under emergency use authorization \u2014 unlike mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna that have earned full FDA approval for certain age groups.",
      "The FDA recently asked Novavax to develop a plan for collecting additional clinical data from those who have gotten the shot, the company said in a statement. It said it is \u201cengaging with the FDA expeditiously\u201d in hopes of receiving approval \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d",
      "At FDA, full vaccine approval is the gold standard. The agency was on track to sign off on Novavax\u2019s license by its April 1 target date, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters.",
      "But FDA\u2019s acting commissioner, Dr. Sara Brenner, directed the agency\u2019s lead official overseeing the vaccine to pause the decision, according to one of the people.

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Reeling from drug overdose deaths and scenes of people smoking fentanyl on sidewalks, San Francisco moved closer Thursday to adopting a \u201crecovery first\u201d drug policy that sets abstinence from illicit drugs as its primary goal, a proposal that has prompted heated debate in the city that pioneered harm reduction.",
      "Opponents of Supervisor Matt Dorsey's proposal say its emphasis on stopping drug use alienates those who are not ready to quit, while proponents say the city has been far too permissive and making drug use safer does not help break the cycle of addiction.",
      "Dorsey, himself recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, amended the proposal in his public safety committee to clarify that distributing safer-use paraphernalia and linking people to social services regardless of whether they are using remain critical to the city's response.",
      "But more than an hour of public comment with cheers and boos from both sides underscored just how touchy the issue remains.",
      "\u201cNo one dies from harm reduction,\u201d Patt Denning said. \u201cPeople die from conventional abstinence-based treatments because they\u2019re either left out or kicked out if they don\u2019t comply with abstinence.\u201d",

      "Mayor Daniel Lurie, who took office in January, has vowed to solve the city's fentanyl crisis. Last year more than 600 people died from accidental overdoses.",
      "He ordered city-funded nonprofits to offer treatment or counseling options before giving out certain paraphernalia such as foil and pipes, and they will no longer be allowed to distribute those items in parks and on sidewalks.",

      "It also defines recovery as \u201cthe process by which an individual suffering from substance use disorder strives to make positive changes that become part of a voluntarily adopted healthy lifestyle.\u201d",
      "Dorsey said aspiring to live a healthy life free from illicit drug use should not be a controversial goal, and abstention can mean receiving methadone as part of a medication assisted treatment program. San Francisco offers an array of services to help people addicted to drugs, but many residents only see the free foil and pipes, he said.",
      "\u201cWe're losing the battle on harm reduction when people think that\u2019s all we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said after the hearing.",
      "The San Francisco Marin Medical Society, which represents more than 3,500 physicians, proposed the amendments.",

      "The 54-year-old makes the journey from a temporary shelter west of Gaza City to Shifa Hospital in the city\u2019s north. There, he receives dialysis for the kidney failure he was diagnosed with nearly 15 years ago. But the treatment, limited by the war's destruction and lack of supplies, is not enough to remove all the waste products from his blood.",
      "\u201cIt just brings you back from death,\u201d the father of six said.",
      "Many others like him have not made it. They are some of Gaza\u2019s quieter deaths from the war, with no explosion, no debris. But the toll is striking: Over 400 patients, representing around 40% of all dialysis cases in the territory, have died during the 18-month conflict because of lack of proper treatment, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "That includes 11 patients who have died since the beginning of March, when Israel sealed the territory's 2 million Palestinians off from all imports, including food, medical supplies and fuel. Israeli officials say the aim is to pressure Hamas to release more hostages after Israel ended their ceasefire.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of coordinating aid, declined to comment on the current blockade. It has said in the past that all medical aid is approved for entry when the crossings are open, and that around 45,400 tons of medical equipment have entered Gaza since the start of the war.",
      "Attiya said he needs at least three dialysis sessions every week, at least four hours each time. Now, his two sessions last two or three hours at most.",
      "Israel\u2019s blockade, and its numerous evacuation orders across much of the territory, have challenged his ability to reach regular care.",
      "He has been displaced at least six times since fleeing his home near the northern town of Beit Hanoun in the first weeks of the war. He first stayed in Rafah in the south, then the central city of Deir al-Balah. When the latest ceasefire took effect in January, he moved again to another school in western Gaza City.",
      "Until recently, Attiya walked to the hospital for dialysis. But he says the limited treatment, and soaring prices for the mineral water he should be drinking, have left him in a wheelchair.",
      "His family wheels him through a Gaza that many find difficult to recognize. Much of the territory has been destroyed.",
      "\u201cThere is no transportation. Streets are damaged,\u201d Attiya said. \u201cLife is difficult and expensive.\u201d",
      "He said he now has hallucinations because of the high levels of toxins in his blood.",
      "\u201cThe occupation does not care about the suffering or the sick,\u201d he said, referring to Israel and its soldiers.",
      "Six of the seven dialysis centers in Gaza have been destroyed during the war, the World Health Organization said earlier this year, citing the territory\u2019s Health Ministry. The territory had 182 dialysis machines before the war and now has 102. Twenty-seven of them are in northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people rushed home during the two-month ceasefire.",
      "\u201cThese equipment shortages are exacerbated by zero stock levels of kidney medications,\u201d the WHO said.",
      "Israel has raided hospitals on several occasions during the war, accusing Hamas of using them for military purposes. Hospital staff deny the allegations and say the raids have gutted the territory's health care system as it struggles to cope with mass casualties from the war.",
      "The Health Ministry says over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel's offensive, without saying how many were civilians or combatants. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war.",
      "At Shifa Hospital, the head of the nephrology and dialysis department, Dr. Ghazi al-Yazigi, said at least 417 patients with kidney failure have died in Gaza during the war because of lack of proper treatment.",
      "That\u2019s from among the 1,100 patients when the war began.",
      "Like Attiya, hundreds of dialysis patients across Gaza are now forced to settle for fewer and shorter sessions each week.",
      "\u201cThis leads to complications such as increased levels of toxins and fluid accumulation \u2026 which could lead to death,\u201d al-Yazigi said.",
      "Mohamed Kamel of Gaza City is a new dialysis patient at the hospital after being diagnosed with kidney failure during the war and beginning treatment this year.",
      "These days, \u201cI feel no improvement after each session,\u201d he said during one of his weekly visits.",
      "The father of six children said he no longer has access to filtered water to drink, and even basic running water is scarce. Israel last month cut off the electricity supply to Gaza, affecting a desalination plant producing drinking water for part of the arid territory.",
      "Kamel said he has missed many dialysis sessions. Last year, while sheltering in central Gaza, he missed one because of an Israeli bombing in the area. His condition deteriorated, and the next day he was taken by ambulance to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital.",

      "The Agriculture Department says it is withdrawing a plan to limit salmonella bacteria in poultry products",
      "The Agriculture Department will not require poultry companies to limit salmonella bacteria in their products, halting a Biden Administration effort to prevent food poisoning from contaminated meat.",
      "The department on Thursday said it was withdrawing a rule proposed in August after three years of development. Officials with the USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service cited feedback from more than 7,000 public comments and said they would \u201cevaluate whether it should update\u201d current salmonella regulations.",
      "The rule would have required poultry companies to keep levels of salmonella bacteria under a certain threshold and test for the presence of six strains most associated with illness, including three found in turkey and three in chicken. If the levels exceeded the standard or any of those strains were found, the poultry couldn\u2019t be sold and would be subject to recall, the proposal had said.",
      "The plan aimed to reduce an estimated 125,000 salmonella infections from chicken and 43,000 from turkey each year, according to USDA. Overall, salmonella causes 1.35 million infections a year, most through food, and about 420 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The withdrawal drew praise from the National Chicken Council, an industry trade group, which said the proposed rule was legally unsound, misinterpreted science, would have increased costs and create more food waste, all \u201cwith no meaningful impact on public health.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to further reducing salmonella and fully support food safety regulations and policies that are based on sound science,\u201d said Ashley Peterson, the group's senior vice president of science and regulatory affairs.",
      "But the move drew swift criticism from food safety advocates, including Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who helped draft the plan.",
      "The withdrawal \"sends the clear message that the Make America Healthy Again initiative does not care about the thousands of people who get sick from preventable foodborne salmonella infections linked to poultry,\" Eskin said in a statement.",
      "The proposed rule had been regarded as a food safety victory similar to a 1994 decision to ban certain strains of dangerous E. coli bacteria from ground beef after deadly outbreaks, said Sarah Sorscher, of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: Shipping more salmonella to restaurants and grocery stores is certain to make Americans sicker,\u201d Sorscher said.",
      "Earlier this month, the USDA said it would delay by six months the enforcement of a final rule regulating salmonella levels in certain breaded and stuffed raw chicken products. Enforcement, which was set for May 1, now begins Nov. 3.",
      "That covers foods such as frozen chicken cordon bleu and chicken Kiev dishes that appear to be fully cooked but are only heat-treated to set the batter or coating. Such products have been linked to at least 14 salmonella outbreaks and at least 200 illnesses since 1998, according to the CDC.",

      "The evidence is anecdotal, but psychologists and flight attendants say they are seeing and hearing increased worries about flying",
      "NEW YORK -- Adelynn Campbell\u2019s last plane trip ended with a panic attack that she got through largely with the help of a kind flight attendant.",
      "That was last year \u2014 before 67 people died in January when an American Airlines jet collided with a helicopter over Washington, D.C., in the deadliest U.S. air disaster in almost a quarter century.",
      "Now, Campbell is even more hesitant to book a flight.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely spiked my concern about getting on a plane and it\u2019s making the whole situation a little more stressful than it used to be,\u201d said Campbell, 30, who manages a coffee shop in San Diego.",
      "Being at least a little nervous about flying is understandable. As Mel Brooks once said: \u201cIf God wanted us to fly, He would have given us tickets.\u201d But for some people it causes deep anxiety that could require professional help.",
      "Here's a look at air travel anxiety and ways to cope with it.",
      "The evidence is anecdotal, but psychologists and flight attendants say they\u2019ve seen and heard increased worries \u2014 and not only in people who already had anxieties about flying.",
      "\u201cEven people who didn\u2019t have a fear of flying are talking about it, given recent events,\u201d said Jennifer Dragonette, a California-based psychologist who treats people with air travel anxieties.",
      "U.S. air travel was down in March and early April compared with last year, according to TSA statistics. Airlines have attributed the decline to economic uncertainty, a decline in government and corporate travel and \u2014 yes \u2014 concern about recent aviation incidents.",
      "FAA officials recently acknowledged they weren\u2019t doing enough to ensure air safety. Recent polling by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that fewer Americans report feeling safe about flying this year.",
      "Flight attendants who work planes out of the Washington, D.C., airport were particularly rattled by the January collision, said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants union. Some asked for time off to process their emotions, and at least one flight attendant left the job, she said.",
      "Fear of flying \u2014 sometimes called aerophobia \u2014 goes beyond just being nervous about a flight. It is an intense form of anxiety that centers on certain aspects of air travel. Many aerophobes get most rattled during take-off and landing, or when they think about being locked in a plane.",
      "Some research has suggested it affects about 25 million U.S. adults. Psychologists say it often surfaces in adulthood, developing in people who didn\u2019t mind flying as kids but grew more rattled as they aged.",
      "In many cases, it starts when people are in their 20s or 30s, at a time they are experiencing big life changes and new responsibilities \u2014 like getting married or becoming a parent \u2014 and they start to think that \u201ceverything counts,\u201d said David Carbonell, a Chicago-based psychologist who authored a workbook to help people cope with flying fears.",
      "A bad flight with heavy turbulence or some other problem may trigger an anxiety that persists, he said.",
      "Campbell, who has other forms of anxiety, developed a fear of flying a few years ago. She is transgender, and said travel can be stressful because of concerns about how she\u2019ll be treated by airport security or in other interactions.",
      "Aerophobia can be complicated, Carbonell said. For many people, it\u2019s not so much a fear of crashing as it is claustrophobic feelings of being in an enclosed cabin and not having control.",
      "Campbell said that\u2019s what she experiences: \u201cfeeling trapped and unable to breathe.\u201d",
      "Nelson said flight attendants regularly deal with suffering passengers: \u201cWe\u2019ve had people have panic attacks, and we\u2019ve had to give them oxygen. It can be quite intense.\u201d",
      "Statistics have long shown that airliners are probably the safest way to travel. According to the National Safety Council, the odds of dying in an airplane crash are too low to be calculated, based on 2023 statistics \u2014 making them far, far lower than of being killed in a motor vehicle crash or, for that matter, walking on a sidewalk or crossing a street.",
      "But experts say you can\u2019t really reason your way out of an anxiety disorder.",
      "Carbonell spends little time on statistics, telling patients: \u201cI know you already looked at them all, and they\u2019re not helping you.\u201d",
      "For people with milder levels of aerophobia, deep breathing often works. Longer exhales help the body relax, said Dragonette, who counseled Campbell for aerophobia and other anxiety disorders at a Newport Healthcare residential facility in Temecula, California.",
      "People suffering more extreme cases can be helped with exposure therapy. It can start by simply getting patients to become comfortable looking at photos of planes, watching videos of planes flying safely, or putting on a virtual reality headset that shows recordings of being inside a plane, Dragonette said.",
      "It\u2019s a matter of getting patients to learn to live with their feelings and better handle them.",
      "Carbonell recommends patients take practice flights that do not involve work trips or any other responsibilities. When they have symptoms, he recommends they keep a written inventory.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re keeping a simple count,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re using counting as a proxy for acceptance.\u201d",
      "Nelson, who was a longtime United Airlines flight attendant, says: \u201cI\u2019ve had situations where I\u2019d sort of sit in the aisle and hold someone\u2019s hand.\"",
      "On a Frontier Airlines flight last year from Detroit to San Diego, Campbell tried breathing and other coping skills, but they didn\u2019t halt her panic attack. The passenger next to her noticed she was increasingly anxious, and summoned a flight attendant.",
      "The flight attendant took deep breaths with Campbell and helped her get through it, and also took down Campbell\u2019s phone number and checked on her a day later.",
      "\u201cI was really impressed,\u201d she said.",

      "The World Food Program and the United Nations refugee agency will slash jobs because of funding cuts, mainly from the United States",
      "CAIRO -- The World Food Program and the United Nations refugee agency will slash jobs because of funding cuts, mainly from the United States, officials told The Associated Press on Tuesday, warning the reductions will severely affect aid programs worldwide.",
      "The WFP, also a United Nations organization, is expected to cut up to 30% of its staff. The head of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it would downsize its headquarters and regional offices to reduce costs by 30% and cut senior-level positions by 50%.",
      "That's according to internal memos obtained by The AP and verified by two U.N. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal personnel decisions.",
      "One WFP official called the cuts \u201cthe most massive\u201d seen by the agency in the past 25 years, and that as a result, operations will disappear or be downsized.",
      "The cuts to the U.N. agencies underscore the impact of President Donald Trump's decision to pull back the U.S. from its position as the world's single largest aid donor. Trump has given billionaire ally Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency power to redo the scale of the federal government, with a focus on slashing foreign assistance. Even before the administration's move, many donor nations had reduced humanitarian spending, and U.N. agencies struggled to reach funding goals.",
      "U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was \u201cdeeply troubled by the drastic funding reduction.\"",
      "\u201cThe heads of our humanitarian agencies are being forced to take impossibly painful decisions as budget cuts have an immediate and often deadly impact on the world\u2019s most vulnerable,\u201d Dujarric said in a statement to The AP. \u201cWe understand the pressures on national budgets faced by governments, but these cuts come at a time when military spending again hits record levels.\"",
      "The WFP, the world\u2019s largest humanitarian organization, received 46% of its funding from the United States in 2024.",
      "Asked about the planned cuts, the organization said in a statement that \"in this challenging donor environment, WFP will prioritize its limited resources on vital programs that bring urgently needed food assistance to the 343 million people struggling with hunger and increasingly facing starvation.\u201d",
      "The internal memo said personnel cuts will \u201cimpact all geographies, divisions and levels\u201d in the agency. It suggested further downsizing may be needed and said the agency will review its \u201cportfolio of programs.\u201d",
      "The U.N.'s top refugee agency provides help to some 43.7 million refugees worldwide, along with others among the 122 million people driven from their homes by conflicts and natural disasters.",
      "It said a statement that the agency will \u201chave to significantly reduce our workforce,\u201d including downsizing the headquarters and regional offices. UNHCR said some country offices will be closed, but it did not give an immediate figure of how many staff will be cut.",
      "\u201cThe impact of this funding crunch on refugees\u2019 lives is already devastating and will get far worse,\u201d the agency said. Programs providing food, clean water, medicines, emergency shelter and other services \u201cwill reduce or stop.\u201d",
      "For example, it said, reduced funding will cut access to clean water for at least half a million displaced people in Sudan, increasing the risk of cholera and other disease outbreaks.",
      "It also will hurt efforts to house and provide schooling for refugees from Sudan in South Sudan, Chad and Uganda. It warned that the lack of facilities in host countries will push more refugees to attempt dangerous crossings to Europe.",
      "In the April 23 email to staff, the UNHCR chief said the headquarters and regional offices will be downsized to cut costs by 30%. It said senior-level positions will be capped to bring a 50% reduction.",
      "The cuts \u201cwill affect our operations, the size of our organization, and, most worryingly, the very people we are called to protect,\u201d it said. \u201cIt is critical that we prioritize, as we always have, the well-being and safety of refugees and of displaced and stateless people.\u201d",
      "UNHCR\u2019s office in Lebanon \u2014 which is home to some 1 million refugees from Syria \u2014 is only 15% funded, its spokesperson Lisa Abou Khaled said.",
      "This month, it had to stop cash assistance to 347,000 refugees \u2014 two-thirds of the number it previously helped \u2014 and funding for the remaining 200,000 will last only through June, she said. It also halted primary health services for some 40,000 refugees.",
      "The U.N. agency said last month that it had been hit by a 30% decrease in funding for the year, mainly because of U.S. cuts. It said it was ending programs that affect 6,000 personnel and reducing its staff at headquarters by 20%.",

      "Canada\u2019s Liberals are celebrating election victory in a stunning turn of fortune",
      "TORONTO -- As Canada\u2019s Liberals celebrated election victory in a stunning turn of fortune, the country would not know until later Tuesday whether the party of Prime Minister Mark Carney would have an outright majority or need help in Parliament.",
      "Populist Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre \u2014 in the lead until U.S. President Donald Trump took aim at Canada with a trade war and annexation threats \u2014 was voted out of his Parliament seat in Monday's election.",
      "That capped a swift decline in fortunes for the firebrand Poilievre, who a few months ago appeared to be a shoo-in to become Canada\u2019s next prime minister and shepherd the Conservatives back into power for the first time in a decade.",
      "Poilievre, a career politician, campaigned with Trump-like bravado, taking a page from the \u201cAmerica First\u201d president by adopting the slogan \u201cCanada First.\u201d But his similarities to Trump may have ultimately cost him and his party.",
      "The Liberals were projected to win more of Parliament\u2019s 343 seats than the Conservatives. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if they would win an outright majority \u2014 at least 172 seats \u2014 or would need to rely on a smaller party to pass legislation.",
      "Elections Canada said it decided to pause counting of special ballots \u2014 cast by voters who are away from their districts during the election \u2014 until later Tuesday. The Liberals were leading or elected in 168 seats when counting was paused, four short of a majority. Elections Canada estimated that uncounted votes could affect the result in about a dozen districts.",
      "Canadians won\u2019t know until later in the day whether Carney\u2019s Liberals have won a minority or majority mandate.",
      "In a victory speech, Carney stressed unity in the face of Washington\u2019s threats. He said the mutually beneficial system Canada and the U.S. had shared since World War II had ended.",
      "\u201cWe are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country,\u201d Carney added. \u201cThese are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so America can own us. That will never ... ever happen. But we also must recognize the reality that our world has fundamentally changed.\u201d",
      "Poilievre hoped to make the election a referendum on former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose popularity declined toward the end of his decade in power as food and housing prices rose.",
      "But Trump attacked, Trudeau resigned and Carney, a two-time central banker, became the Liberal Party\u2019s leader and prime minister.",
      "In a concession speech before the race call on his own seat, Poilievre vowed to keep fighting for Canadians.",
      "\u201cWe are cognizant of the fact that we didn\u2019t get over the finish line yet,\u201d Poilievre said. \u201cWe know that change is needed, but change is hard to come by. It takes time. It takes work. And that\u2019s why we have to learn the lessons of tonight.\u201d",
      "McGill University political science professor Daniel B\u00e9land said nothing prevents Poilievre from remaining the Conservative leader without a seat but, if he decides to stay, he would need to run in another district \u2014 perhaps by asking a Conservative member of Parliament from a safe Conservative district to resign.",
      "\u201cStill, losing your seat when some people within your own party think you\u2019re the main reason why it failed to win is a clear issue for Poilievre,\u201d B\u00e9land said.",
      "\"Moreover, not having the leader of the official opposition in the House of Commons when Parliament sits again would obviously be a problem for the Conservatives, especially if we do end up with a minority Parliament.\u201d",
      "Even with Canadians grappling with deadly weekend attack at a Vancouver street festival, Trump was trolling them on election day, asserting he was on their ballot and erroneously claiming that the U.S. subsidizes Canada, writing, \u201cIt makes no sense unless Canada is a State!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s truculence has infuriated Canadians, leading many to cancel U.S. vacations, refuse to buy American goods and possibly even vote early. A record 7.3 million Canadians cast ballots before election day.",
      "Reid Warren, a Toronto resident, said he voted Liberal because Poilievre \u201csounds like mini-Trump to me.\u201d He said Trump\u2019s tariffs are a worry.",
      "\u201cCanadians coming together from, you know, all the shade being thrown from the States is great, but it\u2019s definitely created some turmoil, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said.",
      "Foreign policy hasn\u2019t dominated a Canadian election this much since 1988, when, ironically, free trade with the United States was the prevailing issue.",
      "Carney and the Liberals have daunting challenges ahead.",
      "If they don\u2019t win a majority in Parliament, the Liberals might need rely on a smaller party. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which looked set to finish third, is a separatist party from French-speaking Quebec that seeks independence. Trudeau\u2019s Liberals relied on the New Democrats to remain in power for four years, but the progressive party fared poorly on Monday and its leader, Jagmeet Singh, said he was stepping down after eight years in charge.",
      "\u201cIt appears the Liberals will not attain a majority, but the (New Democrats) will prop them up as before. I do not expect any formal deal between the parties,\u201d said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto.",
      "In addition to the trade war with the U.S. and frosty relationship with Trump, Canada is dealing with a cost-of-living crisis. And more than 75% of its exports go to the U.S., so Trump\u2019s tariffs threat and his desire to get North American automakers to move Canada\u2019s production south could severely damage the economy.",
      "Carney has vowed that every dollar the government collects from counter-tariffs on U.S. goods will go toward Canadian workers who are adversely affected. He also said he plans to offer a middle-class tax cut, return immigration to sustainable levels and increase funding to Canada\u2019s public broadcaster.",

      "Russia also launched 20 drones and 31 powerful guided bombs at Kharkiv, the second-largest Ukrainian city. Debris from an intercepted Russian drone started a fire in a neighborhood of the capital, Kyiv, according to officials.",
      "Putin announced Monday the temporary ceasefire. However, he hasn't offered details on how the truce, which will start May 8 and last through the end of May 10, would be monitored. It marks Moscow\u2019s defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, known as Victory Day, and comes more than three years after Russia invaded its neighbor.",
      "Russia has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day halt in the fighting by imposing far-reaching conditions. Ukraine has accepted it, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Kyiv is keen to lock in crucial U.S. military aid for the war, amid doubts about whether Europe could pick up the slack if Washington walks away.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has invested effort in trying to end the fighting, but he expressed skepticism last weekend about Putin's commitment to negotiate a peace deal amid continuing attacks on Ukraine. He said he suspected the Russian leader could be trying to mislead him.",
      "Ukrainian officials scoffed at Putin\u2019s ceasefire announcement.",
      "Andrii Yermak, the head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential office, said Russia is still trying to break through the around 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line while also launching long-range attacks on civilian areas.",
      "\u201cPutin can give the order for his forces to stop,\u201d Yermak said, \u201cbut he does not do this in the hope of deceiving everyone.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy also accused Putin of trying to string along the U.S.",
      "\"Russia has consistently rejected everything and continues to manipulate the world, trying to deceive the United States,\u201d he said.",
      "He also said in his nightly address late Monday that the ceasefire \"must be immediate, full, and unconditional \u2014 for at least 30 days to ensure it is secure and guaranteed.\u201d",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that Ukraine hasn\u2019t properly responded to Putin\u2019s announcement and accused Kyiv officials of conniving.",
      "\u201cI would say that not giving a direct response to such an initiative by President Putin is, rather, a manipulation,\u201d Peskov told reporters.",
      "The Institute for the Study of War said Putin likely wants to avoid the embarrassment of Ukrainian strikes on Victory Day, when foreign dignitaries will be visiting Moscow to mark the day.",
      "The ceasefire would also offer a respite for Russian forces, the Washington-based think tank said late Monday.",
      "\u201cThe Kremlin continues attempts to hold legitimate ceasefire negotiations hostage in order to secure additional concessions from Ukraine and the United States,\u201d it said.",
      "Putin previously announced a unilateral 30-hour Easter ceasefire and Ukraine voiced readiness to reciprocate any genuine truce at the time. However, each accused the other of continuous attacks.",

      "The Italian cardinal at the heart of the Vatican\u2019s \u201ctrial of the century\u201d announced Tuesday he was withdrawing from participating in the upcoming conclave to elect a new pope",
      "VATICAN CITY -- The Italian cardinal at the heart of the Vatican\u2019s \u201ctrial of the century\u201d announced Tuesday he was withdrawing from participating in the upcoming conclave to elect a new pope for \u201cthe good of the church.\u201d",
      "Cardinal Angelo Becciu\u2019 s status has dominated discussions in the days after Pope Francis\u2019 death amid questions about whether he would participate in the conclave to elect his successor.",
      "After his 2020 downfall, Becciu had said he would not participate in any future conclave. But in recent days he had asserted he had a right to enter the Sistine Chapel with other cardinals on May 7.",
      "On Tuesday, the 76-year-old Italian issued a statement through his lawyers that said: \u201cHaving at heart the good of the church, which I have served and will continue to serve with fidelity and love, as well as to contribute to the communion and serenity of the conclave, I have decided to obey as I have always done the will of Pope Francis not to enter the conclave while remaining convinced of my innocence.\u201d",
      "Becciu was once an influential Vatican chief of staff who was a leading papal contender himself. But he fell from grace in 2020 when Francis forced him to resign his job as head of the Vatican\u2019s saint-making office and his rights as a cardinal because of allegations of financial misconduct.",
      "Becciu denied wrongdoing but was put on trial in the Vatican criminal court and convicted of finance-related charges in December 2023. He is appealing the conviction and 5 1/2-year prison sentence and had participated in the pre-conclave meetings, including on Monday.",
      "Becciu rose to prominence and power under conservative Pope Benedict XVI and is very much affiliated with the conservative Vatican old guard. While he initially became a close adviser to Pope Francis, Becciu\u2019s subsequent downfall at the hands of Francis might suggest he would vote for someone keen to undo some of Francis\u2019 reforms.",
      "At 76, Becciu is under the age limit of 80 and technically eligible to vote, but the Vatican\u2019s official statistics list him as a \u201cnon-elector.\u201d",
      "The Vatican document regulating a conclave, known by its Latin name Universi Dominici Gregis, lays out the criteria for electors, making clear that 80 cardinals under 80 have the right to elect the pope, except those who have been \u201ccanonically deposed or who with the consent of the Roman Pontiff have renounced the cardinalate.\u201d It adds that after a pope has died, \u201cthe College of Cardinals cannot readmit or rehabilitate them.\u201d",
      "There has never been any clarity on what exactly Becciu renounced or how: The one-line statement issued by the Vatican press office on Sept. 24, 2020, said merely that Francis had accepted Becciu\u2019s resignation as prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints \u201cand his rights connected to the cardinalate.\u201d There is no indication he has been sanctioned canonically.",
      "After he forced Becciu\u2019s resignation, Francis visited Becciu on occasions and allowed him to participate in the life of the Vatican. But Francis also changed Vatican law to allow the city state\u2019s criminal tribunal to prosecute him.",
      "Italian daily Domani reported last week that during the initial pre-conclave discussions, Becciu was presented with two letters signed by Francis before he died indicating he should not participate in the conclave. Becciu's reference of Francis' will in his statement Tuesday suggests that the letters were the tipping point that convinced him to withdraw from the vote.",
      "Questions, meanwhile, have continued to swirl about the integrity of the trial that convicted Becciu and eight others. During the proceedings, the court heard that Francis intervened on several occasions on behalf of the prosecutors and that the prosecution\u2019s prime witness against Becciu was coached and manipulated by outsiders.",
      "The appeal is scheduled to begin in September.",

      "Cardinals have decided the conclave to elect a successor to Pope Francis will begin May 7",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 A conclave is the centuries-old election of a pope that derives its name from the Italian \u201ccon clave\u201d (with a key) to underscore that cardinals are sequestered until they find a winner.",
      "Cardinals have no contact with the outside world after the master of liturgical ceremonies utters the words \u201cExtra Omnes\u201d the Latin phrase for \u201call out,\u201d to ask all those present except the cardinal electors to leave the Sistine Chapel to begin the voting process.",
      "In between votes, the cardinals will be staying at the Domus Santa Marta hotel in Vatican City and possibly another nearby Vatican residence, since there are more cardinal electors than Santa Marta hotel rooms.",
      "The conclave begins May 7, in the afternoon.",
      "The day begins with Mass celebrated in the morning by the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.",
      "In the afternoon, the cardinals process into the Sistine Chapel and take their seats. A priest delivers a meditation and the cardinals take an oath. After the \u201cExtra Omnes,\u201d the conclave begins.",
      "Unless there are any outstanding questions or problems, cardinals take a single vote the afternoon of May 7, seeking a two-thirds majority. If they don't find a winner on the first ballot, they retire for the evening and return to the Sistine Chapel the following morning.",
      "They can take up to two votes each morning, and two each afternoon until they have a winner.",
      "Only cardinals under age 80 are eligible to vote. Current regulations notionally limit the number of electors to 120, but popes often exceeded that ceiling and today there are 135 who are eligible.",
      "Those cardinals who are over 80 can\u2019t vote but can participate in pre-conclave meetings, known as general congregations, in which church problems are discussed. It was in these meetings in 2013 that then-Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio spoke about the need for the church to go to the \u201cexistential peripheries\u201d to find those who suffer \u2014 an off-the-cuff speech that helped his election.",
      "St. John Paul II rewrote the regulations on papal elections in a 1996 document that remains largely in force today, though Pope Benedict XVI amended it twice before he resigned.",
      "Francis didn't introduce any changes into the conclave itself, though his influence will surely be felt given he named 108 of the 135 cardinal-electors who are eligible to vote.",
      "Benedict's most notable change to the original 1996 document was to exclude the possibility that a pope could be elected by a simple majority if voting was stalemated. Benedict decreed that a two-thirds majority is always needed, no matter how long it takes. He did so to prevent cardinals from holding out for the 12 days foreseen by John Paul and then pushing through a candidate with a slim majority.",
      "If the conclave lasts that long, the top two vote-getters go to a runoff, with a two-thirds majority required to win. Neither of the top two candidates casts a ballot in the runoff.",
      "Any baptized Catholic male is eligible to be pope, but since 1378, only cardinals have been selected. Cardinals over age 80 can be elected pope, even if they can't be in the room to cast a ballot.",
      "Francis and popes before him have upheld the ban on ordaining women as priests, which precludes them from being pope. Under Catholic doctrine, the priesthood is reserved for men because Christ chose only men as his 12 apostles. The teaching is considered divinely inspired and infallible.",
      "Benedict tightened the oath of secrecy in the conclave, making clear that anyone who reveals what went on inside faces automatic excommunication.",
      "In John Paul\u2019s rules, excommunication was always a possibility, but Benedict revised the oath that liturgical assistants and secretaries take to make it explicit, saying they must observe \u201cabsolute and perpetual secrecy\u201d and explicitly refrain from using any audio or video recording devices.",
      "They now declare: \u201cI take this oath fully aware that an infraction thereof will incur the penalty of automatic excommunication reserved to the Apostolic See. So help me God and these Holy Gospels, which I touch with my hand.\u201d",
      "After the ballots are pierced, they are burned in a cylindrical stove at the end of the voting session. Black smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney means no decision; white smoke signals the cardinals have chosen a pope and that he has accepted.",
      "Chemical cartridges are added to ensure there is no confusion over the color. To produce black smoke, a cartridge containing potassium perchlorate, anthracene \u2014 the component of coal tar \u2014 and sulfur is burned with the ballots. For white smoke, a cartridge of potassium chlorate, lactose and chloroform resin is burned with the ballots.",
      "Bells also are rung to signal the election of a pope, for further clarity.",

      "\u201cWe have never had a complete collapse of the system,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. Authorities were still investigating what happened on Tuesday.",
      "Such widespread electric failure has little precedent on the Iberian Peninsula or in Europe.",
      "On Tuesday, Spain\u2019s meteorological agency AEMET said that it had not detected any \u201cunusual meteorological or atmospheric phenomena\u201d on Monday, and no sudden temperature fluctuations were recorded at their weather stations.",
      "Portugal\u2019s National Cybersecurity Center on Monday threw cold water on feverish speculation about foul play, saying there was no sign that the outage resulted from a cyber attack. European Council President Antonio Costa also said there were \u201cno indications of any cyber attack\u201d Monday afternoon.",
      "Teresa Ribera, an executive vice president of the European Commission, also ruled out sabotage. Nonetheless, the outage \u201cis one of the most serious episodes recorded in Europe in recent times,\u201d she said.",
      "At Spain's largest train stations, droves of travelers waited Tuesday morning to board trains, or to rebook tickets for journeys that were canceled or disrupted on Monday and return home.",
      "At Atocha station in Madrid, hundreds of people stood near screens waiting for updates. Many had spent the night at the station, wrapped in blankets provided by the Red Cross around 1 a.m. Tuesday morning for those who had to wait overnight thanks to canceled trains. Similar scenes played out at Barcelona's Sants station.",
      "The Madrid Open tennis tournament being held this week was still affected by the power outage Tuesday after its cancellation the previous day. Tournament organizers delayed opening its doors.",
      "By 11 a.m. Tuesday, service on Madrid's metro system was fully restored. In Barcelona, the system was operating normally but commuter trains were suspended due to \u201celectrical instability,\u201d the company that runs the service, Rodalies Catalunya, said on X.",
      "In some parts of the country, commuter and mid-distance services were still suspended or running at reduced capacity.",
      "Emergency workers in Spain said they had rescued some 35,000 passengers on Monday stranded along railways and underground, with the blackout turning sports centers, train stations and airports into makeshift overnight refuges.",
      "On Monday, Rub\u00e9n Cari\u00f3n was stranded on a commuter train outside Madrid, when he pried the window open and walked to the nearest transit station by foot. Then, he spent the night in the city's Atocha station after his train back to Barcelona was canceled.",
      "The 24-year-old said he chose to wait overnight at the station instead of a hotel so he could stay updated on when he could board a train home, describing his experience as \u201cpure chaos.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is pushing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to cede territory occupied by Russia to Moscow to bring about an end to the fighting in Ukraine",
      "LONDON -- President Donald Trump is pushing Ukraine to cede territory to Russia to end the war, threatening to walk away if a deal becomes too difficult \u2014 and causing alarm bells in Europe about how to fill the gap.",
      "Ukraine's European allies view the war as fundamental to the continent's security, and pressure is now mounting to find ways to support Kyiv militarily \u2014 regardless of whether Trump pulls out.",
      "Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of prolonging the \u201ckilling field\u201d by pushing back on his demand that Ukraine hand over occupied Crimea to Moscow.",
      "Trump\u2019s land-for-peace plan would mark a significant shift in the post-World War II order, ripping up conventions that have long held that borders should not be redrawn by force.",
      "\u201cIt took a World War to roll back de jure annexations and 60 million people died,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, special adviser at the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris, referring to the pre-war annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany.",
      "\u201cEuropeans will not accept it\" and Ukraine will not either, he said.",
      "Diplomats and experts described various scenarios if the U.S. decides to walk. They range from the U.S. ceasing direct aid to Ukraine \u2014 but allowing European nations to pass on critical American intelligence and weapons to Kyiv \u2014 to Trump banning transfers of any American technology, including components or software in European weapons.",
      "Any withdrawal of U.S. military aid to Ukraine could create serious difficulties for Europe, analysts and diplomats told The Associated Press. Kyiv's ability to keep fighting would depend on European political will to muster money and weapons \u2014 and how quickly the gaps left by Washington can be filled.",
      "If it were easy, Europe would \u201calready be doing things without America,\u201d said a European diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.",
      "No new U.S. aid package for Ukraine has been approved since Trump came into office, even as European nations have collectively provided Ukraine with more aid than Washington, according to the Keil Institute.",
      "Europe has contributed around $157 billion, some $26 billion more than the U.S., although Washington slightly outpaces Europe when it comes to military aid, the Germany-based institute said.",
      "It will be hard, but there are ways Europe can find cash to fund Ukraine \u2014 including seizing frozen Russian assets \u2014 but \u201cmoney isn't what you shoot bullets with,\u201d Heisbourg said.",
      "Europe\u2019s \"big mistake\" was undertaking major military downsizing following the Cold War and thinking \u201cthis war started in February 2022 and not in February 2014,\u201d when Moscow invaded and then annexed Crimea, said Thomas Gomart, director of IFRI, a French international affairs think tank.",
      "Europeans are scrambling to acquire weapons for themselves and for Ukraine, while confronting constraints on production capacity, a fragmented defense industry and a decades-long reliance on the U.S.",
      "Some extra production capacity could come from Ukraine, which has ramped up manufacturing of ammunition and drones since Russia's invasion. Much harder to replace, experts said, are advanced American weapons, including air defenses.",
      "Russia has attacked Ukraine almost nightly since Putin\u2019s forces invaded in February 2022, flooding the skies with missiles and drones, including dummy attack drones to exhaust Ukraine's limited air defenses. In April, at least 57 people were killed in multiple strikes.",
      "The death toll from the Russian attacks would \u201cinevitably\u201d be higher without the American Patriot air-defense missile systems protecting Ukraine's skies, said Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.",
      "The Patriots can track and intercept Russian missiles, including the hypersonic Kinzhal, which Putin has boasted was unstoppable. Kyiv uses them to protect critical infrastructure, including the country's energy grid.",
      "Earlier this month, Zelenskyy asked to buy 10 Patriots, a request Trump dismissed. \u201cYou don\u2019t start a war against someone 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles,\" he said, a day after a Russian strike on the Ukrainian city of Sumy killed 35 people.",
      "France and Italy have given Ukraine their Aster SAMP/T air-defense system but the issue is not \u201cquality, it\u2019s quantity,\u201d Barrie said, pointing to the larger U.S. defense industrial base and greater U.S. stockpiles.",
      "Although Trump criticized Putin over the weekend for his missile strikes and suggested imposing more sanctions on Russia, for Europe it remains a wait-and-see game.",
      "The whiplash of Trump's aggressive foreign policy means nothing is off the cards, experts said.",
      "A worst-case scenario could see a ban on American weapons exports and transfers to Ukraine, which would bar European nations from buying U.S. weapons to give to Kyiv or transferring weapons with American components or software, Barrie said.",
      "That could mean countries, including Germany, that have already given American Patriots to Ukraine would be prohibited from doing so. Such a move would seriously hamper Europe's ability to support Kyiv and mark a fundamental shift in America's relationship with its allies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing for the U.S. to cease to be an ally, it is another for the U.S. to be an enemy,\u201d Heisbourg said, noting that such a step could also damage the U.S. defense sector if weapons purchases were perceived to be unusable on Trump\u2019s political order.",
      "In March, the Trump administration suspended intelligence sharing with Ukraine in a bid to force Zelenskyy to accept a truce with Russia. The about weeklong suspension impacted Ukraine's ability to track and target Russian troops, tanks and ships.",
      "There are certain capabilities, including \u201chigher-end\u201d surveillance and reconnaissance using satellites that \u201conly the United States can provide,\u201d said Matthew Kroenig, vice president of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security in Washington.",
      "While the extent of intelligence sharing between the U.S. and Ukraine is not known, experts said it likely shows Kyiv near real-time buildup of Russian troop deployments and helps target long-range strikes.",
      "Ukraine's allies do not have as much satellite capability as the U.S. but could launch more, or Ukraine could use commercial systems if Trump cuts off intelligence again, experts said. The latter would likely have to come from a European provider \u2014 in March, the American satellite imagery company Maxar Technologies confirmed it temporarily suspended access to unclassified satellite images following the administration's decision to pull intelligence sharing.",
      "Ukraine also needs an alternative to Elon Musk's satellite network Starlink, which is critical for Ukrainian defensive and civilian communications. European defense companies are discussing creating a satellite alliance but don't currently have an alternative on the same scale.",
      "If Trump walks away, or if Kyiv rejects a deal and keeps fighting with European support, it won\u2019t necessarily mean \"the collapse of Ukraine\" although more people will almost certainly die if the U.S. pulls its air defenses and intelligence-sharing capabilities, Heisbourg said.",
      "Trump has jolted European leaders into awareness that they need to take responsibility for their own defense, regardless of who occupies the White House, experts said.",
      "That means European nations need to invest more in defense, work together to scale up military production and build trust to share intelligence.",
      "\u201cThis issue is not a question about the next two months or the next two years. This issue is about the next two decades,\u201d Gomart said.",

      "Donald Trump cast a long shadow over Canada\u2019s national election \u2014 and many Canadian voters noticed",
      "MISSISSAUGA, Ontario -- Donald Trump cast a long shadow over Canada's national election \u2014 and many Canadian voters noticed.",
      "In his first 100 days back in the White House, the U.S. president has lobbed barbs at America's northern neighbor, levied tariffs on Canadian goods and talked about making Canada the 51st state.",
      "It had many Canadian voters thinking about Trump and how the parties on the ballot would respond to him. Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberals won over Conservative opposition leader Pierre Poilievre, a dramatic reversal of fortune credited largely to Trump.",
      "Here are some voices from voters casting their ballots in Monday's elections:",
      "In Toronto, Reid Warren said he voted Liberal because he saw the party as the best amid what he characterized as \u201creal uncertainty\u201d in the economy particularly.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a better choice right now,\u201d he said, voting in Toronto. \"I know people believe in Poilievre but it\u2019s the same, like, soundbites that you get from anybody else. It sounds like mini-Trump to me.\u201d",
      "Warren, who works at a wholesale food distribution center, said he did feel somewhat boosted by unity among Canadians created by \u201call the shade being thrown from the States,\u201d but \u2018it's definitely created some turmoil, that\u2019s for sure.\"",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s only so many times that you can hear, you know, \u201951st state\u2019 and \u2018governor this\u2019 and all that disrespect that\u2019s coming that you have to think, you know, at some point you have to take it seriously,\" said Duncan Garrow, a resident of Toronto.",
      "\"In a very bizarre, upside down, twisted way, this might be a good thing for Canada, because I think maybe we\u2019ve had too much of a relationship with the United States. I mean, they\u2019re right there, they\u2019re always going to be our neighbor, our partner, our friend, hopefully. But thinking about other possibilities, thinking about cutting down some of our own barriers within Canada, but also thinking more internationally, just as a country, I think that\u2019s a very healthy, progressive way to be going forward.\u201d",
      "Sisters Laiqa and Mahira Shoaib said they both voted for change in Monday\u2019s election, and both said Trump's rhetoric and tariff plans influenced their decision.",
      "The sisters, who immigrated from Pakistan a decade ago and voted in Mississauga, Ontario, said the economy has worsened and job opportunities have dried up under Liberal rule.",
      "\u201cIt was different when we arrived,\u201d Laiqa Shoaib said after casting her ballot. \u201cWe need to get out of Liberals.\u201d",
      "Laiqa, 27 and a health care worker, voted for the New Democratic Party. Mahira, 25, who works at a bank, supported the Conservative Party, and Poilievre, whom she described as \u201cbusiness-minded.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe would definitely be the 51st state if Mark Carney wins,\u201d she said.",

      "Four former Hong Kong lawmakers have been released after spending more than four years in prison for their conviction under a Beijing-imposed law that crushed a once-thriving pro-democracy movement",
      "HONG KONG -- Four former Hong Kong lawmakers were freed from prison on Tuesday, having served more than four years for their conviction under a Beijing-imposed law that crushed a once-thriving pro-democracy movement.",
      "Claudia Mo, Jeremy Tam, Kwok Ka-ki and Gary Fan were among 47 activists arrested in 2021 for their roles in an unofficial primary election. They were the first of the convicted activists to reunite with their families and friends following years of separation.",
      "Only vehicles involved in the release operation were seen leaving the three prisons in the remote areas of the Asian financial hub under tight security. The curtains of the vehicles were down. Reporters who waited for hours outside the prisons where they were held were unable to see them in person around the facilities.",
      "An Associated Press reporter saw Mo's husband, Philip Bowring, waiting for the activist to return home at their residence before being escorted by police out of the area where they live.",
      "In a video posted by local online media HK01, Fan, when asked by a reporter about his feelings, thanked Hong Kongers and the media for their concern. He added he was going to reunite with his family.",
      "The 2020 unofficial primary drew 610,000 voters, and its winners had been expected to advance to the official legislative election. Authorities postponed that, however, citing public health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "During the trial, prosecutors said the activists aimed to paralyze Hong Kong\u2019s government and force the city\u2019s leader to resign by aiming to win a legislative majority and using it to block government budgets indiscriminately. The judges said in their verdict last year that the activists\u2019 plans to effect change through the unofficial primary would have undermined the government\u2019s authority and created a constitutional crisis.",
      "Only two of the 47 original defendants were acquitted. The remaining activists received prison terms ranging from four years and two months to 10 years on a charge of conspiracy to commit subversion. Mo, Tam, Kwok and Fan, who got the shortest terms, had their sentences reduced after pleading guilty.",
      "Regardless of their term length, years of separation have pained the activists and their families. The case involved democracy advocates across the spectrum. They include legal scholar Benny Tai, who got a 10-year prison term, and former student leader Joshua Wong, who has to serve four years and eight months.",
      "Fourteen of the convicted activists would appeal their cases. The government lawyers would also appeal the acquittal of one activist.",
      "Critics said their convictions illustrated how authorities crushed dissent following massive anti-government protests in 2019, alongside media crackdowns and reduced public choice in elections. The drastic political changes reflect that the Western-style civil liberties Beijing promised to retain in the former British colony for 50 years when it returned to China in 1997 were shrinking, they said.",
      "Beijing and Hong Kong governments insisted the national security law was necessary for the city\u2019s stability. China defended the judicial decisions, despite criticism from foreign governments.",

      "The filing was made Friday on behalf of Abdulrahman al-Qaradawi, an outspoken critic of Egypt\u2019s government who had been residing in Turkey. It urges London's Metropolitan Police to launch a criminal investigation into the activist's alleged abduction, torture and extradition to the UAE.",
      "Al-Qaradawi was detained in Lebanon on Dec. 28 as he was returning from Syria. He had reportedly visited Syria to join celebrations after the downfall of President Bashar Assad in a lightning insurgent offensive.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s Cabinet deported him to the United Arab Emirates on Jan. 8. Since then he has been held alone \u201cwithout charge, without due process, and under psychological pressure,\u201d his lawyer said, adding that amounts to torture under international law.",
      "\u201cAbdulrahman was taken from his family, forcibly removed across borders and thrown into solitary confinement in a country where he is not a citizen and there is no evidence he has committed any crime,\" said his lawyer, Rodney Dixon. \u201cThis is not extradition; it\u2019s abduction in plain sight.\u201d",
      "Dixon is pressing U.K. police to open an investigation under Britain's universal jurisdiction laws, which allow governments to prosecute people for the most serious crimes regardless of where they are allegedly committed.",
      "The complaint names the UAE Ministry of Interior, as well as former Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, who approved the activist's extradition from Lebanon to the UAE, and Royel Jet LLC, the company that provided the private aircraft for the extradition, as responsible parties.",
      "All have business or other links with the U.K. and could be arrested and prosecuted if they travel to Britain.",
      "\u201cWhat we are hoping is that based on the evidence we have, the Metropolitan Police will commence an investigation into these persons and entities and then to seek arrest warrants,\u201d Dixon said.",
      "Al-Qaradawi\u2019s late father, Youssef al-Qaradawi, was a senior and controversial Egyptian cleric revered by the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.",
      "Abdulrahman al-Qaradawi was wanted in Egypt on charges of disseminating false news and inciting violence, for which he was convicted and sentenced in absentia to five years in prison.",
      "U.N. special rapporteurs have expressed concern over al-Qaradawi's case, and dozens of rights organizations have written a joint letter to UAE authorities calling for information on his whereabouts and his immediate release.",
      "Amnesty International has said that while visiting Damascus in December, al-Qaradawi had filmed himself criticizing the authorities of the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The rights group said the video may have triggered his arrest.",
      "A spokesman for Mikati said in a statement that it was not his personal decision to extradite the activist, and that the Lebanese Council of Ministers had followed due process in deciding to approve his transfer to the UAE.",
      "The UAE government did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "Police in Japan say that climber who was airlifted with altitude sickness from near the peak of Japan\u2019s Mount Fuji last week returned to the slope and was rescued for a second time just four days later",
      "TOKYO -- A climber airlifted with altitude sickness from near the peak of Japan's Mount Fuji last week returned to the slope and was rescued for a second time just four days later, authorities said Monday.",
      "Officials urged people to be aware of the harsh conditions at the country\u2019s tallest peak during its off-season.",
      "The climber was identified only as a 27-year-old Chinese student living in Japan. He made an emergency call on April 22 and was airlifted after developing symptoms of altitude sickness, police said, adding that his climbing irons also were damaged.",
      "On Saturday, he returned to the mountain's Fujinomiya trail about 3,000 meters (nearly 10,000 feet) above sea level to look for his cell phone and other belongings left behind, Shizuoka prefectural police said. Another climber found him there unable to move after he apparently developed altitude sickness for a second time, police said.",
      "The mountain's hiking trails are officially open only from July to early September, but there is no penalty for hiking off-season. There also is no charge or penalty when a climber needs to be rescued, but the Chinese student's case prompted an uproar on social media and generated calls for him to be charged, at least for his second rescue.",
      "The Shizuoka police urged all climbers to use caution, noting that the mountain has low temperatures and is covered in snow even in spring.",
      "The 3,776-meter-high (12,388-foot-high ) mountain was designated a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site in 2013. A symbol of Japan, the mountain called \u201cFujisan\u201d used to be a place of pilgrimage and is increasingly popular among hikers today.",
      "To control overcrowding and risks from rushed overnight climbing through rocky slopes to see the sunrise, local authorities last year introduced an entry fee and cap on the number of entrants on the most popular trail and will introduce similar rules on other main trails this year.",

      "Hegseth also added a warning that Ukraine will not get all its territory back from Russia and will not be allowed to join their security organization, which would provide Kyiv with the ultimate security guarantee to ensure that Putin never attacks again.",
      "NATO leaders have always insisted that membership should be discussed solely among allies and candidates and that Moscow can have no say, but recently it\u2019s become a bargaining chip in talks between the United States, Russia and Ukraine.",
      "NATO was formed in 1949 as a bulwark against aggression in Europe by the Soviet Union. Former West Germany sought protection as its 15th member on May 6, 1955, as concern grew about the Soviet army massed east of the iron curtain.",

      "The challenge, Steinmeier said, is to uphold values like democracy and the rule of law as much as to defend territory. \u201cWe all know that these have come under attack, not just from outside but also from within,\u201d he said.",

      "Lee, who died at age 97 on March 17, was once ranked as the richest man in Asia. In Forbes\u2019 February ranking, he was listed as the city\u2019s second-richest person with $29.2 billion in assets.",
      "Lee founded Henderson Land Development Co. Ltd. in 1976, and his empire helped shape the Asian financial hub's skyline. The company's portfolio includes landmarks such as the International Finance Centre complex and ifc mall in Central, a vibrant commercial district. His business interests also expanded into other sectors such as hotels, utilities and ferries in the city.",
      "Nicknamed \u201cUncle Four,\" Lee was ranked the richest person in Asia and the world's fourth-wealthiest person by Forbes in 1996. He was Henderson Land's chairman and managing director before stepping down from the position in 2019. He was succeeded by his sons, Peter Lee and Martin Lee, the company\u2019s co-chairpersons.",
      "Like other tycoons, who rose in the city's postwar economic boom and then thrived as mainland China abandoned orthodox Marxism, Lee met with former top Chinese leaders, including Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin. In 2007, a decade after the end of British colonial rule, the Hong Kong government awarded him the Grand Bauhinia Medal in recognition of his outstanding contributions to education and community service.",
      "According to Henderson Land, committee members overseeing his funeral included Hong Kong's leading official, John Lee, former city leaders Tung Chee-hwa and Leung Chun-ying, and Zheng Yanxiong, director of Beijing\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong. Other business and political heavyweights were also part of the committee.",
      "On Sunday, Zheng, Lee and other former and current government officials, as well as Richard Li, the younger son of Hong Kong's richest person Li Ka-shing, and property tycoons Thomas Kwok and Raymond Kwok, paid their respects to Lee during a vigil.",
      "Buddhist rites were performed during the service on Monday. His body will be transported to his ancestral homeland in Shunde district, Guangdong province, the coastal region in southern China across from Hong Kong where Lee, like so many top Hong Kong business leaders, was born. He moved to the city in 1948, one year before the communists swept to power in mainland China, targeting land owners as they went, and became a key player in the city's real estate industry.",
      "Known as Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cWarren Buffett\u201d for his investment acumen, he was also a leading philanthropist who contributed significantly to the development of both Hong Kong and mainland China.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran finally extinguished a fire Monday at a southern port rocked by an explosion as the death toll in the blast rose to at least 65 people killed, authorities said.",
      "Satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press also showed the devastation of the explosion that injured more than 1,000 people. The photos from Planet Labs PBC came as local news reports from the site raised more questions about the cause of the blast Saturday at the Shahid Rajaei port near Bandar Abbas.",
      "Iranian Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni announced the fire had been put out, while Hormozgan Gov. Mohammad Ashouri Taziani gave the death toll.",
      "The port reportedly took in a chemical component needed for solid fuel for ballistic missiles \u2014 something denied by authorities though they've not explained the source of the power that caused such destruction.",
      "The blast Saturday disintegrated a building next to the blast site, which appeared to be in a row where other containers once stood, the satellite photos showed. It also shredded the majority of another building just to the west.",
      "The force of the blast also could be seen, with what appeared to be two craters measure some 50 meters (165 feet) across. Other containers nearby appeared smashed and distended by the explosion and the intense fire that followed.",
      "The fire still burned at the site Monday, some two days after the initial explosion that happened just as Iran began a third round of negotiations with the United States over its rapidly advancing nuclear program.",
      "Authorities still haven't offered an explanation for the explosion.",
      "Private security firm Ambrey says the port received missile fuel chemical in March. It was part of a shipment of ammonium perchlorate from China by two vessels to Iran, first reported in January by the Financial Times. The chemical used to make solid propellant for rockets was going to be used to replenish Iran\u2019s missile stocks, which had been depleted by its direct attacks on Israel during the war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The Iranian military denied receiving the chemical shipment.",
      "Social media footage of the explosion saw reddish-hued smoke rising from the fire just before the detonation. That suggests a chemical compound being involved in the blast, like in the 2020 Beirut port explosion.",
      "Late Sunday, Iran's semiofficial ILNA news agency quoted Saeed Jafari, the CEO of marine services company working at the port, as saying there were false statements about the cargo that detonated, which he called \u201cvery dangerous.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe incident happened following a false statement about the dangerous goods and delivering it without documents and tags,\u201d Jafari said.",
      "Another report by the semiofficial ISNA news agency claimed the cargo that caused the blast was not reported to customs authorities as well.",
      "Only high-level authorities in Iran, such as its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, could circumvent normal procedures at the port.",

      "LA County says it's facing \u201cunprecedented stresses\u201d on its budget, including a tentative $4 billion settlement of thousands of childhood sexual assault claims, a projected $2 billion in impacts related to the LA wildfires in January, and the potential loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.",

    "story": [
      "There\u2019s new uncertainty about updated COVID-19 shots this fall after the Trump administration\u2019s handling of a shot from Novavax",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration's effort to impose new requirements on Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine \u2014 the nation's only traditional protein-based option for the coronavirus \u2014 is sowing uncertainty about updates to other vaccines, too.",
      "Novavax said Monday that the Food and Drug Administration was asking the company to run a new clinical trial of its vaccine after the agency grants full approval. The company said it had responded and that it believed its shot remains \u201capprovable.\u201d",
      "But a weekend post on social media by FDA Commissioner Marty Makary suggested the prospect of needing a new trial before the shots' yearly strain update \u2014 something unlikely to be possible before fall. That's raised questions about whether other vaccines will be caught in the turmoil.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think because there\u2019s a strain change that this is a new product,\u201d said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former FDA vaccine chief. If that\u2019s the new policy, \u201cyou\u2019d always be doing clinical trials and you\u2019d never have a vaccine that was up to date.\u201d",
      "The unusual move at FDA come shortly after the agency's longtime vaccine chief was forced out over disagreements with Makary's boss, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Kennedy won Senate confirmation to his job, in part, by promising not to change the nation\u2019s vaccine schedule. Since taking office, he\u2019s promised to \u201cinvestigate\u201d children\u2019s shots, canceled meetings of expert vaccine advisers and directed officials to look again for connections between vaccines and autism, a link long-ago debunked.",
      "The Novavax vaccine, which originally showed effectiveness in a nearly 30,000-person clinical trial, is still being sold under emergency use authorization in the U.S. The nation's other two options, mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna, have earned full FDA approval for certain age groups.",
      "Because the coronavirus continually mutates, manufacturers follow instructions from FDA to make one change each year to their recipe \u2014 which strain to target \u2014 just like flu vaccines.",
      "The FDA was on track to grant Novavax full approval by its April 1 target date, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters. But Trump appointees directed FDA scientists to pause their decision, according to one of the people. Since that highly unusual move, Novavax and the agency have been discussing additional requirements for approval.",
      "In his weekend tweet, FDA's Makary referred to the Novavax vaccine as \u201ca new product,\u201d presumably because it had been updated to match last year's common coronavirus strain.",
      "\u201cNew products require new clinical studies,\u201d Makary added.",
      "An administration spokesman didn't respond to specific questions about Pfizer and Moderna but suggested all COVID-19 vaccines could face stricter requirements.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now been years since COVID has presented the threat it once did, and the urgency to rush approval of boosters without normal oversight no longer exists,\u201d said Andrew Nixon, a Health and Human Services spokesman, in a statement.",
      "The FDA had been treating the annual COVID-19 strain updates exactly as it's done for decades with flu vaccines \u2014 not as new products, but existing ones that are merely adjusted to protect against the latest strains, said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "Offit said the companies still must perform tests in small numbers of people that show these updated vaccines produce levels of virus-fighting antibodies known to be protective, and they're closely monitored for safety.",
      "Nixon, the HHS spokesman, suggested the policy might not apply to the flu shot, \u201cwhich has been tried and tested for more than 80 years.\u201d",
      "Under federal law, the FDA is required to follow established procedures when issuing requirements to drugmakers for approval. If the agency skips certain steps or imposes additional requirements for political reasons, experts say, it could be sued by drugmakers \u2014 or even patients, such as those who prefer the Novavax vaccine over its competitors because of an allergy or some other reason.",
      "In addition to large clinical trials conducted before all three COVID-19 vaccines were cleared for use, there's data on real-world use, said former Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, who oversaw COVID-19 vaccine policy during the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cAt the point where I had left, we had put some 700 million COVID vaccines into the arms of Americans,\u201d he said. \"That\u2019s a pretty good size clinical trial.\"",

      "President Donald Trump seemed to back down somewhat last week when he said he expected the tariffs to come down \u201csubstantially.\u201d That helped set off a rally in the stock market. But for small businesses that operate on razor-thin margins, the back and forth is causing massive upheaval. Some say they could be just months from going out of business altogether.",

      "Over the past three weeks, WS Game has had three containers of finished games, worth $500,000, stranded in China. It lost orders from three of the largest U.S. retailers totaling $16 million in business. And there\u2019s not much Silva can do about it.",
      "\u201cAs a small business, we don\u2019t have the runway or the capabilities to move manufacturing on a whim,\u201d said Silva, who has 22 employees. He said the tariffs have \u201cdisrupted our business and put us on the verge of insolvency\u201d and estimates he has about a four-month runway to stay afloat if nothing changes.",

      "Rice uses dozens of vendors. The largest are absorbing some of the cost of the tariffs and passing on the rest. One vendor is raising prices by 20% and another 25%. But Rice is expecting smaller vendors to increase prices by much higher percentages.",
      "House offers mid-range artificial flowers. A large hydrangea head will retail for $10 to $16, for example. China is the only place that manufacturers higher quality silk flowers. It would take a vendor years to open a factory in a different country or move production somewhere else, Rice said.",
      "Rice ordered his holiday d\u00e9cor early this year. But even after stocking up ahead of the tariffs, he only has enough everyday floral inventory in to last two to three months.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s basically just put a big pit in my stomach,\u201d said Lisa McDonald, owner of TeaHaus, located in Ann Arbor, home to the University of Michigan. McDonald has owned TeaHaus for nearly 18 years and sells tea to customers across the U.S.",
      "Americans drank about 86 billion servings of tea in 2024, according to the Tea Association of the U.S.A.. Almost all of that is imported since tea isn\u2019t grown in the U.S. at scale, due to factors ranging from climate to cost.",
      "McDonald imports loose-leaf tea from China, India, Kenya, Sri Lanka and other countries. She says her customer base is \u201cfrom all over the U.S. and the world.\" But she worries there is a limit to what they\u2019ll spend. Her premium teas can cost up to $33 for a 50-gram bag.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I can charge $75 for a 50-gram bag of tea, no matter how amazing that tea is,\u201d she said.",
      "McDonald understands Trump\u2019s rationale for wanting to use tariffs to spur U.S. manufacturing but says it doesn\u2019t apply to the tea industry.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t grow tea in the U.S. to the extent that we need. We can\u2019t just flip the industry and \u2018make tea great again\u2019 in America. It just can\u2019t happen,\u201d she said.",
      "Jim Umlauf\u2019s business, 4Knines, based in Oklahoma City, makes vehicle seat covers and cargo liners for dog owners and others. To do so, he needs raw materials such as fabric, coatings and components from China.",
      "Umlauf has explored manufacturing in countries other than China since 2018, when Trump first instituted a 25% tariff on goods from China, but has run into complications. In the meantime, 4Knines absorbs the extra cost, which Umlauf says has limited its growth and squeezed its margins.",
      "Now, the new tariffs make it nearly impossible to do business. The demand is there, but the company can\u2019t afford to bring over more products.",
      "\u201cWe only have a limited amount of inventory left, and without some relief, we\u2019ll run out soon,\u201d Umlauf said.",
      "As a small business owner who has worked hard to develop a high-quality brand, create jobs and contribute to the community, Umlauf is frustrated. He has tried to contact the White House and other decision-makers to ask for small business support. But he's gotten zero response.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time for policymakers to consider the full impact of trade policies not just on stock prices or global competitiveness, but on the real people running small businesses,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "A Texas judge has thrown out a federal rule that would have capped credit card late fees at $8",
      "NEW YORK -- A Texas judge earlier this month threw out a federal rule that would have capped credit card late fees at $8.",
      "The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau finalized the rule last year as part of the Biden administration's efforts to do away with what it called junk fees. It was paused by the courts before it could take effect.",
      "At the time, the CFPB estimated that American families would have saved more than $10 billion in late fees annually had the fees been capped at $8, significantly less than the $32 average.",
      "Banks and industry groups argued that the rule didn't allow card issuers to charge fees high enough to deter late payments and discourage repeat violations.",
      "The Texas judge's ruling earlier this month came a day after a collection of major industry groups and the CFPB under President Donald Trump announced that they had reached an agreement to throw out the rule.",
      "Here's what to know about credit card late fees:",
      "The average late fee for major issuers has steadily ticked up since the 2010s, going from $23 at the end of 2010 to $32 in 2022, according to the CFPB. WalletHub, which tracks financial data, found the average late fee in 2025 to be $30.50, with the maximum $41.",
      "A September 2023 Consumer Reports study estimated that 1 in 5 American adults, or about 52 million people, paid a credit card late fee in the previous year. People with lower incomes pay proportionately bigger fees, according to the CFPB, with the highest burden falling on communities of color and those living paycheck to paycheck.",
      "Enrolling in auto-pay for your credit cards can help you avoid making late payments, and there are some credit cards that don't charge late fees at all (though it's important to note that these cards may have other fee or penalty structures, or higher interest rates.)",
      "Citi Simplicity and the Apple card do not currently charge late fees, and Discover offers a card that will automatically waive the first late fee.",
      "It's also possible to appeal credit card late fees charged by your credit card company by calling them directly. The companies will often reverse the fees, especially if it's your first late payment.",
      "You may also want to consider making payments on your credit card balances during the month. That means you'll have paid more of the balance by the time the amount comes due, and keeping your balance low relative to your credit limit can improve your credit score.",
      "If you're having trouble making ends meet, you can ask your credit issuers about hardship programs. These are typically available to people affected by job loss, illness or medical conditions, natural disasters, or other emergencies.",
      "Concerned that credit card companies were building a business model based on high penalties, Congress passed the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act), which banned the companies from charging excessive late fees and established clearer disclosures and consumer protections.",
      "In 2010, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors voted to issue a regulation implementing the CARD Act, which said that banks could only charge fees to recover costs associated with late payment.",
      "However, the rule included an \u201cimmunity provision\u201d that let some banks charge $25 for the first late payment and $35 for subsequent late payments, adjusted for inflation each year. Those amounts subsequently grew to $30 and $41.",
      "After a review of market data, the CFPB finalized a rule that would have capped late fees at $8 and ended automatic inflation adjustments. Based on records analyzed by the CFPB, a late fee of $8 would be sufficient for card issuers, on average, to cover collection costs incurred as a result of late payments.",
      "Industry groups, including the Consumer Bankers Association, American Bankers Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and others, said they welcomed the court's decision eliminating the cap.",
      "The groups said that the rule would have led to higher interest rates and reduced credit access for card holders. The groups also said the rule would have \u201creduced important incentives for consumers to manage their finances.\u201d",
      "The CFPB has estimated that banks bring in roughly $14 billion in credit card late fees a year.",
      "Horacio M\u00e9ndez, president and CEO of Woodstock Institute, an organization for advancing economic equity, called the ruling a \u201cdevastating blow.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy tossing out the CFPB\u2019s common-sense rule to cap these predatory late fees \u2014 some as high as $41 \u2014 a federal judge is putting corporations over the lives of everyday consumers,\" he said. \u201cThe CFPB\u2019s rule was borne out of clear evidence: the credit card industry was using inflated late fees as a profit engine, forcing families with the least financial cushion to pay.\u201d",
      "M\u00e9ndez said that while consumers have come to expect fees for services, those fees needn't be punitive to be effective.",

And it threatens to hand Beijing more leverage in any eventual dialogue with the U.S. administration.",

      "Horror movies are often one-week wonders at the box office, but Ryan Coogler\u2019s\u201cSinners\u201d is defying the odds and proving to be true event cinema.",
      "In its second weekend in theaters, \u201cSinners\u201d earned $45 million in ticket sales from theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates Sunday. That\u2019s down a miniscule 6% from its Easter holiday launch, the smallest drop in any genre since \u201cAvatar\u201d in 2009. Worldwide, \u201cSinners\u201d has now made $161.6 million.",
      "For the industry, the showing proves the film's reach has broadened beyond horror fans to mainstream audiences wanting to see what the hype is about. Last weekend, men made up 56% of the audience. This weekend, the gender divide narrowed to 50/50. Premium large format showings, like the 70mm IMAX screens, are also a big draw. IMAX screens worldwide accounted for some 21% of the second weekend globally, a nearly 9% increase from last weekend.",
      "The original ensemble movie, starring Michael B. Jordan as twins, rode into theaters on a wave of great reviews. And, to be fair, \u201cSinners\u201d isn\u2019t simply a horror film: It blends elements of drama, action and musical into its southern gothic milieu.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one of the lowest second weekend holds for an overperforming wide release ever,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute phenomenon.\"",
      "Hollywood expects significant drop off in a movie's second week of release. Even a 50% dip is considered a solid number, baked into the movie math. When it's anything less than that, it's notable.",
      "\u201cYou can buy a great opening weekend with marketing, but if a movie doesn\u2019t have the goods, it\u2019ll drop off,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cThere's no greater barometer of success than a second weekend hold like this.\"",
      "The film was produced by Coogler\u2019s Proximity Media and Warner Bros., which handled the theatrical release. After some disappointments earlier in the year, it's the second major win for the studio after \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d helped energize the box office earlier this month.",
      "\u201cSinners\u201d easily topped the biggest new competition this week: \u201cThe Accountant 2,\u201d a sequel starring Ben Affleck and released by Amazon MGM Studios, which opened in third place with an estimated $24.5 million in its first weekend. Gavin O'Connor directed the film, which played in 3,610 theaters in North America. Audiences gave it a promising A- CinemaScore.",
      "The film that beat \u201cThe Accountant 2\u201d for second place was a 20-year-old Star Wars movie: \u201cRevenge of the Sith.\u201d The anniversary re-release took in an estimated $25.2 million over the weekend, with many sellouts reported, more than doubling last year\u2019s release of \u201cThe Phantom Menace.\u201d Internationally, it earned $17 million from 34 territories, giving it a $42.2 million global weekend. It's one of the top grossing re-releases ever.",
      "\u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d landed in fourth place with $22.7 million, bringing its domestic total to around $380 million.",
      "The scary video game adaptation \u201cUntil Dawn\u201d also opened this weekend to an estimated $8 million. Sony Pictures released the film, starring Ella Rubin and Michael Cimino, which has earned $18.1 million globally.",
      "The \u201cMinecraft\u201d and \u201cSinners\u201d wins have meant a huge boost for the April box office, which is up 102% from April 2024. The annual box office is also up over 10% from last year after running at a double-digit deficit in March. And this is all happening right before the industry\u2019s summer movie season kicks off on May 2 with Disney\u2019s \u201cThunderbolts(asterisk).\u201d",
      "\u201cThere cannot be a better opening act for the summer movie season than this weekend,\u201d Dergarabedian said.",

      "The U.S. coal industry has been in a steep decline for decades, and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has proposed several changes that would affect it",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- President Donald Trump's administration has proposed several changes that would affect the struggling U.S. coal industry.",
      "Trump issued executive orders this month to allow mining on federal land. He has used his emergency authority to allow some older coal-fired power plants set for retirement to keep producing electricity to meet the rising demand amid the growth in data centers, artificial intelligence and electric cars.",
      "The Republican president also granted nearly 70 older coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals.",
      "Trump's government efficiency team, run by Elon Musk, made plans earlier this year to terminate the leases of 34 U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration offices in 19 states.",
      "The coal industry once provided more than half of U.S. electricity production. But it has been in steep decline for decades as operators went out of business and utilities installed more renewable energy and converted coal-fired plants to be fueled by cheaper and cleaner-burning natural gas.",
      "U.S. coal production was at 1 billion tons (907,000 metric tons) in 2014 and fell to 578 million tons (524 million metric tons) by 2023, the latest year available, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "Coal employment nationally peaked in the 1920s when there were about 900,000 miners. It was at about 350,000 in 1950 and has declined steadily since 1980. After the coronavirus pandemic, employment rebounded from 2022 to 2023, rising 4.2% to 45,476. West Virginia employed the most miners at 14,000, followed by Kentucky at 5,000. About half of the nation\u2019s 560 coal mines are located in West Virginia (165) and Kentucky (112). Despite having just 15 mines, Wyoming was the highest-producing coal state due to mechanization and more accessible coal.",
      "Mining fatalities over the past four decades have dropped significantly. There have been 11 or fewer deaths in each of the past five years, according to MSHA.",
      "MSHA is responsible for enforcing U.S. mine safety laws. It is required to inspect each underground mine quarterly and each surface mine twice a year. The cuts proposed by Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency would require MSHA inspectors to travel farther to get to a mine, and that could mean less thorough inspections, said Jack Spadaro, a longtime mine safety investigator and environmental specialist who worked for that agency.",
      "According to the DOGE website, ending the MSHA leases is projected to save $18 million. It is unclear whether inspectors\u2019 positions and other jobs from those offices would be moved to other facilities.",
      "Seven of the MSHA offices set for closing are in Kentucky and four are in Pennsylvania. West Virginia is among the states with two targeted offices. Also under consideration for closure are the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement facilities in Lexington, Kentucky, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, shrinking the national footprint of an agency created during the Carter administration to restore land damaged by strip mining, and reclaim abandoned and damaged mine lands.",
      "A recent review of publicly available data by the Appalachian Citizens\u2019 Law Center indicates that nearly 17,000 health and safety inspections were conducted from the beginning of 2024 through February 2025 by MSHA staff in the facilities on the chopping block.",
      "Industry advocates have long contended that there are other uses for coal, some of which use cleaner technology.",
      "Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based Core Natural Resources is working to develop a process using West Virginia coal to create a synthetic material that can be used as an anode for lithium-ion batteries, reducing U.S. dependence on countries such as China, according to Matthew Mackowiak, the company\u2019s director of government affairs.",
      "Core recently acquired a company that turns coal into carbon foam that produces composite tooling used to make nose cones and plane wings for the U.S. defense industry.",
      "\u201cWhether or not there is any more coal-fired generation in the future, obviously that\u2019s something else to talk about in the future,\u201d Mackowiak said. \u201cBut at the very least, we need to be focused on maintaining our current coal fleet.\u201d",

      "FAYETTEVILLE, W.Va. -- The winner of this year's West Virginia Coal Festival teen beauty pageant walks among the ruins of a community abandoned 70 years ago and imagines the rusted remains of coal tipples and processing plants coming back to life.",
      "Ava Johnson knows West Virginia coal will not ever be what it once was. But as she makes her way along overgrown railroad tracks near the abandoned Kay Moor mine in the New River Gorge National Park looking for spikes for her collection, the 16-year-old history buff says she has heard people talking with hope about the future of an industry that has brought good-paying jobs to her state for the better part of two centuries.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t appreciate being a true West Virginian unless you realize that people risk their lives every single day to make ours better,\u201d she said.",
      "Much of that renewed sense of hope is based on the actions of President Donald Trump, who earlier this month issued new executive orders aimed at reviving an energy source that has long been flagged by scientists as the world's most polluting fossil fuel, one that directly contributes to the warming of the planet.",
      "Trump, who has pledged since his first run for the presidency in 2016 to \u201csave coal,\u201d issued orders to allow mining on federal land and to loosen some emissions standards meant to curb coal\u2019s environmental impact.",
      "\u201cAll those plants that have been closed are going to be opened, if they're modern enough,\u201d Trump said at the signing ceremony. \u201c(or) they\u2019ll be ripped down and brand-new ones will be built.\u201d",
      "The news was met with enthusiasm in West Virginia, where residents like Johnson say the coal industry is misunderstood and that they are tired of feeling unheard by their fellow Americans. But others do not think Trump will be able to fulfill promises he has made to some of his most loyal constituents.",
      "Trump and his allies are \u201cspinning a false narrative,\" said Tyson Slocum, who teaches energy and climate policy at the University of Maryland Honors College and is the energy program director for the nonprofit Public Citizen. He said market forces have shifted away from coal in ways that cannot be reversed, an opinion widely shared among economists.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that Trump can do that\u2019s going to materially impact the domestic coal market,\u201d Slocum said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe energy markets, the steel markets, have fundamentally changed. And learning how to adapt and how to provide the real solutions to the concerns and fears in coal communities would be a more effective strategy than promising them a return that isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d",
      "That was not the prevailing mood at a recent coal exposition in Charleston, attended by Johnson and many others who found encouragement in the Republican president's words, even if some expressed skepticism about his ability to make coal great again.",
      "\u201cFor years, our industry has felt like it\u2019s been a little bit of a whipping boy, like a political, sacrificial pawn,\u201d said Steven Tate of Viacore, a company that makes an apparatus that helps mine operators limit the amount of coal dust in a mine. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re finally starting to get the recognition that our industry deserves.\u201d",
      "Some said Trump's orders demonstrated respect for workers who gave their lives in the mines \u2014 21,000 in West Virginia, the most out of any state \u2014 and for a resource that helped build America.",
      "\u201cTrump stood his ground all the way through,\" said Jimbo Clendenin, a retired mine equipment specialist whose grandson started working in coal mining three years ago. \"He said he was for coal. And a lot of people \u2014 even a couple of them here in West Virginia \u2014 said, \u2019I just think he said that to get into office.\u2032",
      "\"Now, nobody\u2019s got any doubt. He\u2019s for coal.\u201d",
      "In recent decades, the Democratic Party\u2019s aggressive push toward clean energy led to the installation of more renewable energy and the conversion of coal-fired plants to be fueled by cheaper and cleaner-burning natural gas.",
      "In 2016, Trump seized on the issue, promising to end what he described as Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cwar on coal\u201d and to save miners\u2019 jobs. It helped in West Virginia, where a majority of voters in every county supported Trump in three presidential elections.",
      "Trump did not bring the industry back during his first term. In West Virginia, which employs the most miners of any state, the number of coal jobs fell from 11,561 at the start of his presidency to 11,418 at the end of 2020, perhaps slowing coal\u2019s steep decline but not stopping it.",
      "Slocum said Trump can defang the federal Environmental Protection Agency and deregulate mining, but he cannot save coal.",
      "\u201cIt's not the EPA, it\u2019s not Democrats that declared this war on coal,\u201d Slocum said. \u201cIt was capitalism and natural gas. And being honest about the reasons for coal\u2019s decline is the least we can do for coal-dependent communities instead of lying to them, which the Trump administration is doing. Sometimes people want to believe a lie, because it\u2019s easier than facing a hard truth.\u201d",
      "In 2009, the EPA found that planet-warming greenhouse gases put public health and welfare in danger, a determination that new EPA chief Lee Zeldin has urged Trump to reconsider. Scientists oppose Zeldin\u2019s push, and Slocum said the endangerment finding and the need to move away from coal dependence \u201cis not a theoretical debate. It is a factual, scientific one, albeit one that does not occur within the current Trump administration.\u201d",
      "Still, there is no doubt that the culture of coal is woven into the fabric of West Virginia. A miner can be a coal industry worker, but also a sports team mascot, an image emblazoned on the state flag or the name of a breakfast sandwich at Tudor\u2019s Biscuit World.",
      "In the 1950s, more than 130,000 West Virginians worked in the industry, which then had a population of around 2 million. Production peaked in 2008, a year before Johnson was born. But by then, the number of coal workers had dropped to 25,000, mostly due to mechanization.",
      "Heather Clay, who runs West Virginia Coal Festival\u2019s beauty pageant and social media, said losing coal jobs \u2014 often six-figure incomes \u2014 was especially significant in a state with one of the nation\u2019s highest poverty rates.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so much more than what people outside of West Virginia understand,\u201d she said. \u2019They\u2019re always saying, \u2018Shut down coal,\u2019 \u2018Shut down coal.\u2019 So you want to shut down our economy? You want to shut down our families? You want to shut down our way of life? And it has, for a lot of people.\u201d",
      "Trump and coal industry advocates say keeping coal in the U.S. energy portfolio is essential for maintaining the power grid, servicing growing demand from innovations like artificial intelligence centers and keeping America energy-independent.",
      "But John Deskins, director of the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research, said it would take a significant shift in the underlying economics for it to make financial sense for utilities to build new coal-fired plants.",
      "Natural gas is cleaner and cheaper, he said, and it\u2019s the direction most utilities are moving in. Earlier this year, First Energy announced plans to convert its two remaining coal-fired power plants to natural gas.",
      "Johnson wears the sash and crown from her pageant victory over a black dress and sneakers as she traipses through the ruins of the abandoned Kay Moor mine. She talks enthusiastically about the industry's past, but also, occasionally, about what she thinks could be a brighter future for coal in West Virginia because of what Trump has done.",
      "\u201cI think that it will positively impact not just the industry,\" she said, \u201cbut people's lives.\u201d",

      "Among fund giant Vanguard\u2019s nearly 5 million accounts, for example, the average investor puts three-quarters of their savings in stocks. Even older investors are still heavily steeped in equities: People 55 to 64 have 64% in stocks at Vanguard; those 65 and older have 49% in stocks.",

    "story": [
      "South Korea\u2019s main liberal opposition party has tapped its former leader Lee Jae-myung as presidential candidate in the June 3 vote",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Lee Jae-myung, a liberal who wants greater economic parity in South Korea and warmer ties with North Korea, became the main opposition party's presidential candidate Sunday, solidifying his position as front-runner to succeed recently ousted conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol.",
      "The former Democratic Party chief had led the opposition-controlled parliament\u2019s impeachment of Yoon over the imposition of martial law in December. The country's Constitutional Court formally dismissed Yoon earlier this month, prompting an early presidential election on June 3 to find a new president.",
      "In a nationally televised announcement, the Democratic Party announced that Lee won its presidential nomination with nearly 90% of the votes cast during the primary that ended Sunday, defeating two competitors.",
      "\"Now, the people and our party colleagues gave me an opportunity to win back the presidency and build a new, real Republic of Korea. Thank you! I\u2019ll humbly uphold that ardent, serious task,\u201d Lee said in a victory speech.",
      "Lee, 60, who served as the governor of South Korea\u2019s most populous Gyeonggi province and a mayor of Seongnam city, is the clear favorite to win the election.",
      "In a Gallup Korea poll released on Friday, 38% of respondents chose Lee as their preferred choice, while all other aspirants obtained single-digit ratings. The main conservative People Power Party will nominate its candidate next weekend. Its four presidential hopefuls competing to win the party ticket won a combined 23% of support ratings in the Gallup survey.",
      "It will be Lee's third bid to run for president. He lost the 2022 election to Yoon in the narrowest margin in the country\u2019s presidential elections. In 2017, Lee ranked third in a Democratic Party primary.",
      "Lee has long established an image as an anti-establishment figure who can eliminate deep-rooted inequality and corruption in South Korea. But his critics view him as a populist who relies on stoking divisions and demonizing opponents and worry his rule would likely further polarize the country.",
      "Lee currently faces five trials for corruption and other criminal charges. If he becomes president, those trials will likely stop as he will enjoy special presidential immunity from most criminal charges.",
      "Lee's rise comes as conservatives are struggling to win back public confidence in the wake of Yoon's martial law decree that plunged the country into turmoil. The People Power Party is grappling with internal feuding between senior members defending Yoon\u2019s action and reformist members who voted for his impeachment.",
      "\u201cThis election is a venue where the people hand down their judgment on Yoon\u2019s martial law imposition after the Constitutional Court issued a judicial judgment on it,\u201d said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. \u201cIt\u2019s subsequently difficult for the People Power Party to win the election if they slide over the martial law issue and fail to apologize.\u201d",
      "When Yoon declared martial law and sent troops to the National Assembly, Lee livestreamed as he went to the assembly and urged people to gather there to protect lawmakers from possible arrests. Lee and others managed to enter an assembly hall to vote down Yoon's decree, forcing him to lift it.",
      "Lee has recently made few comments that could be portrayed as too radical and has focused on ways to revive the economy, ease economic polarization and overcome a national divide.",
      "\u201cRestoring democracy is the path to national unity. Reviving economic growth is the path to national unity. Narrowing the gaps between us is the path to national unity,\u201d Lee said during Sunday's speech.",
      "On foreign policy, Lee has underscored the importance of a trilateral South Korea-U.S.-Japan security partnership. But he's also called for healing badly frayed ties with North Korea, saying peace can drive South Korea's economic growth.",
      "In a recent online talk show, Lee said that he thinks the U.S. would pursue better ties with North Korea as a way to contain China and that such a stance would provide South Korea with diplomatic room to restore ties with the North.",

      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Iowa's governor on Friday sued the Des Moines Register over the newspaper's open records request, asking the court to validate her office's withholding of certain emails she claims are protected.",
      "A Register reporter submitted a records request in February to Gov. Kim Reynolds' office, according to the complaint. In response, the Republican governor's office provided 825 pages of relevant documents and withheld four emails, asserting they were protected because they were \u201cintended to be confidential, and disclosure would inhibit the governor's ability to receive candid, fulsome, and robust information in the future,\" according to the office's response included in filings.",
      "An attorney followed up on the Register's behalf last week, according to court filings, arguing that so-called executive privilege is not an exemption in Iowa's open records law and, even if it was, there was no indication the governor sent or received the emails. The attorney, Susan P. Elgin, called the withholding \u201clegally indefensible\u201d and asked the records be produced in a week's time.",
      "Instead, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird sued Friday to ask the court to intervene, as Iowa law allows, and force the Register to halt its pursuit of the records. The Associated Press emailed Elgin Friday requesting comment. The Register's parent company, Gannett Co., said in an email it does not comment on pending litigation.",
      "In a statement, the governor's office said it was unfortunate that public resources would be used to defend the governor's withholding of the records.",
      "\u201cIt is in the public\u2019s interest that governors can receive candid advice from their closest advisors,\u201d said spokesperson Mason Mauro.",
      "In 2023, the Iowa Supreme Court rejected Reynolds\u2019 request that the court throw out a records-related lawsuit filed against her by the liberal-leaning Bleeding Heartland blog, Iowa Capital Dispatch and Iowa Freedom of Information Council, a nonprofit that focuses on open government issues. The organizations and some of their reporters sued accusing Reynolds of violating the state\u2019s open records law by ignoring records requests and not producing records in a timely manner.",
      "The Register, along with the newspaper's parent company and their former pollster, also is named in a suit filed by President Donald Trump, Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and former Iowa state Sen. Brad Zaun.",

      "GENEVA -- The Swiss president says Switzerland is among 15 countries with which the United States plans to conduct \u201cprivileged\u201d negotiations to help reach a deal in the wake of sweeping U.S. tariffs on dozens of countries that have shaken global markets.",
      "Karin Keller-Sutter, in an interview with broadcaster SRF published Friday, said she was \u201csatisfied\u201d with talks in Washington this week that included an International Monetary Fund conference and her one-on-one meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Keller-Sutter also serves as Switzerland\u2019s finance minister.",
      "\u201cThe United States has defined a group of 15 countries with which it wants to find ... a quick solution in this tariff question. Switzerland is part of this group of these 15 countries,\u201d she told reporters separately late Thursday in Washington.",
      "It was not immediately clear which 14 other countries were included, but she told SRF that \u201cthe U.S. envisages conducting \u2014 I would say somewhat privileged \u2014 negotiations and finding solutions\u201d with that group.",
      "Before the Trump administration paused some of its most stringent tariff plans, products imported from Switzerland had been set to face tariffs of 31% \u2014 more than the 20% tariffs on goods from the European Union. Switzerland is not a member of the 27-country bloc.",
      "According to figures published by the Swiss Embassy in Washington, the U.S. has been Switzerland\u2019s most important goods export market worldwide since 2021, while Switzerland is the fourth most important export market for U.S. services. The bilateral trade volume in goods and services between Switzerland and the U.S. reached a total of $185.9 billion in 2023, the embassy says on its website.",
      "Keller-Sutter said a memorandum of understanding was to be drawn up after which negotiations can begin. A document would also lay out the most important topics, and \u201cwe have also been assigned a specific contact person. This is not easy in the U.S. administration,\u201d she was quoted as saying.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. authorities have clearly expressed their desire to find a solution with Switzerland,\u201d Keller-Sutter told SRF. She said no timetable had been set, but the two sides agreed to move forward quickly \u201cbecause uncertainty is poison for the economy.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s sweeping \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs on April 2 set off turmoil in world stock markets. A week later, Trump spoke by phone with Keller-Sutter in a conversation that her office said focused on tariffs. She emphasized the \u201cimportant role of Swiss companies and investments\" in the U.S.",
      "Hours later, Trump announced the U-turn that paused the steep new tariffs on about 60 countries for 90 days, fanning speculation \u2014 which was not confirmed \u2014 in some Swiss media that her chat with Trump might have played a role in the change of course.",
      "On Thursday, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis, during a trip to Beijing, said the U.S. tariffs have thrust the affected countries into \u201ca sort of coalition\u201d to try to reach a deal with the United States. And on Monday, Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Roche announced plans to invest $50 billion in the U.S. over the next five years \u2014 an unspecified amount of which has already been under way.",

      "Prosecutors allege that Moon, who served as president from 2017-2022, received bribes totaling 217 million won ($151,000) from Lee Sang-jik, founder of the budget carrier Thai Eastar Jet. The bribes were allegedly in the form of financial support for Moon\u2019s son-in-law between 2018-2020.",

      "Cleveland left no doubt on its way to Round 2 \u2014 and finished off the most lopsided series in NBA playoff history",
      "MIAMI -- Cleveland moved into Round 2 with the most lopsided series win in NBA playoff history.",
      "Donovan Mitchell scored 22 points, De\u2019Andre Hunter added 19 and the Cavaliers led by as many as 60 points before beating the Miami Heat 138-83 on Monday night to sweep their Eastern Conference first-round series in four games.",
      "Ty Jerome had 18 points, Evan Mobley added 17 and Jarrett Allen had 14 points, 12 rebounds and six steals for the Cavaliers. Cleveland won the series by a combined 122 points, one more than the previous record for series margin set by Denver over New Orleans in 2009.",
      "\u201cWe came out here with a goal in mind,\" Mitchell said.",
      "The 55-point margin in Game 4 was the fourth-biggest playoff win ever. The record is 58 points, done twice: Minneapolis over St. Louis in 1956 and Denver over New Orleans in 2009. The Los Angeles Lakers beat Golden State by 56 points in 1973.",
      "Nikola Jovic led the Heat with 24 points. Ban Adebayo scored 13, while Pelle Larsson and Andrew Wiggins each added 12 for Miami.",
      "\u201cDamn, it was humbling. This series was humbling. These last two games were embarrassing,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cBut Cleveland's also a very good team. ... They showed us why we weren't ready for that.\u201d",
      "Cleveland will play either Indiana or Milwaukee in the Eastern Conference semifinals. The Pacers lead that series 3-1; regardless of whether the Pacers or Bucks advance, Game 1 of that series would be in Cleveland and not played until Saturday at the earliest.",
      "\u201cI'm always a big fan of rest,\u201d Mitchell said.",
      "This is the third instance of Miami being swept in a best-of-seven series. The others: against Chicago in 2007 and against Milwaukee in 2021, both of those in the first round and both also ending on the Heat home floor.",
      "It was over fast. Cleveland \u2014 which used a 33-5 early run to blow Game 3 open \u2014 led 43-14 late in the first quarter before Davion Mitchell beat the buzzer with a 3-pointer. The 26-point margin matched the worst quarter in Heat playoff history; it was the second-best margin for any quarter in Cavs playoff history.",
      "And the lead only kept growing.",
      "It looked every bit like a 64-win team that led the East wire-to-wire going up against a 10th-place finisher that needed to win two play-in games just to get into the tournament.",
      "\u201cWe came down here with the right mentality and again, our maturity, our leadership, all that stuff we've been talking about all year,\u201d Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson said. \u201cWe don't seem to have letdowns. That's rare.\u201d",
      "Cleveland\u2019s lead was 39 \u2014 72-33 \u2014 at the half, the third-largest lead after two quarters in NBA playoff history. The only halftime leads bigger than that: Cleveland by 41 over Boston on May 19, 2017 and Detroit by 40 over Washington on April 26, 1987.",

    "summary": "It&rsquo;s not often that the 144th overall pick is the biggest story of the NFL draft",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s not often that the 144th overall pick is the biggest story of the NFL draft",
      "It's not often that the 144th overall pick is the biggest story of the NFL draft.",
      "But Shedeur Sanders was not the usual 144th pick and his situation transcended football. The narrative around Sanders blurred lines between sports, race and culture.",
      "The former University of Colorado quarterback was the center of a three-day spectacle of cringe that will live in football lore for a long time. Sanders fell from a potential top-five overall selection on Thursday to the fifth round on Saturday in an excruciating slide that had his supporters fuming and detractors laughing.",
      "The Cleveland Browns finally ended Sanders' misery with the No. 144 selection, adding the 23-year-old to a crowded quarterback room that includes Joe Flacco, Kenny Pickett, fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel and the injured Deshaun Watson.",
      "Five quarterbacks were selected in this year's draft before Sanders, including Gabriel and No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward, who went to the Tennessee Titans.",
      "Sanders \u2014 the son of Pro Football Hall of Famer and Colorado coach Deion Sanders \u2014 has been among the biggest stories in college football over the past four years, first at Jackson State and then with the Buffaloes. The quarterback's play on the field, and occasionally brash personality on and off it, have made him one of the sport's lightning rods.",
      "Below, The Associated Press examines some of the potential reasons for Sanders' free fall, using the QB's own words, his father's comments, the analysis of pundits and his on-the-field performance.",
      "WHAT THE SANDERS SAID: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to understand, when that last name is on your back, you\u2019re going to be attacked and ridiculed by naysayers,\u201d Colorado coach Deion Sanders said.",
      "From Shedeur Sanders: \u201cI\u2019m going to just be myself so you either like it or you don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "WHAT OTHERS SAID: The younger Sanders carries himself with supreme confidence \u2014 much like his father did when he was a two-sport start in the NFL and Major League Baseball in the 1990s. But some pundits who cover the league (usually using anonymous sources) said Sanders\u2019 confidence could annoy NFL personnel, particularly during the interview process at the league\u2019s combine. The elder Sanders was occasionally outspoken on social media about his son\u2019s talent, taking on critics.",
      "\u201cAll of these things began to add up for teams, and I\u2019m not saying that is right that it added up for teams, but it did, clearly, add up for teams. ... This is clearly a way for the NFL and its teams to let him and anyone else after him know \u2014 you can\u2019t comport yourself in this way moving forward,\u201d said Jonathan Jones, an NFL analyst for CBS.",
      "WHAT SANDERS DID: The younger Sanders might be brash \u2014 he set up a customized room for draft night \u2014 but he reportedly maintained a 3.9 GPA at Colorado and was never involved in any off-field incidents that would point to serious character concerns.",
      "READING BETWEEN THE LINES: J. Kenyatta Cavil, the interim dean of education and sports studies at Texas Southern University, said the pushback when it came to Sanders was not a surprise.",
      "Cavil said Deion and Shedeur Sanders did a remarkable job of controlling the younger Sanders\u2019 career, moving from a private high school to Jackson State to Colorado. That proved to be a problem.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s unique in this dichotomy, is you have a coach and a son, for a period of time, who could control the space,\u201d Cavil said, later adding: \u201cThey had this ability to transform spaces that allowed them to be their unique and authentic self, which is not always acceptable in the social structure.\u201d",
      "WHAT HIS SUPPORTERS SAID: \u201cThis is a guy who\u2019s extremely accurate. He\u2019s extremely mobile. He has a lot of mental horsepower. He played the game at a high level,\" said former NFL player and front-office executive Louis Riddick, now an ESPN analyst.",
      "WHAT OTHERS SAID: The main criticisms against Sanders\u2019 football skills are that he takes too many sacks, isn\u2019t overly athletic and doesn\u2019t have great arm strength. He had opportunities during the pre-draft process to address those concerns but didn't always take advantage of opportunities to work out for scouts.",
      "\u201cFor a player who had a variety of questions, both about the talent level, how he would fit into an NFL system, how he would adjust from his play style in college, but also about the potential culture shock of for the first time playing for someone who is not his father, there were opportunities that Shedeur Sanders could have taken there,\" NFL Network's Tom Pelissero said. \u201cHe seemed to feel he was an elite category where he could choose the few teams he wanted to go to.\u201d",
      "WHAT SANDERS DID: Sanders had a productive four seasons in college and finished his career with 50 games played in four seasons \u2014 two at Jackson State and two at Colorado. He completed more than 70% of his passes for 14,353 yards and 134 touchdowns with 27 interceptions. He finished eighth in last year's Heisman Trophy voting while teammate Travis Hunter won the award. Hunter was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars with the No. 2 overall pick.",
      "READING BETWEEN THE LINES: It's not uncommon for a good college quarterback to be overlooked, even with great stats, because of concerns ranging from size to speed to arm strength. Famously, seven-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback Tom Brady was the 199th overall pick out of Michigan in 2000 before embarking on one of the most successful careers in NFL history. But none of those overlooked quarterbacks had transcended the football world the way Shedeur Sanders had during his college career.",
      "WHAT SHEDEUR SANDERS SAID: Despite the embarrassing draft free fall \u2014 which included a prank call orchestrated by the son of an Atlanta Falcons coach and President Donald Trump weighing in \u2014 Sanders will have a chance to prove his worth in the NFL. His first chance is with the Browns, who have added multiple quarterbacks in the offseason in an effort to find a long-term solution.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m truly thankful to have, is the opportunity for people to actually see the real me and not be able to see stuff that could be true or not,\" Sanders said.",
      "WHAT OTHERS SAID: Browns general manager Andrew Berry traded up in the draft to land Sanders after he fell to the fifth round, feeling any possible problems were worth the risk.",
      "\u201cWe felt like he was a good, solid prospect at the most important position. We felt like it got to a point where he was probably mispriced relative to the draft. Really, the acquisition cost was pretty light, and it\u2019s a guy that we think can outproduce his draft slot.",
      "READING BETWEEN THE LINES: Cavil \u2014 the Texas Southern interim dean \u2014 said he expects the news cycle will move quickly and Sanders will have something of a reprieve until the Browns' training camp begins in the summer. In the meantime, more will come out about the quarterback's draft free fall. What really matters is how he performs from this point forward.",
      "\u201cA year from now, for the rest of his career, whatever success he has or doesn't, people will come back to this point,\u201d Cavil said. \u201cIt'll be a story of overcoming all these obstacles or somebody that couldn't get it done.\"",

      "The Bucks announced the severity of Lillard's injury after he had an MRI on Monday.",
      "The injury knocks Lillard out for the rest of the postseason and could put his status for next season in doubt as well. When Kevin Durant tore his Achilles tendon in the 2019 NBA Finals, he ended up missing the entire 2019-20 season.",

      "Lillard\u2019s injury occurred in his third game since coming back from deep vein thrombosis in his right calf.",
      "\u201cThis is a tough one, honestly,\u201d Bucks coach Doc Rivers said after Sunday\u2019s game. \u201cBlood clot, followed by this. It\u2019s just tough. That\u2019s why you have teammates and family around him. He\u2019s just such a great freaking dude, on a basketball level, but more importantly as a teammate and a father and all that stuff.\u201d",
      "Lillard, 34, was behind the 3-point line around the top of the key midway through the first quarter when the ball bounced toward him. Lillard used his left hand to tip the ball toward teammate Gary Trent Jr., then went down and grabbed the lower part of his left leg. He continued to sit on the floor as play resumed on the other end of the court.",

It\u2019s hard being in his position. He\u2019s one of the toughest, mentally toughest guys I\u2019ve ever been around. That\u2019s why he is who he is.\u201d",
      "Lillard ranked 10th in the NBA in scoring (24.9) and 10th in assists (7.1) this season while earning his 10th All-Star Game selection. He made an extraordinarily rapid return from his deep vein thrombosis to rejoin his teammates for the playoffs.",
      "While talking to reporters before the playoffs, Lillard said doctors had told him his case was unusual.",
      "\u201cThey were just like, \u2018We don\u2019t see this,\u2019\" Lillard said then. \u201cFor me, I was just like, it was a different experience for me because I went in there a bunch of times and it was the same size. So I\u2019m like, it didn\u2019t seem that special, and then it just reached a point where it just got a lot smaller out of nowhere.\u201d",

      "Lillard's situation continues the Bucks' run of bad luck with postseason injuries since winning their 2021 title.",
      "Khris Middleton missed an entire seven-game Eastern Conference semifinal loss to Boston in 2022 with a sprained medial collateral ligament. Antetokounmpo bruised his lower back in Milwaukee\u2019s first playoff game in 2023 and didn\u2019t return until Game 4 of a first-round series it lost 4-1 to Miami.

      "Saints quarterback Derek Carr has stated publicly for the first time that he has a shoulder injury",
      "METAIRIE, La. -- Saints quarterback Derek Carr stated publicly for the first time that he has a shoulder injury, but stopped short of disclosing any specifics about how or when it happened, or how it might affect his availability to play during the coming season.",
      "\u201cI hate that I have to say this, but I have to say this: Yes, I have a shoulder injury,\u201d Carr said while delivering a guest sermon at a church in Las Vegas on Sunday.",
      "\u201cI have an MRI report to prove it,\u201d Carr continued. \"The team knows about it. We\u2019ve been in constant communication. There\u2019s nothing wrong. We\u2019re figuring it out and we\u2019re going to go forward with that. Is that OK?\"",
      "\u201cI've been dealing with people lying about me ... and I'm like, \u2018Lord, why do I have to continue to deal with this nonsense?\u201d Carr continued. \"You never know what someone's really going through. And so why do we continually try to attack people \u2014 and I would say attack people that are maybe trying to do things the right way?\"",
      "Carr's sermon took place two days after the Saints used their second-round pick \u2014 the 40th overall \u2014 in this year's NFL draft, to select Louisville quarterback Tyler Shough.",
      "The Saints picked Shough two days after the club's general manager, Mickey Loomis, acknowledged publicly that Carr has \u201can issue\u201d with his shoulder about which the Saints are seeking more \u201cclarity.\u201d",
      "The issue first arose when NFL.com, citing an anonymous source, reported on April 11 that Carr might need shoulder surgery which could cause him to miss part or all of the upcoming season.",
      "The report did not state which shoulder Carr injured or how he injured it. Carr\u2019s agent, Timothy Younger, did not return multiple messages from The Associated Press about the matter. And until Wednesday, the Saints had not addressed it, either.",
      "Likewise, Loomis has declined to say when he first learned of the injury or explain his understanding of how it happened.",
      "Car, who is 14-13 in two seasons as a Saints starter, injured the AC joint in his throwing shoulder in 2023, but never missed a game because of it. Carr missed seven games in 2024, but because of oblique and hand injuries.",
      "The Saints\u2019 injury reports last season did not mention any issues with Carr\u2019s shoulder, and when he played, he had multiple downfield completions that went for 50 or more yards.",
      "But as Carr entered the third year of his four-year Saints contract, doubt surrounded his long-term future with the club because of a coaching change, his inconsistent play and apparent fan discontent.",
      "Carr was signed during the tenure of previous coach Dennis Allen, who was fired last season. The new coach is former Philadelphia offensive coordinator Kellen Moore, who is installing a new offense.",

      "A 14-year-old wunderkind has the cricket world in raptures after scoring an electrifying 35-ball century in the Indian Premier League.",
      "Vaibhav Suryavanshi broke all sorts of batting records in Twenty20 cricket during the IPL game in Jaipur on Monday night.",
      "The precocious batter seemed destined for stardom when he went to Rajasthan Royals during the IPL auction last year at the age of 13. He hit a six with the first ball he faced in the tournament. It took Suryavanshi just three games in the sport\u2019s richest, ritziest league to grab global attention as he smashed 11 sixes and seven fours in his breathtaking 101.",
      "Now he\u2019s the real thing. He plundered all those boundaries against an experienced Gujarat Titans bowling attack with a combined 694 games of international experience.",
      "Suryavanshi\u2019s fearless hitting stunned Rashid Khan, Ishant Sharma, Washington Sundar, Prasidh Krishna, Karim Janat, Mohammed Siraj and Sai Kishore, who have carried Gujarat to six victories in nine IPL games this season.",
      "Rajasthan, which won the inaugural edition of IPL in 2008, has a history of nurturing cricketing talent. Suryavanshi was born a year after Yousuf Pathan hit the then fastest century in IPL in 2010 off 37 balls for Rajasthan against Mumbai Indians.",
      "Pathan was quick to congratulate the youngster for breaking his record for fastest IPL hundred by an Indian.",
      "\u201cEven more special to see it happen while playing for ( rajasthanroyals ), just like I did. There\u2019s truly something magical about this franchise for youngsters,\" Pathan posted on X. \"Long way to go, champ.\u201d",
      "Royals batting coach Vikram Rathore knew what Suryavanshi was capable of doing at top level cricket after watching him practice a few months ago, and quickly figured it was important to nurture him.",
      "\u201cTo do it in front of this kind of crowd and in a situation like this against a really, really good bowling attack, I think it was really special and a lot of credit to him,\u201d Rathore said. \u201cHe has a solid head on his his shoulders. Today was an extraordinary innings.\u201d",
      "Rathore was careful, though, not to pile too much pressure on his young star by comparing him with the great Sachin Tendulkar.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say that and it\u2019s unfair I think on the kid to compare him to Sachin Tendulkar,\" he told the post-game news conference. \"As I said he\u2019s a new Vaibhav Suryavansh. He\u2019s a special kid and he\u2019s a special talent. If he keeps working hard he\u2019ll have a special place in Indian cricket I\u2019m sure.\u201d",
      "Tendulkar, who transformed from teenage talent into an iconic figure and the leading international scorer in the sport, was impressed with Suryavanshi's innings.",
      "The cricket fraternity, including stars from other IPL franchises, praised the talent of the youngest player to score a century in a professional T20 league, and the second-fastest in the history of the IPL.",
      "\u201cWitnessed this carnage of an innings by this youngster. Absolutely insane!\u201d Suryakumar Yadav of Mumbai Indians posted on X.",
      "Former India batter Yuvraj Singh was impressed with the fearless attitude of Suryavanshi.",
      "\u201cWhat were you doing at 14? This kid is taking on the best bowlers in the world without blinking an eyelid!\u201d Yuvraj posted to his 6.4 million followers on X. \u201cVaibhav Suryavanshi -- remember the name! Playing with a fearless attitude Proud to see the next generation shine!\u201d",
      "With the likes of Rahul Dravid and Rathore around him at Rajasthan, Suryavanshi could easily be fast tracked into international cricket.",
      "IPL commentator and ex-West Indies international cricket Ian Bishop said Suryavanshi needs to be surrounded by the right people so that he doesn\u2019t fade out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented, 14 years old. This is new territory,\" Bishop said. \"The scrutiny on him when he plays the next game, and if he doesn\u2019t score any runs, you know, there are going to be detractors out there \u2026 this kid is going to be tested.",
      "\"His parents are going to have to be so close to him, and hopefully \u2014 I'm sure they are great parents \u2014 you\u2019ve got to surround this kid with proper people for the next five years to ensure this high that he\u2019s got so early in his career, there isn\u2019t a drop.\u201d",
      "Suryavanshi made his first class debut for Bihar in northeast India in January 2024.",
      "\u201cVaibhav has shown the world the immense talent that lies hidden in the soil of Bihar,\u201d his father Sanjeev Suryavanshi said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cToday, Bihar stands tall with pride. Our entire family and people across Bihar are overjoyed by this accomplishment.\u201d",

      "Wyatt Johnston scored 9 seconds in for the quickest goal ever to start a playoff game for the Dallas Stars",
      "DALLAS -- Wyatt Johnston scored the quickest goal ever to start a playoff game for the Dallas Stars, who had a well-timed immediate response back at home in their first-round series against the Colorado Avalanche.",
      "Wyatt Johnston scored 9 seconds into Game 5, then added another goal and an assist for the Stars in a 6-2 win Monday night to take a 3-2 series lead.",
      "\u201cWe did probably our best job generating chances tonight and it showed. ... Just a huge win,\u201d Johnston said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not surprised by our response. We\u2019ve got a proud group,\u201d said coach Pete DeBoer, whose team lost 4-0 in Game 4 on the road two nights earlier. \u201cThe last game, we played a poor game. It happens. In a seven-game series you're going to have a night where you're off. And we were off and we owned it and we fixed it, and we responded.\u201d",
      "Mikko Rantanen, who was with the Avalanche in the playoffs the past seven seasons, scored his first postseason goal and had two assists for the Stars as they took a 3-2 series lead.",
      "\"We knew as the top guys we needed to step up a little bit and play a little bit better defensively and try to get on the scoresheet a little bit more,\" Rantanen said.",
      "Game 6 is Thursday night in Colorado, where the Stars clinched their second-round series last season.",
      "After Artturi Lehkonen and Nathan MacKinnon scored 2 1/2 minutes apart for the Avs in the second period to get them to 3-2, Johnston scored on a power play that included a secondary assist from Rantanen.",
      "Mason Marchment restored Dallas' three-goal lead before the end of the second period when he deflected Alexander Petrovic's long slap shot past goalie Mackenzie Blackwood.",
      "Dallas goalie Jake Oettinger stopped 27 shots.",
      "Blackwood, who allowed only seven goals the first four games, gave up five on 18 shots before Scott Wedgewood took over in net to start the third period. Wedgewood, who was Oettinger's backup the past two seasons, had eight saves.",
      "Johnston's record-setting starter goal came off the opening faceoff, when he shot from the immediate left of the net. The 21-year-old forward already in his 43rd career playoff game was skating toward the back wall and passing the red line when he took the shot that ricocheted off Blackwood.",
      "\u201cI just saw just a little opening,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cFigured why not, let\u2019s try it. Got lucky.\u201d",
      "It was the first goal this postseason for Johnston, and his third multigoal playoff game.",
      "The previous fastest goal to start a Stars playoff game came when Jeff Halpern scored 24 seconds into Game 2 of a first-round series against Vancouver on April 13, 2007.",
      "Johnston became just the eighth player in NHL history to score within the first 9 seconds of a playoff game. The record is still held by Don Kozak for the Los Angeles Kings, who scored 6 seconds into a game against Boston on April 17, 1977.",
      "Dallas had led only 62 seconds in the first four games, which included two four-goal losses and back-to-back overtime wins in Games 2 and 3.",
      "\u201cI think we answered really well. It\u2019s also big to start the way we did,\u201d Rantanen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier when you play with a lead, and I think that was our first lead for a while in the series. So it\u2019s a key factor.\u201d",
      "Then in the final minute of the first period, Johnston got the assist on Thomas Harley's goal that Blackwood initially blocked with his right arm. But the puck popped up in the air and came down behind the goalie, bouncing off his back and into the net.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to fall down three when we give up those first two. A couple of strange goals for sure,\u201d Avs coach Jared Bednar said. \u201cWe definitely needed to get sharper on the defensive side early in the game, but we pushed back and created some good chances at the other end.\u201d",
      "Rantanen made it 3-0 early in the second period on a break with fellow Finnish player Roope Hintz, who after initially getting the puck sent it back with a cross-ice pass to set up Rantanen's short snap shot for his 35th career playoff goal.",
      "Hintz added an empty-net goal with 2:05 left, on an assist from Rantanen.",
      "Colorado traded Rantanen on Jan. 24 to Carolina in the East, where he played only 13 games. A deadline deal March 7 sent him back to the Central Division with the Stars and included a $96 million, eight-year contract extension.",

      "NEW YORK -- Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese's return to college for WNBA preseason games will be two of a record four exhibition games shown on national TV.",
      "Clark will head back to Iowa for an exhibition between her Indiana Fever and the Brazilian national team on Sunday, a game airing on ESPN. The Fever's exhibition game against the Washington Mystics a day earlier will be on NBA TV.",
      "Reese will lead the Chicago Sky back to her alma mater, LSU, on Friday to face the Brazilian team. Sky teammate Kamilla Cardoso played for that Brazilian team in February 2024, trying to help it qualify for the Paris Olympics. That game will be part of a doubleheader on ION.",
      "The WNBA will be showing all 15 of its preseason games either on national television or league pass.",

      "The league showed two exhibition games in 2023 and four last year, including Clark's debut, which was on league pass. Reese's preseason debut against Minnesota wasn't televised, but a fan livestreamed it on social media. The livestream drew significant attention, getting millions of views.",
      "The two rookies last season helped the league draw record-breaking viewership. ESPN games averaged 1.2 million viewers in the regular season, a 170% increase from the previous year. The postseason averaged 1.1 million viewers, making it the league's most-viewed playoffs in 25 years.",
      "The other game that will be nationally televised will be when Dallas plays Las Vegas at Notre Dame in the first game of the ION doubleheader Friday.

      "The play on Monday reflected the chippy nature of the series, which has had a somewhat controversial hit in three straight games. After Hagel\u2019s hit in Game 2, Florida\u2019s Matthew Tkachuk landed a late hit on Jake Guentzel in Game 3 and was assessed a five-minute major, though he was not suspended.",

      "Right-hander Tyler Glasnow has been placed on the 15-day injured list by the Los Angeles Dodgers with right shoulder inflammation in the latest setback for the defending World Series champions\u2019 perpetually injury-plagued pitching staff",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Right-hander Tyler Glasnow has been placed on the 15-day injured list by the Los Angeles Dodgers with right shoulder inflammation in the latest setback for the defending World Series champions' perpetually injury-plagued pitching staff.",
      "Glasnow went on the IL one day after leaving his second straight start early due to shoulder discomfort Sunday. He allowed two homers in the first inning against Pittsburgh, but returned to warm up for the second inning before exiting.",
      "Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Monday that Glasnow developed \u201coverall body soreness\u201d in addition to his shoulder woes.",
      "\u201cThere's the mechanics piece of it, there's the uncomfortable, not feeling right,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cAs Tyler said, very frustrating, and we're all just trying to get to the bottom of it.\u201d",
      "For the second consecutive season, Glasnow has joined an alarmingly long list of Dodgers pitchers with significant injury problems.",
      "Top-line starters Glasnow, Blake Snell (left shoulder inflammation) and Clayton Kershaw (recovery from toe and knee surgery) are on the injured list, along with Blake Treinen (right forearm tightness), Michael Kopech (right shoulder), Brusdar Graterol (right shoulder surgery) and several other relievers.",
      "\u201cPitching is certainly volatile,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cWe experienced it last year \u2014 I think every year. I think the thing that's probably most disconcerting is leading Major League Baseball in bullpen innings. I think that that's something the starters are built up to take those innings down, so that's sort of where my head is at, to make sure we don't red-line these guys.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-8 Glasnow has a lengthy injury history, but the Dodgers still signed him to a five-year, $136.5 million contract after acquiring the LA-area native from Tampa Bay in December 2023. Glasnow was solid to begin his debut season with the Dodgers, going 9-6 with a 3.49 ERA and a 0.95 WHIP \u2014 but he didn't pitch after Aug. 11, developing elbow tendinitis that kept him out of the postseason.",
      "Glasnow altered his delivery and his between-starts routine in an attempt to stay healthier, but he only got through five starts and 18 innings this season before his latest injury woes, going 1-0 with a 4.50 ERA.",
      "Snell, who got a $182 million free-agent deal from deep-pocketed Los Angeles last November, made only two starts for his new team before going on the shelf this month.",
      "The Dodgers used 17 starting pitchers during the 2024 regular season while their rotation was altered almost weekly by major injuries. Los Angeles won the World Series while relying on an October starting rotation of late-season acquisition Jack Flaherty, Yoshinobu Yamamoto (who missed three months of the regular season) and Walker Buehler (who also missed three months) along with multiple bullpen games.",
      "Flaherty and Buehler departed in free agency when the Dodgers declined to re-sign them. Gavin Stone, who led LA with 25 starts last season, is out for the entire 2025 season after right shoulder surgery.",
      "The Dodgers' high-priced starting rotation is thin yet again in 2025: LA will have to throw a bullpen game Tuesday against the Miami Marlins, while former All-Star right-hander Tony Gonsolin will return to the mound Wednesday to make his first start since August 2023 after recovering from Tommy John surgery.",

      "Emily Kramer-Golinkoff can\u2019t get enough oxygen with each breath. Advanced cystic fibrosis makes even simple things like walking or showering arduous and exhausting.",
      "She has the most common fatal genetic disease in the U.S., which afflicts 40,000 Americans. But her case is caused by a rare genetic mutation, so medications that work for 90% of people with cystic fibrosis won\u2019t help her.",
      "The same dynamic plays out in other genetic conditions. Stunning advances in genetic science have revealed the subtle, insidious culprits behind these brutal diseases and have started paving the way for treatments. But patients with these exceedingly rare mutations have fewer options and poorer prospects than those with more typical forms of these diseases \u2014 and many are now pinning hopes on experimental gene therapies.",
      "\u201cWe feel such pure joy for our friends who have been lifted from this sinking ship,\u201d said Kramer-Golinkoff, 40. \u201cBut we just feel so eager and desperate to join them. It\u2019s really hard to be in this minority of people left behind.\u201d",
      "It's not just science that is working against these patients, it's market forces. Drug companies are naturally going to look for medications that target the most common mutations.",
      "\u201cYou need a sufficiently large number of patients in a major market in order for a company to be interested in going forward,\u201d said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert. What it amounts to, he says, is \"mutational discrimination.\u201d",
      "Charities \u2013 including a nonprofit Kramer-Golinkoff co-founded called Emily\u2019s Entourage \u2013 are trying to overcome this barrier. Fundraising efforts have helped jump-start gene therapy that could help patients regardless of mutation.",
      "While it likely won't be available for years, \u201cjust to have these therapies in trials provides so much hope,\u201d Kramer-Golinkoff said.",
      "Kramer-Golinkoff was just six weeks old when she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, which causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the body.",
      "It occurs when the so-called CFTR protein is not made or not made correctly, allowing chloride to become trapped in cells, meaning water can't keep the cell's surface hydrated. Mucus buildup can lead to damage, blockages and infections in the lungs and other affected organs.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older \u2026 my CF has gotten worse, despite all my best efforts to delay it,\u201d Kramer-Golinkoff said.",
      "Before her illness got so bad, she was able to earn a master\u2019s degree in bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, work, travel and spend time with friends. But she eventually developed CF-related diabetes and other problems. She\u2019s prone to infections, and since the pandemic has lived with her parents in isolation in Greater Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cCF is a real monster of a disease,\u201d she said.",
      "Meanwhile, others with the condition have seen vast improvements in their health with \u201cCFTR modulator\u201d therapies that work for people with the most common mutation, correcting the malfunctioning protein. Research shows they dramatically improve lung function, respiratory symptoms and patients\u2019 overall quality of life.",
      "Besides not working for people with rare mutations, these treatments are unavailable to patients whose disease-causing mutations aren't known or fully understood. Mutations may be unknown because of a lack of genetic testing in places such as developing nations, or understudied because they are uncommon or difficult to detect.",
      "Genetic testing companies such as GeneDx have made some headway in screening more people of diverse backgrounds, but inequities remain.",
      "For example, comprehensive data about cystic fibrosis is scarce among African populations \u2013 affecting people who live on the continent as well as those who trace their ancestry there. Research shows Black cystic fibrosis patients are more likely than their white counterparts to be among the 10% who don\u2019t benefit from modulator therapies.",
      "While there\u2019s little chance of changing market dynamics, researchers said, one solution is to develop \u201cmutation agnostic\u201d gene therapies targeting all patients with a disease. This approach is being tried in diseases of the retina as well as cystic fibrosis.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge push to develop these therapies,\" said Dr. Garry Cutting of the Johns Hopkins Cystic Fibrosis Center.",
      "Most of the 14 experimental gene therapies in the pipeline for the disease aim to help patients with any mutation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation says, delivering a new, correct version of the CFTR gene to cells. Getting correct copies of the CFTR gene would enable cells to make normal proteins no matter what mutation causes a patient to have no, or not enough, functional CFTR proteins.",
      "One treatment, partially funded by the foundation, is sponsored by Spirovant Sciences, a company Emily\u2019s Entourage provided seed money to launch. The first patient received the therapy in November in a 53-week clinical trial at Columbia University that aims to determine if it's safe and how long it stays in the lung.",
      "Kramer-Golinkoff said she\u2019s more optimistic about her future these days, even as her own illness worsens. At this point, she\u2019s living with 30% lung function, suffers from kidney issues and has high blood pressure in her lungs. She depends on insulin for her diabetes and takes numerous pills daily.",
      "\u201cYou have to make really conscientious choices ... throughout the day on how to use your limited energy. And that\u2019s really difficult to do when you have big dreams and important work and life to live,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited about the promise of gene therapies. They can\u2019t come soon enough.\u201d",

      "In the White House and the Republican-led Congress, \"woke AI\u201d has replaced harmful algorithmic discrimination as a problem that needs fixing. Past efforts to \u201cadvance equity\u201d in AI development and curb the production of \u201charmful and biased outputs\u201d are a target of investigation, according to subpoenas sent to Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and 10 other tech companies last month by the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "And the standard-setting branch of the U.S. Commerce Department has deleted mentions of AI fairness, safety and \u201cresponsible AI\u201d in its appeal for collaboration with outside researchers. It is instead instructing scientists to focus on \u201creducing ideological bias\u201d in a way that will \u201cenable human flourishing and economic competitiveness,\u201d according to a copy of the document obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "In some ways, tech workers are used to a whiplash of Washington-driven priorities affecting their work.",
      "But the latest shift has raised concerns among experts in the field, including Harvard University sociologist Ellis Monk, who several years ago was approached by Google to help make its AI products more inclusive.",
      "Back then, the tech industry already knew it had a problem with the branch of AI that trains machines to \u201csee\u201d and understand images. Computer vision held great commercial promise but echoed the historical biases found in earlier camera technologies that portrayed Black and brown people in an unflattering light.",
      "\u201cBlack people or darker skinned people would come in the picture and we\u2019d look ridiculous sometimes,\u201d said Monk, a scholar of colorism, a form of discrimination based on people\u2019s skin tones and other features.",
      "Google adopted a color scale invented by Monk that improved how its AI image tools portray the diversity of human skin tones, replacing a decades-old standard originally designed for doctors treating white dermatology patients.",
      "\u201cConsumers definitely had a huge positive response to the changes,\u201d he said.",
      "Now Monk wonders whether such efforts will continue in the future. While he doesn't believe that his Monk Skin Tone Scale is threatened because it's already baked into dozens of products at Google and elsewhere \u2014 including camera phones, video games, AI image generators \u2014 he and other researchers worry that the new mood is chilling future initiatives and funding to make technology work better for everyone.",
      "\u201cGoogle wants their products to work for everybody, in India, China, Africa, et cetera. That part is kind of DEI-immune,\" Monk said. \u201cBut could future funding for those kinds of projects be lowered? Absolutely, when the political mood shifts and when there\u2019s a lot of pressure to get to market very quickly.\u201d",
      "Trump has cut hundreds of science, technology and health funding grants touching on DEI themes, but its influence on commercial development of chatbots and other AI products is more indirect. In investigating AI companies, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, chair of the judiciary committee, said he wants to find out whether former President Joe Biden's administration \u201ccoerced or colluded with\" them to censor lawful speech.",
      "Michael Kratsios, director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy, said at a Texas event this month that Biden's AI policies were \u201cpromoting social divisions and redistribution in the name of equity.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration declined to make Kratsios available for an interview but quoted several examples of what he meant. One was a line from a Biden-era AI research strategy that said: \u201cWithout proper controls, AI systems can amplify, perpetuate, or exacerbate inequitable or undesirable outcomes for individuals and communities.\u201d",
      "Even before Biden took office, a growing body of research and personal anecdotes was attracting attention to the harms of AI bias.",
      "One study showed self-driving car technology has a hard time detecting darker-skinned pedestrians, putting them in greater danger of getting run over. Another study asking popular AI text-to-image generators to make a picture of a surgeon found they produced a white man about 98% percent of the time, far higher than the real proportions even in a heavily male-dominated field.",
      "Face-matching software for unlocking phones misidentified Asian faces. Police in U.S. cities wrongfully arrested Black men based on false face recognition matches. And a decade ago, Google\u2019s own photos app sorted a picture of two Black people into a category labeled as \u201cgorillas.\u201d",
      "Even government scientists in the first Trump administration concluded in 2019 that facial recognition technology was performing unevenly based on race, gender or age.",
      "Biden's election propelled some tech companies to accelerate their focus on AI fairness. The 2022 arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT added new priorities, sparking a commercial boom in new AI applications for composing documents and generating images, pressuring companies like Google to ease its caution and catch up.",
      "Then came Google's Gemini AI chatbot \u2014 and a flawed product rollout last year that would make it the symbol of \u201cwoke AI\u201d that conservatives hoped to unravel. Left to their own devices, AI tools that generate images from a written prompt are prone to perpetuating the stereotypes accumulated from all the visual data they were trained on.",
      "Google's was no different, and when asked to depict people in various professions, it was more likely to favor lighter-skinned faces and men, and, when women were chosen, younger women, according to the company's own public research.",
      "Google tried to place technical guardrails to reduce those disparities before rolling out Gemini's AI image generator just over a year ago. It ended up overcompensating for the bias, placing people of color and women in inaccurate historical settings, such as answering a request for American founding fathers with images of men in 18th century attire who appeared to be Black, Asian and Native American. Google quickly apologized and temporarily pulled the plug on the feature, but the outrage became a rallying cry taken up by the political right.",
      "With Google CEO Sundar Pichai sitting nearby, Vice President JD Vance used an AI summit in Paris in February to decry the advancement of \u201cdownright ahistorical social agendas through AI,\u201d naming the moment when Google\u2019s AI image generator was \u201ctrying to tell us that George Washington was Black, or that America\u2019s doughboys in World War I were, in fact, women.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have to remember the lessons from that ridiculous moment,\u201d Vance declared at the gathering. \"And what we take from it is that the Trump administration will ensure that AI systems developed in America are free from ideological bias and never restrict our citizens\u2019 right to free speech.\u201d",
      "A former Biden science adviser who attended that speech, Alondra Nelson, said the Trump administration's new focus on AI's \u201cideological bias\u201d is in some ways a recognition of years of work to address algorithmic bias that can affect housing, mortgages, health care and other aspects of people's lives.",
      "\u201cFundamentally, to say that AI systems are ideologically biased is to say that you identify, recognize and are concerned about the problem of algorithmic bias, which is the problem that many of us have been worried about for a long time,\u201d said Nelson, the former acting director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy who co-authored a set of principles to protect civil rights and civil liberties in AI applications.",
      "But Nelson doesn't see much room for collaboration amid the denigration of equitable AI initiatives.",
      "\u201cI think in this political space, unfortunately, that is quite unlikely,\u201d she said. \u201cProblems that have been differently named \u2014 algorithmic discrimination or algorithmic bias on the one hand, and ideological bias on the other \u2014- will be regrettably seen us as two different problems.\u201d",

      "Former employees of OpenAI are appealing to the top law enforcement officers in California and Delaware to halt the company\u2019s move to transfer control of its artificial intelligence technology from a nonprofit charity to a for-profit business",
      "Former employees of OpenAI are asking the top law enforcement officers in California and Delaware to stop the company from shifting control of its artificial intelligence technology from a nonprofit charity to a for-profit business.",
      "They\u2019re concerned about what happens if the ChatGPT maker fulfills its ambition to build AI that outperforms humans, but is no longer accountable to its public mission to safeguard that technology from causing grievous harms.",
      "\u201cUltimately, I\u2019m worried about who owns and controls this technology once it\u2019s created,\u201d said Page Hedley, a former policy and ethics adviser at OpenAI, in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Backed by three Nobel Prize winners and other advocates and experts, Hedley and nine other ex-OpenAI workers sent a letter this week to the two state attorneys general.",
      "The coalition is asking California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, both Democrats, to use their authority to protect OpenAI's charitable purpose and block its planned restructuring. OpenAI is incorporated in Delaware and operates out of San Francisco.",
      "OpenAI said in response that \u201cany changes to our existing structure would be in service of ensuring the broader public can benefit from AI.\u201d It said its for-profit will be a public benefit corporation, similar to other AI labs like Anthropic and tech billionaire Elon Musk's xAI, except that OpenAI will still preserve a nonprofit arm.",
      "\u201cThis structure will continue to ensure that as the for-profit succeeds and grows, so too does the nonprofit, enabling us to achieve the mission,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "The letter is the second petition to state officials this month. The last came from a group of labor leaders and nonprofits focused on protecting OpenAI's billions of dollars of charitable assets.",
      "Jennings said last fall she would \u201creview any such transaction to ensure that the public\u2019s interests are adequately protected.\" Bonta\u2019s office sought more information from OpenAI late last year but has said it can\u2019t comment, even to confirm or deny if it is investigating.",
      "OpenAI's co-founders, including current CEO Sam Altman and Musk, originally started it as a nonprofit research laboratory on a mission to safely build what's known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, for humanity's benefit. Nearly a decade later, OpenAI has reported its market value as $300 billion and counts 400 million weekly users of ChatGPT, its flagship product.",
      "OpenAI already has a for-profit subsidiary but faces a number of challenges in converting its core governance structure. One is a lawsuit from Musk, who accuses the company and Altman of betraying the founding principles that led the Tesla CEO to invest in the charity.",
      "While some of the signatories of this week's letter support Musk's lawsuit, Hedley said others are \u201cunderstandably cynical\u201d because Musk also runs his own rival AI company.",
      "The signatories include two Nobel-winning economists, Oliver Hart and Joseph Stiglitz, as well as AI pioneers and computer scientists Geoffrey Hinton, who won last year's Nobel Prize in physics, and Stuart Russell.",
      "\u201cI like OpenAI\u2019s mission to \u2018ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity,\u2019 and I would like them to execute that mission instead of enriching their investors,\" Hinton said in a statement Wednesday. \"I\u2019m happy there is an effort to hold OpenAI to its mission that does not involve Elon Musk.\u201d",
      "Conflicts over OpenAI's purpose have long simmered at the San Francisco institute, contributing to Musk quitting in 2018, Altman's short-lived ouster in 2023 and other high-profile departures.",
      "Hedley, a lawyer by training, worked for OpenAI in 2017 and 2018, a time when the nonprofit was still navigating the best ways to steward the technology it wanted to build. As recently as 2023, Altman said advanced AI held promise but also warned of extraordinary risks, from drastic accidents to societal disruptions.",
      "In recent years, however, Hedley said he watched with concern as OpenAI, buoyed by the success of ChatGPT, was increasingly cutting corners on safety testing and rushing out new products to get ahead of business competitors.",
      "\u201cThe costs of those decisions will continue to go up as the technology becomes more powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that in the new structure that OpenAI wants, the incentives to rush to make those decisions will go up and there will no longer be anybody really who can tell them not to, tell them this is not OK.\u201d",
      "Software engineer Anish Tondwalkar, a former member of OpenAI\u2019s technical team until last year, said an important assurance in OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit charter is a \u201cstop-and-assist clause\u201d that directs OpenAI to stand down and help if another organization is nearing the achievement of better-than-human AI.",
      "\u201cIf OpenAI is allowed to become a for-profit, these safeguards, and OpenAI\u2019s duty to the public can vanish overnight,\u201d Tondwalkar said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Another former worker who signed the letter puts it more bluntly.",
      "\u201cOpenAI may one day build technology that could get us all killed,\" said Nisan Stiennon, an AI engineer who worked at OpenAI from 2018 to 2020. \"It is to OpenAI\u2019s credit that it\u2019s controlled by a nonprofit with a duty to humanity. This duty precludes giving up that control.\u201d",

      "Elon Musk intends to focus more on his job as Tesla CEO, but it\u2019s unclear if the billionaire will be able to solve a big problem of his own making: damage to its brand",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk has been called a Moonshot Master, the Edison of Our Age and the Architect of the Future, but he's got a big problem at his car company and it's not clear he can fix it: damage to its brand.",
      "Sales have plunged for Tesla amid protests and boycotts over Musk's embrace of far right-wing views. Profits have been sliced by two-thirds so far this year, and rivals from China, Europe and the U.S. are pouncing.",
      "On Tuesday came some relief as Musk announced in an earnings call with investors that he would be scaling back his government cost-cutting job in Washington to a \u201cday or two per week\" to focus more on his old job as Tesla's boss.",
      "Investors pushed up Tesla's stock 5% Wednesday, though there are plenty of challenges ahead.",
      "Musk seemed to downplay the role that brand damage played in the drop in first-quarter sales on the investor call. Instead, he emphasized something more fleeting \u2014 an upgrade to Tesla's best-selling Model Y that forced a shutdown of factories and pinched both supply and demand.",
      "While financial analysts following the company have noted that potential buyers probably held back while waiting for the upgrade, hurting results, even the most bullish among them say the brand damage is real, and more worrisome.",
      "\u201cThis is a full blown crisis,\u201d said Wedbush Securities' normally upbeat Dan Ives earlier this month. In a note to its clients, JP Morgan warned of \u201cunprecedented brand damage.\"",
      "Musk dismissed the protests against Tesla on the call as the work of people angry at his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency because \u201cthose who are receiving the waste and fraud wish it to continue.\u201d",
      "But the protests in Europe, thousands of miles from Washington, came after Musk supported far-right politicians there. Angry Europeans hung Musk in effigy in Milan, projected an image of him doing a straight-arm salute on a Tesla factory in Berlin and put up posters in London urging people not to buy \u201cSwasticars\u201d from him.",
      "Sales in Europe have gone into a free fall in the first three months of this year \u2014 down 39%. In Germany, sales plunged 62%.",
      "Another worrying sign: On Tuesday, Tesla backed off its earlier promise that sales would recover this year after dropping in 2024 for the first time a dozen years. Tesla said the global trade situation was too uncertain and declined to repeat the forecast.",
      "Meanwhile, Tesla's competition is stealing its customers.",
      "Among its fiercest rivals now is Chinese giant BYD. Earlier this year, the EV maker announced it had developed an electric battery that can charge within minutes. And Tesla\u2019s European rivals have begun offering new models with advanced technology that is making them real Tesla alternatives just as popular opinion has turned against Musk.",
      "Tesla's share of the EV market in the U.S. has dropped from two-thirds to less than half, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "Another rival, Google parent Alphabet, is already ahead of Tesla in an area that Musk has promised will help remake his company: Cybercabs.",
      "One of the highlights of Tesla\u2019s call Tuesday was Musk sticking with his previous prediction that it will l aunch driverless cabs without steering wheels and pedals in Austin, Texas, in June, and in other cities soon after.",
      "But Google\u2019s service, called Waymo, already has logged millions of driverless cybercab trips in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin as part of a partnership with ride-hailing leader Uber.",
      "Musk also told analysts that this driverless capability will be available on the Tesla vehicles already on the road through software updates over the air, and put a timeline on it: \u201cThere will be millions of Teslas operating autonomously in the second half of the year.\"",
      "But he has made similar promises before, only to miss his deadlines, such as in April 2019 when he vowed full automation by the end of the next year. He repeated the prediction, moving up the date, several more times, in following years.",
      "A big problem is federal investigators have not given the all-clear that Tesla vehicles can drive completely on their own safely. Among other probes, safety regulators are looking into Tesla's so-called Full Self-Driving, which is only partial self-driving, for its tie to accidents in low-visibility conditions like when there is sun glare.",
      "In competition with rivals in the U.S., Tesla currently has one clear advantage: It will get hurt by less by tariffs because most of its vehicles are built in the countries where they are sold, including those in its biggest market, the U.S.",
      "\u201cTariffs are still tough on a company where margins are still low, but we do have localized supply chains,\u201d Musk said Tuesday. \u201cThat puts us in a strong position.\u201d",
      "The company also reconfirmed that a cheaper version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y sport utility vehicle, will be ready for customers in the first half of this year. That could help boost sales.",
      "Another plus: The company had a blow out first quarter in its energy storage business. And Musk has promised to be producing 5,000 Optimus robots, another Tesla business, by the end of the year.",
      "Even after falling nearly 50% from its December highs, Tesla's stock is still very richly valued based on the one yardstick that really matters in the long run: its earnings.",
      "At 110 times its expected per share earnings this year, the stock is valued more than 25 times higher than General Motors. The average stock on in the S&P 500 index trades at less than 20 times earnings.",
      "That leaves Tesla little margin for error if something goes wrong.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- X Corp., the social media platform owned by Trump adviser Elon Musk, is challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota ban on using deepfakes to influence elections and harm candidates, saying it violates First Amendment speech protections.",
      "The company's federal lawsuit filed this week also contends that the 2023 state law is preempted by a 1996 federal statute that shields social media from being held responsible for material posted on their platforms.",
      "\u201cWhile the law's reference to banning \u2018deep fakes\u2019 might sound benign, in reality it would criminalize innocuous, election-related speech, including humor, and make social-media platforms criminally liable for censoring such speech,\" the company said in a statement. \u201cInstead of defending democracy, this law would erode it.\u201d",
      "Minnesota's law imposes criminal penalties \u2014 including jail time \u2014 for disseminating a deepfake video, image or audio if a person knows it's fake, or acts with reckless disregard to its authenticity, either within 90 days before a party nominating convention, or after the start of early voting in a primary or general election.",
      "It says the intent must be to injure a candidate or influence an election result. And it defines deepfakes as material so realistic that a reasonable person would believe it's real, and generated by artificial intelligence or other technical means.",
      "\u201cElon Musk funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into the 2024 presidential election and tried to buy a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat,\" said the law's author, Democratic state Sen. Erin Maye Quade.",
      "\"Of course he is upset that Minnesota law prevents him from spreading deepfakes that meant to harm candidates and influence elections. Minnesota\u2019s law is clear and precise, while this lawsuit is petty, misguided and a waste of the Attorney General Office\u2019s time and resources,\u201d her statement said.",
      "Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison's office, which is legally obligated to defend the constitutionality of state laws in court, said in a statement that it's \u201creviewing the lawsuit and will respond in the appropriate time and manner.\u201d",
      "The Minnesota law was already the subject of a constitutional challenge by Christopher Kohls, a content creator, and GOP state Rep. Mary Franson, who likes to post AI-generated parodies of politicians. That case is on hold while they appeal to overturn a judge's denial of their request to suspend the law.",
      "The attorney general's office argues in that case that deepfakes are a real and growing threat to free elections and democratic institutions, that the law is a legitimate and constitutional response to the problem, and that it contains important limitations on its scope that protect satire and parody.",
      "X, formerly known as Twitter, said it's the only social media platform challenging the Minnesota law, and that it has also challenged other laws it considers infringements of free speech, such as a 2024 California political deepfakes law that a judge has blocked.",
      "X said in its statement that its \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d feature allows users to flag content they consider problematic, and that it's been adopted by Facebook, YouTube and TikTok. The company's lawsuit said its \u201cAuthenticity Policy\u201d and \u201cGrok AI\u201d tool provide additional safeguards.",

      "There's no exception under the First Amendment for false or misleading political speech, even lies, he said. And the potential for criminal penalties gives social media companies like X and Facebook \u201can incentive to take down anything that might be a deepfake. ... You're going to censor a massive amount to comply with this law.\u201d",
      "Deepfakes aren't good, but it would be nice to get evidence that they're causing actual problems before imposing such limits on free speech, the professor said. And while it's easy to focus on the supply of misinformation, the large demand for it is the problem.",

      "In a series of executive actions signed Wednesday, Trump targeted universities that he views as liberal adversaries to his political agenda. One order called for harder enforcement of a federal law requiring colleges to disclose their financial ties with foreign sources, while another called for a shakeup of the accrediting bodies that decide whether colleges can accept federal financial aid awarded to students.",
      "Trump also ordered the Education Department to root out efforts to ensure equity in discipline in the nation's K-12 schools. Previous guidance from Democratic administrations directed schools not to disproportionately punish underrepresented minorities such as Black and Native American students. The administration says equity efforts amount to racial discrimination.",
      "Colleges\u2019 financial ties with foreign sources have long been a concern among Republicans, especially ties with China and other countries with adversarial relationships with the U.S. It became a priority during Trump\u2019s first term and reemerged last week as the White House grasped for leverage in its escalating battle with Harvard University.",
      "The White House said it needed to take action because Harvard and other colleges have routinely violated a federal disclosure law, which has been unevenly enforced since it was passed in the 1980s. Known as Section 117 of the Higher Education Act, the law requires colleges to disclose foreign gifts and contracts valued at $250,000 or more.",

      "In the executive order, Trump calls on the Education Department and the attorney general to step up enforcement of the law and take action against colleges that violate it, including a cutoff of federal money.",
      "The Trump administration intends to \u201cend the secrecy surrounding foreign funds in American educational institutions\u201d and protect against \u201cforeign exploitation,\u201d the order said.",
      "It was applauded by Republicans, including Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, chair of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. He accused China of exploiting academic ties to steal research and \u201cindoctrinate students.\u201d",
      "Another order aims at accrediting bodies that set standards colleges must meet to accept federal financial aid from students. Trump campaigned on a promise to overhaul the industry, saying it was \u201cdominated by Marxist Maniacs and lunatics.\u201d",
      "Often overlooked as an obscure branch of college oversight, accreditors play an important role in shaping colleges in many aspects, with standards that apply all the way from colleges\u2019 governing boards to classroom curriculum.",
      "Trump's executive order is the opening salvo in what could be a lengthy battle to overhaul the accrediting industry. Chief among his priorities is to strip accreditors of DEI requirements imposed on colleges. Some accreditors have already dropped or stopped enforcing such standards amid Trump\u2019s DEI crackdown.",
      "Trump\u2019s order calls on the government to suspend or terminate accreditors that discriminate in the name of DEI. Instead, it calls on accreditors to focus more squarely on the student outcomes of colleges and programs they oversee.",
      "The president wants to make it easier for new accreditors to compete with the 19 that are now authorized to work on behalf of the federal government. As it stands, new accreditors looking to be recognized by the government must undergo an arduous process that traditionally takes years. Trump\u2019s order said it should be \u201ctransparent, efficient, and not unduly burdensome.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead of pushing schools to adopt a divisive DEI ideology, accreditors should be focused on helping schools improve graduation rates and graduates\u2019 performance in the labor market,\u201d Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement.",
      "Trump also invoked opposition to equity efforts in his order on school discipline. The edict signed Wednesday seeks a return to \u201ccommon sense school discipline,\u201d allowing decisions to be based solely on students\u2019 behavior and actions, McMahon said.",
      "Another executive order instructs government agencies and departments to no longer rely on \u201cdisparate impact theories.\u201d Under the disparate impact standard, policies and practices that disproportionately impact minorities and other protected groups could be challenged regardless of their intent.",
      "In many schools around the country, Black students have been more likely to receive punishments that remove them from the classroom, including suspensions, expulsions and being transferred to alternative schools. A decade ago, those differences became the target of a reform movement spurred by the same reckoning that gave rise to Black Lives Matter. The movement elevated the concept of the \u201cschool-to-prison pipeline\u201d \u2014 the notion that being kicked out of school, or dropping out, increases the chance of arrest and imprisonment years later.",
      "Federal guidelines to address racial disparities in school discipline first came from President Barack Obama\u2019s administration in 2014. Federal officials urged schools not to suspend, expel or refer students to law enforcement except as a last resort, and encouraged restorative justice practices that did not push students out of the classroom. Those rules were rolled back by Trump\u2019s first administration, but civil rights regulations at federal and state levels still mandate the collection of data on discipline.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump directed McMahon to issue new school discipline guidance within 60 days. The order also calls for a review of nonprofit organizations that have promoted discipline policies rooted in equity and ensure they don\u2019t receive federal money.",
      "Another order creates a federal task force focused on giving America\u2019s students training on artificial intelligence as early as kindergarten. It would work to develop new online learning resources.",
      "Trump is also establishing a White House initiative to empower Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Among other efforts, it would seek to promote private-sector partnerships with HBCUs and schools\u2019 workforce preparation in industries like technology and finance.",

      "SHANGHAI -- The world\u2019s auto industry is getting a shake-up from Chinese automakers that are quickly expanding across the globe, offering relatively affordable electric vehicles designed to wow car buyers with sleek designs and the latest high-tech interiors.",
      "Companies like BYD, Great Wall, Geely and Chery Automobile are reaching outward as they build the scale they need to survive cut-throat competition in their home market.",
      "These generally are not state-run giants like SAIC, BAIC and Guangzhou Automotive. The founder of Geely started out making refrigerators.",
      "BYD first built up its expertise in battery technology, now its biggest advantage as the world\u2019s largest-selling EV maker. Some others are technology companies allied with automakers to offer autonomous driving.",
      "Here are some of the key players:",
      "Great Wall Motors, with the Haval, Wey, Ora, Poer and Tank brands, is banking on overseas sales to keep growing after seeing its sales inside China fall by nearly 15% last year, even as the company\u2019s net profit jumped more than 80%. The company has factories in Russia, Thailand and Brazil, where it is challenging Toyota\u2019s popular Hilux pickup truck with its GWM Poer, a hybrid pickup of its own. Another mainstay is the Haval H6, a hybrid sports SUV.",
      "Great Wall has smoothed its transition to overseas production by buying factories of other automakers. In Thailand, it took over a factory formerly operated by General Motors Corp. In Brazil, it purchased a former Mercedes-Benz plant.",
      "\u201cIt is essential for volume to be big, otherwise the cost of production is too high,\u201d Great Wall\u2019s chairman, Wei Jianjun, said in a media huddle at the show. Wei, who also goes by the name Jack Wey, was born in Beijing but moved to nearby Hebei, home of the Great Wall. He led the company\u2019s transition from vehicle modification to automaking, becoming China\u2019s biggest maker of pickup trucks and a leading SUV maker. The company has a joint venture for EVs with BMW.",
      "State-owned Chery Automobile says it was the first Chinese automaker to export overseas. It has sold more than 15 million of its Chery, Exeed, Omoda and Jetour models overseas, mostly in the developing world and emerging markets, including Turkey and Ukraine. Chery reported selling 2.6 million vehicles overseas last year and is aiming for 3 million in 2025. It\u2019s quickly expanding overseas production, setting up factories in Russia and Spain. It is expanding rapidly in Latin America.",
      "Chery\u2019s tie-up with EV-maker Visionary Vehicles aimed to sell in North America but has not yet achieved that goal. The company has a 50-50 joint venture with Jaguar Land Rover, which is a subsidiary of Tata Motors of India that makes Jaguars and Land Rovers in China. It also collaborates with Huawei Technologies and e-commerce giant Alibaba.",
      "Chery still sells far more fuel-engine cars than EVs. Its battery electric vehicle company, Chery New Energy, makes minivehicles like the eQ1, or Small Ant, and the QQ Ice Cream. Its mainstays are the Tiggo lineup of SUVs and its Arrizo sedans.",
      "BYD made more electric vehicles last year than Tesla, selling 3.52 million EVs in China, up 28% from a year earlier. Its strength in plug-in hybrids has helped as Chinese increasingly opt for the fallback of a fuel engine.",
      "The company, based in southern China's Shenzhen, recently announced an ultra-fast EV charging system it says can provide a full charge for its latest EVs within five to eight minutes, about as long as a fill-up. It plans to build more than 4,000 of the new charging stations across China.",
      "The Chinese company started out making batteries and has been refining its battery and energy storage technology while building an auto empire that is expanding outside China.",
      "While BYD\u2019s fanciest, latest premium models are expected to sell for up to about $40,000, it also makes much less expensive EVs including the Seagull, which sells for around $12,000 in China.",
      "BYD barely nudged ahead of Tesla in production of battery-powered EVs in 2024, making 1,777,965 compared with Tesla\u2019s 1,773,443.",
      "Geely Auto is perhaps the most famous Chinese automaker that many people have never heard of. The privately held company was founded as a refrigerator-maker by businessman Li Shufu in 1997 in eastern China\u2019s Taizhou, which early on became a hub of private industry.",
      "Li began making strategic overseas acquisitions early on, buying Sweden\u2019s Volvo Car Co. from Ford Motor in 2010. Geely's purchase of a 49.9% stake in Malaysia\u2019s Proton gave it a 51% stake in luxury sports car brand Lotus. It formed a 50-50 joint venture to make Smart city cars with Germany\u2019s Daimler AG. It also works with Renault SA of France on powertrains and owns a stake in Aston Martin Lagonda.",
      "In March, it launched sales of its Geely EX5 SUVs in Australia and New Zealand, adding to its global reach.",
      "Geely also owns New York Stock Exchange-listed Zeekr Intelligent Technology Holding, which makes a premium EV brand. Geely and Volvo own Swedish automaker Polestar, which has struggled in the U.S. market.",
      "China\u2019s second-best selling EV brand is Wuling, a joint venture of Shanghai\u2019s SAIC Motor, General Motors and Guangxi Auto. It sold more than 673,000 EVs in China and has a market share of only 6% compared with BYD\u2019s nearly one-third share. Tesla came in third at 659,000 cars sold.",
      "Apart from its Baojun sedans and vans, Wuling mainly makes engines, commercial vehicles and special purpose vehicles like mini-EVs and golf carts.",
      "Other major Chinese brands of EVs include Nio, Xpeng, Li Auto and Leap Motor. State-run giants like Dongfeng Motor Group, which has an alliance with Nissan Motor Corp., and Changan Automobile, a partner with Japan\u2019s Mazda Motor Corp. and with Ford Motor Co., are also quickly expanding EV sales.",
      "But the industry is fast-changing and competition in the home market is tough. That\u2019s a key reason why the biggest automakers have focused attention on expanding into global markets.",

      "The legal licensing body said in a news release Monday that it will ask the California Supreme Court to adjust test scores for those who took its February bar exam.",
      "\u201cThe debacle that was the February 2025 bar exam is worse than we imagined,\u201d Mary Basick, assistant dean of academic skills at the University of California, Irvine, Law School, told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cI\u2019m almost speechless. Having the questions drafted by non-lawyers using artificial intelligence is just unbelievable.\u201d",
      "In February, the new exam led to complaints after many test-takers were unable to complete their bar exams. The online testing platforms repeatedly crashed before some applicants even started. Others struggled to finish and save essays, experienced screen lags and error messages and could not copy and paste text, the Times reported earlier.",
      "According to a recent presentation by the State Bar, 100 of the 171 scored multiple-choice questions were made by Kaplan and 48 were drawn from a first-year law students exam. A smaller subset of 23 scored questions were made by ACS Ventures, the State Bar\u2019s psychometrician, and developed with artificial intelligence.",

      "\u201cThe State Bar has admitted they employed a company to have a non-lawyer use AI to draft questions that were given on the actual bar exam,\u201d she said. \u201cThey then paid that same company to assess and ultimately approve of the questions on the exam, including the questions the company authored.\u201d",

      "Harmful bleaching of the world's coral has grown to include 84% of the ocean's reefs in the most intense event of its kind in recorded history, the International Coral Reef Initiative announced Wednesday.",
      "It's the fourth global bleaching event since 1998, and has now surpassed bleaching from 2014-17 that hit some two-thirds of reefs, said the ICRI, a mix of more than 100 governments, non-governmental organizations and others. And it's not clear when the current crisis, which began in 2023 and is blamed on warming oceans, will end.",
      "\u201cWe may never see the heat stress that causes bleaching dropping below the threshold that triggers a global event,\u201d said Mark Eakin, executive secretary for the International Coral Reef Society and retired coral monitoring chief for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking at something that\u2019s completely changing the face of our planet and the ability of our oceans to sustain lives and livelihoods,\u201d Eakin said.",
      "Last year was Earth\u2019s hottest year on record, and much of that is going into oceans. The average annual sea surface temperature of oceans away from the poles was a record 20.87 degrees Celsius (69.57 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "That's deadly to corals, which are key to seafood production, tourism and protecting coastlines from erosion and storms. Coral reefs are sometimes dubbed \u201crainforests of the sea\u201d because they support high levels of biodiversity \u2014 approximately 25% of all marine species can be found in, on and around coral reefs.",
      "Coral get their bright colors from the colorful algae that live inside them and are a food source for the corals. Prolonged warmth causes the algae to release toxic compounds, and the coral eject them. A stark white skeleton is left behind, and the weakened coral is at heightened risk of dying.",
      "The bleaching event has been so severe that NOAA\u2019s Coral Reef Watch program has had to add levels to its bleaching alert scale to account for the growing risk of coral death.",
      "Efforts are underway to conserve and restore coral. One Dutch lab has worked with coral fragments, including some taken from off the coast of the Seychelles, to propagate them in a zoo so that they might be used someday to repopulate wild coral reefs if needed. Other projects, including one off Florida, have worked to rescue corals endangered by high heat and nurse them back to health before returning them to the ocean.",
      "But scientists say it's essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet, such as carbon dioxide and methane.",
      "\u201cThe best way to protect coral reefs is to address the root cause of climate change. And that means reducing the human emissions that are mostly from burning of fossil fuels \u2026 everything else is looking more like a Band-Aid rather than a solution,\u201d Eakin said.",
      "\u201cI think people really need to recognize what they\u2019re doing \u2026 inaction is the kiss of death for coral reefs,\u201d said Melanie McField, co-chair of the Caribbean Steering Committee for the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, a network of scientists that monitors reefs throughout the world.",
      "The group's update comes as President Donald Trump has moved aggressively in his second term to boost fossil fuels and roll back clean energy programs, which he says is necessary for economic growth.",

To make matters worse, its digital ad network also was found to be illegally abusing its power earlier this month in another case brought by the Justice Department.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war has injected more uncertainty into the mix by rattling the financial markets amid fears the tariffs will reignite inflation while dragging the economy into a recession. Although Google\u2019s digital services aren\u2019t directly impacted by the tariffs, a recession would likely curtail the spending on ads that generate most of Alphabet\u2019s revenue.",
      "But there were few signs of a slowdown in the past quarter. Google's ad revenue during the period totaled $72.5 billion, an 11% increase from the same time a year ago.",
      "The steady growth emboldened Alphabet to stand firm on plans to invest $75 billion on AI and other technologies this year while also pursuing approval of a $32 billion deal to buy cybersecurity firm Wiz.",

      "Trump's 'government by executive order'",
      "Nearly every day since Jan. 20, Trump has signed executive actions in the Oval Office, often in front of television cameras. He's signed the greatest number of executive orders in his first 100 days of any president going back 88 years.",
      "\"He's trying to do government by executive order on a whole range of issues,\" said David Schultz, a constitutional law expert at Hamline University.",
      "Following Trump's lead, his administration has carried out a dramatic purge of what Congress had set up as independent agencies, firing tens of thousands of employees, even those with civil service protections. He's also sought to wipe out diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives across the federal government.",
      "Trump signed an order to diminish the Department of Education, with the ultimate goal of wiping away the agency established by law. He's tried to effectively end birthright citizenship, which is enshrined in the 14th Amendment and has been upheld repeatedly by the Supreme Court.",
      "To move forward with his immigration and economic policies, Trump has declared national emergencies that Goitein, an expert on presidential emergency powers, said are unjustified.",
      "Despite border crossings being down, Trump invoked the 1798 wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport hundreds of Venezuelan migrants his administration alleged to be gang members, affording them little to no due process.",
      "He invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act in order to impose sweeping tariffs on virtually all U.S. trading partners. Though it is Congress, not the president, that has the power to impose taxes and regulate trade -- and the emergency power used by Trump makes no mention of tariffs.",
      "At times, he's used the power of the presidency to pursue retribution on political opponents. Seemingly contrary to his promise to end the \"weaponization\" of government and the justice system, he's signed orders targeting specific law firms that took on clients or cases he disagreed with politically. He directed the Justice Department to investigate Chris Krebbs and Miles Taylor, two officials from his first term who've criticized him or challenged his 2020 election falsehoods.",
      "Trump's harshest critics say some action verges on authoritarianism, noting his open respect for \"strongman\" leaders, including China's President Xi Jinping, Russia's Vladimir Putin and Hungary's Viktor Orban.",
      "\"Sometimes you need a strongman,\" Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity last September while campaigning.",
      "Pushback from the courts -- but not from Congress",
      "\"Our Framers were envisioning that if a president tried to do things like this, Congress would step in,\" said Schultz. \"And right now, it looks like partisanship is more powerful than checks and balances.\"",
      "Despite having Republican majorities (albeit narrow ones) in the House and Senate, Trump has opted to largely go it alone on his agenda in his first 100 days. Republicans on Capitol Hill, so far, appear uninterested or unwilling to seriously challenge him.",
      "\"We're all afraid,\" GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, one of the few Republicans to be critical of Trump, told her Alaskan constituents last month. Murkowski added that \"retaliation is real.\"",
      "While congressional pushback has been minimal, a clear clash is underway between the Trump administration and the courts as various groups and individuals challenge his policies.",
      "Trump has berated judges who ruled against him as \"radical left\" and called for District Judge James Boasberg's impeachment. He and Vice President JD Vance openly floated the idea of not abiding by lower court orders -- \"He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,\" Trump posted on social media -- though later said they would comply with decisions from the Supreme Court.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement in rebuke of the rhetoric -- and though he didn't mention Trump by name, the context was clear.",
      "In a major escalation of the administration's standoff with the courts, the FBI last week arrested a Milwaukee judge, Hannah Dugan, and accused her of obstructing immigration agents. An attorney for Dugan said she will \"defend herself vigorously and looks forward to being exonerated.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked about the incident, left open the possibility of the Justice Department taking more action against federal judges or even Supreme Court justices if they were obstructing the arrest of anyone suspected of being in the country illegally.",
      "\"He thinks he can either ignore or bully his way through,\" Schultz said of Trump's posture toward the judiciary. \"And so far, he's got a mixed record at best in terms of being able to do that.\"",
      "Several legal experts and presidential scholars who spoke to ABC News expressed concern that the courts will become inundated by Trump's moves as his second term continues, and the system of checks and balances will continue to break down.",
      "\"The separation of powers is probably the most important protection that we have against presidents becoming kings,\" said Goitein. \"If this is the new normal, then we can say goodbye to democracy.\"",

      "Ford and GM applauded the policy change.",
      "President Donald Trump is set to provide tariff relief for carmakers on Tuesday, just weeks after the onset of auto levies triggered warnings of price increases.",
      "An administration official confirmed that the 25% tariff on finished foreign-made cars and parts will remain -- but today's announcement will prevent tariffs from stacking on top of other tariffs he's imposed, such as duties on steel and aluminum.",
      "Trump's 25% tariff on foreign auto parts goes into effect on Saturday and automakers will also be reimbursed for those tariffs up to an amount equal to 3.75% of the value of a U.S.-made car for one year. Reimbursement would fall to 2.5% of the car's value in a second year, and then completely phased out altogether.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent touted the tariff adjustment as a means of ensuring carmakers bring manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "\"President Trump has had meetings with both domestic and foreign auto producers, and he's committed to bring back auto production to the US. We want to give the automakers a path to do that quickly, efficiently and create as many jobs as possible,\" Bessent said.",
      "Trump is expected to deliver remarks about the policy change in Michigan on Tuesday. Details of the plan were first reported in the Wall Street Journal.",
      "U.S. automakers on Tuesday applauded the easing of tariffs.",
      "\"Ford welcomes and appreciates these decisions by President Trump, which will help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers,\" Ford told ABC News in a statement.",
      "GM also voiced praise for the move. \"We're grateful to President Trump for his support of the U.S. automotive industry and the millions of Americans who depend on us. We believe the President's leadership is helping level the playing field for companies like GM and allowing us to invest even more in the U.S. economy,\" the company told ABC News in a statement.",
      "The 25% tariff on imported cars took effect on April 3. It applies to an array of passenger vehicles, including cars, SUVs, minivans, cargo vans and light trucks.",
      "The tariffs will almost certainly raise foreign-made car prices, experts previously told ABC News, since importers typically pass along a share of the tax burden to consumers in the form of extra costs.",
      "The policy change offers automakers a chance to relocate their manufacturing, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told ABC News in a statement.",
      "\"This deal is a major victory for the President's trade policy by rewarding companies who manufacture domestically, while providing runway to manufacturers who have expressed their commitment to invest in America and expand their domestic manufacturing,\" Lutnick said.",
      "The move aims to give automakers an opportunity to move their supply chains for parts back to the U.S.",
      "\"President Trump is building an important partnership with both the domestic automakers and our great American workers,\" Lutnick also said in the statement.",

      "His second first 100 days in office have been vastly different from those of his first term. Unlike then, Trump is now surrounded by a team that understands how to mechanize government to satiate his desires to make himself in the image of the strongmen he expresses admiration for.",
      "Clawing back federal funding, revoking security clearances and visas, and testing the limits of court orders are all tools in this administration's arsenal. Trump himself continues to float legally questionable ideas like sending Americans to foreign prisons with the ominous promise that his team is \"looking into\" it and claiming \"there are methods\" to seek a third term for president.",

For the Republican Party, particularly those in vulnerable congressional districts and battleground states, this is a political liability.",
      "Look no further than the hordes that turn up to town halls hosted by the few Republican lawmakers brave enough to host them. They are characterized by tense exchanges, audience ejections and, in one case, stun guns deployed to subdue two attendees. Republicans have largely dismissed concerns raised in these venues.",
      "Or look at special elections where Democrats won or outperformed expectations. Even some Republicans admit that momentum is on the side of Democrats and their anti-Trump (and Musk) message.",

      "California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has ingratiated himself with conservative figures via his podcast (a medium Trump and those in his orbit dominated in the run-up to November's elections). Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer made a point to say she understood Trump's motivation on tariffs and appeared with him in the Oval Office (though she hid behind a folder for a portion of her visit). Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan seemingly praised Ronald Reagan during her rebuttal to Trump's address to a joint session of Congress.",
      "Intraparty tensions have also been on display as the party tries to reinvent itself and as some Democratic voters have indicated they're looking for Democrats to fight harder against the Republican Party.",
      "Gun-reform activist David Hogg made the highly unusual move as vice chair of the Democratic Party to weigh in on primary races targeting incumbent Democrats he calls \"asleep at the wheel\" in hopes of forcing a party shift to a new generation of leadership through his group Leaders We Deserve. It's a move Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin decried.",
      "During recent remarks in New Hampshire, Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, a potential 2028 contender, went after who he called \"do-nothing Democrats\" who he said \"blame our losses on our defense of Black people, of trans kids, of immigrants, instead of their own lack of guts and gumption.\"",
      "He also called for mass protests against the White House.",
      "\"These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace,\" Pritzker said. \"They have to understand that we will fight their cruelty with every megaphone and microphone that we have. We must castigate them on the soap box and then punish them at the ballot box.\"",

      "Thousands of people have been let go at federal agencies and critical research has been put on hold. Additionally, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has questioned the safety and efficacy of vaccines and antidepressant medications despite dozens of studies proving they are safe and effective.",

      "\"It's completely unprecedented,\" Steve Cohen, senior vice dean of Columbia University's School of Professional Studies and a professor of public affairs at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs, told ABC News. \"It's frankly a little unhinged. I've never seen anything like it.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.",

      "\"Further reviewing pharmaceutical products with gold standard science and common sense is not an'\"attack on science' \u2014 it's what the American people have asked for and deserve,\" the official said. \" Let's be clear: Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine \u2014 he is pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability.\"",
      "Thousands of layoffs",
      "Earlier this month, HHS began to lay off 10,000 workers as part of a massive restructuring plan.",
      "Sources previously told ABC News that affected offices included most of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Office on Smoking and Health, key offices in the Center for Tobacco Products, most of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and the entire assisted reproductive technology team at the CDC.",
      "There have also been local impacts in communities due to federal layoffs. ABC News previously reported in March, the CDC was poised to send its lead 'disease detectives' to Milwaukee amid an ongoing lead crisis in schools, but the entire division was cut under sweeping HHS layoffs, leaving local health officials without help they were relying on.",
      "Erik Svendsen, the director of the division that oversaw the CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention branch, previously told ABC News that what's happening in Milwaukee is a real world example of the impact of their absence.",
      "\"Without us, there is no other unit at the federal level that is here to support them in doing what they need to do,\" he said.",
      "On Monday, officials in Milwaukee announced two additional schools are closing due to this crisis",
      "Despite Kennedy saying some programs and employees would soon be reinstated because they were mistakenly cut, it still leaves thousands of federal employees without jobs.",
      "Scientists have also been laid off at NASA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Cohen said these firings have put studies on hold and have greatly reduced the capacity of the federal government to review research.",
      "\"Scientists inside agencies, whether they're environmental scientists or medical scientists or people focusing on vaccines or drugs, are being fired, and so some of the research capacity in Washington, in the federal government is being eliminated, and also their ability to judge proposals from universities,\" he said.",
      "\"The only place I haven't seen [firings] happen yet are the laboratories,\" Cohen added.",
      "Cuts that are currently proposed or have already been implemented include the elimination of the Office of Infectious Disease and HIV Policy, created by Brett Giroir, the former U.S. assistant secretary for health.",
      "Giroir, who helped convince Trump in his first term to set a goal to end the HIV epidemic in the U.S., wrote in a post on social media last week that the president could ruin his legacy and mission with such cuts.",
      "Canceling research grants, funding cuts to universities",
      "Millions of dollars' worth of grants have been terminated at the National Institutes of Health related to studies involving LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) because they do not \"effectuate\" the \"priorities\" of President Donald Trump's administration, according to copies of termination letters sent to grant recipients and viewed by ABC News.",
      "Dr. Harold Varmus, a cancer researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City and former director of the NIH, said these terminations are \"detrimental\" because they may be affecting people in the middle of clinical trials, or affecting the early stages of experimental work.",
      "Research projects focusing on minority populations have major benefits, Varmus noted.",
      "\"The purpose of health research in this country is to address problems faced by everybody and to explore every facet of a population that may affect their health,\" he said. \"To single out certain categories of individuals who would not be appropriate to study seems ludicrous to me ... one of the great strengths of America is that we are diverse.\"",
      "Universities have also been threatened with funding cuts -- or have seen funds frozen -- if they don't fulfill their obligations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act to protect Jewish students on campus and to end race-based programs.",
      "Cohen believes universities are at odds with the administration because some on the political right view universities as \"left wing.\" By \"weakening the finances of universities, they can force them to change the ideologies that they believe are being promoted in the classrooms,\" he argued.",
      "The problem with this idea, according to Cohen, is that the administration's actions are hurting the least ideological parts of universities, such as engineering schools or medical centers. At Columbia, for example, several institutes and centers are conducting Alzheimer's research, he said.",
      "\"Those are the places that are being attacked,\" Cohen said. \"It's pretty ironic, but the greatest danger, actually, is that one of America's fundamental economic strengths is the creativity and the innovation of our scientists, and that is now under attack by the Trump administration.\"",
      "Questioning safety, efficacy of vaccines",
      "Kennedy has shared vaccine skepticism in the past and has continued to do so as HHS secretary.",
      "In the wake of several ongoing measles outbreaks and over 800 cases so far this year, Kennedy has shared contradicting views about vaccines.",
      "In a post on X on April 6, he said that \"most effective way to prevent the spread of measles\" is to receive the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. However, in a post later that evening, he said more than 300 children have been treated with an antibiotic and a steroid, neither of which are cures for measles.",
      "Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor of pediatrics and molecular virology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said the statements Kennedy has made in support of the MMR vaccine are \"half-hearted.\"",
      "\"The reason I say 'half-hearted' or insufficient is because each time he talks about using the MMR vaccine, he qualifies it,\" Hotez told ABC News. \"He then draws this false equivalency between either getting the MMR vaccine or this cocktail of interventions that would do absolutely nothing.\"",
      "Last month, HHS confirmed that the CDC will study \"all the potential culprits\" including whether vaccines cause autism despite numerous existing studies already showing there is no link.",
      "Hotez said epidemiologic studies show that children who received either the MMR vaccine, or vaccines containing thimerosal -- a compound used as a preservative in vaccines -- are not more likely to be diagnosed autism than kids who didn't receive those vaccines.",
      "Additionally, Hotez said about 100 genes have been identified that are involved in the development of autism, many by the Broad Institute at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "He believes rising rates of autism diagnoses are likely due to wider testing and expanding diagnostic criteria. Hotez added that there could be an environmental exposure influencing autism genes, but that it's not vaccines.",
      "In 2017, he discussed with Kennedy an investigation looking at \"about half a dozen chemical exposures\" in early pregnancies but Kennedy \"had no interest,\" according to Hotez, who later documented these conversations in a book he published in 2018.",
      "\"He apparently seems to not understand the science or doesn't care about the science. He's got his fixed beliefs and doesn't want to let any of the facts or scientific findings get in the way of his fixed belief,\" Hotez said. \"And it's completely irresponsible having someone like that as Health and Human Services secretary.\"",
      "Claims around antidepressant use",
      "Earlier this year, Trump issued an executive order to study the use of several medications including antidepressants and antipsychotics.",
      "The order called for the formation of the \"Make America Healthy Again\" commission -- to be chaired by Kennedy -- with an aim to understand chronic diseases.",
      "Among the goals of the commission is to \"assess the prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, stimulants, and weight-loss drugs.\"",
      "Dr. Joseph Saseen, associate dean for clinical affairs and a professor in the departments of clinical pharmacy and family medicine at the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Colorado, said there are plenty of studies and analyses in the medical literature looking at the prevalence of SSRIs.",
      "\"We have an overwhelming amount of information,\" he told ABC News. \"These medicines, particularly SSRIs, are the most frequently prescribed antidepressants for patients with major depressive disorder. There is a plethora of information evaluating efficacy in a broad range of patient populations for which these medicines are indicated.\"",
      "Saseen says these medications do have side effects, just like any drug, but the benefits significantly outweigh the risks for most people in the general population who have major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders.",
      "Kennedy has also falsely linked the use of antidepressants to school shootings and claimed during his Senate confirmation hearings that members of his family had a harder time stopping SSRI use than heroin use.",
      "Experts have said there is no evidence that equates ending the use of antidepressants to ending the use of heroin or to suggest that people on SSRIs are more likely to be violent.",
      "Saseen said it's reasonable to question scientific research, either to reaffirm or dispute findings, but it must be done following the scientific method.",
      "\"Question it the real way, not the cowardly way,\" he said. \"The cowardly way is labeling things as threats or as bad without taking a scientific approach. The key is you need to use appropriate methodologies, not vocal inflections and very triggering and polarizing words to create an uprising.\"",

    "summary": "Since Donald Trump took office 100 days ago, the president and his administration have faced at least 220 lawsuits challenging nearly every element of his agenda.",
    "story": [
      "The administration has been sued over nearly every element of Trump's agenda.",
      "Since Donald Trump took office 100 days ago, the president and his administration have faced an average of more than two lawsuits per day, challenging nearly every element of his agenda.",
      "The breakneck pace of the president's policies has been matched in nearly equal force by a flood of litigation -- at least 220 lawsuits in courts across the country -- challenging more than two dozen executive orders, the firing of twenty high-ranking government officials, and dozens of other executive actions.",
      "While the Trump administration has had some victories in the courts, federal judges have blocked key parts of Trump's agenda ranging from parts of his immigration policy and military guidelines to his effort to roll back diversity and equity initiatives.",
      "\"The administration has basically gone on a shock-and-awe bombing campaign,\" said Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University. \"There is a huge amount of what they are currently doing that they probably could have achieved lawfully, but they have crashed through any of the existing legal guardrails in an attempt to do everything, everywhere, all at once.\"",
      "The suits have come at a steady clip -- 20 in January, approximately 70 in both February and March, and about 50 so far in April -- as the Trump administration has rolled out its new policies.",
      "Approximately 60 of those cases have focused on the president's immigration policy, with courts so far blocking the president's attempts to remove birthright citizenship, withhold funding from sanctuary cities, remove noncitizens to countries other than their place of origin with little-to-no due process, and strip thousands of their temporary protected status. Some of those policies have earned the president rebukes from judges questioning the rationale for his unilateral immigration policy.",
      "\"It has become ever more apparent that to our president, the rule of law is but an impediment to his policy goals,\" U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, a Reagan appointee, said of Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. \"There are moments in the world's history when people look back and ask, 'Where were the lawyers, where were the judges?' In these moments, the rule of law becomes especially vulnerable. I refuse to let that beacon go dark today.\"",
      "Courts have also blocked the Trump administration from effectively banning transgender people from military service, limiting gender-affirming care, requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote, attempting to freeze trillions in funding to states and nonprofits, and moving to block billions in foreign aid.",
      "But in many cases federal courts have not stopped the president outright -- tentatively allowing the mass firing of thousands of government employees, greenlighting a historic federal buyout, and, for now, allowing the dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development. The Department of Education and the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau are also undergoing massive staffing reductions as judges actively consider the legality of the Trump administration's cuts.",
      "The president's supporters have decried the litigation as a \"judicial coup,\" while those opposing his policies have praised judges for serving as a check against the administration. But the seemingly constant conflict between the Trump administration and the judiciary could risk permanent damage to the separation of powers at the heart of the Constitution, some judges have warned.",
      "\"Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both. This is a losing proposition all around,\" wrote federal Judge Harvie Wilkinson III, a Reagan appointee who rebuked the Trump administration's inaction after it was ordered to facilitate the return of a man from a Salvadoran prison.",
      "In the first hundred days since Trump took office, lawyers challenging his actions in court alleged that his administration violated court orders at least six times, according to court records reviewed by ABC News.",
      "While no judge has held members of the Trump administration in contempt of court, two federal judges have sharply rebuked the government for acting in \"bad faith\" during ongoing lawsuits. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg -- who heard arguments over the deportation of two planeloads of alleged migrant gang members to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act -- an 18th century wartime authority used to remove noncitizens with little-to-no due process -- ultimately determined the Trump administration likely violated his order by failing to return the migrants to the United States.",
      "An appeals court temporarily blocked Judge Boasberg from beginning the process of contempt proceedings, but his most recent ruling invoked the words of former Chief Justice John Marshall to describe the stakes of the Trump administration's actions.",
      "\"The Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders -- especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it. To permit such officials to freely 'annul the judgments of the courts of the United States' would not just 'destroy the rights acquired under those judgments'; it would make 'a solemn mockery' of 'the Constitution itself,'\" Boasberg wrote.",
      "Lawyers representing the Trump administration have argued that Judge Boasberg\u2019s order fell outside his jurisdiction because the flights in question had left U.S. airspace, and have insisted that a federal judge should not dictate U.S. foreign policy.",
      "The Trump administration has also faced legal challenges for its refusal to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native living in Maryland, to the United States after he was mistakenly deported to his home country despite an order barring his deportation there due to fear of persecution.",
      "The administration has so far declined to bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States despite the Supreme Court ordering his release, though administration officials have complied with a lower court\u2019s order to provide regular updates about him.",
      "The administration has rebutted orders to bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States despite the Supreme Court ordering them to facilitate his release.",
      "Judge Wilkinson, in the meantime, has condemned the Trump administration's attempt to send alleged migrant gang members to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison.",
      "\"The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order,\" he wrote. \"This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.\"",
      "In an ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, 65% of respondents said Trump's administration is trying to avoid complying with federal court orders, and 62% said they don't think his administration respects the rule of law.",
      "With the Trump administration just 100 days in, most lawsuits have not made their way through the appeals process to the Supreme Court -- but the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to block some court orders on an emergency basis.",
      "Those appeals have led to some losses for the Trump administration -- among them a 5-4 Supreme Court decision ordering the Trump administration to unfreeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid funds for work that aid groups have already completed on the government's behalf.",
      "On the flip side, the Supreme Court -- citing largely technical reasons -- handed the Trump administration a series of temporary wins, including vacating an order blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. In that case, the justices opted to throw out the case because the case was filed in the wrong court, declining to weigh in on the merits of the issue.",
      "The Supreme Court also handed the Trump administration a temporary win by blocking a lower court's ruling that barred the Trump administration from firing thousands of probationary government employees without cause. The district judge who blocked the firings slammed the Trump administration for using a \"sham\" and \"gimmick\" to fire thousands of federal workers.",
      "\"I just want to say it is a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that's a lie,\" U.S. District Judge William Alsup said. \"That should not have been done in our country. It was a sham in order to try to avoid statutory requirements.\"",
      "But the Supreme Court vacated his order because the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit -- a group of unions and interest groups -- lacked the legal standing to bring the lawsuit.",
      "Over the next month, the Supreme Court is set to hold oral arguments for the first time in a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's attempt to eliminate birthright citizenship as guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, which confers American citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil regardless of their parents' immigration or citizenship status.",
      "The Trump administration also asked the Supreme Court to take up a legal challenge to the Pentagon's transgender service ban after three judges blocked it from taking effect.",
      "Despite President Trump's vow to restore free speech and end censorship, his administration has faced multiple lawsuits challenging his actions on the grounds they violate the First Amendment.",
      "Four law firms have sued the Trump administration after they were targeted for their past work, with each firm arguing the Trump administration unlawfully retaliated against them and violated their First Amendment rights. Judges have temporarily blocked the Trump administration from targeting Susman Godfrey LLP, Jenner & Block LLP, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, and Perkins Coie LLP.",
      "\"The framers of our Constitution would see this as a shocking abuse of power,\" U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan said regarding the order targeting Susman Godfrey LLP.",
      "At least nine law firms have already acquiesced to the Trump administration's demands, agreeing to donate a total of $940 million in legal services to promote causes supported by the president.",
      "After the Trump administration attempted to freeze more than $2 billion dollars in federal funding to Harvard University, the country's oldest school cited the First Amendment in their lawsuit challenging the funding freeze, arguing the \"threat of additional funding cuts will chill Harvard's exercise of its First Amendment rights.\" More than two in three Americans support Harvard in their ongoing dispute with the Trump administration, according to an ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll.",
      "\"Harvard will be unable to make decisions regarding its faculty hiring, academic programs, student admissions, and other core academic matters without fear that those decisions will run afoul of government censors' views on acceptable levels of ideological or viewpoint diversity on campus,\" Harvard\u2019s lawyers argued.",
      "At least nine current or recent students have challenged the Trump administration's attempt to revoke their visas or green cards, with several alleging they were targeted for their outspoken support of Palestinians. The Trump administration's policy of revoking student visas marks the government's most aggressive approach in more than two decades and the first time students have been targeted over their speech, according to immigration attorney Renata Castro.",
      "\"The government is looking at speech -- the exercise of free speech -- and using that to dig into perceived immigration violations so that they can revoke student visas,\" Castro said.",
      "The Trump administration also invoked a rarely used law -- 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 237 (a)(4)(C)(i) -- to justify removing noncitizens such as Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident who was a prominent figure during student protests at Columbia, because he and others allegedly harm U.S. foreign policy.",
      "According to an analysis of past immigration cases conducted by political scientists Graeme Blair and David Hausman, the United States had only used that provision as a basis to remove a noncitizen two times in the last 25 years.",
      "\"The Trump administration is targeting me as part of a broader strategy to suppress dissent,\" Khalil wrote in a public letter last month from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana. \"At stake are not just our voices, but the fundamental civil liberties of all.\"",
      "Earlier this month, an immigration judge ruled that Khalil can be deported on the grounds that he threatens U.S. foreign policy. While he remained in ICE detention and prepared an appeal, Khalil\u2019s wife gave birth to their child last week.",

      "The division was established in the wake of the 1950s Civil Rights movement.",
      "The Justice Department's division tasked with enforcing the nation's federal civil rights laws has recently seen a mass exodus of \"over 100\" attorneys, the newly confirmed official leading the division said in an interview this week.",
      "\"What we have made very clear last week in memos to each of the 11 sections in the Civil Rights Division is that our priorities under President Trump are going to be somewhat different than they were under President Biden,\" DOJ Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said in an interview with conservative host Glenn Beck. \"And then we tell them, these are the President's priorities, this is what we will be focusing on \u2014 you know, govern yourself accordingly. And en masse, dozens and now over 100 attorneys decided that they'd rather not do what their job requires them to do.\"",
      "The resignations come as Dhillon and Attorney General Pam Bondi have made clear the priorities of the division -- which was established in the wake of the Civil Rights movement in the 1950s -- would shift away from priorities like enforcing voting rights laws and cracking down on unconstitutional policing to culture war issues touted by President Trump in his 2024 campaign.",
      "In recent weeks, the department has said it would pursue legal action against states that permit transgender athletes to participate in girls' and women's sports, withdrawn from a Biden-era lawsuit against Georgia's voting laws and convened a task force to investigate incidents of \"anti-Christian bias.\"",
      "Of the recent resignations, Dhillon said in the interview that she thinks it's \"fine\" the attorneys opted to leave.",
      "\"We don't want people in the federal government who feel like it's their pet project to go persecute, you know, police departments based on statistical evidence or persecute people praying outside abortion facilities instead of doing violence,\" Dhillon said. \"That's not the job here. The job here is to enforce the federal civil rights laws, not woke ideology.\"",
      "At the same time, Dhillon said in the interview she was seeking to staff up the division so they could pursue issues like the administration's actions targeting Harvard University.",
      "\"You need more lawyers, investigators and commitment to do the work, and you need the people in the United States identifying these things for us,\" Dhillon said. \"We're going to run out of attorneys to work on these things at some point.\"",
      "Several top Democrats sent a letter to Bondi, Dhillon and DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz Monday raising concerns over what they described as the \"politicization\" of the DOJ's civil rights division.",

      "GOP hopes to reshape spending to align with the president\u2019s domestic agenda.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson met with President Donald Trump Monday afternoon in the Oval Office, where they huddled over the GOP's political strategy heading into a pivotal period of legislative business -- with their congressional majorities on the line.",
      "As Congress returns to Washington following a two-week recess and the president approaches 100 days in office, Republicans hope to sharply reshape federal spending to align with the president's domestic agenda.",
      "After meeting with the president, Johnson returned to the Capitol to meet with top administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and leading congressional Republicans grappling over budget reconciliation.",
      "\"We're working on the big, beautiful bill, the reconciliation bill,\" Johnson told reporters. \"Now is game time as the big developments will be coming together. We're excited about that. I think it's going to be a great piece of legislation.\"",
      "Flanked by White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and James Blair, assistant to the president, Bessent told reporters after the meeting on Monday that he found \u201cgreat unity\u201d among congressional Republican leaders, with the House and Senate moving quickly and \"in lockstep\" on a budget bill focused on Trump\u2019s priorities.",
      "The meeting included Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Johnson, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith.",
      "\u201cWe think that they are in a substantial agreement, and that this is going to be a win for the American people. Very-pro growth,\u201d Bessent continued.",
      "He said there were \u201cthree legs\u201d to the president's economic agenda: trade, tax and deregulation. He said they hoped to get the tax portion of the budget package done by July 4.",
      "\u201cBoth sides have proposals in front of the President, and we think there's a path to deliver the requisite spending reforms to get a great pro-growth tax package, along with the president's priorities that he laid out on the campaign trail,\u201d Bessent said.",
      "Hassett reiterated Trump\u2019s claim that a billionaire tax cut is off the table. Bessent said priorities for the package would be to make tax cuts and the Jobs Act permanent, no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime, and deductibility for loans for American-made cars.",
      "Asked if Bessent's July 4 timeline was realistic, Thune said, \"I think so. You know, I mean, it's, it all depends on how progress goes in the next few weeks.\"",
      "\"I think we, everybody, feels like we're making significant progress in trying to get the House, the Senate and the White House, kind of in the same place. But it's going to take time. It's complicated -- a lot of moving parts,\" Thune said.",
      "Republicans have begun releasing legislative text to codify their lofty ambitions to cut at least $2 trillion from federal spending over the next decade, with six markups scheduled this week and additional hearings anticipated in the coming weeks as conservatives face the latest test of their narrow majority.",
      "\"It's going to solve a lot of problems,\" Johnson predicted. \"It's going to be a turbo-boost for the economy, and we're looking forward to getting that done.\"",
      "But as Trump reaches his 100th day in office this week, polling shows the public souring on the president's job performance. Nevertheless, Johnson maintains the belief that the GOP is poised to defend its narrow majority -- claiming Republicans \"are playing offense.\"",
      "\"We talked about the upcoming races, the midterm elections and we're very bullish on it,\" Johnson proclaimed. \"There's 13 Democrats sitting in districts that President Trump won. Those are the obvious targets. We have an offensive map. There's only three House Republicans sitting in districts that Kamala Harris won. So it's a lopsided map, it gives us a great opportunity and we're going to go make history.\"",
      "Still, Johnson acknowledged there have been some ups and downs in the early stages of the administration.",
      "\"These presidential terms are roller-coaster sometimes. There's been a little tumult in the markets with the tariff policy and all of that, but I think this is settling out,\" Johnson said. \"People are in very good spirits. They understand that this is a long game to be played.\"",

      "Donald Trump has the lowest 100-day job approval rating of any president in the past 80 years, with public pushback on many of his policies and extensive economic discontent, including broad fears of a recession, according to a new ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll.",
      "Yet he still beats the Democrats in Congress in terms of trust to handle the nation's main problems.",
      "Thirty-nine percent of respondents in this ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll said they approve of how Trump is handling his job as president, down 6 percentage points from February, while 55% said they disapprove.",
      "The previous low in approval for a president at or near 100 days in office, in polls dating to 1945, was Trump's 42% in 2017.",
      "Perhaps most threatening to Trump, given his promise of an economic turnaround, is the extent of negative views on the economy: Seventy-two percent said they think it's very or somewhat likely that his economic policies will cause a recession in the short term.",
      "Seventy-three percent said the economy is in bad shape, 53% said it's gotten worse since Trump took office and 41% said their own finances have worsened -- which is as many as those who said so under President Joe Biden last summer.",
      "Sixty-two percent said prices, which as a candidate, Trump pledged to curb, are rising. Seventy-one percent said they see his tariffs as a negative factor in price inflation. And just 31% in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates with fieldwork by Ipsos, said they accept Trump's argument that the economy will emerge with a stronger foundation for the long term.",
      "Negative assessments go beyond the economy. Sixty-five percent said Trump's administration is trying to avoid complying with federal court orders, and 64% said he's going too far in trying to expand presidential powers.",
      "Sixty-two percent said they don't think his administration respects the rule of law.",
      "Majorities also expressed concern that the president will do too much to reduce the size and role of government (58%), argued he's acted beyond his authority as president without justification (56%) and doubted the Trump administration's commitment to protecting citizens' rights and freedoms (55%).",
      "See PDF for full results.",
      "Anywhere from 57% to 67% of Americans said they disapprove of Trump's performance on six of seven issues tested in this survey, including at least 6 in 10 on his handling of stock market volatility, tariffs, foreign relations and the economy overall.",
      "Fewer, 53%, said they disapprove of his handling of immigration.",
      "Six in 10 or more said they oppose various administration initiatives, peaking at 77% opposed to cuts in federal funding for medical research.",
      "Seventy percent were opposed to increasing the federal government's role in how private universities are run, 67% were opposed to ending birthright citizenship and 66% were opposed to closing the Department of Education.",
      "As reported Friday, opposition to deporting immigrants is lower, 51%. Additionally, on university governance, the public sided with Harvard University over the Trump administration in their dispute, 66%-32%.",
      "In another gauge, 57% said Trump is \"going too far\" in closing federal agencies, and it's about the same, 56%, in both laying off federal employees and in taking action against his political opponents.",
      "This eases to about half on ending diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, reflecting the public's divide on whether DEI efforts help level the playing field (51%) or create unfair discrimination (47%).",
      "In a positive for the president, more people said they believe waste throughout the federal government has decreased rather than increased under Trump, 43%-25%. The rest said it's stayed the same.",
      "That doesn't carry over in perceptions of fraud: Thirty-four percent said they think this has increased, while 32% said it has decreased.",
      "Another question, raised by Trump's comprehensive efforts to reshape the government, found that 49% think the president is moving the country away from its founding principles, while 34% think he's moving it closer toward them. Seventeen percent said they don't think he's moving it either way.",
      "Approval",
      "At 39%, Trump's job approval rating is down from 45% in a Washington Post/Ipsos poll in February. It now almost exactly matches his average, 40%, across his first term -- tied with Biden for the lowest presidential career average available, dating back to President Harry Truman.",
      "Notably, just 21% now said they \"strongly\" approve of Trump's work in office, his lowest percentage on record. About twice as many, 44%, said they strongly disapprove.",
      "Trump's approval rating from non-college-educated white men, a core support group, is 54%, tying his low in this group from his first term.",
      "That may reflect that 43% of non-college-educated white men said the nation's economy has worsened under Trump, and a third said they have gotten less well off financially since he's taken office.",
      "Trump is also tied with his previous lows in approval among Democrats and liberals.",
      "Still, Trump is hanging on to the vast bulk of his voters.",
      "Among people who voted for him in November, just 6% said they now regret it, while 94% said it was the right thing to do. (Buyer's regret was even lower, 2%, at this point in his first term, a 4-point swing.)",
      "In another gauge of partisanship, 83% of Republicans said they approve of Trump's work in office, while 93% of Democrats and 60% of independents said they disapprove.",
      "A difference is that 51% of Republicans strongly approve of Trump, while 85% of Democrats strongly disapprove. So do 44% of independents, three times as many as those who strongly approve.",
      "Trump's ratings on individual issues, absent immigration, are also underwater.",
      "Sixty-seven percent said they disapprove of his handling of the recent turmoil in the stock market.",
      "The S&P 500 is down 8.7% since Trump took office.",
      "On tariffs, 64% said they disapprove; on both the economy overall and U.S. relations with other countries, 61% said they disapprove; on looking out for the interests of average Americans, 58% said they disapprove; and on managing the federal government, 57% said they disapprove.",
      "The opposition",
      "The silver lining for Trump is that the opposition party remains out of favor.",
      "People said they trust him over the Democrats in Congress to handle the nation's main problems by 37%-30%. Underscoring bipartisan disaffection, 30% said they don't trust either party.",
      "Further, while 60% said Trump is out of touch with the concerns of most people in the country, even more, 69%, said the Democratic Party is out of touch. It's 64% for the Republican Party overall.",
      "There are some telling partisan gaps.",
      "In the political middle, 62% of independents said Trump is out of touch, while substantially more, 76%, said the Democratic Party is out of touch. And in their own camps, relatively few Republicans said Trump is out of touch, 19%, while twice as many Democrats, 38%, said this about their own party.",
      "At the same time, more people said both parties should be doing more to oppose Trump rather than more to support him -- the Democratic Party by 46%-38% and the Republican Party by 50%-26%, with the rest saying each party is handling this about right.",
      "In both cases, independents help tip the balance to opposing versus supporting Trump.",
      "Courts and Compliance",
      "In terms of the legal battles over Trump's moves, people widely rejected the administration's accusations of improper judicial interference.",
      "Most, 62%-35%, said federal judges are trying to enforce existing limits on Trump's legal authority rather than trying to interfere with his authority.",
      "An even wider margin of people, 67%-31%, said federal judges should have the authority to block an administration policy until a trial is held if they think it will harm people and is probably illegal.",
      "Further, people said by a margin of 67%-31% that they think the Trump administration is trying to avoid complying with court orders regarding its activities rather than trying to comply with those orders.",
      "Cutting government",
      "Majority perceptions of presidential overreach are common.",
      "As mentioned, 58% said they express concern that Trump will do too much to reduce the size and role of the federal government. That's essentially a mirror of attitudes under Biden: Fifty-nine percent said they were concerned he'd do too much to increase the government's size and role.",
      "The difference is in partisan divisions, reflecting sharply different views of government between Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents on one hand and Republicans and Republican-leaning independents on the other.",
      "In the Democratic group, 91% said they are concerned Trump will do too much to shrink the size and role of government, while 26% in the Republican group said the same.",
      "In 2021, by contrast, 87% in the GOP camp said they were concerned that Biden would go too far to increase the government's size and role, while 31% in the Democratic group said so.",
      "Views on the Trump administration cutting federal regulations are more closely divided.",
      "Fifty-two percent said they think it will cut regulations that are needed to protect public health and safety, while 46% instead said they think it will cut unnecessary regulations while keeping those that are needed.",
      "Foreign relations and Russia",
      "In the last area covered by this survey, respondents by 49%-34% said they think Trump has weakened rather than strengthened U.S. leadership in the world.",
      "While still negative, that's better than Biden's 48%-23% result on the same question in 2022.",
      "Regarding Russia, 46% said Trump's approach is too friendly, while 11% said it's too confrontational and 40% said it's about right. That's similar to what it was in a January 2017 poll.",
      "This survey was completed before the administration's move in the past week, pressuring Ukraine to accept a ceasefire deal favorable to Russia.",
      "Methodology: This ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel\u00ae April 18-22, 2025, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,464 adults. Partisan divisions are 30%-30%-29%, Democrats-Republicans-independents.",
      "Results have a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points, including the design effect. Error margins are larger for subgroups. Sampling error is not the only source of differences in polls.",

    "summary": "The Democrats \u201curgently\u201d called for the White House to issue the full disclosure of financial transactions of senior officials amid Trump's tariff rollbacks.",
    "story": [
      "They're calling for full disclosure of officials' financial transactions.",
      "Democratic lawmakers are \"urgently\" calling for the White House to issue a full disclosure of financial transactions leading up to President Donald Trump's sudden pause on a sweeping set of tariffs earlier this month, raising concerns that people close to the president \"potentially violated federal ethics and insider trading laws\" surrounding his actions.",
      "Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Rep. Mike Levin, D-Calif., sent a letter on Monday, signed by a group of 23 other Democrats, to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, calling for a commitment from all senior White House and executive branch employees to \"expeditiously\" transmit all reports related to their securities transactions since the start of Trump's term to the Office of Government Ethics, requesting, too, that all of this mandatory reporting be made public.",
      "The letter, shared first with ABC News, also asks that any extensions granted to White House employees related to their accounting reports become public, noting that this was practiced during the first Trump administration.",
      "\"We are concerned that no periodic transaction reports have been posted on the OGE database for White House officials' individual disclosures at any point since President Trump took office on January 20, 2025,\" Schiff and Levin wrote.",
      "\"There is reason to doubt that not a single senior White House official or employee has made any financial transactions triggering a periodic transaction report since the start of the Administration,\" the letter continued. \"As an important point of reference, during the first Trump Administration, periodic transaction reports filed by senior White House officials were made publicly available on the OGE's disclosure database, as required by the Ethics in Government Act and the STOCK Act.\"",
      "Kush Desai, a spokesperson for the White House, responded to the letter by suggesting that Schiff should shift his focus surrounding insider trading to his fellow California lawmaker, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has faced allegations of trading on insider information during her time in Congress but has denied any impropriety.",
      "\"If Adam Schiff is concerned about insider trading, he should start by probing his fellow California Democrat Nancy Pelosi,\" Desai said in a statement to ABC News.",
      "Hours before Trump announced he was rolling back tariffs to 10% to all countries except China, which sent the stock market soaring, he posted on Truth Social: \"BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!\" and \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT.\"",
      "Stocks were down the morning before Trump's Truth Social post. Nasdaq soared 12.1% at close, the index's largest single-day gain since 2021, while the Dow jumped 7.8%, its biggest one-day increase in five years.",
      "\"Newly identified data raises concerns about potential violations of federal ethics and insider trading laws by individuals close to the President with access to non-public information,\" Schiff and Levin's letter reads.",
      "Trump has said he hasn't engaged in insider trading himself -- but that he couldn't definitively claim that members of his administration have not. \"I can commit to myself, that's all I can commit to,\" Trump told reporters on Friday, when asked whether he could assure Americans that no one in his administration was insider trading with information about trade deals coming together.",
      "Trump said he hires \"honorable people\" but said, \"I have thousands of people that work for me, but I can't imagine anybody doing that.\"",
      "The Democrats requested a response from Wiles no later than May 9, 2025, and for a \"detailed plan\" for how the administration plans to address any officials and employees who may have failed to file required disclosures from the start of the administration.",
      "\"By failing to take these steps, the Administration would be withholding critical information from the American people regarding potential violations of federal ethics and insider trading laws. We look forward to reviewing all required reports and disclosures,\" Schiff and Levin wrote.",
      "\"Senior White House officials have influence over or become witting of consequential policy decisions that can have market moving impacts,\" the letter said. \"It is critical that such officials adhere to all applicable ethics, conflict of interest, and disclosure requirements.\"",
      "\"The American public deserves nothing less than full transparency, particularly in the context of the harm done to pension funds and retirement savings as a result of the President's erratic trade policy,\" it continued",
      "The letter was signed by Sens. Chris Van Hollen, Elizabeth Warren, Jeffrey Merkley and Elissa Slotkin, as well as Reps. Brad Sherman, Brad Schneider, Angie Craig, Jerry Nadler, Rashida Tlaib, Cleo Fields, Yassamin Ansari, Seth Magaziner, Pramila Jayapal, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Nanette Diaz Barraga\u0301n, Mark DeSaulnier, Madeleine Dean and Delia Ramirez.",
      "Schiff had previously written to Wiles and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer over the rollbacks on Trump's tariffs. In that letter, sent with Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., Schiff asked for an investigation into potential conflicts of interest. Schiff has not received a response from Wiles following his request, a spokesperson for the senator told ABC News.",

    "story": [
      "\"Our country will be 'woke' no longer,\" Trump said.",
      "In a speech to a joint session of Congress in March, President Donald Trump took direct aim at diversity, equity and inclusion policies, saying hiring and promotion practices should be based on merit, not race and gender.",
      "\"We've ended the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be 'woke' no longer,\" said Trump, using the term some conservatives have adopted to negatively describe progressive values.",
      "In the first 100 days of his new administration, Trump has wielded the power of the Oval Office in an attempt to root out DEI programs beyond the federal government, threatening to withhold billions of dollars in federal funding and grants from universities, including Harvard University, unless they fall in line.",
      "A new ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll released on Sunday indicated that the country is almost evenly split on the issue. While 51% of respondents said they believe DEI efforts help level the playing field, 47% said such policies create unfair discrimination.",
      "Despite the president's claim that DEI in America is history, supporters say Trump's war against what they refer to as \"wokeism\" is far from over.",
      "\"It's definitely not over. And those of us who want to see corporate America get back to neutral and focusing on uniting Americans around creating value rather than dividing us on the basis of race and sex, we have a long, long way to go,\" said Stefan Padfield, executive director of the Free Enterprise Project, which is part of National Center for Public Policy Research, a non-partisan conservative think tank in Washington, D.C.",
      "Padfield said one of his primary focuses is on \"reversing what we might refer to as the woke capture of corporate America\" by filing shareholder proposals, engaging in litigation and conducting educational research across the nation.\"",
      "\"One of the things that I and others on our side are concerned about is this idea and this notion that somehow we've won,\" Padfield told ABC News.",
      "Using the analogy of the Allied troops storming the beach at Normandy during the 1944 D-Day invasion, Padfield said, \"Could you imagine if the Allied forces just packed up and left and claimed to have won World War II after they took Normandy beach? It would be a very different world.\"",
      "\"So, we've got a very long march to go and certainly the proponents of DEI and related ESG [environmental, social and governance] agendas, they're making very clear that they're not going to go quietly, certainly,\" Padfield said.",
      "In a letter dated Feb. 12, 2025, a coalition of the nation's largest civil and human rights organizations, including the NAACP and the National Urban League, asked for an urgent meeting with congressional leadership \"to discuss actionable steps to protect diversity, equity, and inclusion programs to ensure equal opportunity for all Americans.\"",
      "The letter was addressed to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. \"We are deeply concerned about the recent executive actions by the Trump Administration that seek to undo decades of bipartisan support for civil and human rights,\" the coalition wrote.",
      "\"Diversity is and will always be one of America\u2019s greatest strengths because a diverse America is an innovative and prosperous America,\" the letter said. \"Diversifying our institutions, providing opportunities, and working to ensure that everyone is included are not partisan values. These values strengthen our nation and are rooted in our country\u2019s history of advancing equal opportunity and 'liberty and justice for all.'\"",
      "The letter goes on to characterize the actions taken by the Trump administration as \"misguided\" and, according to the coalition, \"seek to erode progress and stifle opportunity for all.\"",
      "The letter emphasizes that America\u2019s strength and leadership \"in an increasingly diverse and competitive world depends on our ability to be an inclusive society.\" It goes on to say that history has shown that without clear-cut guidelines that encourage diversity, equity and inclusion, institutions will \"continue discriminatory and exclusionary patterns that hold us all back.\"",
      "Some corporations have taken Trump's cue and have started to eliminate or roll back DEI programs. After Minnesota-based retailer Target announced in January that it would phase out some of its DEI initiatives, the Rev. Jamal Bryant, senior pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, a megachurch in the Atlanta suburb of Stonecrest, Georgia, organized a 40-day \"fast\" of Target.",
      "Bryant said he encouraged followers of his movement to fight back with their pocketbooks and not shop at the chain's stores from the first day of Lent, March 5, until Easter Sunday.",
      "In an interview with ABC News, Bryant said he announced at his church on Easter that the \"fast\" is now a full-fledged boycott of Target.",
      "\"We began the boycott against Target because the Black community felt betrayed,\" Bryant said.",
      "Among the programs Target said it is phasing out is one established in the wake of the 2020 police-involved killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man. The program assists Black employees in building meaningful careers and promoting Black-owned businesses.",
      "\"For them to roll back DEI, it was felt as a slap in the face,\" Bryant said.",
      "Bryant noted that the Montgomery bus boycott led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1955 and 1956 lasted 381 days.",
      "\"We have just been boycotting Target for 10 weeks and I think that the African American community is resolved that we\u2019re not going back into the store until we see a market change,\" Bryant said.",
      "In response to the boycott, Target, which has 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said in a April 23 statement, \"We have an ongoing commitment to creating a welcoming environment for all team members, guests, and suppliers.\"",
      "\"It's core to how we support and grow our business,\" Target said. \"We remain focused on supporting organizations and creating opportunities for people in the 2,000 communities where we live and operate.\"",
      "But Target isn't the only major U.S. company scaling back on DEI programs. McDonald's, Meta, Walmart, Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson have all announced they are eliminating some DEI programs.",
      "Some of the companies changed their DEI programs after coming under pressure from conservative groups.",
      "Conservative political commentator and anti-woke activist Robby Starbuck publicly attacked Walmart's DEI programs. This prompted the big-box retail giant to announce it was rolling back diversity policies and pivoting from the term DEI in internal communications.",
      "After Walmart said it was eliminating the use of the phrase \"DEI\" altogether, Starbuck said in a social media post, \"This is the biggest win yet for our movement to end wokeness in corporate America.\"",
      "In a statement to ABC News, Walmart said, \"Our purpose, to help people save money and live better, has been at our core since our founding 62 years ago and continues to guide us today. We can deliver on it because we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also threatened to withhold federal funding and grants from universities nationwide that decline to roll back DEI programs or curb protests on campuses, including pro-Palestinian demonstrations that the administration deems antisemitic.",
      "Some universities have fought back against the administration.",
      "The Trump administration threatened to withhold from Harvard University $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $60 million in multi-year contract value after demanding that the school end its DEI programs, adopt what the administration deems merit-based admissions, and cooperate with immigration authorities.",
      "But Harvard President Alan Garber has refused to give in to the White House's demands, writing in an April 14 letter addressed to members of the Harvard community, that the school \"will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights\" by agreeing to the terms proposed by the Trump administration.",
      "On April 21, Harvard sued the Trump administration, asking a Massachusetts federal judge to block Trump's funding freeze, arguing that it is \"unlawful and beyond the government's authority.\" Harvard also argued that by withholding funds, the Trump administration is violating the First Amendment, flouting federal law, and threatening life-saving research.",
      "\"All told, the tradeoff put to Harvard and other universities is clear: Allow the Government to micromanage your academic institution or jeopardize the institution's ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries, and innovative solutions,\" Harvard's lawyers wrote.",
      "Trump's Department of Education has also attempted to pressure public schools K-12 to do away with DEI programs or risk losing federal funding. Education groups sued the administration over the move.",
      "Federal judges in both Maryland and New Hampshire issued rulings this month siding with the education groups.",
      "\"This Court takes no view as to whether the policies at issue here are good or bad, prudent or foolish, fair or unfair,\" wrote U.S. District Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher of Maryland, a Trump appointee, on Thursday. \"But this Court is constitutionally required to closely scrutinize whether the government went about creating and implementing them in the manner the law requires. The government did not.\"",
      "New Hampshire U.S. District Court Judge Landya McCafferty also issued an order Thursday partially blocking the Department of Education from withholding funding to public schools that did not end DEI programs.",
      "\"Ours is a nation deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom, which is of transcendent value to all of us and not merely to the teachers concerned,\" McCafferty wrote, adding the \"right to speak freely and to promote diversity of ideas and programs is\u2026one of the chief distinctions that sets us apart from totalitarian regimes.\"",
      "The Department of Education did not immediately respond to the rulings on Thursday.",
      "Supporters of doing away with DEI programs claim the policies are racist, discriminatory and further divide the nation, while advocates for keeping the programs argue it is racist, discriminatory and divisive to end them.",
      "Rev. Bryant told ABC News that he believes Trump is pursuing his \"war on woke\" to appeal to his base.",
      "\"I think he's playing to his base of uneducated white males, who for some reason feel threatened,\" Bryant said. \"They\u2019re getting ready to see that America is better when we're together, not when we are segregated.\"",
      "Bryant said Trump's fight against wokeism has been an attack on civil rights that demonstrators have shed blood and died for going back to the 1950s and 1960s.",
      "\"It looks like we\u2019re going back to yesteryear and it\u2019s a very disturbing probability,\" Bryant said.",
      "On the other hand, Padfield described most DEI programs in corporate America as \"overt racial discrimination.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s problematic because it sets the corporation up for legal liability and it\u2019s problematic on a moral basis because that\u2019s not the country that we want to live in, where some of our most powerful institutions have decided that the way to get what they want in terms of demographic outcomes is just start brazenly and, in fact, proudly, discriminating on the basis of race and sex,\" Padfield said.",
      "Padfield added, \u201cThe problem is that the pro-DEI solution actually makes things worse and divides us further. And what I\u2019m hoping for is that ultimately corporate America wakes up and starts addressing these inequalities on a colorblind basis.\"",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency says consumers across the U.S. will still be able to buy cheaper E15 gasoline this summer",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- Consumers across the U.S. still will be able to buy higher-ethanol blend E15 gasoline this summer, the Environmental Protection Agency announced Monday, saving them a little money at the pump but risking potential damage to the air and water.",
      "The emergency waiver issued by the EPA prevents retailers in most states from having to stop selling E15 gasoline on May 1. While the waiver remains in effect only through May 20, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin signaled that he plans to keep issuing waivers through Sept. 15, the date when the federal government typically would allow E15 sales in all states again.",
      "Most gasoline sold across the U.S. is blended with 10% ethanol, but 15% blends are becoming increasingly common, particularly in the Midwest, where most of the nation's corn is grown. E15 gasoline generally costs at least 10 cents less a gallon than E10 gasoline, but the EPA had previously prohibited its sale during the summer over concerns that its use during the summer driving season could increase smog.",
      "But the EPA has relaxed restrictions on E15, granting a series of short-term waivers in 2022, 2023 and 2024 to allow its sale nationwide through the summer. And last year, the EPA issued a rule allowing year-round sales in eight Midwestern states \u2014 Iowa, usually the nation's top corn producer, as well as Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin.",
      "Trump administration officials said Monday's action will lower consumers' costs and give them more choices at the pump while also increasing the demand for corn. They also described it as reducing America's reliance on imported energy.",
      "\u201cOur nation\u2019s great corn growers are critical to helping the U.S. achieve energy independence, which is essential to national security,\u201d Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement.",
      "While the ethanol industry and Iowa officials praised the EPA's action, the Renewable Fuels Association, a trade group for ethanol producers, argued that Congress should approve legislation allowing year-round E15 sales across the U.S.",
      "\u201cFor the economic and energy security benefits of E15 to be fully realized, the marketplace needs long-term certainty,\u201d President and CEO Geoff Cooper said.",
      "The biofuels industry and politicians in both major parties argue that ethanol helps farmers, lowers prices at the pump and reduces greenhouse gas because the fuel burns more cleanly than straight gasoline.",
      "But ethanol consumes about 40% of the nation's corn crop, and environmentalists argue that higher corn production leads to higher use of fertilizers that are a leading source of water pollution.",
      "Zack Pistora, Kansas lobbyist for the Sierra Club, said ethanol plants also use high amounts of water, and states like Kansas are worried about the depletion of aquifers. He said it's \u201chypocritical\u201d to portray ethanol as environmentally friendly and said the Trump administration should promote renewable energy, electric vehicles, public transportation and sustainable agriculture.",
      "\u201cWe need to dramatically reduce our fossil fuel dependence, but relying on corn-based ethanol doesn\u2019t put our country on the path it needs,\u201d Pistora said in an interview.",

      "The woman, a neighborhood resident in her 30s, told The Associated Press she learned of the protest after hearing police helicopters over her apartment. She walked over to investigate around 10:30 p.m. but by then the protest had mostly disbursed. Not wanting to be filmed, she covered her face with a scarf.",

      "\u201cThis is America,\u201d one of the men can be heard saying. \u201cWe got Israel. We got an Army now.\u201d",
      "At one point, she and the police officer were nearly cornered against a building, the video shows.",
      "\u201cI felt sheer terror,\u201d the woman recalled. \u201cI realized at that point that I couldn\u2019t lead this mob of men to my home. I had nowhere to go. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I was just terrified.\u201d",
      "After several blocks, the officer hustled the woman into a police vehicle, prompting one man to yell, \u201cGet her!\u201d The crowd erupted in cheers as she was driven away.",
      "The woman, a lifelong New Yorker, said she was left with bruises and mentally shaken by the episode, which she said police should investigate as an act of hate.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m afraid to move around the neighborhood where I\u2019ve lived for a decade,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like anyone in any position of power really cares.\u201d",
      "A police spokesperson said one person was arrested and five others were issued summons following the demonstration, but did not say whether anyone involved in assaulting the woman was charged.",
      "Mayor Eric Adams said Sunday that police were investigating \u201ca series of incidents stemming from clashing protests on Thursday that began when a group of anti-Israel protesters surrounded the Chabad Lubavitch World Headquarters \u2014 a Jewish house of worship \u2014 in Brooklyn.\u201d",
      "He said police had spoken to a different woman on the pro-Palestinian side of the protest who suffered injuries after she was harassed by counter-protesters. Photos shared online showed that woman with blood streaming down her face.",
      "\u201cLet me be clear: None of this is acceptable, in fact, it is despicable,\u201d Adams added. \u201cNew York City will always be a place where people can peacefully protest, but we will not tolerate violence, trespassing, menacing, or threatening.\u201d",
      "The protest was one of several in recent days against Ben-Gvir, an ultranationalist settler leader who is embarking on his first U.S. state visit since joining Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet three years ago.",
      "Previously convicted in Israel of racist incitement and support for a terrorist group, he has called on his supporters to confront Palestinians and assert \u201cJewish Power.\"",
      "The protest against Ben-Gvir\u2019s Brooklyn appearance generated condemnations from some Jewish groups, who accused participants of targeting a religious site.",

      "A Chabad-Lubavitch spokesman, Rabbi Motti Seligson, denounced both the anti-Ben-Gvir protesters and the mob that chased the woman.",
      "\u201cThe violent provocateurs who called for the genocide of Jews in support of terrorists and terrorism \u2014 outside a synagogue, in a Jewish neighborhood, where some of the worst antisemitic violence in American history was perpetrated, and where many residents share deep bonds with the victims of Oct 7 \u2014 did so in order to intimidate, provoke, and instill fear,\u201d Seligson said.",
      "\u201cWe condemn the crude language and violence of the small breakaway group of young people; such actions are entirely unacceptable and wholly antithetical to the Torah\u2019s values. The fact that a possibly uninvolved bystander got pulled into the melee further underscores the point,\u201d he said.",

      "Former Grand Rapids police officer Christopher Schurr is set to stand trial in the death of Patrick Lyoya, a 26-year old man and Congolese immigrant who was shot and killed by the officer three years ago",
      "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- The trial of a former Michigan police officer charged with second-degree murder in the killing of a 26-year-old Black man is set to begin in Grand Rapids, three years after the case sparked weeks of protest and national outrage.",
      "Patrick Lyoya, a Congolese immigrant who sought refuge with his family in the U.S. to flee violence in his home country, was fatally shot by former officer Christopher Schurr, who is white.",
      "Lyoya was shot in the back of the head while facedown on the ground following a traffic stop. Schurr\u2019s attorneys argue he acted in self-defense.",
      "Opening statements in the trial begin Monday in downtown Grand Rapids and the trial is expected to last at least a week.",
      "Here is what to know.",
      "Schurr pulled over a vehicle driven by Lyoya over improper license plates on a rainy morning April 4, 2022, in a Grand Rapids residential neighborhood.",
      "Body camera footage and dash camera footage shows Lyoya run from Schurr after the officer asks for his driver's license. Schurr tackles Lyoya and a struggle ensues as Schurr attempts to shoot his Taser at Lyoya.",
      "Schurr\u2019s body camera footage appears to show Lyoya reaching for the officer\u2019s Taser. The body camera footage goes out before the shooting.",
      "A passenger of the vehicle recorded a video. The cellphone footage shows the officer tell Lyoya to let go of the Taser multiple times.",
      "While Lyoya is facedown on the ground and Schurr is on top of him, the officer takes out his firearm and shoots Lyoya in the back of the head.",
      "Lyoya\u2019s family has said he came to the U.S. to get away from prolonged civil unrest involving several rebel groups vying for control of territories in the mineral-rich eastern Congo. He was raising two children in Grand Rapids, a city of around 200,000 people located about 150 miles (240 kilometers) northwest of Detroit.",
      "After fleeing violence back home, Lyoya ultimately joined a list of names of Black immigrants who sought better lives in the U.S. only to suffer abuse or death at the hands of law enforcement.",
      "Before him, there was Botham Jean, Amadou Diallo and Abner Louima, all men whose cases increased awareness around the global impact of systemic racism in policing.",
      "The Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader who eulogized Lyoya at his 2022 funeral, noted then that Lyoya was killed on April 4, the anniversary of the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Lyoya came to America in search of a better life and \u201cran into an America that we know too well,\u201d Sharpton said.",
      "Lyoya\u2019s killing prompted weeks of protest in the west Michigan city and calls to reform the police department.",
      "Schurr, now 34, was fired by the police department shortly after he was charged with one count of second-degree murder in June 2022.",
      "He had worked for the department for seven years.",
      "Schurr has said he acted in self-defense while prosecutors say the use of lethal force was unnecessary and excessive. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison.",
      "The role of the Taser is likely to play a significant role in Schurr's defense. Prosecutors have argued the Taser already had been deployed and therefore did not pose a threat to Schurr.",
      "Tasers are generally considered non-lethal by police but the narrative often flips when handled by someone who is not law enforcement, said Ian Adams, a professor of criminology at the University of South Carolina.",
      "Whether Schurr gave proper warning of his use of lethal force also will likely be of note to the jury, Adams said.",
      "\u201cIn the video, you can hear the officer say, \u2018Drop the taser,\u2019 which is a command,\" Adams said. \u201cBut whether or not it\u2019s a warning that an officer is about to use lethal force is going to be contested.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a highly salient case in U.S. policing right now,\u201d Adams said.",
      "Charles Joe Key, who has testified as a consulting witness in police use of force in a different Michigan case, said the Taser can still cause pain and could have incapacitated Schurr even after it had been discharged. Key expected the physical struggle the two engaged in will likely be another factor of Schurr\u2019s defense.",
      "\u201cGiven the officer's continued attempts to have the person quit, let go of the Taser, etcetera, then it would be a reasonable analysis by the officer that the person would continue to fight,\u201d Key said.",

      "A historic Black church in downtown Memphis that was the organizing point for Martin Luther King Jr.'s final stand has suffered a devastating fire",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A historic Black church in downtown Memphis that was the organizing point for Martin Luther King Jr.'s final campaign in 1968 caught fire early Monday morning and suffered significant damage.",
      "\u201cThe inside is a total loss, but we're still somewhat hopeful that some of the facade will be able to be left standing,\u201d Memphis Fire Chief Gina Sweat said at a Monday morning news conference. She said the fire was reported at 1:39 a.m. through a commercial alarm service. Local fire and police officers are investigating the cause, along with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. It is \u201cway too early\u201d to know anything more, Sweat said. King was drawn to Memphis in 1968 to support some 1,300 predominantly Black sanitation workers who went on strike to protest inhumane treatment. Two workers had been crushed in a garbage compactor in 1964, but the faulty equipment had not been replaced. On Feb. 1, 1968, two more men, Echol Cole, 36, and Robert Walker, 30, were crushed in the compactor. The two men were contract workers, so they did not qualify for workmen\u2019s compensation, and had no life insurance.",
      "Workers wanted to unionize, and fought for higher pay and safer working conditions. City officials declared the strike illegal and arrested scores of strikers and protesters.",
      "Before the fire, the Clayborn Temple was undergoing a $25 million restoration that was slated for completion in 2026. The initiative aims to preserve the architectural and historical integrity of the Romanesque revival church and includes the restoration of a 3,000-pipe grand organ. At the same time, the project seeks to help revitalize the local neighborhood with a museum, cultural programing and community outreach, according to a news release on the renovation.",
      "\u201cThis morning we woke up to heartbreaking news: a devastating fire has ravaged one of our city\u2019s greatest treasures, Clayborn Temple,\u201d Memphis Mayor Paul Young wrote in a statement posted to social media. \u201cClayborn is more than a historic building. It is sacred ground. It is the beating heart of the civil rights movement, a symbol of struggle, hope, and triumph that belongs not just to Memphis but to the world.\u201d",
      "Just south of Beale Street, Clayborn Temple was built in 1892 as the Second Presbyterian Church and originally served an all-white congregation. In 1949, the building was sold to an African Methodist Episcopal congregation and renamed Clayborn Temple, according to the release.",
      "Memphis sanitation workers started striking in February 1968 after Cole and Walker were killed on the job.",
      "The Clayborn Temple hosted nightly meetings and the campaign\u2019s iconic \u201cI AM A MAN\u201d posters were made in its basement. The temple was also a staging point for marches to City Hall. They included a March 28, 1968, march led by King, a rally that turned violent when police and protesters clashed on the iconic Beale Street, and a 16-year-old was killed.",
      "When marchers retreated to the temple, police fired tear gas inside. People broke some of the stained-glass windows to escape. King promised to lead a second, peaceful march in Memphis, but he was killed by a sniper while standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel on April 4.",
      "After King was assassinated and the strike ended with the workers securing a pay raise, the church\u2019s influence waned. It fell into disrepair and was vacant for years before the renovation effort that took off in 2017 thanks to a $400,000 grant from the National Park Service.",
      "Clayborn Temple was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.",
      "Jimmie Tucker, one of the architects who has been working on the restoration for years, said Monday that he spent the morning working on a plan to try to shore up the exterior walls. He had been speaking to some of the people who helped after a similar Memphis fire at First United Methodist Church in 2006. He said that project gives him hope because they were able to rebuild.",
      "\u201cAs a native Memphian, this project is personal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has so much meaning.\u201d",
      "Young pledged that the city will \u201chelp ensure this sacred place rises again.\u201d",

      "A former supervisor of the team that prosecuted the 1,500 plus people charged in the attack on the U.S. Capitol says he fears President Donald Trump's pardons could embolden right-wing extremists and encourage future political violence",
      "WASHINGTON -- Michael Romano spent more than 17 years at the Justice Department, eventually becoming a supervisor on the team that would prosecute more than 1,500 people charged in the attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "The moment he watched the largest investigation in department history get wiped away with the stroke of a pen \u2014 on President Donald Trump's first day back in the White House \u2014 Romano knew he had to leave.",
      "\u201cI knew on January 20th, when the pardons were announced, that I needed to find my way out,\" Romano said in an interview with The Associated Press weeks after his resignation from the Justice Department. \u201cIt would be untenable for me to stay, given the pardons and given the false narratives that were being spread about January 6.\"",
      "Now, Romano says he fears Trump\u2019s decision to pardon even the most violent rioters \u2014 whom his own vice president once said \u201cobviously\u201d shouldn\u2019t be pardoned \u2014 could embolden right-wing extremists and encourage future political violence.",
      "\u201cThe way that the pardons have been received by the January 6th defendants and by other right-wing extremists, as I understand it, is to recognize that if you support the president and if you commit violence in support of the president, that he might insulate you from the consequences, that he might protect you from the criminal justice system,\u201d Romano said. \u201cAnd so that might encourage people to commit these sort of acts.\u201d",
      "Romano is among dozens of Justice Department lawyers who have resigned, been pushed out or fired in the weeks since Trump's new leadership has taken over and begun making sweeping changes to align the law enforcement agency with the priorities of the Republican president whom the department once prosecuted.",
      "Trump's return to the White House has ushered in a dizzying change for many in the Justice Department, but perhaps few have felt it more than the lawyers who spent years working on the largest-scale serious attack on the Capitol since the war of 1812.",
      "As a deputy chief of the now-disbanded Capitol Siege Section that prosecuted the Jan. 6, 2021, riot, Romano had a close-up view of the evidence, including harrowing videos and court testimony detailing the violence that unfolded when the pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol as lawmakers met to certify former President Joe Biden's 2020 victory.",
      "Romano joined the Justice Department in 2007 straight out of law school, and was working in the section in Washington that handles public corruption cases on Jan. 6, 2021. He recalled watching the riot unfold on television, and quickly deciding he wanted to help with the prosecution of what he described as a \u201ccrime of historic proportions.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s pardons cemented the president's yearslong campaign to rewrite the history of the Jan. 6 attack.",
      "While vying to return to the White House, Trump repeatedly downplayed the violence that left more than 100 police officers injured, and lauded the rioters as patriots and hostages whom he contended were unfairly persecuted by the Justice Department for their political beliefs. Only two Capitol riot defendants were acquitted of all charges, which Trump supporters cited as evidence that Washington juries can\u2019t be fair and impartial. Some Jan. 6 defendants are now considering running for office.",
      "The scope of Trump's clemency hours after the inauguration came as a surprise to many, considering the president had suggested in the weeks prior that instead of blanket pardons, he would look at the Jan. 6 defendants on a case-by-case basis. Trump's proclamation described the prosecution as \u201ca grave national injustice\" and declared that the pardons would begin \u201ca process of national reconciliation.\u201d",
      "Trump's pardons led to the release from prison of the leaders of far-right extremist groups convicted of orchestrating violent plots to stop the peaceful transfer of power as well as rioters convicted of brutal attacks on police \u2014 many of whose crimes were captured on camera and broadcast on live TV. Trump has defended his pardons, saying the sentences handed down for actions that day were \u201cridiculous and excessive\" and that \u201cthese are people who actually love our country.\u201d",
      "Romano said the notion that the Jan. 6 defendants were not treated fairly by in the justice system or not given the due process they were entitled is \u201csimply not true.\u201d In many cases, he said prosecutors had overwhelming evidence because the defendants \u201cfilmed themselves proudly committing crimes.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey had the full protection of rights guaranteed to them by the American justice system and the Constitution,\" Romano said. \u201cIt was my experience when dealing with these cases and seeing the way that the rioters and some of their attorneys behaved in court, that their take was that they should be treated like heroes and not prosecuted at all.\u201d",
      "Despite the pardons, Romano said he still believes that the Capitol Siege Section's work was important because it left behind a \u201chistorical record\u201d of what happened on Jan. 6 that cannot be changed.",
      "\u201cIn light of the efforts to whitewash the history of that day, in light of the efforts for people to lie about that day for their own benefit, which is what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s important that people really understand the truth about what happened on January 6th,\u201d he said.",

      "Former Memphis police officer Desmond Mills Jr. has testified that he regrets his failure to stop the beating of Tyre Nichols after Nichols ran away from a traffic stop in 2023",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Former Memphis police officer Desmond Mills Jr. testified Tuesday that he regrets his failure to stop the beating of Tyre Nichols after Nichols ran away from a traffic stop in 2023.",
      "Mills' testimony came in the second day of the trial of Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith, who have pleaded not guilty to state charges including second-degree murder in the death of Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who was beaten as he cried out for his mother just steps from his home. The three defendants already face the prospect of years behind bars after they were convicted of federal charges last year.",
      "Footage of the beating was captured by a police pole camera and also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled. Nichols' death led to national protests, raised the volume on calls for police reforms in the U.S. and directed intense scrutiny toward the police force in Memphis, a majority-Black city.",
      "Mills pleaded guilty to federal charges last year and has entered into an agreement to plead guilty to state charges as well.",
      "During his testimony Tuesday, Mills said he and Bean responded to a Jan. 7, 2023, police radio call that a man had run away from a traffic stop after he was pepper-sprayed and hit with a Taser. Nichols saw the two officers and ran away from them, and Bean eventually caught Nichols after a foot chase, Mills testified.",
      "When Mills arrived at Nichols\u2019 location, Nichols was struggling with Bean and Smith, who were holding Nichols on the ground, Mills said. Mills then tried to pepper-spray Nichols, but he ended up spraying himself, which made him angry, Mills said.",
      "After stepping away to try to recover, Mills then walked up to Nichols and hit him three times in the arm with a police baton as Bean and Smith were holding Nichols, Mills said.",
      "Mills told prosecutor Paul Hagerman that he hit Nichols with the baton because he was angry. Another officer, Emmitt Martin, arrived and punched and kicked Nichols in the head.",
      "Nichols died three days after the beating. Mills acknowledged on the stand that he had a duty to intervene to stop it, but didn\u2019t.",
      "\u201cDo you regret that?\u201d the prosecutor said.",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d Mills said.",
      "Mills also acknowledged that he did not tell paramedics that Nichols had been repeatedly hit in the head and later failed to give police supervisors details of the beating because he didn\u2019t want to get in trouble.",
      "Under the plea agreements, Mills\u2019 state sentence will be the same length as his federal term, which could reach up to life in prison, though federal prosecutors have recommended a 15-year sentence. He would serve the state sentence at the same time as his federal term in prison.",
      "In opening statements Monday, prosecutor Paul Hagerman said Nichols was being held by his arms by two of the officers as he was punched and kicked and hit with a police baton.",
      "Hagerman said the officers helped each other beat Nichols to death. An autopsy showed Nichols died three days after the beating of blunt force trauma.",
      "He said the officers had a duty to stop the beating but none of them did so. They were \u201covercome by the moment,\u201d the prosecutor said.",
      "In his opening statement, Bean\u2019s attorney said the situation became \u201chigh risk\u201d when Nichols continued driving for about 2 miles (3.2 km) after one of the officers turned on his vehicle\u2019s blue lights in an attempt to stop Nichols for speeding. Nichols then failed to follow orders to give officers his hands so that he could be handcuffed, Perry said.",
      "\u201cHe was actually resisting arrest the whole time,\u201d Perry said, adding that the officers just \u201cwanted to do their job effectively.\u201d",
      "Both Smith and Haley called for medical aid the night of the beating, their lawyers said.",
      "The jury for the state trial was chosen in Hamilton County, which includes Chattanooga, after Judge James Jones Jr. ordered the case be heard from people outside of Shelby County, which includes Memphis. Defense lawyers for the officers had argued that intense publicity made seating a fair jury difficult.",
      "The officers are charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression.",
      "Mills and Martin were also charged but will not stand trial with their former colleagues due to their agreements to testify. Sentencings for all five officers in the federal case is expected after the state trial.",
      "The five officers were part of a crime suppression team called the Scorpion Unit that has since been disbanded. The team targeted drugs, illegal guns and violent offenders with the goal of amassing arrests, while sometimes using force against unarmed people.",
      "In December, the U.S. Justice Department said a 17-month investigation showed the Memphis Police Department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people.",

    "story": [
      "For hundreds of communities nationwide, plans to protect against natural disasters and climate change have been upended because of the Trump administration's elimination of a federal grant program",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The textile mills that once served as the backbone of Mount Pleasant, North Carolina, have long been shuttered, and officials believed federal money would be key to the town's overdue revitalization. They hoped an improved stormwater drainage system and secured electrical wires \u2014 funded through a program to help communities protect against natural disasters and climate change \u2014 would safeguard investments in new businesses like a renovated historic theater to spur the largely rural economy.",
      "Mount Pleasant was about to receive $4 million when the Federal Emergency Management Agency eliminated the program. Officials say their plans \u2014 years in the making \u2014 and those of hundreds of communities nationwide supported by the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program have been upended.",
      "\u201cThis is a generational set of infrastructure projects that would set us up for the next hundred years and it just \u2014 poof \u2014 went away,\u201d said Erin Burris, assistant town manager for Mount Pleasant, 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Charlotte.",
      "FEMA's elimination this month of the BRIC program revoked upwards of $3.6 billion in funding earmarked for communities like Mount Pleasant. Though President Donald Trump has openly questioned whether to shutter FEMA completely, local officials said they were blindsided by the move to end BRIC, established during the Republican president's first term.",
      "Many affected communities are in Republican-dominated, disaster-prone regions. FEMA called the BRIC grants \u201cwasteful\u201d and \u201cpoliticized\u201d tools, but officials and residents say they were a vital use of government resources to proactively protect lives, infrastructure and economies. Money would have gone toward strengthening electrical poles to withstand hurricane-force winds in Louisiana, relocating residents in Pennsylvania\u2019s floodplains and safeguarding water supply lines in Oklahoma\u2019s Tornado Alley.",
      "Disasters affect the vast majority of Americans \u2014 95% live in a county that has had a federally declared weather disaster since 2011, said Amy Chester, director of Rebuild by Design, a nonprofit focused on disaster prevention.",
      "The BRIC program told communities, \u201cWe\u2019re going to help your community be stronger ahead of time,\u201d she said. \u201cCutting one of the sole sources of funding for that need is essentially telling Americans that it's OK that they're suffering.\u201d",
      "Across multiple states, officials said the BRIC program was far from perfect \u2014 they were often frustrated with the wait for funding.",
      "But in southeastern Louisiana, Lafourche Parish President Archie Chaisson said despite his issues with FEMA\u2019s bureaucracy, he\u2019s seen firsthand that money invested to fortify homes and infrastructure works.",
      "The hurricane-ravaged state receives the highest rate of federal disaster assistance per capita, with more than $8 billion pouring in since 2011, according to Rebuild by Design. Lafourche Parish has seen more than a dozen federally declared extreme weather disasters since 2011.",
      "Lafourche had been set to receive more than $20 million from several grants to replace wooden electrical poles with steel and take other steps to lower the soaring costs of home insurance.",
      "Chaisson, a Republican whose parish saw 80% of voters support Trump in November, said he backs efforts to streamline federal agencies \u2014 as long as funding continues to flow for disaster prevention.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that that\u2019s what the president\u2019s trying to do with this,\u201d he said. \"Is there some other way to get the money so we can continue to do these projects? ... No matter where you sit on the political spectrum, the programs themselves and the dollars allocated make our communities more resilient.\"",
      "Research backs him up: A 2024 study funded by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found every $1 invested in disaster preparation saved $13 in economic impact, damage and cleanup costs.",
      "Democratic officials in states that lost money have publicly expressed outrage. Few Republicans have joined in at a national level, even though about two-thirds of the top 15 states in total FEMA funds received, spending per person and number of federally declared disasters lean heavily Republican.",
      "An exception has been Louisiana's senior U.S. senator, Bill Cassidy. He took to the Senate floor this month calling for BRIC's reinstatement, saying it's \u201ca lifesaver and a cost-saver.\u201d",
      "About $185 million intended for Louisiana evaporated, and officials had to shelve dozens of applications for hundreds of millions of dollars in new funding, according to data compiled by state and federal agencies.",
      "\u201cThis isn't waste,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cTo do anything other than use that money to fund flood mitigation projects is to thwart the will of Congress.\"",
      "FEMA says more than $3.6 billion of BRIC funds will be returned to the federal Disaster Relief Fund, for disaster response and recovery, and an additional $882 million is being returned to the U.S. Treasury or reapportioned by Congress in the following fiscal year. Agency officials did not comment further for this story.",
      "Twenty-two mostly blue states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit demanding the federal government release obligated funding, including FEMA grants.",
      "The lawsuit highlights Grants Pass in conservative southern Oregon, where FEMA has refused to release BRIC funding awarded for a $50 million water treatment facility.",
      "Flooding could knock out the water supply for 60,000 people for months, said Jason Canady, city public works director. Funding would have been used in part to build a modernized plant on higher ground.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t provide drinking water, hospitals, groceries, restaurants are going to have trouble. Economically, it would be devastating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really is the cornerstone on which the community is built.\u201d",
      "In Stillwater, Oklahoma, Mayor Will Joyce spent two years working with FEMA on a BRIC application to overhaul and provide backup supply for a regional water system used by 100,000 people. Its 36-mile (58-kilometer) pipeline is at risk of damage from tornadoes and flooding. If it breaks, Stillwater has less than a day's worth of reserve drinking water.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t just hope nothing bad happens,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cThis project is a necessity.\u201d",
      "Without FEMA's support, he said, Stillwater will have to double the cost of water for residents to fund the project.",
      "In an open letter, U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan Jr., a northeast Pennsylvania Republican, urged FEMA to revive BRIC, saying communities in his district would struggle to fund disaster adaptation work, including relocating families in flooded homes.",
      "Bresnahan wrote that \u201cprograms like BRIC are not wasteful, but well within the purview of federal coordination of disaster relief efforts\u201d and noted that Trump \u201cpromised not to leave the forgotten men and women of America behind.\u201d",
      "In Mount Pleasant, Whit Moose, the fourth-generation owner of a downtown pharmacy, said few of his neighbors seem aware that funding disappeared, though his own business would have benefited.",
      "\u201cIt was going to be a wonderful thing,\" he said. \"Now we just got to start over.\u201d",
      "Republican voters in the town embrace efforts to downsize government, but the perception is that cuts are focused on federal bureaucracy, related waste and redundancy, or diversity, equity and inclusion spending, said Jim Quick, vice chairman of the Cabarrus County Republican Party.",
      "\u201cIt would be a surprise for us to learn that those budget cuts would be impacting a local municipality,\u201d Quick said. \u201cThe reality is all of us have to trim back.\u201d",
      "Town voters are unlikely to retract their support for Trump, he said, noting that 80% supported him in November.",
      "Burris, the assistant town manager, worries about flooding downtown. And she points to one vulnerable utility pole she's nicknamed Atlas \u2014 after the Greek god carrying the world on his shoulders \u2014 holding up the electricity, internet and telecommunications for the town's 1,700 people.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a special community, and it deserves good things,\" Burris said, choking up. \u201cI don\u2019t know what was political about Mount Pleasant \u2014 little, teeny, tiny Mount Pleasant \u2014 getting a little bit of help with some stormwater flooding.\u201d",

      "Wisconsin Rep. Gwen Moore, who co-sponsored legislation to award the medal to the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, called it a long overdue honor for the women in the unit.",
      "\u201cThese heroes deserve their dues; and I am so glad their story is being told,\u201d Moore, a Democrat, told The Associated Press on Monday. \u201cI am especially honored to ensure my constituent Ms. Anna Mae Robertson and the many others who served with her, are recognized for their selfless service.\u201d",

      "McClendon joined the Air Force after the military was integrated and retired in 1971. She was the first female to command an all-male squadron with the Strategic Air Command.",
      "The 6888th was sent overseas in 1945, a time when there was growing pressure from African-American organizations to include Black women in what was called the Women\u2019s Army Corps, and allow them to join their white counterparts overseas.",
      "\u201cThey kept hollering about wanting us to go overseas so I guess they found something for us to do overseas: Take care of the mail,\u201d McClendon said. \u201cAnd there was an awful lot of mail. ...

Well I think in about a month, in a month and a half, we had it all straightened out and going in the right direction.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump is pushing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to cede territory occupied by Russia to Moscow to bring about an end to the fighting in Ukraine",
      "LONDON -- President Donald Trump is pushing Ukraine to cede territory to Russia to end the war, threatening to walk away if a deal becomes too difficult \u2014 and causing alarm bells in Europe about how to fill the gap.",
      "Ukraine's European allies view the war as fundamental to the continent's security, and pressure is now mounting to find ways to support Kyiv militarily \u2014 regardless of whether Trump pulls out.",
      "Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of prolonging the \u201ckilling field\u201d by pushing back on his demand that Ukraine hand over occupied Crimea to Moscow.",
      "Trump\u2019s land-for-peace plan would mark a significant shift in the post-World War II order, ripping up conventions that have long held that borders should not be redrawn by force.",
      "\u201cIt took a World War to roll back de jure annexations and 60 million people died,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, special adviser at the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris, referring to the pre-war annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany.",
      "\u201cEuropeans will not accept it\" and Ukraine will not either, he said.",
      "Diplomats and experts described various scenarios if the U.S. decides to walk. They range from the U.S. ceasing direct aid to Ukraine \u2014 but allowing European nations to pass on critical American intelligence and weapons to Kyiv \u2014 to Trump banning transfers of any American technology, including components or software in European weapons.",
      "Any withdrawal of U.S. military aid to Ukraine could create serious difficulties for Europe, analysts and diplomats told The Associated Press. Kyiv's ability to keep fighting would depend on European political will to muster money and weapons \u2014 and how quickly the gaps left by Washington can be filled.",
      "If it were easy, Europe would \u201calready be doing things without America,\u201d said a European diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.",
      "No new U.S. aid package for Ukraine has been approved since Trump came into office, even as European nations have collectively provided Ukraine with more aid than Washington, according to the Keil Institute.",
      "Europe has contributed around $157 billion, some $26 billion more than the U.S., although Washington slightly outpaces Europe when it comes to military aid, the Germany-based institute said.",
      "It will be hard, but there are ways Europe can find cash to fund Ukraine \u2014 including seizing frozen Russian assets \u2014 but \u201cmoney isn't what you shoot bullets with,\u201d Heisbourg said.",
      "Europe\u2019s \"big mistake\" was undertaking major military downsizing following the Cold War and thinking \u201cthis war started in February 2022 and not in February 2014,\u201d when Moscow invaded and then annexed Crimea, said Thomas Gomart, director of IFRI, a French international affairs think tank.",
      "Europeans are scrambling to acquire weapons for themselves and for Ukraine, while confronting constraints on production capacity, a fragmented defense industry and a decades-long reliance on the U.S.",
      "Some extra production capacity could come from Ukraine, which has ramped up manufacturing of ammunition and drones since Russia's invasion. Much harder to replace, experts said, are advanced American weapons, including air defenses.",
      "Russia has attacked Ukraine almost nightly since Putin\u2019s forces invaded in February 2022, flooding the skies with missiles and drones, including dummy attack drones to exhaust Ukraine's limited air defenses. In April, at least 57 people were killed in multiple strikes.",
      "The death toll from the Russian attacks would \u201cinevitably\u201d be higher without the American Patriot air-defense missile systems protecting Ukraine's skies, said Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.",
      "The Patriots can track and intercept Russian missiles, including the hypersonic Kinzhal, which Putin has boasted was unstoppable. Kyiv uses them to protect critical infrastructure, including the country's energy grid.",
      "Earlier this month, Zelenskyy asked to buy 10 Patriots, a request Trump dismissed. \u201cYou don\u2019t start a war against someone 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles,\" he said, a day after a Russian strike on the Ukrainian city of Sumy killed 35 people.",
      "France and Italy have given Ukraine their Aster SAMP/T air-defense system but the issue is not \u201cquality, it\u2019s quantity,\u201d Barrie said, pointing to the larger U.S. defense industrial base and greater U.S. stockpiles.",
      "Although Trump criticized Putin over the weekend for his missile strikes and suggested imposing more sanctions on Russia, for Europe it remains a wait-and-see game.",
      "The whiplash of Trump's aggressive foreign policy means nothing is off the cards, experts said.",
      "A worst-case scenario could see a ban on American weapons exports and transfers to Ukraine, which would bar European nations from buying U.S. weapons to give to Kyiv or transferring weapons with American components or software, Barrie said.",
      "That could mean countries, including Germany, that have already given American Patriots to Ukraine would be prohibited from doing so. Such a move would seriously hamper Europe's ability to support Kyiv and mark a fundamental shift in America's relationship with its allies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing for the U.S. to cease to be an ally, it is another for the U.S. to be an enemy,\u201d Heisbourg said, noting that such a step could also damage the U.S. defense sector if weapons purchases were perceived to be unusable on Trump\u2019s political order.",
      "In March, the Trump administration suspended intelligence sharing with Ukraine in a bid to force Zelenskyy to accept a truce with Russia. The about weeklong suspension impacted Ukraine's ability to track and target Russian troops, tanks and ships.",
      "There are certain capabilities, including \u201chigher-end\u201d surveillance and reconnaissance using satellites that \u201conly the United States can provide,\u201d said Matthew Kroenig, vice president of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security in Washington.",
      "While the extent of intelligence sharing between the U.S. and Ukraine is not known, experts said it likely shows Kyiv near real-time buildup of Russian troop deployments and helps target long-range strikes.",
      "Ukraine's allies do not have as much satellite capability as the U.S. but could launch more, or Ukraine could use commercial systems if Trump cuts off intelligence again, experts said. The latter would likely have to come from a European provider \u2014 in March, the American satellite imagery company Maxar Technologies confirmed it temporarily suspended access to unclassified satellite images following the administration's decision to pull intelligence sharing.",
      "Ukraine also needs an alternative to Elon Musk's satellite network Starlink, which is critical for Ukrainian defensive and civilian communications. European defense companies are discussing creating a satellite alliance but don't currently have an alternative on the same scale.",
      "If Trump walks away, or if Kyiv rejects a deal and keeps fighting with European support, it won\u2019t necessarily mean \"the collapse of Ukraine\" although more people will almost certainly die if the U.S. pulls its air defenses and intelligence-sharing capabilities, Heisbourg said.",
      "Trump has jolted European leaders into awareness that they need to take responsibility for their own defense, regardless of who occupies the White House, experts said.",
      "That means European nations need to invest more in defense, work together to scale up military production and build trust to share intelligence.",
      "\u201cThis issue is not a question about the next two months or the next two years. This issue is about the next two decades,\u201d Gomart said.",

      "With nearly every move came a new school, a new set of classmates, and new lessons to catch up on. Mackenzie only has one friend she\u2019s known longer than a year, and she didn't receive testing or a diagnosis for dyslexia until this year. She would often miss long stretches of class in between schools.",
      "Schoolchildren threatened with eviction are more likely to end up in another district or transfer to another school, often one with less funding, more poverty and lower test scores. They're more likely to miss school, and those who end up transferring are suspended more often. That's according to an analysis from the Eviction Lab at Princeton University, published in Sociology of Education, a peer-reviewed journal, and shared exclusively with The Associated Press' Education Reporting Network.",
      "Pairing court filings and student records from the Houston Independent School District, where Mackenzie started kindergarten, researchers identified more than 18,000 times between 2002 and 2016 when students lived in homes threatened with eviction filings. They found students facing eviction were absent more often. Even when they didn\u2019t have to change schools, students threatened with eviction missed four more days in the following school year than their peers.",
      "In all, researchers counted 13,197 children between 2002 and 2016 whose parents faced an eviction filing. A quarter of those children faced repeated evictions.",
      "As eviction rates in Houston continue to worsen, there might be more children like Mackenzie.",
      "Neveah Barahona, a 17-year-old big sister to seven siblings, started kindergarten in Houston, but has moved schools half a dozen times. Her mother, Roxanne Abarca, knew moving can be disruptive. So whenever she fell behind on rent and the family was forced to move, she tried to let them finish the school year \u2013 even if it meant driving them great distances.",
      "Neveah, a strong student who hopes to join the military, said the moves took a toll.",
      "\u201cIt is kind of draining, meeting new people, meeting new teachers, getting on track with ... what they want to teach you and what you used to know,\u201d Neveah said. Then there's finding her way with new classmates. A spate of bullying this year left her despondent until she got counseling.",
      "Households with children are about twice as likely to face eviction than those without children, Eviction Lab research has shown. That's 1.5 million children getting evicted every year \u2014 and one in 20 children under 5 living in a rental home. Still, much of the discourse focuses on adults \u2014 the landlords and grown-up tenants \u2014 rather than the kids caught in the middle, said Peter Hepburn, the study's lead author.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 worth reminding people that 40% of the people at risk of losing their homes through the eviction process are kids,\u201d said Hepburn, a sociology professor at Rutgers University-Newark and associate director at the Eviction Lab.",
      "Households often become more vulnerable to eviction because they fall behind when they have children. Only 5% of low-wage earners, who are especially vulnerable to housing instability, have access to paid parental leave.",
      "Under a federal law that protects homeless students, districts are supposed to try to keep children in the same school if they lose their housing midyear, providing daily transportation. But children who are evicted don't always qualify for those services. Even those who do often fall through the cracks, because schools don't know why children are leaving or where they're headed.",
      "In the sprawl of Houston, it can be especially challenging for transient students to stay on track. The metropolis bleeds seamlessly from the city limits to unincorporated parts of Harris County, which is divided into 24 other districts. It\u2019s easy to leave Houston's school district without realizing it. And despite the best efforts of parents and caretakers, kids can miss a lot of school in transition.",
      "That's what happened in January, when Mackenzie's grandmother, then staying in her son's one-bedroom apartment with her granddaughter, got desperate. Fearful her son would get evicted for having family stay with him, Crystal Holmes \u2014 who had no home, no car and no cell phone service \u2014 walked miles to a women's shelter.",
      "The shelter, where she and Mackenzie now share a room, is in another district's enrollment zone. She worried about Mackenzie being forced to move schools again \u2014 the fifth grader had already missed the first three weeks of the school year, when her grandmother struggled to get her enrolled.",
      "Thankfully, the federal law kicked in, and Mackenzie's school, Thornwood Elementary, now sends a car to fetch her and other students from the shelter.",
      "Houston Independent School District did not respond to interview requests.",
      "Millicent Brown lives in a public housing project in Houston, alongside an elevated highway so noisy she had to buy a louder doorbell. She and her daughter, Nova, 5, were forced to move last year when Nova\u2019s father threatened to hurt Brown.",
      "Nova had attended a charter school. But when she moved, the school said it could only bus Nova from her new home if she waited on a street that Brown said was too dangerous. Instead, Nova missed a month of school before enrolling in a nearby public school.",
      "Brown grew up bouncing between schools and wants better for Nova. But she may have to move again: The state has plans to widen the highway. It would wipe out her housing project \u2014 and Nova's new school.",
      "Nearly three years ago, Neveah and her family settled into a ranch-style home down a country road in Aldine. It's brightly lit, with four bedrooms and a renovated kitchen. Neaveah adopted a neighborhood cat named she named Bella. Her sister Aaliyah painted a portrait of the home that's displayed in the living room.",
      "\u201cWhen we were little, we always kept moving,\u201d Aaliyah said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to move. I already got comfortable here.\u201d",
      "Then, last year, her mother once again began to fall behind on rent. Ultimately, Abarca received an eviction notice.",
      "The mother was lucky. At the courthouse, she met an employee tasked with helping families stay in their homes. The employee connected her with a nonprofit that agreed to pay six months of her rent while Abarca got back on her feet.",
      "And she did, working from home as a call operator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",
      "But the siblings' dream of a \u201cforever home\" may still come to an end. Abarca learned this month the home's owner hopes to sell to an investor, displacing them once again.",

      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- New York state would ban cellphones in public schools \u201cbell to bell\u201d beginning with the next school year under an agreement announced late Monday by Gov. Kathy Hochul.",
      "\u201cWe've protected our kids before from cigarettes, alcohol, and drunk driving, and now we're protecting them from addictive technology designed to hijack their attention,\u201d Hochul said in announcing the plan as part of a tentative budget agreement with state lawmakers.",
      "Hochul, a Democrat, did not immediately detail plans for the ban. Her office has previously said that schools would have some flexibility over how to implement it, with districts deciding how to store students\u2019 devices during the school day. There would be exemptions for students who need access for medical reasons, to help with learning disabilities or because they don\u2019t speak fluent English, she has said.",
      "If approved, New York would join at least eight states \u2014 California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia \u2014 that have enacted measures banning or restricting students\u2019 use of cellphones in schools. Nationally, most schools say they prohibit cellphone use except for academic purposes, but educators say the rules are difficult to enforce when students are allowed to have the devices in hallways and at lunch.",
      "\u201cBell-to-bell\u201d bans like the one Hochul described are meant to remove the distraction altogether by restricting access during school hours, often over the objection of parents who say they want to be able to reach their kids during emergency situations.",

      "JUNEAU, Wis. -- Prosecutors have reduced a felony misconduct charge against a former Wisconsin prison warden implicated in two inmate deaths to a misdemeanor as part of a plea deal, online court records indicated Monday.",
      "Hepp was charged with felony misconduct in office in June 2024 in the deaths of Cameron Williams and Donald Maier at the Waupun Correctional Institution, the state's oldest maximum security facility. He announced his retirement days before he was charged.",
      "Online court records show prosecutors reduced the misconduct charge Monday to violating state-county institution laws. The misconduct charge carried a maximum sentence of three-and-a-half years in prison and $10,000 in fines. The violation count is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail and $500 in fines.",
      "Hepp was due to appear in Dodge County Circuit Court on Monday afternoon for a joint plea-sentencing hearing. Online records show a plea agreement was filed Monday morning and Hepp was given a guilty plea questionnaire, a form that asks defendants if they knowingly and voluntarily plead guilty.",
      "Hepp's attorney, Michael Steinle, did not return a message from The Associated Press on Monday morning.",
      "Eight members of Hepp's staff were charged in June with abuse or misconduct in the deaths. Online court records show charges were dismissed against one of them this month and another pleaded guilty in September to a reduced count of misdemeanor violating laws governing a penal institution and was assessed a $250 fine. Cases are pending against the remaining six staffers.",
      "Williams died of a stroke at the prison in October 2023. His body was not discovered for at least 12 hours. Maier died of dehydration and malnutrition in February 2024.",
      "According to court documents, Williams told an inmate advocate three days before he died that he needed to go to a hospital but no action was taken. He had fallen in the shower two days earlier and had to crawl into his cell. A day before that he collapsed on the way back to his cell but neither fall was documented. No one checked on him the night he died.",
      "Maier had severe mental health problems but either refused or wasn't given his medication in the eight days leading up to his death, according to court documents. Another inmate told investigators guards turned off Maier's water after he flooded his cell. Guards said they turned water off and on for Maier, but investigators said no one told him when it was on and no one gave him food in the four days before his death.",
      "Asked if prison workers understand the water shut-off policy, Hepp told investigators that policies go out via email but he doesn't think anyone at any prison reads them. He said no American jail documents an inmate's every meal.",
      "The prison, with a stone exterior and high, castle-like guard towers, opened in 1854 and has long been a target for closure. Seven inmates, including Williams and Maier, have died there since 2023. One killed himself, one died of a fentanyl overdose and one died of what investigators suspect was suicide. Two more deaths are under investigation.",
      "A federal investigation into smuggling at the prison has so far netted at least one former employee who pleaded guilty to smuggling cellphones and drugs in exchange for money. Inmates have filed a class-action lawsuit alleging inhumane conditions and a lack of health care.",
      "Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has rejected calls to shutter the facility, despite the problems. He has said he wants broader criminal justice reform and a plan to house the facility's roughly 1,700 inmates.",

      "MUSCAT, Oman -- Iran and the United States began in-depth negotiations in Oman over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program on Saturday, talks that likely will hinge on the Islamic Republic's enrichment of uranium.",
      "Iranian state television reported the talks had begun in Muscat, the mountain-wrapped capital of this sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula. However, neither Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi nor U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff offered any immediate specifics or details on the talks that they'll lead.",
      "Araghchi arrived Friday in Oman and met with Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who has mediated the two previous round of talks in Muscat and Rome. Araghchi then visited the Muscat International Book Fair, surrounded by television cameras and photojournalists. Video late Saturday morning showed Araghchi heading to the talks.",
      "Witkoff was in Moscow on Friday meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin. He arrived Saturday to Oman, where the talks were expected to start in the coming hours, a source familiar with Witkoff's travels told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations.",
      "The talks seek to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed on the Islamic Republic closing in on half a century of enmity.",

      "Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers did limit Tehran's program. However, Trump unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018, setting in motion years of attacks and tensions. The wider Middle East also remains on edge over the devastating Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Trump, traveling to Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, again said he hoped negotiations would lead to a new nuclear deal. However, he still held out the possibility of a military strike if they didn't.",
      "\u201cThe Iran situation is coming out very well,\u201d Trump said on Air Force One. \u201cWe've had a lot of talks with them and I think we're going to have a deal. I'd much rather have a deal than the other alternative. That would be good for humanity.\"",
      "He added: \u201cThere are some people that want to make a different kind of a deal \u2014 a much nastier deal \u2014 and I don\u2019t want that to happen to Iran if we can avoid it.\u201d",
      "While Araghchi and Witkoff are again expected to speak through the Omanis, experts on both sides also will begin negotiating details of a possible deal.",
      "From the Iranian side, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-e Ravanchi will lead Tehran\u2019s expert team, said Mohammad Golzari, an Iranian government official. Takht-e Ravanchi took part in the 2015 nuclear talks.",
      "The U.S. technical team, which is expected to arrive in Oman on Friday, will be led by Michael Anton, the director of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s policy planning staff. Anton does not have the nuclear policy experience of those who led America\u2019s efforts in the 2015 talks.",
      "Iran has insisted that keeping its enrichment is key. But Witkoff has muddied the issue by first suggesting in a television interview that Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop.

    "story": [
      "U.S. states are adopting and expanding programs that use taxpayer money to pay for private schools even as their costs rise and budget pictures become more uncertain",
      "State lawmakers across the U.S. are pushing to use more taxpayer dollars to pay for private school tuitions and homeschooling expenses even as they try to figure out how to budget in a time of economic uncertainty.",
      "A $1 billion-per-year voucher program the Texas Legislature sent to the governor last week and a longshot push in Congress to expand vouchers nationally, including to states that have rejected them, are focusing attention on the issue.",
      "In states that already have programs to pay private education costs for most students, the expense has quickly gobbled up more of their budgets as revenue growth has slowed or stalled. Besides Texas, Tennessee adopted a program this year, and North Dakota gave serious consideration to one before a veto last week likely ended its prospects this year.",
      "States are required to produce annual spending plans that don't exceed what they bring in. With pandemic-era federal money mostly phased out, voucher opponents fear the programs will come at the expense of other priorities, including public schools.",
      "\u201cEven if they\u2019re being funded by separate revenue sources, it can feel like school choice programs and public schools are competing for the same slice of an increasingly smaller pie,\u201d said Page Forrest, who analyzes state finances at the nonpartisan think tank Pew.",
      "Until five years ago, the boldest school choice programs were limited to lower-income and special-needs students. More recently, scholarships and state-funded savings accounts open to most or all families have been catching on, especially in Republican-controlled states.",
      "This approach costs far more, at least in the short term. That is partly because studies of the efforts in several states have found most of the first students to enroll were already attending private schools, and not receiving taxpayer subsidies at all before the choice programs' launch.",
      "In the coming school year, voucher programs are expected to cost Florida taxpayers almost $3.9 billion, or about $1 in every $13 from the state\u2019s general revenue fund. In Arizona, it\u2019s nearly 5% of the general budget.",
      "An analysis by The Associated Press found the costs in Iowa, Ohio and Oklahoma are over 3% of state general spending this year, or are projected to be in the coming budget year.",
      "Spending is a smaller portion of the budget in states where the scholarship programs are still ramping up. Those include Arkansas, Indiana, North Carolina, Utah and West Virginia.",
      "A flood of campaign money from voucher proponents has been a key factor in convincing previously resistant Republican lawmakers to endorse school choice plans, particularly as advocates have called for more school options coming out of the COVID pandemic.",
      "Programs were approved last year in Alabama and Louisiana and this year in Tennessee, where Republican Gov. Bill Lee has said the $447 million program will be available for the upcoming school year.",
      "A New Hampshire bill raising income limits on an existing program has been moving through the legislature.",
      "In Texas on Thursday, lawmakers sent the governor a bill that would allot more than $10,000 per year for students in accredited private schools. The cost would be capped at $1 billion in the 2026-27 school year, which is a little over 1% of the annual state general funding. But by 2030, a legislative analysis found, it could cost $4.5 billion a year. That could partially be offset by a little over $800 million in savings, because there would be fewer public school students to subsidize.",
      "The Texas House also approved a nearly $8 billion boost to the public education system, which advocates say doesn't cover extra expenses due to inflation.",
      "In energy-dependent North Dakota, GOP Gov. Kelly Armstrong vetoed an education savings account program, saying it wouldn't expand options for all students and there were implementation problems. He has since said the concept remains a priority for him.",
      "Erin Oban, an organizer with North Dakotans for Public Schools, said the program's costs and unknowns about the state's financial outlook make it a bad time to start a voucher program.",
      "\"I think it would be a very long-term challenge to fund something in the short term you think might be a good idea or that somehow we can afford right now,\u201d she said.",
      "Congressional Republicans are looking to extend an assortment of tax cuts passed in President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, plus enact new tax cuts for overtime, tips and Social Security benefits. Proponents of the school choice credit will face stiff competition when it comes to getting included in that mix.",
      "In Ohio, under a budget proposed by House Republicans, vouchers would see a bigger funding increase than public schools starting in July 2026. The plan, which was passed this month, also calls for a way for the state to take back some property tax money already collected by school districts.",
      "Democratic state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney said she doesn\u2019t have a problem with vouchers, so long as public schools are fully funded. But she says the budget plan falls short of that.",
      "It also would continue to increase the amount available for scholarships to private schools, including for the first time making a portion of them available to institutions that operate without any state oversight.",
      "\u201cNinety percent of Ohio\u2019s kids are still in the public schools,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cThey are increasing still more into vouchers while still not giving the public schools what they need \u2014 even though that\u2019s where the bulk of the money is coming from.\u201d",
      "Rachel Brady, a mother of four in Wake Forest, North Carolina, was a leader in a successful push last year for lawmakers to fully fund scholarships after one of her children, and thousands of others, were put on a waiting list after the initial allocation was exhausted.",
      "Lawmakers should look to cut costs elsewhere if they have to in order to keep the programs going, she said.",
      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein \u2014 like Arizona's Katie Hobbs, another Democratic governor \u2014 has proposed scaling back the scholarships. But there is no indication the GOP-controlled legislatures will pump the brakes in either state.",
      "The budget advanced this month by the North Carolina House includes scholarship funding and a smaller raise for public school teachers than Stein proposed.",
      "\u201cThis is a great investment in the future of our kids,\u201d Brady said. \u201cIt\u2019s giving them what they need to be successful in life. I can\u2019t think of a better way to invest in the future of our state.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A new tribal national park in North Dakota is opening a little-seen area of the rugged Badlands to hikers and other outdoors enthusiasts",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- A new tribal national park in North Dakota's rugged Badlands is opening a little-seen area of the dramatic landscape to hikers and other outdoors enthusiasts, part of a Native American tribe's efforts to preserve the land and encourage recreation.",
      "The Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation established Three Affiliated Tribes National Park with the purchase of 2,100 acres (850 hectares) of a former ranch adjacent to the Fort Berthold Reservation's boundaries on the south side of the Little Missouri River.",
      "The area was in the tribe's original treaty lands but a government allotment act later reduced the reservation's size, said Mary Fredericks, director of the tribe\u2019s Parks and Reserve Program. The reservation's boundaries have expanded to include the park.",
      "Tribal Chairman Mark Fox said the goal is to establish a park for cultural and recreational purposes such as canoeing, kayaking and viewing wildlife.",
      "\u201cIt's part of our history, our lands, very significant to us, the whole area,\u201d Fox said. \u201cThis is just another strong move to reacquire some of our lands and then do something very effective with it, so to speak\u201d to aid tourism and the economy through recreation.",
      "Park officials are being careful with how they plan and develop the park to be thoughtful about impacts on the landscape.",
      "\u201cThis place will be here in perpetuity and it will be better when we are done than it was when we got it, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re pushing for, that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed,\u201d Park Superintendent Ethan White Calfe said.",
      "North Dakota's Badlands \u2014 the name denotes the difficult terrain \u2014 comprise a stark, erosive, colorful landscape with dramatic shapes, petrified wood and ancient fossils. The area draws hikers, campers, hunters, bicyclists and other outdoors enthusiasts.",
      "The park, which held a soft opening in September, is open only to foot traffic by a free permit online. Park officials require visitors to register their plans and hikers must park at a grass lot. By the end of the summer, organizers hope to have 10 miles (16 kilometers) of trails finished, Fredericks said.",
      "Plans to build a visitor center and campground are in the works. Park officials also intend to work on native prairie and soil restoration in the erosive environment where some native plants that thrive in the area have been pushed out by invasive species, White Calfe said.",
      "\u201cWe're looking at it as how do we help this area look like it did 300 years ago? How do we help this area heal to where it is in a lot of more of a state of equilibrium,\u201d White Calfe said.",
      "It's a beautiful and picturesque but deceptive and steep landscape, Fredericks said.",
      "The park is bisected by a state highway that drops from a flat into a rugged river bottom. People can see parts of the park while driving, but not its interior, she said.",
      "Eventually, the park could be a gateway for visitors to the reservation, Fredericks said. Outdoor recreation is available at Lake Sakakawea, which straddles the vast reservation, and nearby at Theodore Roosevelt National Park and the Maah Daah Hey Trail.",
      "The MHA Nation benefits from oil development on its reservation, which helped the tribe to afford the land for the park, Fredericks said.",
      "\u201cBut in that we have to be careful and preserve and conserve,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm very, very proud of our tribal council for having the foresight to buy this land with the intent of making it into a national park ... because we don't know what's going to happen 50 years from now and what our landscape is going to look like, but we can preserve this part of it.\u201d",
      "The park neighbors Little Missouri State Park, which draws horseback riders to its 40 miles (64 kilometers) of trails in the Badlands.",
      "The rugged landscape \u201ckind of has that almost spiritual feel to it. It's peaceful,\u201d state Parks and Recreation Department Director Cody Schulz said.",
      "State park officials have worked with the tribe for about two years on its plans and partnering together, such as connecting trail systems, Schulz said. Tribal park officials are collaborating with anyone willing, Fredericks said.",
      "White Calfe said the park is an opportunity \u201cto tell our own story, our own narrative from our own perspective in a place like this. That's pretty valuable.\u201d",

The fact the White House is attacking Amazon for \"hostile acts\" in publishing tariffs is a cast iron example of this. President Trump's gun is pointed primarily at his own feet, the thinking goes.",

      "While \"enemy\" is overstating it, Peterson was right, and additionally Carney is also very adept at understanding the nexus between markets and headlines.

He also dismissed President Trump's territorial ambitions not just for his country, but Greenland and Canada too.",

    "story": [
      "Sportswear giant Adidas has warned import taxes imposed by President Donald Trump will lead to higher prices in the US for popular trainers including the Gazelle and Samba.",
      "\"Since we currently cannot produce almost any of our products in the US, these higher tariffs will eventually cause higher costs for all our products for the US market,\" chief executive Bjorn Gulden said on Tuesday.",
      "Clothing manufacturers are among the businesses hit hardest by tariffs as they source labour from countries such as China and Vietnam, which have faced steep levies from the US.",
      "Adidas did not comment on how much prices would rise, but said the trade war had \"put a stop to\" an upgrade in its financial outlook.",
      "Mr Gulden said it was \"currently impossible to quantify\" cost increases resulting from tariffs, \"or to conclude what impact this could have on the consumer demand for our products\".",
      "\"Given the uncertainty around the negotiations between the US and the different exporting countries, we do not know what the final tariffs will be. Therefore, we cannot make any 'final' decisions on what to do,\" he added.",

    "summary": "Bug hunters make money by funding flaws in software, but AI is changing the way they work.",
    "story": [
      "Few technology careers offer the chance to demonstrate your skills in exclusive venues worldwide, from luxury hotels to Las Vegas e-sports arenas, peers cheering you on as your name moves up the leaderboard and your earnings rack up.",
      "But that's what Brandyn Murtagh experienced within his first year as a bug bounty hunter.",
      "Mr Murtagh got into gaming and building computers at 10 or 11-years-old and always knew \"I wanted to be a hacker or work in security\".",
      "He began working in a security operations centre at 16, and moved into penetration testing at 20, a job that also involved testing the security of clients' physical and computer security: \"I had to forge false identities and break into places and then hack. Quite fun.\"",
      "But in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back.",
      "Internet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash \"bounty\" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s.",
      "Eventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities.",
      "As Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a \"morally agnostic skill set\", bug hunters do have to operate within the law.",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the \"scope\" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate \"hammering\" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money.",
      "The payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. \"We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes.\"",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd mean \"you can use hackers as a force for good,\" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered \u2013 and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one \"we deem very severe\". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.",
      "So, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.",
      "But while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.",
      "Mr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"",
      "Yet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.",
      "Mr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.",
      "\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".",
      "Dr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.",
      "And it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.",
      "But modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.",
      "He says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".",
      "Mr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"",
      "But these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"",
      "But the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.",
      "\"If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws.\"",
      "Dr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but \"I think it's just a matter of time\".",
      "In the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. \"The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe.\"",
      "That is unlikely to put off the bug hunters in the meantime. As Mr De Ceukelaire says: \"Once a hacker, always a hacker.\"",

      "After the prince's disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019, legal ownership of his Dragons' Den-style start-up competition, Pitch@Palace Global, was transferred to a Barrowman-linked firm, Knox House Trustees (UK).",
      "Barrowman and his wife, lingerie boss Baroness Michelle Mone, hit the headlines when she admitted they had lied about their links to a company that won large government contracts during the Covid pandemic after she recommended it to ministers.",
      "A lawyer for Mr Barrowman said he \"at no time... had any business or personal involvement with the duke\".",
      "Pitch@Palace Global remained the prince's company, under his control. But in line with longstanding royal practice, it was owned under the names of other people or companies, acting on his behalf as so-called \"nominees\".",
      "Documents filed at Companies House show that from 2021, the nominee owner was Knox House Trustees (UK), which was controlled and ultimately owned by Mr Barrowman until 2023.",
      "Controversial associates",
      "Prince Andrew's finances have been under intense scrutiny, with questions about how he can afford to live in his Royal Lodge mansion in Windsor after he was cut off financially by his brother, King Charles.",
      "The prince's choice of business associates has long been controversial. In December, he said he \"ceased all contact\" with Yang Tengbo, who led the Chinese arm of Pitch@Palace, after receiving advice from the UK government which alleged that he was a spy.",
      "Mr Yang has denied being a spy or doing anything unlawful.",
      "Mr Barrowman has attracted plenty of controversy too. In 2017, HMRC began an investigation into one of his companies, AML Tax (UK), which it said \"aggressively promoted\" tax avoidance schemes. It was fined \u00a3150,000 in 2022.",
      "In January that year, the Guardian newspaper first reported links between Mr Barrowman, Baroness Mone and PPE Medpro. The pair denied involvement until December 2023, when she admitted in a BBC interview that they had lied about their links with the company.",
      "The National Crime Agency is now investigating suspected criminal offences at the firm. Mr Barrowman and Baroness Mone both deny any wrongdoing.",
      "Author Andrew Lownie, who is writing a biography of the prince, said: \"Andrew has a long history of associating with dubious business figures and disguising his business activities behind nominee and offshore accounts. There really needs to be a full investigation into the duke's financial activities.\"",
      "Who owns Pitch@Palace?",
      "Pitch@Palace was a start-up competition, founded in 2014, where entrepreneurs would pitch their ideas to possible investors in the hope of winning their backing. It had two parts:",
      "a UK-based version, set up as a community interest company, which cannot pay profits to shareholdersan international arm, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd, which held competitions in places such as Australia, Bahrain and China, and was set up as a for-profit UK company",

      "an international arm, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd, which held competitions in places such as Australia, Bahrain and China, and was set up as a for-profit UK company",
      "Both arms of Pitch@Palace suspended operations following the Newsnight interview in 2019 about the prince's links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which led to Andrew stepping down as a working royal.",
      "Nonetheless, the international operation has emerged as a possible way for the duke to fund his lifestyle. In a court witness statement from 2023, Mr Yang wrote that the duke had needed money \"and saw the relationships with China through Pitch as one possible source of funding\".",
      "Earlier this year a Dutch company said it was in talks to buy it, saying it saw \"immense value\" in the network, even though it had suspended operations.",
      "However, Prince Andrew has never held the company in his own name.",
      "Founded in 2017, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd was initially held in the name of Amanda Thirsk, the prince's private secretary, in an arrangement often used by the Royal Family.",
      "But early in 2021, the legal ownership was transferred to Knox House Trustees (UK) Limited.",
      "This company had been set up the year before, and Mr Barrowman was named as having \"significant influence and control\" over it.",
      "Corporate filings in the Isle of Man show Knox House Trustees (UK) was ultimately owned by Knox Limited, whose sole shareholder is Mr Barrowman.",
      "Investigations into Barrowman's companies",
      "In 2023, ownership of Knox House Trustees (UK) Ltd \u2013 which still owned Pitch@Palace Global - was transferred to Arthur Lancaster, an accountant who has a longstanding working relationship with both the prince and Mr Barrowman. This remains the situation today.",
      "The same year Mr Lancaster took over as the sole director and shareholder of PPE Medpro. He was also a director of many of the companies involved in the AML tax avoidance case.",
      "The judge in that case called him \"evasive\" and said he had \"real concerns as to the reliability of Mr Lancaster's evidence\", which contained \"significant inconsistencies\".",
      "After the case, his lawyer wrote to the court arguing that the conclusions were \"unnecessarily harsh\", that Mr Lancaster had been a \"diligent and truthful witness\", and that his efforts to provide information had been hampered by the Covid pandemic.",
      "For decades the Royal Family has held investments through nominees, and still does. In the past this has served to keep details of their holdings private, though not in this case. Prince Andrew's involvement in Pitch@Palace Global is well known, and he is listed as having \"significant influence or control\" over the company on Companies House.",
      "Mr Barrowman's lawyer said in a statement: \"Mr Lancaster was a director of KHT (UK) Ltd which provided company administration services to a number of external companies, including Pitch@Palace, a company wholly owned by the duke. Mr Lancaster acted for the duke in a personal capacity at all times and has been an associate of the duke for many years.\"",

      "President Donald Trump is set to take action to ease the impact of his tariffs on US car makers, a top White House official says.",
      "\"This deal is a major victory for the President's trade policy by rewarding companies who manufacture domestically,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement provided to the Reuters news agency.",
      "The president will announce measures to reduce some import duties on parts from abroad that are used in vehicles manufactured in the US.",
      "In addition, while cars made outside the country will still be subject to automotive tariffs, they will not be hit with further levies like those on steel and aluminium products, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier.",
      "Trump is due to hold a rally in Michigan on Tuesday to mark his first 100 days in office.",
      "The state is home to the so-called Detroit Three carmakers - Ford, General Motors (GM) and Stellantis - and a network of more than 1,000 major suppliers to the industry.",
      "Trump has put tariffs at the centre of his economic plans, describing it as \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\".",
      "But they have sparked turmoil in global financial markets, caused major uncertainties for businesses and increased fears of a sharp economic slowdown.",
      "The move to ease the impact on the motor industry has been seen as the latest attempt by his administration to show flexibility on the policy.",
      "GM's chief executive Mary Barra welcomed the development.",
      "\"We're grateful to President Trump for his support of the US automotive industry and the millions of Americans who depend on us,\" she told the BBC in an emailed statement.",
      "\"We appreciate the productive conversations with the President and his Administration and look forward to continuing to work together.\"",
      "Ford said it appreciated Trump's decision, which it said would \"help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers\".",
      "\"We will continue to work closely with the administration in support of the president's vision for a healthy and growing auto industry in America,\" a statement added.",
      "The car maker said policies that encouraged exports and ensured affordable supply chains to promote more domestic growth were \"essential\".",
      "\"It will be important for the major vehicle importers to match Ford's commitment to building in America,\" the company said, adding that if they did, the US would see a \"windfall of new assembly and supplier factories and hundreds of thousands of new jobs\".",
      "Stellantis chairman John Elkann echoed the sentiments of his rival carmakers in response to the tariff reliefs.",
      "\"We look forward to our continued collaboration with the US administration to strengthen a competitive American auto industry and stimulate exports,\" he added.",
      "Last week, a coalition of US motor industry groups called on the president to not impose 25% tariffs on imported car parts.",
      "A letter to his administration from groups representing companies including GM, Toyota and Volkswagen said the levies \"will lead to higher auto prices for consumers, lower sales at dealerships and will make servicing and repairing vehicles both more expensive\".",

      "The sugar tax applied to fizzy drinks could be extended to pre-packaged milkshakes and lattes under new government plans.",
      "The government is consulting on proposals to end the exemption from the tax for milk-based drinks, as well as non-dairy substitutes such as oats or rice.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in her autumn budget last year that the government was considering widening the levy.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride labelled the move a \"sucker punch\" to households when Labour had \"already pushed up the cost of living for families\".",
      "The sugar tax, known formally as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), is a tax on pre-packaged drinks such as those sold in cans and cartons in supermarkets.",
      "It applies to manufacturers and was introduced by the Conservative government in April 2018 as a means to tackle obesity.",
      "On Monday, the Treasury also confirmed proposals to reduce the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml.",
      "Some 203 pre-packed milk-based drinks on the market, which make up 93% of sales within the category, will be hit with the tax unless their sugar content is reduced in accordance with the proposals, government analysis says.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the government was consulting on \"going further\" with the existing levy after it was shown to have had a particular impact on children's health.",
      "\"We are making sure we are taking practical, sensible measures to improve the health of our children,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.",
      "The original exemption for milk-based drinks was included because of concerns about calcium consumption, particularly among children.",
      "Announcing the planned changes, the Treasury said young people only get 3.5% of their calcium intake from such drinks, meaning \"it is also likely that the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar\".",
      "\"By bringing milk-based drinks and milk substitute drinks into the SDIL, the government would introduce a tax incentive for manufacturers of these drinks to build on existing progress and further reduce sugar in their recipes,\" it added.",
      "The government estimates that 89% of soft drinks sold in the UK are not subject to the tax because of widespread reformulation by manufacturers since 2018.",
      "But it added that the levy had effectively created a \"target\" of just below the 5g threshold, and products had clustered below 5g as a result.",
      "The government consultation will run from Monday until 21 July.",
      "No drinks with sweeteners for younger children, say UK advisers",
      "Top-brand baby food pouches lack key nutrients",
      "Are sweeteners healthier than sugar?",
      "The SDIL has raised a total of \u00a31.9 billion since its introduction in 2018, according to government statistics released last September. Revenue for HMRC for the 2023-24 financial year was \u00a3338 million.",
      "Opponents of the levy in recent years include the soft drinks industry, pubs and off licences. Some argue the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families and does little to tackle obesity.",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage told the BBC on Tuesday he was \"sick to death of a government telling us how we should live\" and said the focus should be on educating people who can then make decisions about their health.",
      "Meanwhile, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she had not been a \"fan\" of the levy when it was first introduced by her party, calling it \"a bit too much nanny state\".",
      "She told BBC Breakfast: \"My worry is that the government does not have any plans... and so they're just looking for what else they can tax.\"",
      "But Tam Fry, the chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said he welcomed the proposals \"tremendously\" and said it was \"high-time\" the levy was extended.",
      "He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was \"not a game-changer\" in terms of tackling obesity, but \"one of those things that is needed\".",
      "Industry body the Food and Drink Federation said it welcomed the chance to share its views in the consultation.",
      "It said \"significant progress\" had already been made and \"many years of investment in research and development\" had reduced sugar in soft drinks by 46% in the last five years, with a 30% sugar reduction in pre-packed milk-based drinks in the last three years.",
      "It added that food and drink manufacturers were facing a series of inflationary pressures and called on the government to \"continue to create the right conditions for businesses to innovate and also be clear about their long-term goals to promote business confidence\"."

      "The outage began soon after midday Spanish time and cities across the country have been impacted, although the popular tourist destinations of the Balearic and Canary Islands have not been as badly affected.",
      "The blackouts have led to public transport being disrupted, with trains being cancelled. Traffic lights being affected led to the mayor of Madrid to ask residents to keep the roads clear as tunnels of certain highways were closed.",
      "According to aviation analytics firm Cirium, Lisbon airport had the most (29.6%) departure cancellations in Portugal by Monday evening. A total of nine flights from the UK to Portugal were also grounded.",
      "The BBC understands that Lisbon airport has limited its flow rates - effectively not allowing planes to arrive or there are delays getting planes in, which then knocks on to the tight system of airport operations, where planes normally arrive and leave in strict timeframes.",
      "Barcelona and Madrid made up the majority of cancellations from Spanish airports, but zero flights from the UK to Spain have been scrapped, according to Cirium.",
      "David Gleave, an aviation investigator, told the BBC any interruption to power supplies at airports would not affect air traffic control as \"a battery will kick in a maximum of a second later, so airplanes are safe\".",
      "\"From then on, a diesel-powered generator will keep power running so air traffic control can function,\" he added.",

      "Other customers have described having to cancel orders for clothes which they were expecting to collect before going on holiday, or being unable to return goods they had previously bought.",
      "But some have expressed sympathy for the staff at the stores, who they say have been on the receiving end of abuse from angry customers, or having to deal with shopping abandoned at the tills when customers were unable to pay when contactless payments were down.",

      "M&S remains silent on how the cyber attack unfolded, the nature of the attack and how specifically it has been affected by it - leaving cyber security experts to speculate as to what might have happened.",
      "It is known it has hired external cyber security experts, who are likely to be a team of incident response specialists who will be working around the clock either at the headquarters of the company or remotely.",

      "And there is a widespread view that there is no need for countries to retaliate, when the CEOs of Walmart and Target are telling the President privately that there will be empty shelves from early May.",
      "The collapse in container traffic from China to the port of Los Angeles - the main artery of the world economy for the first quarter of the 21st century - is the one to watch. The IMF's boffins say they can start to see the impact from space as satellites track fewer, increasingly empty ships leaving China's ports. Of course this will be denied by the US.",
      "West Wing farce",
      "It is true that there was far more relative calm at the end of the IMF Meetings compared to the beginning. Why? Because the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has seized control of the tariff agenda and has almost single-handedly calmed markets and the rest of the world.",
      "Financial diplomats put down the Bessent ascendancy and the critical 90 day pause in the so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs to some farcical West Wing antics.",
      "The story goes Bessent was able to get the ear of Trump regarding the bond market damage from his tariffs, only after a separate White House economic adviser managed to use the bait of a fake meeting to lure away the hardline tariff hawk and author of the infamous reciprocal tariff equation Pete Navarro from patrolling the Oval Office.",
      "Wall Street bosses are thought to have suggested that only by firing Navarro, can some semblance of normality return. Insiders suggest that Trump will never get rid of his trade adviser, as he served time in jail after the January 6 riots in support of the President.",
      "At best this sounds like the future of the world economy and all our livelihoods played out like a real time Hilary Mantel novel about the court of Trump. At worst it is leading to financiers and Governments starting to think the unthinkable about how much further the US or the rest of the world might go and  currently, the uncertainty about everything is more concerning than the direct impact of the tariffs.",
      "A nightmarish scenario",
      "And that uncertainty is prompting some fairly wild theories about what might come next.",
      "At times of acute global financial stress, \"swap lines\" between central banks exist to preserve financial stability, making sure there is a constant supply of US dollars.",
      "But now some of the world's central banks have started to game out what might happen if the US chose to use its dollar \"swap lines\" to the rest of the world as a form of diplomatic leverage or even a weapon.",
      "Is it inconceivable that the US might deny them or veto the Federal Reserve handing them out? One just has to assume it is inconceivable, because in many instances there is no way to mitigate it. But the nightmarish scenario for the world financial system, however unlikely, is now not wholly implausible.",
      "A little less unlikely perhaps is the idea that those countries with a trade surplus with the US could help fund the US with an effective tax on their holdings of US government debt. Some of these ideas have been floated in speeches and papers by US government advisers.",
      "In this atmosphere, worrying but incorrect ideas can start to infect confidence. For example, there was a \"whodunnit\" about significant selling of US Government debt just after the original tariff reveal.",
      "Some speculated it was China. But Tokyo currently happens to be the biggest overall creditor to the US. Was this Japanese selling that helped make the case to Trump for the tariff pause, an almost deliberate diplomatic tactic? Two very well connected officials suggested this scenario to me, which shows the febrility right now, even though it seems implausible.",
      "No one crawling",
      "While Bessent commanded the weekend airwaves in the US having assumed control of this process, it was still quite something to see him sending the message that \"Investors need to know that the U.S. government bond market is the safest and soundest in the world\". If you have to say it\u2026",
      "Another significant finance minister told me of his global counterparts that \"no one was crawling to the Americans\" given the unbeatable effectiveness of the US having to negotiate with its own bond market.",
      "Amid the uncertainty, no one seems to know if the \"baseline\" universal tariff of 10% is even negotiable. President Trump's message that tariff revenue could be sufficient to \"completely eliminate\" income taxes for \"many people\" would rather suggest that it will stay.",
      "\"It depends on who you talk to on which day of week\u2026 I've heard three different positions articulated on the baseline, one by the White House, one by the Commerce Dept, and one by a US Trade representative,\" said one senior G7 official. \"Do you know what the final outcome will be? Whatever the president wants at that moment, shaped by industrial, market and political issues,\" I was told.",
      "Consistent UK diplomacy",
      "This is of particular interest to the UK, because the baseline bites the UK hard. Alongside big tariffs on cars which are our biggest goods export and likely further ones on pharmaceuticals, our second most important export, the US hit to the UK appears inexplicable when by the White House's own creative definition of \"trade cheating\" - running a goods surplus - the US is actually slightly \"cheating\" the UK.",
      "I put this point to the Chancellor several times over two interviews in Washington. She diplomatically rejected that suggestion.",
      "But eventually right at the end of our last interview, strolling around the famous reflecting pool in between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument, she volunteered something rather telling of the changing world. \"I understand why there's so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they're our nearest neighbours and trading partners,\" she told me. It caused a bit of a fuss back home, but it was not an off the cuff gaffe.",
      "That's because concessions to the US on food standards are off limits for domestic political reasons. This appears to have been accepted by the Americans after consistent UK diplomacy, as the focus remains on a technology prosperity deal. It seems pretty clear now that the UK is going to push ahead with a \"high ambition high alignment\" deal with the European Union. And word had got out here among finance ministers.",
      "A very senior international official used the example of the UK-EU rapprochement as an example of the rest of the world coordinating and \"doing its homework\" as a response to US unreliability. \"Brexit was a bitter divorce, but now I see you are dating again,\" I was told privately.",
      "There was also some relief that the US remained engaged with the World Bank and IMF. The Project 2025 plan that was published in April 2023 by the think tank The Heritage Foundation in anticipation of a second Trump presidency envisaged the US leaving those international organisations, and the Governor of the Bank of England recently expressed his concerns to me.",
      "Bessent used the meetings to confirm US commitment to the Bank and the Fund, albeit with a return to their core functions and away from considerations of social issues and the environment. The Europeans counted that as a win.",
      "A grand battle?",
      "But a bigger canvas remains. Will the US use this trade war in order to try to corral the rest of the world on to its side in a grand battle with China? It seems astonishing to have annoyed allies so significantly and fundamentally if this was the strategic point of all this. A test case here is Spain, which faces 20% tariffs as an EU member state.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez met President Xi in Beijing a fortnight ago. Spain's booming economy (the fastest growing advanced economy last year -  and forecast to be again this year) is the only one to be upgraded by the IMF. It is built on green energy, access to foreign labour, tourism and significant investment and technology transfer from China. The US took a dim view of the visit and held a \"frank\" discussion with its finance minister Carlos Cuerpo.",
      "He appeared rather unmoved by all this, telling me at the Semafor World Economy Summit in DC: \"There's a huge trade deficit with China, and we need to correct that by opening up to China, by also attracting Chinese investment, of course, within an overall economic security umbrella. And that can only be done by engaging and actually talking to the Chinese authorities\".",
      "Spain has secured notable Chinese electric vehicle factory investment and technology transfer. The US doesn't like it. But if the US wanted to persuade the Spanish and EU of its reliable long term allyship against China, it is difficult to see the strategy in the past month's tariff accusations and chaos.",
      "Whoever wins in Canada's election will bring that G7 economy firmly back into this globally transformative debate. Could the newly elected Canadian PM start a full fat negotiation with the UK too? And then he will chair the G7 Summit in Canada in June as President Trump's 90 day deadline expires. It is presumed Donald Trump will travel to Alberta, to the country he claims should be part of his own.",
      "There is a path to trade peace, calm and deescalation. But it could get much worse too. This is a critical few weeks for the world economy.",

      "Planned changes to school uniform policy will affect over four million pupils across England, according to new estimates from the Department for Education (DfE).",
      "The government says seven in 10 secondary schools and 35% of primary schools in England will have to reduce the number of compulsory branded items to three, plus a branded tie for secondary students.",
      "The new rule is part of the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which still has several parliamentary stages to go through before becoming a law.",

      "The government claims parents will save around \u00a350 per child through the school uniform measures, which it hopes to introduce in September 2026.",
      "But uniform retailers warn that the planned changes might increase costs for families. The Schoolwear Association says the plans could mean parents spend more on replacing lower-quality generic garments which might not last as long as branded items.",

      "She is the director of mortgage distribution at April Mortgages, which provides 10 and 15-year mortgages. The rates are generally higher, but the certainty of payments she feels is a selling point.",
      "The company is now offering home loans at seven times a borrower's income, which is higher than for many shorter-term loans.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20lyg4385o",
    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 16:07:38 GMT",
    "summary": "The US central bank is one of Trump's favourite punching bags. But how serious is the threat?",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has some well-known nemeses: illegal immigrants, low-flow showers and last, but definitely not least, the head of the US central bank.",
      "Elevated by Trump to lead the Federal Reserve starting in 2018, Jerome Powell almost immediately found himself under fire - described on social media as a bonehead and questioned about reports that the president wanted him gone.",
      "But however uncomfortable Powell might have been then, his position has only gotten worse.",
      "Not only is he overseeing an economy where the risk of recession is rapidly rising, Trump has been flirting publicly with his removal, writing on social media last week: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\"",
      "Coming at a time when Trump has pushed to expand presidential power, while cowing political opponents and ploughing past judicial efforts to check his action, it has raised alarm that he is more serious about, and might be more able to, exert control over the Fed than during his first term.",
      "The tensions cooled this week, when Trump, a day after a market slide that some analysts tied to the comments, denied to reporters that he ever had any intention of firing Powell.",
      "It came amid other hints of de-escalation in Trump's economic rhetoric as his policies, especially trade tariffs, have faced rising political and business backlash.",
      "But Trump did not offer much assurance that he would limit his interventions at the Fed, maintaining his right to have a view and noting that he might call Powell to discuss his concerns about the bank's interest rate policy.",
      "Donald Kohn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the former vice chair of the Federal Reserve, said the shift in tone appeared intended to calm financial markets but he did not think it marked the end of a fight over the Fed, an institution considered vital to the health of the world's largest economy.",
      "\"It's a testimony to the market's response,\" he said. \"But I think it's way too soon to say that there's a stability there.\"",
      "What is Trump's problem with Powell?",
      "Trump's clash with the Fed is ostensibly rooted in differences over where the bank should fix its key interest rate, which plays an influential role shaping borrowing costs for credit cards, mortgages and other loans.",
      "Lower rates make it easier to borrow and tend to deliver an economic boost. Higher interest rates dampen activity, helping to keep prices stable.",
      "Trump, who cut his teeth professionally taking out loans as a property developer, has long confessed to liking a low interest rate policy.",
      "He objected when the Fed raised rates in his first term and has been pushing Powell to cut them now, arguing that inflation has cooled and keeping rates too high could do unnecessary economic damage.",
      "\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote on social media earlier this week, referring to Powell.",
      "A threat to Fed independence?",
      "Trump is hardly the first politician to cast the bank as a scapegoat at a moment of economic turmoil - or to press for lower interest rates.",
      "Nor is he alone in his criticism of Powell, who infamously initially dismissed post-pandemic price inflation as \"transitory\" and has been faulted for being too focused on backward-looking data.",
      "Trump's pressure on the bank, however, breaks with Washington tradition in recent decades of presidential deference to the Fed.",
      "It has drawn comparisons to former President Richard Nixon, who pushed his Fed chairman to loosen its policies ahead of the 1972 election, moves later blamed for feeding the high-inflation, low-growth \"stagflationary\" dynamic of that decade.",
      "The idea that Trump could exert control over the Fed elicits horror among many economists, who say history is littered with examples of countries where political interference at central banks led to spiralling prices and economic ruin.",
      "Sarah Binder, professor at George Washington University and a scholar of the Federal Reserve, said confidence in Fed independence is key to maintaining market faith that inflation will be controlled.",
      "If shaken, it could lead to higher borrowing costs for everyone, as investors demand higher interest rates for holding debt, she warned, noting that should the Fed eventually cut rates, it is likely to spark speculation about Trump's influence - regardless of how, if at all, it played into the decision.",
      "\"That's ultimately the problem. It is perceptions of independence that really matter and that's what the pernicious effects of the attacks are they do raise doubts about whether the Fed can be as stalwart as central bankers want to be,\" she said.",
      "Can Trump fire Powell?",
      "Joe Lavorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, who served on the National Economic Council during Trump's first term, said he saw little need for Trump to dial back his attacks, noting that he was making a \"very classic macro argument\" about the bank's flaws.",
      "\"I'm completely on board with the president's sympathies or comments that the Fed has historically been late,\" he said, adding that he thought stock market falls had been driven primarily by questions about trade policy.",
      "He said he believed that Fed officials would remain more responsive to financial conditions than the president, noting that, if anything, Trump's pressure could make it more hesitant to cut, lest it be perceived as being cowed.",
      "\"Ultimately the Fed is going to do what's prudent,\" he said. \"The question is just the timing.\"",
      "Powell, a longtime Washington lawyer whose term as chair is due to end next year, has maintained that he is unbothered - and uninfluenced - by the criticism and asserted that Trump does not have the legal authority to remove him.",
      "But the strength of his position is a matter of legal debate.",
      "By law, Fed governors can only be removed for cause, but it is unclear whether that protection extends to the role leading the board.",
      "The administration has already taken steps to reduce the Fed's regulatory role and is engaged in a legal battle over expanding presidential authority over other government agencies set up with features, like for cause protections, intended to insulate them from partisan pressure.",
      "Mark Spindel, founder and chief investment officer of the Washington-based investment advisory firm Potomac River Capital, who has worked with Prof Binder on Fed studies, noted that the tradition of Fed \"independence\" had evolved over time, often after political or economic crisis.",
      "\"Things that are given can be taken away,\" he said, hours before Trump appeared to back off.",
      "Asked again for his thoughts a few days later, Mr Spindel wrote back just two words in reply: \"Damage done.\""

      "Domestic energy prices are forecast to fall in July, reversing three consecutive increases in regulator Ofgem's price cap.",
      "The annual bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by \u00a3166 a year, a drop of nearly 9%, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted.",
      "It comes after a series of household bills became more expensive in April, and would mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost \u00a31,683.",
      "The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, not the total bill - so if you use more, you pay more.",
      "Huge uncertainty",
      "The energy price cap covers around 22 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is set every three months by Ofgem.",
      "While the quarterly change can skew annual comparisons, the regulator illustrates the effect of the price cap with the annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity.",
      "In the three months from July last year, that typical bill stood at \u00a31,568 a year. It rose on each of the three occasions the cap was set after that, the most recent of which was at the start of April.",
      "The predicted fall of almost 9% in July - if it happens - would bring it sharply down to the lowest level since last September.",
      "Cornwall Insight also expects a slight fall in prices in October and another drop in January 2026.",
      "However, analysts said great uncertainty still surrounded these forecasts.",
      "\"While a fall in bills will always be welcomed by households, we mustn't get ahead of ourselves.

      "Tax rises in October's Budget are \"crippling\" her salon business, she said, and the extra \u00a323,000 a year imposed by the chancellor could prove the final nail in the coffin.",
      "\"I have been crying myself to sleep because, since October, this has been the worst period of my personal life in 30 years,\" she said.",
      "\"I feel ashamed to get into debt but we are gradually eating through our business reserves and I can't take wages if I don't make a profit.",
      "\"I could lose my house if the business folds - that is the reality and if things don't change it is frightening the life out of me.\"",
      "'I don't have the margin to invest in apprentices'",
      "'Perfect storm' could see end of salon apprenticeships",
      "'We're always hammered' - Beauty industry ahead of budget",

      "They say their plan to reform business rates will mean lower taxes for High Street businesses such as hair salons when it comes into effect in 2026-27.",
      "But salon owners fear this may come too late to save their businesses.",
      "Cutting a client's hair, Kerry explained she could not afford to take on any new apprentices this year and had been forced to reduce the hours of her current 12 apprentices to the minimum.",
      "The next step will be to halve the number of apprentices over the next year as their contracts finish, ending up with six by the end of this year.",
      "If the business cannot recover over the next four years, the rest of her 28 staff, who are nearly all local women who became stylists after serving an apprenticeship at the salon, are facing potential redundancy.",
      "\"I'm having to drastically reduce my overall employee numbers to cut costs just to survive,\" she said.",
      "\"Where are the future hairdressers going to come from if good, employed salons go out of business?\"",
      "Kerry added the way the chancellor is treating salons, which overwhelmingly employ women, \"totally goes against the objectives of the government\" in growing the economy and supporting workers.",
      "Part of the pressure is coming from the UK's Value Added Tax (VAT) rules, which do not allow businesses to reclaim tax on staff costs in the same way they can for goods, putting labour-intensive businesses such as hair or beauty salons at a disadvantage.",
      "\"If you look at a cafe, one waiter can serve several tables of four customers in the space of an hour and the cafe can reclaim the VAT on all the food and drink they serve,\" Kerry explained.",
      "\"Whereas one salon customer needs attention from the receptionist, the apprentice for hair-washing, and the stylist in that same hour and we can only claim VAT back on a tube of hair colour.\"",
      "Many hairdressers went into debt due to the pandemic, said Kerry, and the added pressures of increases in employer National Insurance contributions (Nics) and business rates are now threatening the future of salons across the country.",
      "For Kerry's salon, the Vanilla Rooms, the tax increases have added a \"devastating\" \u00a323,000 extra to her annual costs, through a combination of the threshold at which employers start to pay Nics on staff wages being lowered to \u00a35,000 and changes to business rates.",
      "Her Nics costs have risen 29%, from about \u00a342,000 to about \u00a354,500 - now costing more than \u00a31,000 a week  - and business rates have gone up by 144%, from \u00a37,576 to \u00a318,482 a year.",
      "Kerry is one of 50,000 UK hairdressing professionals represented by the British Hair Consortium (BHC), which has urged Rachel Reeves to take action or face the \"collapse\" of the industry due to rising costs.",
      "The BHC argues the most efficient support the government could offer is through halving VAT for salons, because staff wages make up 60% of their costs.",
      "The association says cutting VAT could actually increase overall tax take, by preventing more workers going self-employed or entering the black market.",
      "Kerry's case was one of those raised by Conservative MP Julia Lopez in a debate this week in Parliament's Westminster Hall, where she urged Rachel Reeves to lower VAT from 20% to 10% to support the hair and beauty sector.",
      "Lopez,  the MP for Hornchurch and Upminster, said Kerry was not alone in being forced to consider whether she will have to shut up shop completely.",
      "\"Some of the increased bills for salons are just unbelievable,\" she said, adding that women were disproportionately impacted by the changes.",
      "\"It's hard to ignore the impact, let alone the irony, of a chancellor celebrating herself for being the first woman to hold that office while simultaneously hammering the sectors that employ, serve and are often led, by women.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat business spokesperson Sarah Gibson agreed that Reeves' Budget had implemented \"an unfair tax on jobs\" and the government must offer tax relief for small businesses in June.",
      "Gibson said an increasing number of salons are opting to rent chairs out to self-employed staff, instead of employing stylists directly, to avoid paying tax.",
      "\"If salons don't get support we will see a huge increase in people becoming chair renters,\" she said, which reduces the Treasury's overall tax take.",
      "Responding for the Labour government, Small Business Minister Gareth Thomas defended the chancellor's decisions in her October Budget as \"important for long term stability\".",
      "Salons are \"a vital pillar of our high streets\", he said, adding \"many hair and beauty businesses will benefit from some of the other measures the chancellor introduced\".",
      "\"We increased the employment allowance so that almost one million employers pay no national insurance contributions at all.",
      "More than half of employers will see no change or gain from that package, and that includes many hair and beauty businesses,\" he told MPs.",
      "Update 26 April 2025: This article was amended to correct the cost of Kerry's business rates, which she said increased from about \u00a37,000, not from \u00a3700 as we originally stated.",

      "Armath is part of the UATE's education and workforce development programme. Mr Karapetyan says the programme is the most successful public-private partnership in the country.",
      "\"We raise capital expenditure from the private sector, we go to the schools and establish Armath labs, we donate the equipment,\" he says. \"And the government, the education ministry gives us a budget of $2m (\u00a31.5m) annually to pay the salaries of the coaches.\"",

      "In 1956 the Yerevan Scientific Research Institute of Mathematical Machines was established in Armenia and by 1960 it had developed two first generation computers.",
      "Today, the country is tapping into its legacy with the ambition to transform itself into the tech powerhouse of the Caucasus.",
      "And there has been some success already. Picsart, a AI-powered photo and video editing website and app, was launched in Armenia in 2011. Today the company of the same name, which has dual headquarters in Yerevan and Miami, is valued at $1.5bn.",

    "summary": "Humanoid robots are attracting a lot of investment but will China dominate the industry?",
    "story": [
      "It's a bright spring morning in Hanover, Germany, and I'm on my way to meet a robot.",
      "I have been invited to see the G1, a humanoid robot built by Chinese firm, Unitree, at the Hannover Messe, one of the world's largest industrial trade shows.",
      "Standing at about 4'3\" (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers and martial arts have gone viral.",
      "Today the G1 is being controlled remotely by Pedro Zheng, the Unitree sales manager.",
      "He explains that customers must program each G1 for autonomous functions.",
      "Passers-by stop and actively try to engage with the G1, which cannot be said for a lot of the other machines being shown off in the cavernous conference room.",
      "They reach out to shake its hand, make sudden movements to see if it will respond, they laugh when G1 waves or bends backwards, they apologise if they bump into it. There's something about its human shape that, uncanny as it is, sets people at ease.",
      "Unitree is just one of dozens of companies around the world developing robots that have a human form.",
      "The potential is huge - for business it promises a workforce that doesn't need holidays or pay rises.",
      "It could also be the ultimate domestic appliance. After all, who wouldn't want a machine that could do the laundry and stack the dishwasher.",
      "But the technology is still some way off. While robotic arms and mobile robots have been common in factories and warehouses for decades, conditions in those workplaces can be controlled and workers can be kept safe.",
      "Introducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment, like a restaurant or a home, is a much more difficult problem.",
      "To be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous - simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous.",
      "So much work needs to be done on the artificial intelligence that would control such a machine.",
      "\"The AI simply has not yet reached a breakthrough moment,\" a Unitree spokesperson tells the BBC.",
      "\"Today's robot AI finds basic logic and reasoning \u2013 such as for understanding and completing complex tasks in a logical way \u2013 a challenge,\" they said.",
      "At the moment their G1 is marketed at research institutions and tech companies, who can use Unitree's open source software for development.",
      "For now entrepreneurs are focussing their efforts on humanoid robots for warehouses and factories.",
      "The highest profile of those is Elon Musk. His car company, Tesla, is developing a humanoid robot called Optimus. In January he said that \"several thousand\" will be built this year and he expects them to be doing \"useful things\" in Tesla factories.",
      "Other carmakers are following a similar path. BMW recently introduced humanoid robots to a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundai has ordered tens of thousands of robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021.",
      "Thomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms.",
      "Mr Andersson thinks that Chinese companies are likely to dominate the market.",
      "\"The supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in China, and it's really easy to iterate developments and do R&D [research and development],\" he says.",
      "Unitree underlines that advantage - its G1 is cheap (for a robot) with an advertised price of $16,000 (\u00a312,500).",
      "Also, Mr Andersson points out, the investment favours Asian nations.",
      "In a recent report STIQ notes that almost 60% of all funding for humanoid robots has been raised in Asia, with the US attracting most of the rest.",
      "Chinese companies have the added benefit of support from the national and local government.",
      "For example, in Shanghai there is a state-backed training facility for robots, where dozens of humanoid robots are learning to complete tasks.",
      "So how can US and European robot makers compete with that?",
      "Bristol-based Bren Pierce has founded three robotics companies and the latest, Kinisi has just launched the KR1 robot.",
      "While the robot has been designed and developed in the UK, it will be manufactured in Asia.",
      "\"The problem you get as a European or American company, you have to buy all these sub-components from China in the first place.",
      "\"So then it becomes stupid to buy your motors, buy your batteries, buy your resistors, shift them all halfway around the world to put together when you could just put them all together at the source, which is in Asia.\"",
      "As well as making his robots in Asia, Mr Pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form.",
      "Designed for warehouses and factories, the KR1 does not have legs.",
      "\"All of these places have flat floors. Why would you want the added expense of a very complex form factor... when you could just put it on a mobile base?\" he asks.",
      "Where possible, his KR1 is built with mass-produced components - the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter.",
      "\"My philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf. So all our motors, batteries, computers, cameras, they're all commercially available, mass produced parts,\" he says.",
      "Like his competitors at Unitree, Mr Pierce says that the real \"secret sauce\" is the software that allows the robot to work with humans.",
      "\"A lot of companies come out with very high-tech robots, but then you start needing a PhD in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it.",
      "\"What we're trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours,\" Mr Pierce says.",
      "He says the KR1 can perform a task after being guided through it by a human 20 or 30 times.",
      "The KR1 will be given to pilot customers to test this year.",
      "So will robots ever break out of factories into the home? Even the optimistic Mr Pierce says it's a long way off.",
      "\"My long term dream for the last 20 years has been building the everything robot. This is what I was doing my PhD work in I do think that is the end goal, but it's a very complicated task,\" says Mr Pierce.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 06:56:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Australia has proposed to create a strategic reserve of critical minerals.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's prime minister Anthony Albanese has pledged to invest A$1.2bn (\u00a3580m) in a strategic reserve for critical minerals if he wins next month's election, as trade tensions escalate.",
      "The announcement came after China imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements, essential to the production of advanced technologies - including electric vehicles, fighter jets, and robots.",
      "China's controls apply to all countries but were widely seen as retaliation to US President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "Albanese said Australia would prioritise minerals that are key to its security, and that of its partners, including rare earths. But could his plan challenge China's dominance?",
      "What are rare earth minerals and why are they important?",
      "Rare earths are a group of 17 elements - named \"rare\" because they are notoriously difficult to extract and refine.",
      "Rare earths, like samarium and terbium, are critical to the production of technologies set to shape the world in the coming decades \u2013 including electric vehicles and highly advanced weapons systems.",
      "Albanese's proposed reserve includes rare earths as well as other critical minerals of which Australia is a top producer - like lithium and cobalt.",
      "Both China and Australia have rare earth reserves. But 90% of rare earth refining \u2013 which makes them usable in technology \u2013 takes place in China, giving the country significant control over supply.",
      "And that has spooked Western governments.",
      "Why is China restricting the export of rare earth minerals?",
      "Beijing said its restrictions on rare earths were in response to Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports to the US, currently at 145%.",
      "But analysts say Washington's inability to secure the supply of rare earths has become one of the Trump administration's chief anxieties, especially as diplomatic tensions with Beijing have deepened.",
      "Around 75% of US rare earth imports came from China between 2019 and 2022, according to the US Geological Survey.",
      "Philip Kirchlechner, director of Iron Ore Research in Perth, Western Australia, told the BBC that the US and EU had \"dropped the ball\" on recognising the importance of the rare earths over recent decades, as China swiftly developed a monopoly over refinement.",
      "\"China has its foot on the blood vein\u2026 of US and European defence systems,\" he added.",
      "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, this week said that China halting exports of rare earths used in advanced magnets was affecting the company's ability to develop humanoid robots, in an early symbol of the pain Beijing has the power to inflict on US companies.",
      "Could Australia's proposal change the game?",
      "Albanese's proposal says that minerals in the reserve will be available to both \"domestic industry and international partners\", in a likely reference to allies such as the US and EU.",
      "But Kirchlechner, while welcoming the move as \"long overdue\", added that the proposal is \"not going to solve the problem\".",
      "The fundamental issue is that even if Australia stockpiles more critical minerals, the refining process of rare earths will still largely be controlled by China.",
      "Lithium \u2013 not a rare earth, but a crucial metal in the production electric vehicle batteries and solar panels \u2013 is a good example. Australia mines 33% of the world's lithium, but only refines and exports a tiny fraction. China, on the other hand, mines just 23% of the world's lithium, but refines 57% of it, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Australia has been investing in refining rare earths as part of its Future Made in Australia plan, aimed at leveraging the country's critical minerals reserves to drive the green transition.",
      "Arafura Rare Earths, headquartered in Perth, Western Australia, last year received A$840m in funding to create the country's first combined mine and refinery for rare earths. And in November, Australia opened its first rare earths processing plant, also in Western Australia, operated by Lynas Rare Earths.",
      "But the country is expected to depend on China for refining until at least 2026, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, headquartered in Washington.",
      "How will the US and China respond?",
      "China has been trying to seize on the volatility brought by Trump.",
      "In a series of editorials in Australian newspapers, China's ambassador to Canberra lambasted Washington's approach to global trade, and called on Australia to \"join hands\" with Beijing - something that Albanese quickly rejected.",
      "Australia has touted its resource industry in its talks with Trump. Some critical minerals were exempt from a 10% tariff he imposed on imports of most Australian products.",
      "But analysts say Albanese's proposal is mainly aimed at protecting Australia and its partners from strategic adversaries like China.",
      "Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, told the BBC that Albanese's plan was \"more sophisticated\" than previous proposals, because it included the ability to sell Australia's resources at moments of economic tension.",
      "If China imposes export controls, she added, Australia could begin selling more of its mineral reserves to help lower prices on global markets, and loosen the control China has had on setting prices.",
      "But she said that Australia still cannot completely replace China.",
      "\"If [Australia's] goal is to serve the West, become more instrumental to the West \u2013 especially the US \u2013 there are weak spots China can enter \u2013 and the most important is refining.\"",

    "summary": "A Guyanese political commentator says Washington objects to Beijing's \"very strong foothold\" in the country.",
    "story": [
      "The Caribbean nation of Guyana is breathing a sigh of relief after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the introduction of higher tariffs on a number of countries.",
      "Guyana, which is nestled between Venezuela and Suriname on the South American mainland, had been singled out for rates of 38% on many of its exports.",
      "Following Trump's change in policy, it now faces tariffs of only 10% - the same as all countries apart from Canada, China and Mexico.",
      "But why had Guyana been facing a higher levy in the first place?",
      "Guyanese political commentator Francis Bailey says the country is caught in a geopolitical battle between the US and China. Or more specifically - Washington objects to Beijing's \"very strong foothold\" in Guyana.",
      "Recent years have seen billions of dollars of investment in Guyana by Chinese entities, in everything from roads and hospitals, to hotels and shopping centres. And a crucial new bridge linking the capital Georgetown to the western region of Demerara-Mahaica is currently under construction by a Beijing-based company.",
      "For its part, the US continues to be happy to buy Guyana's key exports of crude oil, gold and bauxite, which is the ore from which aluminium is extracted. These were all to be exempt from the planned 38% tariff, which instead would have hit Guyana's fishing and sugar industries.",
      "The US also backs Guyana in its territorial dispute with Venezuela over the vast Essequibo region that forms the western two thirds of Guyana. During a visit to Georgetown in March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Venezuela of \"consequences\" if it were to use force against Guyana.",
      "But the planned high tariff showed Washington's ire, says Mr Bailey. \"I think the reason we had been given such high tariffs is to apply pressure on Guyana.",
      "\"The US is saying, 'if you want our protection you need to chase the Chinese out of your country'. Trump is a very transactional president \u2013 and Guyana is in a very precarious position against its sabre-rattling adversary Venezuela which has been ramping up acts of aggression.\"",
      "The Guyanese government did not respond to requests for comments before this article was initially published. However, it subsequently put out a statement denying that the country's initially high tariff from the US had anything to do with its relationship with China.",
      "It pointed to the website of the US Trade Representative, which it said \"very transparently indicated that the formula for determining the tariff applied to each country is based on the trade balance between the US and the country concerned, and that the formula does not include any variable to capture the relationship of the country concerned with any other country whatsoever\".",
      "The country, once one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere, and a former British colony, has been enjoying a surge in wealth since it first discovered oil in its territorial waters in 2015.",
      "Last year it exported $3.13bn (\u00a32.4bn) of crude oil to the US, according to United Nations figures.",
      "Across the Caribbean all countries now face a 10% tariff on their exports to the US. However, it is the price impact of Trump's global tariffs on what they import from the US that is of most concern.",
      "This is because the Caribbean's love for, and reliance on, US products is immediately apparent when you glance at a High Street or supermarket shelf across the region. In fact, some islands are said to import as much as 70% of their consumer goods from their North American neighbour.",
      "And with American goods that rely on overseas raw materials or components set to go up in price, this will inevitably be passed on to consumers in the Caribbean.",
      "Also, much of what Caribbean nations buy from other countries around the world comes to them via the US.",
      "So with the White House now hitting Chinese goods coming into the US with tariffs of 125%, Chinese items that are then reexported to the Caribbean should see price hikes of a similar amount. And by around 10% for goods from other countries that arrive via the US.",
      "With already ever-increasing shipping costs in the Caribbean, and high local import duties causing exorbitant prices in a region beset by low wages, the impact of Trump's tariffs could be profound and keenly felt.",
      "In Antigua and Barbuda, interior designer Carissa Warner tells the BBC that 70% of her materials are imported from the US, and 20% from China.",
      "\"Some of my projects are on hold while we wait to see what happens,\" she explains. \"I am extremely worried from a business aspect but also just as a local consumer.",
      "\"I'm so worried about the cost of food I have been looking online for pots to start growing fresh produce. I don't think people realise the impact it will have on us.\"",
      "Ms Warner believes one way Caribbean governments could ease the squeeze on their people is by lowering their own import duties, which are partially calculated using a percentage of an item's cost.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's Prime Minister Gaston Browne has dubbed global tariffs \"extremely worrisome\" and is urging citizens to \"buy smarter and buy local\".",
      "Trump's tariffs come as the Caribbean is already grappling with a confluence of harsh economic conditions from the cost of cleaning up after frequent natural disasters like hurricanes, to the aftereffects of the Covid pandemic.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's ambassador to the US, Sir Ronald Sanders, says that the US has long enjoyed a trade surplus with most Caribbean countries.",
      "\"For decades, we have helped sustain American prosperity by collectively importing far more from the United States than we export,\" he says.",
      "\"The problem we have created for ourselves is that we have been dependent on the US market for such a long time and have not sought to diversify into other markets.\"",
      "As for the 10% tariff on Caribbean exports to the US, Sir Ronald says: \"Any loss is not a good thing for our small economies, but the 10% that we face is not going to disrupt our goods from going to the US market.\"",
      "The Caribbean islands' small market sizes, high labour costs and remoteness from principle markets has kept their manufacturing sectors relatively modest. Their exports include many niche products like specialist rums and indigenous foods such as ackee, a fruit from Jamaica.",
      "\"These kinds of products are all orientated to a certain kind of market and will not face any competition because the US does not produce them, and the countries that do face their own tariffs,\" Sir Ronald continues.",
      "Exacerbating worries in the Caribbean are potential additional taxes on Chinese-built ships entering US ports of up to $1.5m per docking. This idea was mooted by the White House in February.",
      "Many fear that will aggravate freight costs in the Caribbean, and lead to further hikes in the price of everyday goods, given the large volume of items sold in the region that are manufactured in China.",
      "Sir Ronald adds that tacking the problem of an overreliance on the US \"can only come from diversifying the market, but that's not an overnight achievement\".",
      "He adds: \"It's not as easy to set up new markets as people think. It's not governments who control trade; it's the private sector. And much of what we buy will still come via the US.\"",
      "Many Caribbean leaders feel the best strategy to thwart the fallout from tariffs is to negotiate as a bloc.",
      "Mia Mottley, chair of the intergovernmental group Caricom, said the region was facing the most challenging of times since its 15 member states gained independence several decades ago.",
      "\"We are working and will continue to work to become more self-sufficient, but\u2026 this trade war will mean higher prices for all of us,\" she said in a recent statement.",
      "Ms Mottley added that it was vital to redouble efforts to \"invest in Caribbean agricultural production and light manufacturing\".",
      "\"We must build our ties with Africa, Central and Latin America, and renew those ties with some of our older partners around the world, in the United Kingdom and Europe, and in Canada. We must not rely solely on one or two markets.\"",

      "The sister of a head teacher who took her own life after her school was downgraded in an Ofsted inspection, has warned the proposed new system for assessing schools has the \"same risks\" as before.",
      "Ruth Perry's sister, Julia Waters, joined education professionals in an open letter to Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson in asking for delays to the plans which she said are \"rushed\" and \"fail to learn\" from Ms Perry's death.",
      "Ofsted has proposed a new system which involves report cards and is due to come in this autumn, rather than the old one or two-word judgements.",
      "The Department for Education (DfE) said reforms played a \"central\" role in work to raise school standards.",
      "Ms Perry took her own life after her school, Caversham Primary in Berkshire, was downgraded from \"outstanding\" to \"inadequate\".",
      "An inquest into her death heard how she felt \"powerless\" and believed her career could be over after the inspection in November 2022.",
      "The proposed new system of Ofsted inspections will no longer give a single overall grade to an institution.",
      "Speaking on Today on BBC Radio 4, Prof Waters said there was \"no evidence the new system will work\".",
      "\"The proposal that's coming out, in this new report card, just fundamentally fails to address the key concern which is the very real and present risk of more terrible and preventable deaths like my sister's.",
      "\"My very real fear is the introduction of this report card will introduce more areas of inspection, more judgements and really poorly defined criteria,\" she added.",
      "The open letter signed by school leaders, national organisations and former inspectors warned against \"excessive pressure, ill-health and stress for the profession\".",
      "\"In particular, we believe the proposed new report cards and the new grading system fail to address the recommendations of the coroner following the tragic, preventable death of Ruth Perry.",
      "Ed Barnett-Ward, a parent at Caversham Primary who campaigned for changes to Ofsted inspections following Ms Perry's death, said the proposed changes \"don't go far enough\".",
      "He said: \"Our argument was never simply about the removal of single word judgements which we have managed to achieve.",
      "\"We need to have a system that gets rid of excessive pressure, inconsistency and we need to get a fair independent complaint process,\" he added.",
      "National Education Union general secretary Daniel Kebede said Ofsted needed to \"come up with a system of accountability that reduced pressure on schools\".",
      "\"But the reality is it's turned into a big ignore and we are facing a big disaster,\" he said.",
      "The DfE said it wanted to make inspections \"more powerful\" and \"more transparent\".",
      "\"The system this Government inherited was high stakes for teachers but low information for parents, which is why we're removing single-word judgments and introducing school report cards\".",
      "It said answers to Ofsted's and the department's consultations would be carefully considered before an approach is finalised.",

    "story": [
      "Planned changes to school uniform policy will affect over four million pupils across England, according to new estimates from the Department for Education (DfE).",
      "The government says seven in 10 secondary schools and 35% of primary schools in England will have to reduce the number of compulsory branded items to three, plus a branded tie for secondary students.",
      "The new rule is part of the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which still has several parliamentary stages to go through before becoming a law.",
      "The government says families will save money, but school wear manufacturers warn the plans could end up costing them more.",
      "The average cost of a full school uniform and PE kit for a child at secondary school is \u00a3442, and is \u00a3343 for a primary school pupil, according to the latest DfE data.",
      "Existing statutory guidance, introduced by the previous government, requires schools to consider the cost of their uniform so that it is not a deciding factor for parents when choosing schools.",
      "The current government wants to go further, by limiting the number of items unique to a school that have to be bought from designated suppliers.",
      "The government claims parents will save around \u00a350 per child through the school uniform measures, which it hopes to introduce in September 2026.",
      "But uniform retailers warn that the planned changes might increase costs for families. The Schoolwear Association says the plans could mean parents spend more on replacing lower-quality generic garments which might not last as long as branded items.",
      "They say branded uniforms also play a role in reducing inequality in schools and improving behaviour.",
      "Many parents rely on uniform exchanges to afford the full list of items required by their children's schools.",
      "At Darlington Borough Council's exchange, located on the ground floor of a multi-storey car park, all the uniforms have been donated and are free to local parents, who are able to stock up on branded items from over 25 schools in the area.",
      "The exchange has been running for five years and has given out approximately 12,000 items to 4,000 customers.",
      "Volunteer Kay says she is worried some school uniform policies will still be too strict even after the government's planned limit on logos comes into force.",
      "\"Some of the schools are particular about a certain skirt, a certain style from a certain supplier - so that can cause problems and be quite expensive for parents,\" she says.",
      "But she says it is a good thing that more parents will be able to buy more of their uniforms from other retailers, like supermarkets.",
      "In Darlington town centre, one mum with two sons at primary school and a daughter in secondary said she was worried about the jump in uniform costs coming when her sons join secondary school.",
      "\"It's just a nightmare,\" she said.",
      "\"My daughter's school is really strict on the uniform. You can't get black trousers, it's got to be grey, or pleated skirts. For their shoes alone I'm looking at \u00a360 a year, and there's three of them. That's not including blazers, PE kits or anything else.",

      "The school may cut back further if limits to branded items are brought in.",
      "The school is in an area of Halifax with high deprivation, and has a uniform bank as well as a laundrette to wash pupils' uniforms.",

      "\"There are so many different factors that children have to face in order to have clean and correct uniform that is used daily,\" he says.",

    "story": [
      "The government has ruled out any extra cash for pay rises after review bodies recommended new deals for teachers and NHS staff above the amount budgeted for by ministers, Downing Street has said.",
      "The pay review body for teachers in England has recommended a pay rise of about 4% this year, while its NHS equivalent has recommended about 3%, according to figures first reported by The Times.",

      "The government could reject the pay recommendations and stick to 2.8%.",
      "But it is more likely that ministers say the higher pay will have to be funded by existing budgets and efficiency savings.",
      "That would set ministers on a collision course with trade unions and - government insiders privately concede - make a new wave of strikes possible.",

      "National Education Union general secretary Daniel Kebede said: \"They need to ensure the pay award is above inflation, that it takes steps to address the crisis in recruitment and retention, but most of all that it is fully funded.\"",
      "The British Medical Association (BMA) has previously said the government's approach \"indicates a poor grasp of the unresolved issues from two years of industrial action\".",
      "Health Minster Stephen Kinnock told Sky News: \"We are all about putting more money into the pockets of working people, but we do also have to ensure that we are balancing the books, and we have got to work in terms of public sector pay within fiscal constraints.",
      "\"We will give these recommendations careful consideration.",
      "\"But I would, of course, also urge our colleagues in the trade union movement to engage constructively with us and recognise the reality of the financial position.\"",
      "Director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies Paul Johnson said the government will face \"tough\" trade-offs when considering how to award pay.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set \"very, very tight budgets\" so any pay increase risks the government being \"forced into tax rises or other spending cuts\", Johnson said.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Johnson said: \"If you're increasing pay then you can't do other things.",
      "\"You can't employ more teachers or open breakfast clubs or have more doctors and nurses.\"",
      "Public anger over pay, squeezed public services and potential strikes could play a major role in local elections this week - the government's first major test since last year's landslide general election victory.",
      "Sir Keir is spending Monday touring hospitals promoting reforms to the NHS app - which he said will haul the health service out of the \"dark ages\", saving it money and cutting waiting lists.",
      "The salaries of NHS staff, as well as other public-sector workers such as police officers, teachers and the members of the armed forces, are recommended by eight pay review bodies (PRBs).",
      "They cover 2.5 million workers - about 45% of public-sector staff - and a pay bill of around \u00a3100bn.",
      "The PRBs are made up of economists and experts on human resources, with experience in both the public and private sector and are appointed by the relevant government department.",

    "story": [
      "Author Philip Pullman has revealed details of the sixth and final book in his series about Lyra Silvertongue, the character at the heart of His Dark Materials and The Book of Dust trilogies.",
      "The Rose Field will be published on 23 October, and will follow his heroine's story up to her early 20s.",
      "She was 11 when she was introduced in the best-selling and award-winning first His Dark Materials book, Northern Lights, in 1995.",
      "Pullman, 78, said he was \"relieved\" to have \"come out of the end alive and able to see it being made into a book and published\".",
      "The Rose Field refers to a magnetic or gravitational field, and was mentioned in the opening chapters of Northern Lights, when scholars at Lyra's Oxford college secretly discussed a mysterious phenomenon called Dust.",
      "\"In this final book, Lyra is on the verge of discovering what Dust is and what it means, and the story is about how that happens,\" the author told BBC Radio 4's The World At One.",
      "The story also deals with the nature of imagination, the former Oxford English teacher said. \"I've got a view of what the imagination is, and Lyra discovers what she thinks the imagination is, so we're talking about that as well.\"",
      "The Book of Dust",
      "Beyond the world of Dust and daemons, this book has been influenced by real-life global events, including the rise of tech billionaires, Pullman revealed.",
      "\"It has become clear to me in the last 10 years that the influence of money and the power of the billionaire class, the power of the tech industry and all those extractive things like oil and gas and so on, have a much deeper effect on the world than I had thought,\" he said.",
      "\"And in thinking about that, and seeing the way the story's gone, and seeing what Lyra has to face and endure and decide about, I've thought about it more deeply myself.",
      "\"The world has changed enormously. We're either at the end of a long period of American power, which will end, presumably, like the end of any empire, in chaos, destructiveness, and then the gradual coming together of nations in a new form. That'll be interesting to watch, if I'm still alive to watch it.",
      "\"But we're also at a time when we can look back, with the resources of the internet and so on... We're at an age where we've got the wisdom of centuries and millennia to draw on. It'll be interesting to see if we do or we don't. I suspect that most of us won't, but some of us might.\"",
      "The Rose Field comes six years after the publication of the previous book in The Book of Dust series.",
      "The trilogy's first two books have sold 49 million copies around the world, publisher Midas said.",
      "Pullman said he would now turn his attention to planning a memoir, which would be titled Before I Forget.",
      "\"I've been talking for quite a while about writing a memoir before I forget everything, and that's something that's possibly on the horizon,\" he said.",
      "\"I was born in 1946 I was brought up as a child of the British Empire, which still existed then. And I've seen a very great number of changes, as everyone of my age has.",
      "\"There's nothing remarkable about that, but I've seen a lot of things that I loved, enjoyed, made me happy, made me excited in various ways. And I'd like to remember those and write them down, because I think it's a shame if they're not celebrated and remembered.\"",

      "\"I mean, what the... hell was all that about?\" Allen said. \"I mean, in all seriousness, what? Why? For why?",

      "She added: \"And the fact that they've, like, made it like some sort of feminist thing...\"",

      "But Perry bore the brunt of the ridicule after it emerged she sang Louis Armstrong's What a Wonderful World, and held up the setlist for her new tour to an in-flight camera.",
      "Fast food chain Wendy's posted on social media, \"Can we send her back\", before adding several days later that they had \"a ton of respect for Katy Perry and her out-of-this-world-talent\".",
      "Model Emily Ratajkowski was among the other critics of the flight, saying she was \"disgusted\", and took aim at Bezos in a follow-up video arguing that taking \"his fianc\u00e9e and a few other famous women to space for space tourism is not progress\".",
      "US actress Olivia Munn described the flight as \"gluttonous\", explaining: \"It's so much money to go to space, and there's a lot of people who can't even afford eggs. What's the point? Is it historic that you guys are going on a ride?\"",
      "But King hit back, saying she was \"very disappointed and very saddened\" by the backlash. \"Have you been?\" she asked the haters. \"If you've been and you still feel that way after you come back, please let's have a conversation.\"",

      "His band was formed in 1981 in Rhyl, Denbighshire, out of the punk era and had a top 20 hit, Sixty Eight Guns, two years later.",
      "It typified an anthemic style of song but their unpretentious and down-to-earth approach earned loyal followings on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "Peters lived with blood cancer for 30 years, following his diagnosis of lymphoma in 1995, and later having chronic lymphocytic leukaemia twice.",

      "They would go on to sell an estimated five million records and also become the first Welsh musicians since Tom Jones and Bonnie Tyler to crack America.",
      "Thanks to a support slot with U2 on their 1983 US tour, The Alarm gained a transatlantic following - not an inconsiderable achievement.",
      "Their debut album Declaration was released in 1984. As well as Sixty Eight Guns, it also included another favourite, Blaze of Glory.",
      "The band had honed their live performances by extensive touring, and were also reliable \"go-to\" support choice for big names - which included Bob Dylan, Queen and U2 again - including an appreciative crowd at Cardiff's National Stadium in 1987.",

      "Speaking on Radio Ulster's Talkback programme on Tuesday, Mr Cox said: \"It's fine to say that you're sorry for it, but the way that they have actually spoken about it is to suggest that it's a conspiracy, that they have been targeted unfairly and for me that then doesn't come across as unfortunately particularly genuine.\"",
      "In their statement, Kneecap said they rejected \"any suggestion that we would seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. Ever\".",

      "Mr Cox added: \"It wasn't a throwaway remark. It was part of a conversation that they were having about politics, and it was a very clear incitement to violence.",
      "\"I doubt that they really wanted someone to go out and kill a Tory MP, but if you say those words\u2026 then the risk of someone acting on those words is there.\"",

      "That 2013 Respect at Work review looked into BBC culture in light of Jimmy Savile's depravity. It found bullying was an issue inside the corporation, with some people viewed as \"untouchable\" because of their status and colleagues too scared to speak up, for fear of reprisals.",
      "The then director general, Tony Hall, said he wanted \"zero tolerance of bullying\". The BBC brought in a series of measures, including updating its policies and setting up a confidential helpline.",
      "'We have your backs'",
      "On Monday, the current director general, Tim Davie, said he was \"totally committed to make long-lasting change.\"",
      "He said staff must feel confident to speak up and they will be supported (unless their complaints are malicious) without any negative impact on their careers.",
      "\"We have your backs,\" he said. He announced a series of measures including a new code of conduct, a more robust disciplinary policy and leadership training.",
      "All organisations have bad apples, but the power dynamics in a media company are multi-layered. Well-known presenters, for example, can wield extraordinary influence, as well as behind-the-scenes editors and managers.",
      "Then there is the issue of an industry that often relies on freelancers, who have even less power. 30% of freelancers told the report they had seen inappropriate behaviour at the BBC. Less than half said they would feel safe speaking up. That is sobering.",
      "Equally, in BBC news and current affairs, only 48% of staff who answered a recent survey said they thought the corporation dealt with bullying and harassment concerns appropriately.",
      "This is all about power imbalances. Will BBC employees ever feel confident that the organisation really will have their backs if they decide to complain?",
      "My sense is that the biggest consideration when deciding whether to make a formal complaint is the fact that the person you are complaining about will be told you have done so. If that person is your boss, or a close colleague, how can you be sure that it won't have an impact on your career?",
      "But equally, if you don't take formal action, then there is a perception that offenders consistently get away with bad behaviour. There are rumours and stories about particular individuals inside the BBC, just as there are in all organisations.",
      "The proof, perhaps, of whether these new policies are working will be whether the small number of people whose names are often raised internally, accused informally of bad behaviour, will now face more scrutiny; whether colleagues will feel confident to raise a formal complaint.",
      "The report makes clear the majority of people enjoy working at the BBC and that there isn't a toxic culture. But it also talks of some names repeated several times as people who are \"not being held to account for poor behaviour\".",
      "Who are those people and is any action being taken in light of this review?",
      "The report doesn't name names, either complainants or those accused.",
      "A BBC source told me the corporation will always act if necessary on any information it becomes aware of.",
      "But in pockets of the BBC there is real anger that bullying by individuals is an open secret - and there's a belief that complainants aren't protected. Shah and Davie are promising that will change.",
      "It takes time to change cultures. While some behaviour is always unacceptable - sexual harassment or physical assault for example - the report also talks about grey areas, including colleagues being tetchy or rude, ridiculing ideas or using aggressive language. The plan is to nip these in the bud.",
      "Sometimes this kind of behaviour has been blamed on working in a high pressure environment, for example a newsroom, where short-term emotions can run high. It's not an excuse, Davie said.",
      "The report was commissioned because of the BBC's newsroom's most high-profile star, Huw Edwards. But his name was never mentioned over its 60 pages.",
      "Perhaps the evidence of real culture change will be if this is the last report the BBC ever does about workplace culture."

      "This is \"owing to a combination of their complex modern materials, lack of a traditional coating layer, and intensity of flat colour fields, which make even the smallest areas of damage instantly perceptible,\" she said.",

      "She said that when an artwork is damaged, a gallery's insurer will appoint a specialist fine art loss adjuster to visit the museum.",
      "The loss adjustor typically \"reviews the damage to the artwork, examines any CCTV footage to determine the exact cause of the loss, and assesses conservation options\", Ms Myrtle said.",
      "The museum did not comment on who will be held liable for the damage to the 1960 painting, which the gallery reportedly bought in the 1970s.",

    "story": [
      "Original Coronation Street star Philip Lowrie has died aged 88.",
      "Lowrie, who appeared in the first episode of the ITV soap in 1960 as the original bad boy Dennis Tanner, died on Friday, his publicist Mario Renzullo said.",
      "\"My client and very dear friend, Philip Lowrie, the beloved actor renowned for his role as Dennis Tanner on Coronation Street, passed away yesterday,\" he said.",
      "\"His death marks the end of an era for the world's longest-running soap, where he became a cornerstone of its storytelling.\"",
      "Lowrie was born in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester.",
      "When the soap started more than six decades ago, Lowrie's character was seen as a national heartthrob thanks to his roguish role.",
      "Dennis was introduced as the son of Elsie Tanner, and moved in with his mother after being released from prison.",
      "Lowrie had originally auditioned for the role of Ken Barlow prior to the show's launch, and appeared in the first episode at the age of 24.",
      "William Roache was soon cast as Ken for the beginning of the soap and became a regular sparring partner for Dennis.",
      "He left the Street in 1968, when he married Jenny Sutton and moved to Bristol, and did not return until 2011.",
      "Corrie reappearance",
      "According to Mr Renzullo, Lowrie was presented in September 2011 with a certificate by the Guinness World Records for being the person with the longest gap between television appearances as the same character in the same show.",
      "Dennis soon got back in touch with newsagent Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox), who was his sweetheart when she first appeared in the show in 1966, and they tied the knot when he came back.",
      "He left the soap again in 2014 and was later killed off without making another appearance on screen.",
      "Varied career",
      "Lowrie's mother saved for his fees to go to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) in London after he left school.",
      "After graduating three years later, he soon received his first parts in the West End, appearing with Dame Margaret Rutherford and Peggy Mount in the play Farewell, Farewell, Eugene.",
      "He also appeared on Victoria Wood's comedy shows, such as Victoria Wood's All Day Breakfast, Victoria Wood, Pat and Margaret, Live In Your Own Room, and We'd Quite Like To Apologise.",

    "published": "Sun, 27 Apr 2025 19:26:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Suspects who are accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at gunpoint in October 2016 stand trial in Paris.",
    "story": [
      "The morning after the heist, burglar Yunice Abbas went home to catch up on some sleep.",
      "When he woke up, his wife was glued to the TV. The headline news of the day was that American reality TV star Kim Kardashian, then 35, had been tied up and robbed at gunpoint in a luxury Paris apartment.",
      "All her jewellery - worth about $10m (\u00a37.5m), and including the engagement ring her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m (\u00a33m) - had been taken.",
      "Yunice Abbas' wife glared at him. \"This has you written all over it,\" she grumbled.",
      "She was right. The 62-year-old had dabbled in crime his whole life, from petty offences to bank heists.",
      "The Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement.",
      "But a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017 - three months after the robbery - Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested.",
      "Ten of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks.",
      "Out of those, five are accused of taking part in the heist, and six are accused of being accessories to the crime.",
      "Most of them were born in the 1950s, leading French media to dub them the \"grandpa robbers\".",
      "Abbas and a 68-year-old man, Aomar Ait Khedache, have confessed; the others have not.",
      "One has since passed away, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he is suffering from advanced dementia.",
      "By the time the trial starts, almost nine years will have gone by since the heist.",
      "Gun wielding robbers fled on bikes and on foot",
      "On the night between 2 and 3 October 2016, Abbas and four accomplices allegedly staked out Kardashian's discreet suite in Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s, in the glitzy Madeleine neighbourhood in Paris, not far from the Op\u00e9ra and Place Vendome.",
      "At around 03:00 local time, they burst into the hotel's entrance hall, dressed as policemen and wielding a gun.",
      "They threatened and handcuffed Abderrahmane Ouatiki, an Algerian PhD student who regularly took up shifts as night receptionist, and marched him up to Kardashian's room.",
      "She was resting on her bed, tired from days of attending Paris Fashion Week events, when she heard stomping up the stairs.",
      "She called out for her sister Kourtney and her stylist Stephanie, but when they didn't answer she panicked.",
      "\"I knew someone was there to get me,\" she recalled in an interview with US interviewer David Letterman years later. \"You just feel it.\"",
      "Kim dialled 911 but the number, of course, didn't work outside of the US. As she was calling her then-security guard Pascal Duvier - who had accompanied her sister to a club - the men burst in, pushed her on the bed and started shouting.",
      "\"They kept on saying: the ring, the ring! And I was so startled that it didn't compute for a minute,\" she told Letterman.",
      "The language barrier meant Ouatiki had to act as an interpreter.",
      "They found the ring and stuffed it in a bag along with several other jewels, as well as \u20ac1000 in cash. One of the men grabbed her and pulled her towards him.",
      "Because she was wearing a robe with nothing underneath, she thought he was going to assault her, Kim later told Letterman, wiping tears away.",
      "But instead \u2013 using the technique of saucissonnage, or the practice of tying victims up like a saucisson, a salami - the man bound her with zip ties and duct tape, and left her in the bathroom.",
      "Then, he and the rest of the burglars fled on bikes and on foot. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up.",
      "Traumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn.",
      "It wasn't until later that day, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was.",
      "\"There were breaking news alerts saying Kim Kardashian had been robbed at gunpoint \u2013 that's how important it was,\" says LA-based entertainment journalist KJ Matthews.",
      "Blunders meant heist was doomed from the start",
      "\"We were so fascinated with her and her family and their rise to fame... When the heist happened we were so surprised. How could burglars have gotten so close to her?\" Matthews says.",
      "But while mistakes were made in terms of Kardashian's security, serious errors were made on the burglars' side, too.",
      "\"They didn't take into account the progress made by police techniques, which can now find micro traces of DNA anywhere,\" said Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and the author of \"Kim and the Grandpa Robbers\" - a thorough account of the heist and of the lives of its perpetrators.",
      "\"When they dressed up as police they thought 'that's it, nobody will be able to recognise us',\" she adds.",
      "But in 2016 Paris was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of the previous year, and there were a huge number of CCTV cameras all round the city, meaning police were able to spot the thieves and see them make off with the jewels.",
      "Other details of this story suggest that the thieves' planning was rather haphazard. When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels.",
      "The next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from.",
      "Police arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as \"Omar the Old\".",
      "French media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian caf\u00e9 that winter, just before their arrest.",
      "The question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian's schedule.",
      "Court documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements.",
      "But how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard?",
      "The documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael's firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim's whereabouts.",
      "Mr Madar was arrested in January 2017. His lawyer Arthur Vercken vehemently pushed back against the accusations, telling the BBC that \"since the start the case was built on assumptions, theses, theories - but no proof [of Madar's involvement] was ever found\".",
      "He added that although the Madar brothers exchanged texts about the Kardashians during Fashion Week it was just because they were \"bored\" and that when the heist took place Gary was asleep.",
      "Gary's brother, Michael, is not a defendant.",
      "\"Five men did this. You don't think one of them was keeping an eye on who was coming and going from her hotel?\" he said, suggesting that Mr Madar had only been arrested \"to prove that the French justice system works\".",
      "The trial will also attempt to determine where the jewels ended up.",
      "Police tracking of the gang's phones showed that soon after the heist Omar the Old travelled from Paris to Antwerp in Belgium, where 50% of the world's polished diamonds and 80% of rough diamonds are sold, according to the Diamond Investment Office.",
      "Many jewels were reportedly melted or broken up and sold. Abbas got \u20ac75,000 (\u00a364,000); others far less.",
      "As for Kim's engagement ring, Omar the Old said the gang was too scared to sell it on as it would be too easily traceable. It has never been found.",
      "Kim was undoubtedly spooked by the event, which marked the start of her social media hiatus.",
      "In an episode of the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she tearfully recalled the night of the heist and said had been scared for her life; later she also said the robbery had made her a \"less materialistic person\".",
      "Soon after the incident her sister Khloe told The Ellen DeGeneres Show that, for safety reasons, the Kardashian family were making some changes to how freely they posted on social media.",
      "\"The biggest change was her security detail,\" KJ Matthews told the BBC.",
      "'They're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is'",
      "Patricia Tourancheau, the author of the book about the heist, said she was \"fascinated\" by the \"clash between these old-style burglars from the Parisian banlieue and this global social media star\".",
      "\"They fled on bikes and she flies around on private jets,\" she laughed.",
      "\"These are a group of elderly down-and-out thieves, they're always broke, they're forever involved in convoluted plans\u2026 and they're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is.\"",
      "The gang was not \"elite\" as it was suggested in the early days, she added.",
      "\"This isn't the creme de la creme of French banditry. They're a bit of a bunch of losers, really. They're the same kind of people who in the 60s and 70s would burglar banks or post offices and who then rebranded to drug trafficking and then moved on to jewels because it was easier,\" she said.",
      "Around mid-May, Kim will face the suspects for the first time in years when she takes the stand as a witness.",
      "Cameras are not allowed in French courts but her arrival to the tribunal on Ile de la Cit\u00e9 alone will inevitably spark the same media frenzy that has accompanied her for over a decade.",
      "In his memoir, Abbas expressed the hope the victim's status and the global resonance of the case would not influence judges unduly.",
      "However, he also said that on the last day of the trial he would bring a duffle bag with his belongings, ready to be sent to jail.",
      "\"The problem with the past,\" he wrote, \"is that it sticks with you as long as you live\".",

      "\"No, you saved your own life,\" he replies, quietly. \"Maybe the music was the soundtrack, but you saved your own life, OK?\"",

      "\"I didn't think people would see that, except me and her,\" he says, \"but it was such a moment for me.\"",
      "The interaction crystallised something he'd felt for a while.",
      "\"I always said that Bowie and My Chemical Romance saved my life, but ultimately you have to find yourself,\" he says.",

      "\"That's what I was trying to tell that girl in Amsterdam.\"",
      "Self-assurance is a lesson he learned the hard way.",
      "On the surface, Yungblud, aka 27-year-old Dominic Harrison, had it all. Two number one albums, an international fanbase, a Louis Theroux documentary and enough clout to run his own festival.",
      "But if you looked more closely, there were chinks in the armour. Those number one albums both fell out of the Top 30 after one week, a sign of a strong core fanbase, with limited crossover appeal.",
      "And the first year of his Bludfest in Milton Keynes was criticised after long queues and a lack of water caused fans to pass out and miss the concert.",
      "Harrison was keenly aware of it all. As he released his self-titled third album in 2022, he hit a low.",
      "\"Yungblud was number one in seven countries, and I wasn't happy because it wasn't the album I wanted to make,\" he says.",
      "\"It was a good album, but it wasn't exceptional.\"",
      "The problem, he says, was a record label who'd pushed him in a more commercial direction. But in polishing his sound, he lost the angry unpredictability that characterised his best work.",
      "\"It's funny, my-self titled album was actually the one where I was most lost,\" he observes.",
      "\"I felt like I compromised but, because of that, I was never taking no for an answer again.\"",
      "Nowhere is that clearer than on his comeback single, Hello Heaven, Hello.",
      "Over nine minutes and six seconds it achieves Caligulan levels of excess, full of scorching guitar solos, throat-shredding vocal runs, and even an orchestral coda.",
      "\"Do you still remember, or have you forgotten where you're from?\" Harrison asks himself, as he re-ignites his ambition.",
      "The song's purposefully unsuited to radio \u2013 unlike the follow-up single, Lovesick Lullaby. Released today, it's a free-associating rampage through a messy night out, that ends with epiphany in a drug dealer's apartment.",
      "Combining Liam Gallagher's sneer with Beach Boys' harmonies, it's uniquely Yungblud. But the singer reveals it was originally written for his last album.",
      "\"We were actually discouraged from doing it,\" he says.",
      "\"My advisor at the time, a guy called Nick Groff [vice president of A&R at Interscope, responsible for signing Billie Eilish], was like, 'I don't get it'.\"",
      "Warming to the theme, he continues: \"The music industry is crap because it's all about money but, as an artist, I need to make sure that anything I put out is exciting and unlimited.",
      "\"It can't be like a 50% version of me.\"",
      "To achieve that, he shunned expensive recording studios and made his new album in a converted Tetley brewery in Leeds.",
      "Professional songwriters were banished, too, in favour of a close group of collaborators, including guitarist Adam Warrington, and Matt Schwartz, the Israeli-British producer who helmed his 2018 debut.",
      "\"When you make an album in LA or London, everything is great, even if it's mediocre, because people want a hit out of it,\" he argues.",
      "\"When you make an album with family, all they want is the truth.\"",
      "'Sexiness and liberation'",
      "One of the most honest tracks on the record is Zombie, a lighters-aloft ballad (think Coldplay, sung by Bruce Springsteen) about \"feeling you're ugly, and learning to battle that\".",
      "\"I always was insecure about my body, and that got highlighted as I got famous,\" says the singer, who last year revealed he'd developed an eating disorder due to body dysmorphia.",
      "\"But I realised, the biggest power you can give someone over you is in how you react. So I decided, I'm going to get sober, I'm going to get fit, and I discovered boxing.\"",
      "He ended up working with the South African boxer Chris Heerden - who was recently in the news after Russia jailed his ballerina girlfriend, Ksenia Karelina.",
      "\"I met him before all that,\" says Harrison, \"but he's been extremely inspirational. Boxing's become like therapy for me.",
      "\"If someone says something bad about me, I go to the gym, hit the punch bag for an hour and talk it out.\"",
      "Fans have noticed the change\u2026 drooling over photos of his newly chiseled torso, and declaring 2025 his \"shirt-off era\".",

      "\"When Chase and Status had played [there] a day before, there were 5,000 people when the doors opened, and another 30,000 trickled in during the day.",
      "\"With my fans, there were 20,000 kids at the gate at 10am. So we've learned a lot for this year. There'll be pallets of water outside. It'll be very different.\"",
      "Dedication to his fans is what makes Yungblud Yungblud.",

    "story": [
      "McFly star Tom Fletcher has said he felt \"overwhelming excitement\" working on the new Paddington stage musical, which producers have confirmed will open in November.",
      "The singer-songwriter said he hoped the music and lyrics he has written for the show would \"do Paddington proud\", adding that the musical numbers are \"my favourite songs I've ever written\".",
      "The show will open at the Savoy Theatre in the West End on 1 November, and follow Paddington as he arrives from Peru seeking a new home in London.",
      "The musical, which has been in development for five years, is based on Michael Bond's original novels and follows the hugely successful recent film series.",
      "Speaking about the show for the first time, Fletcher told BBC News he felt \"so honoured and lucky\" to be working on the project, which he said would reflect \"all of the fun, warmth and heart that the books and movies have captured so brilliantly\".",
      "\"There is something so magical about seeing Paddington step out on to the stage, and seeing him... I was about to say in the flesh, but I guess in the fur is more accurate,\" he joked.",
      "Fletcher is best-known as the founding member of pop band McFly, whose hits include All About You, Obviously and Star Girl, and is also a successful children's author.",
      "He was first approached about Paddington around the time of the first Covid lockdown in early 2020, and workshopped the project with scriptwriter Jessica Swale, director Luke Sheppard and the producers before the show was formally announced in 2023.",
      "With the musical now almost ready to launch, Swale told BBC News it would feature \"lots of juicy new material\".",
      "\"We're bringing a lot of new flavours to the table, but of course we're all in love with the original material, so we've been faithful to our cast of characters,\" she said.",
      "\"Of course the Browns are part of it, and familiar faces like Mr Gruber and Mr Curry, but there are a lot of new people as well. We've been very inspired by the books and the films but we like to think we're covering new territory.\"",
      "Bond's first book in the series, A Bear Called Paddington, was published in 1958.",
      "The author went on to write 29 Paddington books in total, the final one being Paddington at St Paul's, which was published posthumously in 2018. The stories have sold more than 35 million copies worldwide.",
      "Fletcher said he relished the opportunity to find what \"the musical language\" of Paddington was. \"Having something that everybody knows but no-one's heard what it sounds like yet is a really exciting thing to be able to work on,\" he explained.",
      "He recalled that, when producer Eliza Lumley first called him about the project, he not only immediately replied with \"a very fast 'yes please'\", but began writing music for the show right away.",
      "\"While I was still on the phone to her, I had the idea for a song, so I went and wrote my first song for it that night, instantly after getting off the phone, and that song is still in the musical now.\"",
      "He reflected: \"My instant reaction wasn't to be intimidated, it was to be excited and just so inspired by these stories and films that I already knew, I just jumped straight at my piano and started writing.\"",
      "The three film adaptations of Paddington, featuring the voice of Ben Whishaw, have been a huge success at the box office since the first was released in 2014.",
      "In recent years, London has seen pop group Abba represented by virtual avatars on stage, while some animated film characters have been depicted using more traditional puppeteering methods, such as snowman Olaf in the stage adaptation of Frozen.",
      "It has not yet been revealed what approach producers will take to representing Paddington in the theatre.",
      "\"I don't know what you're talking about, he's a bear!\" joked Swale. \"He's travelling from Peru to be a special part of our show!\"",
      "She continued: \"I can't give away our secrets. One of the things I'm most excited about for this show is the character of Paddington.\"",
      "'The politics of Paddington'",
      "Swale credits producers Lumley and Sonia Friedman for \"really experimenting with every possible way that we could tell the bear's story in the best way, and the magic that they've found in how they do it\u201d, adding: \u201cEvery single time I see Paddington for the first time, it makes me cry.",
      "\"I think he's completely magic, and to me he's very real. But I don't think audiences will be disappointed. It's a wonderful, theatrical version of how to tell this story.\"",
      "As for the character himself, Swale noted the musical \"also reveals the spirit and the politics of Paddington\".",
      "\"For example, Paddington is a refugee, so we want to honour the fact that he is somebody who migrates to the UK and doesn't have a home, and make sure we are conscious of the experience of who he represents.\"",
      "Between now and the show's opening in November, Fletcher said the team would be \"fine-tuning for as long as we can, and making sure that we get it absolutely right\".",
      "He added: \"I really hope that I've done everyone who loves Paddington justice... This is so different to anything I've ever done before. I feel like this show is so ready to be out in the world, it's the most special thing I've ever been a part of in my whole life.\"",
      "The 39-year-old will be on tour with McFly and Busted when the musical opens in November, \"so I'll be going from touring with the band and then rushing back to London to fit it all in\", he explained.",
      "\"It's a slightly hectic schedule, but we'll make it work somehow. I might get confused and start singing Paddington songs on stage with McFly.\"",
      "Most important, of course, is the question of whether or not Paddington's favourite food will feature in the stage adaptation.",
      "\"You can rest easy,\" laughed Swale. \"Marmalade features not only in the book and the lyrics, but physically on stage in a spectacular way.\"",

      "The Society of Radiographers (SoR) has called for a change in policy due to \"critical\" staff shortages among radiographers who specialise in this area.",
      "Sally Reed, 67, who had two mastectomies after mammograms revealed breast cancer, told the BBC that \"if something can save your life you should go for it\" - whether it's administered by a woman or man.",

      "Breast X-rays, which look for cancers that are too small to see or feel, are only permitted to be undertaken by female health workers. Mammography is the only health examination carried out exclusively by female staff.",
      "According to radiographers, the vacancy rate among mammographers who specialise in breast exams is 17.5%.",
      "Among mammographers who assess women who have found a lump in their breast or have a family history of breast cancer, the figure is 20%.",
      "It takes three to four years to qualify as a radiographer through a university degree.",
      "Changes to staffing were being discussed at the annual SoR conference, with discussions also taking place over whether transgender men should be included in the NHS breast screening programme.",
      "Sue Johnson, who represents the SoR, told the BBC: \"The role of the radiographer has developed and evolved and there is a much broader scope to the job role than simply taking the images.",
      "\"It's a very desirable and enjoyable career and men are saying 'we would like to access that same career and we could help deliver the service'\".",
      "Johnson said she believes this could help the recruitment of more radiographers and open up the job to more qualified people because \"mammography doesn't get as much publicity\" as other health professions.",
      "The prospect of men performing mammograms has been explored unsuccessfully in the past, but Johnson believes \"the world has changed\" and that \"the time is right\" to start reconsidering the role.",
      "She says women would still be given a choice on who conducted their mammogram if they didn't feel comfortable with a man doing it.",
      "Ms Reed said having two mammograms 15 years apart were responsible for \"saving\" her life.",
      "She's now had two mastectomies after two separate breast cancer diagnoses.",
      "Because of what she's gone through, having a male radiographer \"wouldn't bother me at all\", she says.",
      "But Claire Rowney, chief executive of charity Breast Cancer Now, says \"it's vital that efforts to build up the screening workforce do not inadvertently damage uptake of breast screening\".",
      "She says that \"while we welcome every effort to reduce staff shortages and delays in breast screening, we know that concerns about being seen by a male mammographer already deter some women from attending breast screening, even with current staffing being all-female\".",
      "Ms Rowney adds that recruiting male mammographers could be an issue for some women in ethnic minority communities, who may have greater concerns around preserving their modesty and who may be less likely to take up the offer of screening."

      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride labelled the move a \"sucker punch\" to households when Labour had \"already pushed up the cost of living for families\".",
      "The sugar tax, known formally as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), is a tax on pre-packaged drinks such as those sold in cans and cartons in supermarkets.",
      "It applies to manufacturers and was introduced by the Conservative government in April 2018 as a means to tackle obesity.",
      "On Monday, the Treasury also confirmed proposals to reduce the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml.",
      "Some 203 pre-packed milk-based drinks on the market, which make up 93% of sales within the category, will be hit with the tax unless their sugar content is reduced in accordance with the proposals, government analysis says.",

      "\"We are making sure we are taking practical, sensible measures to improve the health of our children,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.",
      "The original exemption for milk-based drinks was included because of concerns about calcium consumption, particularly among children.",

      "Opponents of the levy in recent years include the soft drinks industry, pubs and off licences. Some argue the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families and does little to tackle obesity.",

    "story": [
      "The chair of England's first public inquiry into mental health deaths vowed to \"seek out the truth\" - despite difficulties getting documents from the NHS.",
      "The first key evidence sessions in the Lampard Inquiry - examining more than 2,000 deaths at NHS inpatient units in Essex between 2000 and 2023 - have begun in London.",
      "Baroness Lampard said although the hearing was \"breaking new ground\", 21 legal notices had been issued to NHS organisations to force them to submit evidence.",
      "\"We will seek out the truth,\" she said, adding she would not hesitate to use her legal powers \"to the fullest extent necessary to compel the production of evidence where it's not provided\".",
      "Baroness Lampard said the inquiry was of \"national significance\" as it focussed on \"the big critical concerns about what went wrong over almost a quarter of a century\".",
      "Counsel to the inquiry, Nicholas Griffin KC, said: \"We have been unimpressed with a significant number of requests for deadline extensions... and the number of occasions where providers have not given the material expressly asked for.\"",
      "He said there were problems with the condition of paper records, \"missing documents\" and providers, including private ones, sending information late.",
      "Mr Griffin said it was a criminal offence to suppress, conceal, alter, or destroy relevant evidence and said providers should be properly resourced to respond to the inquiry.",
      "He said the inquiry should not be delayed because of it.",
      "The original government investigation into the deaths of inpatients stalled after only 11 out of 14,000 staff agreed to take part.",
      "But Mr Griffin said the inquiry was still facing barriers in the flow of information.",
      "He said the inquiry team had asked providers and regulators for a reassurance that they would not take action against staff if they provided information to the inquiry or failed to provide it in the past.",
      "He said almost all, including the largest providers, declined to give such undertakings and said the inquiry was reflecting on what further steps to take.",
      "Over the next three weeks, Baroness Lampard will hear from care regulators, experts, and the chief executive of the Essex Partnership NHS University Trust (EPUT).",
      "She said she would confront difficult topics \"head on\" and promised to keep those affected at the \"heart of the inquiry,\" adding that she wanted to make \"lasting, positive recommendations to improve mental healthcare\" across England.",
      "Melanie Leahy, whose 20-year-old son Matthew died under NHS care, was joined by fellow campaigners outside the hearing at Arundel House.",
      "She said: \"It's been years of heartbreak, unanswered questions and fighting just to be heard.\"",
      "Ms Leahy, who campaigned for more than a decade for an inquiry, said it was a real chance to get the truth.",
      "\"At Matthew's inquest, they [those in charge of EPUT] walked out of the back door and didn't speak to anybody, let's bring them out now.\"",
      "Campaigners and lawyers acting for bereaved families have alleged mental health services are still unsafe.",
      "It is understood the inquiry team has referred ongoing concerns to regulators.",
      "Mr Griffin said they would be looking at what recent inquests and deaths may reveal about the extent to which the issues in Essex \"are really being addressed\".",
      "He said Dr Emma Ireton, an associate professor from Nottingham Law School, would be producing a report to support the inquiry's work on maximising the chance of its recommendations being implemented.",
      "EPUT chief executive Paul Scott has apologised for deaths under his trust's care.",
      "He said: \"As the inquiry progresses, there will be many accounts of people who were much loved and missed over the past 24 years and I want to say how sorry I am for their loss.\"",
      "Evidence is due to continue until 15 May and will resume in July.",

      "She said the medical exemption criteria had remained virtually unchanged since the late 1960s, with nearly three million people in England living with long-term conditions not eligible for an exemption because they were not recognised 60 years ago or people rarely survived into adulthood.",
      "Conditions which are not currently on the medical exemption list include Parkinson's disease, cystic fibrosis and motor neurone disease.",

    "story": [
      "People who eat lots of ultra-processed foods (UPF) may be at greater risk of dying early, a study in eight countries including the UK and the US suggests.",
      "Processed meats, biscuits, fizzy drinks, ice cream and some breakfast cereals are examples of UPF, which are becoming increasingly common in diets worldwide.",
      "UPFs tend to contain more than five ingredients, which are not usually found in home cooking, such as additives, sweeteners and chemicals to improve the food's texture or appearance.",
      "Some experts say it's not known why UPFs are linked to poor health - there is little evidence it's down to the processing itself and could be because these foods contain high levels of fat, salt and sugar.",
      "'Artificial ingredients'",
      "The researchers behind the study, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, looked at previous research to estimate the impact of ultra-processed food intake on mortality.",
      "The study cannot definitively prove that UPFs caused any premature deaths.",
      "This is because the amount of ultra-processed foods in someone's diet is also linked to their overall diet, exercise levels, wider lifestyle and wealth, which can all also affect health.",
      "The studies looked at surveys of people's diets and at data on deaths from eight countries - Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, UK and US.",
      "The report estimates that in the UK and the US, where UPFs account for more than half of calorie intake, 14% of early deaths could be linked to the harms they cause.",
      "In countries such as Colombia and Brazil, where UPF intake is much lower (less than 20% of calorie intake), the study estimated these foods are linked to around 4% of premature deaths.",
      "Lead study author Dr Eduardo Nilson, from Brazil, said UPFs affected health \"because of the changes in the foods during industrial processing and the use of artificial ingredients, including colorants, artificial flavours and sweeteners, emulsifiers, and many other additives and processing aids\".",
      "By their calculations, in the US in 2018, there were 124,000 premature deaths due to the consumption of ultra-processed food. In the UK, nearly 18,000.",
      "The study says governments should update their dietary advice to urge people to cut back on these foods.",
      "But the UK government's expert panel on nutrition recently said there wasn't any strong evidence of a link between the way food is processed and poor health.",

      "Still questions to answer",
      "The numbers in the study are based on modelling the impact of ultra-processed foods on people's health.",
      "Prof Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics, Open University, said the study makes lots of mathematical assumptions which make him cautious about what the findings mean.",
      "\"It's still far from clear whether consumption of just any UPF at all is bad for health, or what aspect of UPFs might be involved.",
      "\"This all means that it's impossible for any one study to be sure whether differences in mortality between people who consume different UPF amounts are actually caused by differences in their UPF consumption.",
      "\"You still can't be sure from any study of this kind exactly what's causing what.\"",
      "Dr Nerys Astbury, an expert in diet and obesity at the University of Oxford, also agrees there are limitations to the research.",
      "It's been known for some time that diets high in energy, fat and sugar can increase the risk of diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, heart conditions and some cancers, which can lead to premature death.",
      "\"Many UPF tend to be high in these nutrients,\" she says, adding that studies to date haven't been able to prove that the effects of UPFs are due to anything more than \"diets high in foods which are energy dense and contain large amounts of fat and sugar\".",
      "This type of research cannot prove that consumption of ultra-processed foods is harmful, says Dr Stephen Burgess at Cambridge University.",
      "How physically fit someone is may be the main cause of poor health instead. But when numerous studies across many countries and culture suggest UPFs could be a risk to health, Dr Burgess says \"ultra-processed foods may be more than a bystander\".",
      "The Food and Drink Federation, which represents manufacturers, said the term 'ultra-processed food' \"demonises a wide variety of food that can help people achieve a healthy balanced diet, such as yoghurt, pasta sauces or bread\".",

      "Baby food pouches from six of the UK's leading brands are failing to meet key nutritional needs of babies and toddlers - with parents being \"misled\" by their marketing - BBC Panorama has been told.",
      "Laboratory testing of 18 pouches made by Ella's Kitchen, Heinz, Piccolo, Little Freddie, Aldi and Lidl found many to be low in vitamin C and iron, while some contained more sugar in a single pouch than a one-year-old should have in a day.",
      "There are more than 250 of these products on the multi-million pound baby pouch market - they have become a staple for many households with babies and children up to the age of two or three. They are convenient and have long shelf lives.",
      "Experts have told the BBC the products should only be used sparingly, are not replacements for homemade meals, and can cause children health problems if used as their main source of nutrition.",
      "When we put this to the brands, the market leader Ella's Kitchen said it agreed with all three points.",
      "All of the brands said their products were intended as a complementary part of a child's varied weaning diet.",
      "The brands also told the BBC they are committed to infant health, and they provide quality, nutritional products that meet UK regulations.",
      "Young children should be protected from commercial interests, experts told us - while the government said existing laws already set nutritional requirements for baby foods.",

      "Pouches being marketed to babies as young as four months old, against the clear recommendations of the UK government and the World Health Organization (WHO)",
      "'Misleading' nutrition claims",
      "\"You think they are going to be nutritionally good for your child,\" said one parent, Hazel, during a focus group on baby food pouches at Leeds University.",
      "\"You trust the brands\u2026 it's really, really concerning.\"",
      "However, public health experts have been unified in telling the BBC that no parent should feel guilty for using the products.",
      "The nutritional claims of baby food pouches are misleading, according to Dr Alison Tedstone, who spent nine years as chief nutritionist to the UK government.",
      "\"You think as a parent it is a healthy product, and it just isn't,\" she said.",
      "Many of the biggest brands use \"halo-marketing\" - surrounding products with healthy words or phrases - according to Dr Tedstone.",
      "Ella's Kitchen, for example, describes savoury products as \"perfectly balanced for growing babies\", while Piccolo claims many pouches are \"packed with goodness\".",
      "Some Little Freddie pouches come branded as \"Good for Brains\" and Heinz claims some of its fruit products are \"as nutritionally good as homemade\".",
      "Piccolo and Little Freddie told us their packaging accurately represented the key ingredients and flavours contained in their products, while Ella's Kitchen said it \"would never use\" misleading claims. Heinz did not address our questions on marketing.",
      "'Very, very low in iron'",
      "Savoury pouches are often used by parents as a main meal - but of the six such products sent for laboratory testing, none could provide a significant contribution to the 7.8mg of iron an infant needs in a day.",
      "Iron is a key nutrient for a healthy immune system, growth and brain development - but levels are not shown on the products' labelling.",
      "By seven months old, \"babies' iron stores are starting to run out, so we now need to get that from food,\" explained Bahee Van de Bor, a paediatric dietitian from the British Dietetic Association.",
      "Our lab results found that none of the pouches came close to the 3mg of iron that Ms Van de Bor would want an infant to be having from a main meal.",
      "Of the four pouches that contained meat - known to be a good source of iron - Heinz's Sweet Potato, Chicken and Veggies contained the lowest, with just over 0.3mg of iron.",
      "\"That's really low. Very, very low,\" Ms Van de Bor told the BBC. \"That doesn't meet even 5% of [an infant's] daily requirements.\"",
      "The ingredients list on the back of the pouch says it contains 12% chicken - \"so the iron-rich food is a very tiny amount,\" she said.",
      "All the companies stressed they were committed to providing nutritious products for babies, and that their products were intended as a complementary part of a child's varied weaning diet. Little Freddie added that its products were not intended to be meal replacements for one-year-olds.",
      "Sugar and tooth decay",
      "Alongside savoury products, companies also sell pouches containing only fruit, which are leaving dentists concerned about the potential for tooth decay.",
      "The NHS says an infant should have as little sugar as possible, and that a one-year-old child should have no more than 10g of free sugars a day.",
      "Free sugars occur when fruit is pureed, as is the case with the pouches. Unlike eating fresh fruit - which is much better for a child - pureeing releases sugar from inside fruit cell walls and can be absorbed much more quickly.",
      "A recent British Dental Association (BDA) report, shared exclusively with the BBC, indicated that 37 of 60 fruit pouches found on supermarket shelves contained more free sugar than this 10g guideline.",
      "The NHS says eating too many free sugars can also lead to weight gain.",
      "Children who are \"barely out of weaning\" are coming to hospital for multiple tooth extractions because of tooth decay caused by their diets, said Eddie Crouch, BDA chair.",
      "\"It's obviously not all down to these pouches,\" he added. \"But clearly, regular use and feeding with these pouches with such high levels of sugar cause serious problems to the general health of children as they're growing up.\"",
      "Some pouches contain higher levels of sugar than some fizzy drinks. The highest found by the BBC was Ella's Kitchen's Bananas and Apples, which has 19.6g of sugar - equivalent to more than four teaspoons.",
      "At the same time, Ella's Kitchen - as well as Lidl, Aldi, Piccolo and Heinz - label their products as containing \"no added sugar\".",
      "While such claims are truthful and not breaking any guidelines, Mr Crouch believes \"the wording itself is intended to mislead\".",
      "Piccolo said it develops \"recipes that combine fruits with vegetables\" to reduce sugar levels, while Ella's Kitchen said that, \"the sugar content would be the same if you pureed the ingredients yourself at home\" and that it has \"a dedicated sugar reduction pathway for 2025\".",
      "Heinz, Aldi, Little Freddie and Lidl all said their products contained \"no added sugars\".",
      "Vitamin C lost",
      "The BBC found that nearly all the vitamin C in one of the fruit pouches tested had been lost during the manufacturing process.",
      "Vitamin C is important for immune systems and an infant needs 25mg a day, the government says. But the Pure Mango pouch from Piccolo had, in effect, no vitamin C left - less than 0.1mg. This is despite the same amount of fresh mango (70g) containing 18.2mg of vitamin C.",
      "\"That is a huge surprise for me,\" said paediatric dietitian Ms Van de Bor. What's left is \"free sugars, sadly, and fluids\", she said, plus a \"small amount\" of fibre.",
      "Vitamin C is heat sensitive, which means it degrades because the food inside pouches is heated to ensure safety and increase shelf life.",
      "We tested three separate production batches of the mango pouch, and all came back with the same result.",
      "However, not all the pouches had low results. Heinz's Apple pouch - which has vitamin C added - and Ella's Kitchen's Bananas pouch tested high in vitamin C.",
      "Piccolo said vitamins degrade during processing, so it boosts many of its fruit pouches with ingredients rich in vitamin C. Ella's Kitchen said it keeps the loss of vitamin C to a minimum.",
      "None of the other brands commented directly on our vitamin C results.",
      "Ignoring expert guidance",
      "We also found that the six companies had failed to implement some NHS, Public Health England and WHO recommendations.",
      "Piccolo, Aldi and Ella's Kitchen currently promote their fruit pouches to babies as young as four months, despite the NHS and WHO saying babies should not be given solid food until about the age of six months.",
      "Introducing products at four months old, added Dr Tedstone, is \"a whole eight weeks of extra product sales\".",
      "\"I think we should put our babies' health ahead of commercial incentives to sell more product,\" she said.",
      "Dr Kremlin Wickramasinghe from the World Health Organization (WHO) told the BBC that companies promoting foods to parents of four-month-olds were acting \"against the best interest of the babies\".",
      "Companies are now making changes to the age recommendations on their products. Since we began our investigation Ella's Kitchen has announced that by March next year it will only recommend pouches for babies older than six months to align with UK guidance. Piccolo told us it has begun relabelling all four-month packets to six-months. And since we contacted Aldi, it has said it will make that change too, \"in line with other brands and retailers\".",
      "Babies should not feed from the spout",
      "Baby food pouches are topped off with a little spout, but both the NHS and the World Health Organization say it should not be used to suck directly from the pouch. It means babies can eat too fast and it can cause dental decay.",
      "None of the companies we looked at used front-of-pack labelling to advise parents against feeding children directly from the spout, despite this being a Public Health England recommendation made in 2019.",
      "We also found that Piccolo was promoting the \"convenience\" of eating directly from the pouch on its website, which said: \"There is no need for extra utensils because food pouches can be squeezed right into a baby's mouth.\"",
      "Since the BBC contacted the company, this has been removed - but the brand does have multiple videos on social media showing children eating from pouches through the spout.",
      "Piccolo didn't respond when asked about its social media images.",
      "All the other brands say their labelling - on the back of pouches - either recommends parents use a spoon, or to not let babies eat directly from the spout.",
      "'We need to protect our babies'",
      "Mandatory legislation is what is needed, said Dr Tedstone and the WHO's Dr Wickramasinghe.",
      "The current UK regulations that cover baby food were written in 2003, before baby food pouches came to market. They provide some guidelines for labelling, prohibit the use of pesticides and set out the minimum and maximum levels of some nutrients. But campaigners say they are outdated and do not ensure products are nutritionally appropriate or stop them being promoted to four month olds.",
      "\"I would hope that ministers, when they think about the baby food industry, recognise that we need to protect our babies,\" said Dr Tedstone.",
      "\"[Businesses] are not going to [change] unless they are forced to.\"",
      "Lidl said it welcomed clear government guidelines, while Little Freddie said it actively participated in policy consultations. Ella's Kitchen said it would \"never, ever\" put profit above the health of children.",
      "Voluntary guidelines for manufacturers aimed at improving standards were drawn up for the government by Public Health England in 2020, but haven't been published by either the Conservative or Labour administrations.",
      "Existing laws already ensure that the safety and quality of baby foods and the claims made on packaging are clear and accurate, the Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC.",
      "It added that it was \"committed to tackling the childhood obesity crisis and improving children's health through our Plan for Change\".",
      "Brands, said Dr Wickramasinghe \"will always come up with the argument why we shouldn't introduce these regulations.\"",
      "\"But we never really quantify the cost [of inaction] to the children... and to the NHS.\""

    "summary": "Just a few years ago, Chris Brookes-Smith could have died from eating peanuts - but taking part in a clinical trial has changed his life.",
    "story": [
      "Chris Brookes-Smith, 28, used to live in fear of dying from eating even the smallest trace of peanut.",
      "Ten years ago he had his worst allergic reaction after ordering a curry at a local Indian takeaway. The trauma of it is seared into his memory.",
      "\"I knew I was in trouble after one bite,\" he says. \"Within seconds there were spots on my lips. Within minutes I was vomiting. I could feel my throat closing up, hives forming in my armpits then over my whole body... My face going all puffy with the swelling.\"",
      "His voice tails off, full of emotion.",
      "\"I thought I was going to die.\"",
      "Photos taken in hospital later that day show the toll the reaction took on his body.",
      "\"I looked like a plucked turkey because my skin had blistered so much,\" Chris says.",
      "But the most painful thing were the hives - red, raised bumps on the skin - which felt \"like boiling water had been poured over me\".",
      "Trying to avoid peanuts, one of the most common food allergies, has been a way of life for Chris and millions of other adults with a serious allergy. Eating out, going to social events and travelling abroad are all fraught with anxiety.",
      "As many as one in 200 adults and one in 50 children have a nut allergy, charities say. Some children grow out of their allergies, but many don't - and they continue into adulthood, often getting worse.",
      "An allergic reaction occurs when the body reacts to the protein in peanuts, thinking it's a threat, which triggers a sudden release of chemicals. Symptoms can range from the mild to very serious.",
      "Chris's allergy first came to light as a baby, when he developed a rash as his mum made peanut butter sandwiches.",
      "Each reaction since has been worse than the one before, which means he's become accustomed to living every day \"on high alert hoping nothing bad happens\".",
      "Activities such as going out with friends or eating in restaurants, which should be enjoyable, turned into stressful, potentially life-threatening experiences.",
      "Despite a love of travel, Chris avoided going to countries where peanuts are commonly used, like south east Asia, after three allergic reactions on a trip to Italy.",
      "As Chris grew up, his family constantly worried about him. But then his mum heard about a clinical trial at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London that would change her son's life.",
      "It would test whether adults like Chris with serious peanut allergies could be desensitised by training their bodies to tolerate the very thing that could kill it, calming down the immune system when it would usually over-react.",
      "Despite being \"really nervous\", Chris agreed to sign up.",
      "From milligrams to whole nuts",
      "Under the watchful eye of doctors, Chris started by eating a fraction of a milligram of peanut powder mixed with yoghurt. Over many months, the amount of peanut was gradually increased, slowly building up to Chris eating fractions of nuts and, finally, whole nuts.",
      "By the end of the nine-month study, 14 of the 21 patients could eat the equivalent of five peanuts without having allergic reactions - including Chris.",
      "Professor Stephen Till, who led the research, says the treatment \"has potential to have a real impact on patients' lives\".",
      "\"Most severe reactions occur because of mistakes, usually by somebody else, and miscommunication. So it provides them with some protection against that.",
      "\"They've taken control, if you like, of their peanut allergy now.\"",
      "The method - called oral immunotherapy - is already proven to work for allergies to pollen, wasp and bee stings. It's only been used on food allergies in the last 20 years, and mostly in children whose immune systems are still developing. Adult allergies are thought to be harder to shift.",
      "\"Peanut allergy is very common in children and almost never goes away,\" says Prof Till. \"Those young people are going to become adults, so we need treatments for adults too.\"",
      "This trial, published in the journal Allergy, shows adults with serious allergies can increase the amount of peanut they can tolerate by 100 times.",
      "Chris, who lives in Northamptonshire, had no idea how he would react to even the slightest trace of peanut. Increasing that dose - willingly - every day was something he couldn't imagine.",
      "\"The first time I went there and I ingest this stuff, my heart's going a million miles an hour,\" he says. \"The big jump in fear was going from peanut dust to half a whole nut.\"",
      "But he was reassured by having a team of doctors and nurses present, with drugs such as adrenaline standing by in case of a severe, life-threatening reaction.",
      "\"You've got 100 eyes on you - nothing is gonna happen.\"",
      "However, experts stress no one should try this at home on their own because of the risk of a serious allergic reaction occurring.",
      "'Wonderful feeling'",
      "Not everyone who tried the treatment was desensitised, and larger trials in more people will have to work out why that is.",
      "\"For some people, there were reactions and we had to slow down or go back a step,\" explains Prof Till. \"But the message is that you can desensitise adults to peanuts -and there should be more focus on adults in the future.\"",
      "Being able to eat peanuts safely had a huge impact on the lives of those who took part, the researchers say. It has given them freedom to travel, reduced their anxiety when eating out and removed their fear of food.",
      "How to develop this into a practical treatment on the NHS is more of a challenge. First, larger trials are needed to prove it can work for more people.",
      "And researchers are looking at whether putting drops of peanut in solution under the tongue could be a safer way of achieving the same end result.",
      "Chris now eats four peanuts every morning with his breakfast granola to keep his allergy at bay \u2013 as recommended by his doctors.",
      "He's grateful for having had the opportunity to take part in the trial and hopes many others with serious peanut allergies can also benefit from the treatment.",
      "While he admits he still hates the flavour of peanuts, he says knowing he can now eat something that once sent his body into \"nuclear meltdown\" has changed his life.",
      "\"It's a wonderful feeling,\" Chris says. \"I'm no longer afraid of dying.\"",

      "The Home Office has been asked to comment.",
      "Sir Mark says unless the Met receives more money in June's spending review, the government risks being unable to meet its own national promises to halve knife crime, and violence against women and girls, over the next decade.",

      "The commissioner's report states the force wants to grow in size to 38,000 officers and 19,000 staff, but is forecast to have just 31,248 officers and 10,972 staff by the end of the year.",
      "He predicts the Met will lose about 1,700 officers, PCSOs and staff, but that additional funding may allow the force to reduce the losses by speeding up recruitment.",
      "'Less capacity, increasing demand'",
      "The report warns that with no additional investment, London may experience \"sustained increases\" in knife crime, violence against women and girls (VAWG), and theft.",
      "\"We will have less policing capacity and capability at a time when demand has been steadily increasing,\" the commissioner writes.",
      "\"Undoubtedly this will impact our ability to respond to victims of crime and Londoners and have consequences for our own officers and staff and our reform plans.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Met detailed a list of savings it would need to make in order to protect frontline services such as neighbourhood policing and public protection teams, which tackle sex offences and domestic abuse.",
      "Those plans include scrapping the Royal Parks police and Safer Schools officers, along with cuts to forensics and mounted police, and potentially taking firearms off the Flying Squad.",
      "Sir Mark's report warns the financial challenges are likely to have a \"negative impact on the speed and scale\" of reforms, which the force is under pressure to make following a series of scandals and a highly critical review two years ago by Baroness Casey.",

      "Sir Mark also describes how the Met expects, without further funding, that it will have to close \"up to half our current buildings due to them being no longer habitable or legally compliant\".",

    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 17:46:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Quangos are taxpayer-funded but not directly controlled by central government and include watchdogs.",
    "story": [
      "Over 300 quango bosses received a higher salary than the prime minister last year, according to the TaxPayers' Alliance (TPA).",
      "Quango stands for quasi autonomous non-governmental organisations, which means they are taxpayer-funded but not directly controlled by central government, and include watchdogs as well as the prison service.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer axed the biggest quango, NHS England, last month and the government is currently reviewing hundreds of quangos in a bid to reduce bureaucratic waste and inefficiency.",
      "John O'Connell, chief executive of the TPA, said there should be more scrutiny of the hundreds of \"quangocrats\" taking home \"massive pay packets\" with minimal democratic oversight.",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "Ministers to review hundreds of public bodies",
      "Starmer pitches reform to 'shackled' civil servants",
      "As prime minister, Sir Keir is entitled to a salary of \u00a3172,153, which is five times higher than the median UK annual salary of \u00a337,430 in April 2024, as measured by the Office for National Statistics.",
      "In all, 315 quango chief executives received a higher salary, according to the TPA, with the top three being Channel 4's on \u00a3619,000, the chief executive of HS2 on \u00a3618,195, and head of Network Rail on \u00a3588,000.",
      "The research also found that at least 1,472 quango staff received more than \u00a3100,000 in total remuneration, which included salary, expenses and pension benefits.",
      "The TPA definition of a quango is wider than others and includes any non-ministerial department, public corporation, agency or other public body included in the government's departments, agencies and public bodies list, including the Bank of England and the BBC.",
      "Mr O'Connell said the TPA backed the Labour government's review of quangos, and urged more focus on scrapping unnecessary functions and bringing delivery of significant services back under political control.",
      "He said: \"Taxpayers will be shocked to hear that there are hundreds of quangocrats heading up bodies they may never have heard taking home massive pay packets the average Brit can only dream of.",
      "\"But beyond the healthy remuneration, arguably the bigger problem is that in many areas of government policy these quango bosses reign supreme, with minimal ministerial or parliamentary oversight despite the often highly sensitive and significant nature of what their organisation is responsible for.",
      "\"The government may have signalled an intent to get a grip of the quango state, but as well as restoring political accountability there needs to be serious review of some of the functions they perform.\"",
      "However, Matthew Gill, the Institute for Government's programme director on public bodies, said focusing on the pay of quango bosses could be misleading.",
      "\"It is important that public bodies are democratically accountable, but ministers cannot micro-manage everything in the public sector,\" he said.",
      "\"They need good people running things \u2013 and pay that is too low to attract them is a false economy.",
      "\"It is very difficult to evaluate whether public sector leaders are paid appropriately without benchmarking their pay to the private sector.\"",
      "Under Sir Keir, the Labour government has set up more than 20 new quangos, including Great British Energy, which will invest in renewable energy to help meet the government's clean power goals; and Skills England, which aims to support people in finding jobs.",
      "Almost 60% of day-to-day government spending is channelled through quangos, with \u00a3353.3bn budgeted for them in 2022/23, according to the latest published figures.",
      "The last major shake-up was under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, when a \"bonfire of the quangos\" scrapped nearly a third of them, including the Audit Commission and the UK Film Council.",
      "Asked last month if the government was planning another \"bonfire of the quangos\", Downing Street said the PM wanted to see a more \"active and agile state\", rather than \"outsourcing\" decisions to other bodies.",
      "Meanwhile, the government has announced it will merge the Valuation Office Agency, which values properties for council tax and business rates, into HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) by April 2026.",
      "It is the latest quango to be scrapped in a move the Treasury said would increase efficiency and cut duplication.",

    "story": [
      "Planned changes to school uniform policy will affect over four million pupils across England, according to new estimates from the Department for Education (DfE).",
      "The government says seven in 10 secondary schools and 35% of primary schools in England will have to reduce the number of compulsory branded items to three, plus a branded tie for secondary students.",
      "The new rule is part of the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which still has several parliamentary stages to go through before becoming a law.",
      "The government says families will save money, but school wear manufacturers warn the plans could end up costing them more.",
      "The average cost of a full school uniform and PE kit for a child at secondary school is \u00a3442, and is \u00a3343 for a primary school pupil, according to the latest DfE data.",
      "Existing statutory guidance, introduced by the previous government, requires schools to consider the cost of their uniform so that it is not a deciding factor for parents when choosing schools.",
      "The current government wants to go further, by limiting the number of items unique to a school that have to be bought from designated suppliers.",
      "The government claims parents will save around \u00a350 per child through the school uniform measures, which it hopes to introduce in September 2026.",
      "But uniform retailers warn that the planned changes might increase costs for families. The Schoolwear Association says the plans could mean parents spend more on replacing lower-quality generic garments which might not last as long as branded items.",
      "They say branded uniforms also play a role in reducing inequality in schools and improving behaviour.",
      "Many parents rely on uniform exchanges to afford the full list of items required by their children's schools.",
      "At Darlington Borough Council's exchange, located on the ground floor of a multi-storey car park, all the uniforms have been donated and are free to local parents, who are able to stock up on branded items from over 25 schools in the area.",
      "The exchange has been running for five years and has given out approximately 12,000 items to 4,000 customers.",
      "Volunteer Kay says she is worried some school uniform policies will still be too strict even after the government's planned limit on logos comes into force.",
      "\"Some of the schools are particular about a certain skirt, a certain style from a certain supplier - so that can cause problems and be quite expensive for parents,\" she says.",
      "But she says it is a good thing that more parents will be able to buy more of their uniforms from other retailers, like supermarkets.",
      "In Darlington town centre, one mum with two sons at primary school and a daughter in secondary said she was worried about the jump in uniform costs coming when her sons join secondary school.",
      "\"It's just a nightmare,\" she said.",
      "\"My daughter's school is really strict on the uniform. You can't get black trousers, it's got to be grey, or pleated skirts. For their shoes alone I'm looking at \u00a360 a year, and there's three of them. That's not including blazers, PE kits or anything else.",
      "\"It's a lot of money when it all adds up.\"",
      "Matt Perry, head teacher at The Halifax Academy in West Yorkshire, says he makes sure pupils follow the school's rules on uniform, but also wants to ensure it is affordable for parents.",
      "The school gives its pupils ties for free, and parts of the PE kit and a school blazer are the only compulsory items with branding on.",
      "The school may cut back further if limits to branded items are brought in.",
      "The school is in an area of Halifax with high deprivation, and has a uniform bank as well as a laundrette to wash pupils' uniforms.",
      "Mr Perry says branded school uniform can bring a sense of pride and inclusion, but that tough uniform policies can be a barrier to attendance.",
      "\"There are so many different factors that children have to face in order to have clean and correct uniform that is used daily,\" he says.",
      "\"As long as we see the families really trying to adhere to the uniform policy that we've got, we can be flexible with how we interpret that. So if it is in the right colours but it's not branded, that doesn't matter to us.\"",

    "story": [
      "Interim guidance on single-sex spaces is \"ill-considered and impractical\" and should be withdrawn, the Green Party has said.",
      "The guidance, issued by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), followed the UK Supreme Court's ruling that a woman is defined by biological sex under the Equality Act.",
      "In places like hospitals, shops and restaurants, trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use women's facilities but they should not be left with no facilities to use, the guidance says.",
      "Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer told the BBC the guidance puts trans people at risk of discrimination, while Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said there were questions over how it would be enforced.",
      "Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden said the \"logical consequence\" of the Supreme Court ruling and EHRC guidance was that \"people use the facilities of their biological sex\".",
      "Asked if the government would ban trans people from using changing rooms or toilets they wish to use in its own buildings, he told the BBC: \"In reality, when you say ban, am I going to be standing outside toilets?  I'm probably not.",
      "\"There isn't going to be toilet police but that is the logical consequence of the court ruling and the EHRC guidance.\"",
      "The UK government has welcomed the Supreme Court ruling, saying it brings \"clarity\" for women and service providers.",
      "A spokesperson added: \"We will review and update policy wherever necessary to ensure it complies with the latest legal requirements.\"",
      "Last week the Supreme Court found the terms \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the 2010 Equality Act \"refer to a biological woman and biological sex\".",
      "This means, for instance, that transgender women, who are biologically male but identify as women, can be excluded from women-only spaces.",
      "As part of the judgement in the case brought against Scottish ministers by the group For Women Scotland, Supreme Court judge Lord Hodge stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.",
      "Equality watchdog issues interim guidance on single-sex spaces",
      "Five key takeaways from Supreme Court ruling",
      "Westminster's tortuous battle with the gender question",
      "Carla Denyer, co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, said the interim guidance, which was published on Friday following the Supreme Court ruling on 15 April, was \"rushed and ill-thought out\".",
      "\"It's been really obvious that they have not listened to trans people,\" she told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.",
      "She added that the guidance put trans people at risk of discrimination, especially in workplaces, and \"seems to fly in face of the strong tradition of tolerance we have in Britain\".",
      "The Green Party said in a statement that the guidance was likely to cause \"distress\" to the trans community as well as \"further confusion to employers, businesses and service providers\" .",
      "It is calling for the guidance to be withdrawn \"until the EHRC can produce something more thought-through which takes into account the voices of all those affected\".",
      "Denyer questioned what should happen if trans people are not allowed to go to the toilet of their gender or their birth sex.",
      "The guidance also states that in some circumstances the law allows trans women (biological men) not to be permitted to use men's facilities, and trans men (biological women) not to be permitted to use women's facilities.",
      "When asked to clarify this, the EHRC pointed to a section of the Supreme Court ruling stating that trans men could be excluded from women's facilities \"where reasonable objection is taken to their presence, for example because the gender reassignment process has given them a masculine appearance or attributes to which reasonable objection might be taken\" in the context of a women-only service.",
      "However, the guidance says where possible mixed-sex toilets or changing facilities should be provided, with lockable rooms intended to be used by one person at a time, in addition to single-sex facilities.",
      "Denyer also raised concerns that for lesbian associations or venues which wanted to include trans women, the advice appeared to say they would not be allowed to.",
      "The guidance states that \"a women-only or lesbian-only association should not admit trans women (biological men)\", while \"a men-only or gay men-only associations should not admit trans men (biological women)\".",
      "Sir Ed also told the programme lots of people were confused and anxious about the guidance, for example over which toilet a trans man (biological woman) should use.",
      "The Lib Dem leader said his party accepted the Supreme Court ruling but there needed to be more debate in Parliament to reach a clear solution that \"respects people's rights\".",
      "The EHRC, which enforces equalities law and provides guidance to policymakers, public sector bodies and businesses, is expected to launch a two-week consultation to seek views from those affected in May.",
      "The watchdog is then aiming to provide an updated code of practice to the government for ministerial approval by the end of June.",
      "A spokesperson for the EHRC said: \"The law is as set out in the Supreme Court's very readable judgment and is effective immediately.",
      "\"Employers, service providers and others with duties under the Equality Act must follow the law and should take appropriate specialist legal advice where necessary.",
      "\"But we know many people have questions about the consequences of the judgment and what it means for them, which is why we issued this [guidance] in the interim.\"",

      "Sir Keir Starmer met European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later, as preparations increase for the summit in London on 19 May.",
      "Following the meeting, a Downing Street spokesperson said: \"Discussing the ongoing negotiations to strengthen the UK-EU partnership, they both agreed that good progress had been made.",
      "\"They asked their teams to continue their important work in the coming weeks, with the aim of delivering as ambitious a package as possible at the first UK-EU summit next month.\"",
      "The Labour government is aiming to forge closer economic ties to the EU after Brexit. Both sides have also expressed a renewed interest in a defence and security pact amid the war in Ukraine.",
      "A defence deal would potentially unlock full UK access to a \u20ac150bn (\u00a3128bn) EU-backed loans scheme, with British firms otherwise limited to providing up to 35% of the value of projects funded under the programme.",
      "Speaking at UK Trade and Business Commission meeting on Thursday, Germany's ambassador to the UK Miguel Berger said he wanted to see progress on a youth visa deal as part of a \"package approach\" to the talks, where different topics are linked together.",
      "He added that EU citizens had faced \"many obstacles\" to moving to the UK since Brexit, including \"very high thresholds\" for skilled work visas.",
      "Existing schemes",
      "The UK currently offers visas allowing young people from 12 non-EU countries including Japan, South Korea and Uruguay to study or work in the UK for up to two years. Those from Australia, Canada or New Zealand can extend by a further year.",
      "These visas are subject to annual quotas, ranging from 100 visas for Andorra to 42,000 for Australia, with ballots held where they are oversubscribed.",
      "Applicants from these countries need at least \u00a32,530 in savings, cannot apply for most benefits, and have to pay an annual NHS surcharge of \u00a3776 for students and \u00a31,035 for workers.",
      "The European Commission first suggested an EU-wide youth deal in April last year, claiming Rishi Sunak's government had approached European capitals to discuss individual visa deals, risking \"differential treatment\" of EU citizens.",
      "Under its original proposal, people aged between 18 and 30 would be able to apply for visas lasting up to four years to work, study, train or volunteer, with no overall cap on the number of visas issued.",
      "It also said EU applicants should not have to pay the NHS surcharge, and should be able to pay the same university tuition fees as British students, rather than the higher fees they have had to pay since Brexit.",
      "'Youth experience'",
      "There have been suggestions that the Home Office, tasked with delivering government plans to lower overall migration, is pushing for any eventual agreement to be more limited than that suggested by the European Commission.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is reportedly arguing for visas to be limited to one year so that EU citizens taking part do not show up in official immigration figures, with applications also subject to an overall cap.",
      "Asked about the reports, Mr Berger declined to comment, saying that \"we have to leave that to the negotiations\".",
      "The EU has been keen to stress that a visa deal would not replicate the bloc's rules on freedom of movement, under which EU citizens were automatically entitled to live and work in the UK without applying for a visa.",
      "Documents circulated between EU states also suggest a deal could be rebranded as a \"youth experience\" scheme, in an apparent bid to downplay any link to migration.",
      "But any deal that is negotiated is likely to lead to a political row, with the Conservatives and Reform UK critical of a proposed agreement.",
      "During a local election campaign visit earlier, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said a deal risked \"another avenue which people might use to game the system,\" adding that Labour \"doesn't know how to negotiate\".",
      "She added: \"Where are all these people they want to bring in going to work?\"",
      "Reform leader Nigel Farage said a deal could lead to a \"huge number of people\" coming to the UK, adding it would be \"completely against what the Brexit vote demanded\".",
      "An agreement has however been strongly supported by the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, which have long been calling on the Labour government to reach an agreement with the EU.",
      "In his comments on Thursday, Mr Berger insisted a deal would have \"nothing to do with migration\" as those taking part in the scheme would \"go home\" once their visa has ended."

      "\"I feel ashamed to get into debt but we are gradually eating through our business reserves and I can't take wages if I don't make a profit.",

      "They say their plan to reform business rates will mean lower taxes for High Street businesses such as hair salons when it comes into effect in 2026-27.",
      "But salon owners fear this may come too late to save their businesses.",
      "Cutting a client's hair, Kerry explained she could not afford to take on any new apprentices this year and had been forced to reduce the hours of her current 12 apprentices to the minimum.",
      "The next step will be to halve the number of apprentices over the next year as their contracts finish, ending up with six by the end of this year.",
      "If the business cannot recover over the next four years, the rest of her 28 staff, who are nearly all local women who became stylists after serving an apprenticeship at the salon, are facing potential redundancy.",
      "\"I'm having to drastically reduce my overall employee numbers to cut costs just to survive,\" she said.",
      "\"Where are the future hairdressers going to come from if good, employed salons go out of business?\"",
      "Kerry added the way the chancellor is treating salons, which overwhelmingly employ women, \"totally goes against the objectives of the government\" in growing the economy and supporting workers.",
      "Part of the pressure is coming from the UK's Value Added Tax (VAT) rules, which do not allow businesses to reclaim tax on staff costs in the same way they can for goods, putting labour-intensive businesses such as hair or beauty salons at a disadvantage.",
      "\"If you look at a cafe, one waiter can serve several tables of four customers in the space of an hour and the cafe can reclaim the VAT on all the food and drink they serve,\" Kerry explained.",
      "\"Whereas one salon customer needs attention from the receptionist, the apprentice for hair-washing, and the stylist in that same hour and we can only claim VAT back on a tube of hair colour.\"",
      "Many hairdressers went into debt due to the pandemic, said Kerry, and the added pressures of increases in employer National Insurance contributions (Nics) and business rates are now threatening the future of salons across the country.",
      "For Kerry's salon, the Vanilla Rooms, the tax increases have added a \"devastating\" \u00a323,000 extra to her annual costs, through a combination of the threshold at which employers start to pay Nics on staff wages being lowered to \u00a35,000 and changes to business rates.",
      "Her Nics costs have risen 29%, from about \u00a342,000 to about \u00a354,500 - now costing more than \u00a31,000 a week  - and business rates have gone up by 144%, from \u00a37,576 to \u00a318,482 a year.",
      "Kerry is one of 50,000 UK hairdressing professionals represented by the British Hair Consortium (BHC), which has urged Rachel Reeves to take action or face the \"collapse\" of the industry due to rising costs.",
      "The BHC argues the most efficient support the government could offer is through halving VAT for salons, because staff wages make up 60% of their costs.",
      "The association says cutting VAT could actually increase overall tax take, by preventing more workers going self-employed or entering the black market.",
      "Kerry's case was one of those raised by Conservative MP Julia Lopez in a debate this week in Parliament's Westminster Hall, where she urged Rachel Reeves to lower VAT from 20% to 10% to support the hair and beauty sector.",
      "Lopez,  the MP for Hornchurch and Upminster, said Kerry was not alone in being forced to consider whether she will have to shut up shop completely.",
      "\"Some of the increased bills for salons are just unbelievable,\" she said, adding that women were disproportionately impacted by the changes.",
      "\"It's hard to ignore the impact, let alone the irony, of a chancellor celebrating herself for being the first woman to hold that office while simultaneously hammering the sectors that employ, serve and are often led, by women.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat business spokesperson Sarah Gibson agreed that Reeves' Budget had implemented \"an unfair tax on jobs\" and the government must offer tax relief for small businesses in June.",
      "Gibson said an increasing number of salons are opting to rent chairs out to self-employed staff, instead of employing stylists directly, to avoid paying tax.",
      "\"If salons don't get support we will see a huge increase in people becoming chair renters,\" she said, which reduces the Treasury's overall tax take.",
      "Responding for the Labour government, Small Business Minister Gareth Thomas defended the chancellor's decisions in her October Budget as \"important for long term stability\".",
      "Salons are \"a vital pillar of our high streets\", he said, adding \"many hair and beauty businesses will benefit from some of the other measures the chancellor introduced\".",
      "\"We increased the employment allowance so that almost one million employers pay no national insurance contributions at all.",
      "More than half of employers will see no change or gain from that package, and that includes many hair and beauty businesses,\" he told MPs.",
      "Update 26 April 2025: This article was amended to correct the cost of Kerry's business rates, which she said increased from about \u00a37,000, not from \u00a3700 as we originally stated.",

    "story": [
      "\"A sliver here and a sliver there\" \u2013 in a few days millions of voters will be taking part in what are, frankly, a pretty weird set of elections.",
      "Forget the huge thwack of decisive national victory. Brace for what one former minister described as slivers of votes between five political parties, determining who wins and loses power over town halls in England, and one perch in the Commons.",
      "The results will set the political pace for the next few months. And from Friday, Reform could give the two big traditional tribes a problem, and also acquire a potential problem they haven't encountered thus far - a track record to defend.",
      "The largest parties are both likely to have a horrible time of it. Labour's wide coalition of voters went pop almost as soon as they moved into No 10.",
      "Calm heads in government say it was always going to be thus because of the state of the country when they took over. Sir Keir Starmer even told us on the record he was going to \"have to be unpopular\" \u2013 a curious ambition for a politician!",
      "But more candid insiders admit the government \"looked very unsure\" at the start. \"They didn't come in with a big project,\" one source says, and many voters took a dim view of ministers' freebies and the decision on winter fuel allowance.",
      "Runcorn by-election battle tests Labour nerves",
      "Badenoch warns Tories of difficult local elections",
      "Lib Dems aim to become 'party of Middle England'",
      "Labour loyalists and spin doctors will emphasise what is true \u2013 the elections being fought at council level are \"us fighting in the shires\", as one of them said.",
      "A poor performance in areas that are traditionally Tory, where the party prospered in 2021, won't be a surprise. One cabinet minister says, \"they're just not our heartlands, so we just haven't got our normal base\".",
      "But Labour could also lose mayors and there's no such excuse in what was one of their safest seats, in Runcorn, in the by-election where they could struggle to cling on.",
      "After 10 months in power, next week could show Labour how much the reality of government can really hurt.",
      "The Conservatives have also been falling over themselves to tell you just saying how awful it's going to be for them after they were, in the words of one senior figure, \"absolutely, mercilessly hammered\" back in July.",
      "The leadership says \"nowhere is safe\".  Some sources even warn in private they could lose all of the town halls they control.",
      "The concern behind the very public worry about losing hundreds and hundreds of seats is that \"we might not yet actually have hit the bottom\", in the words of another veteran.",
      "Leader Kemi Badenoch's backers continually say that rebuilding the party is a long-term project, and praise her for managing to draw at least a faint line under the toxic infighting that corroded Conservative ranks in recent years.",
      "The broad sense in Westminster is that dreadful results next week won't usher Badenoch to the door. Still, you'd be hard pressed to find a Conservative who'd happily bet their mortgage she'll definitely be in charge by the time of the next election.",
      "That's in large part because in the words of one Tory bigwig, \"she was working on the basis that it was her versus Starmer but it's not her versus Starmer,  it's her versus Starmer and Farage and Davey\".",
      "This election is pick and mix, with the newest morsels on offer coming from Nigel Farage's Reform UK. They see success in these elections as \"two or three more steps up the staircase\" towards power, says a senior figure.",
      "The other parties report Reform spending big, particularly on online advertising, focusing on national issues like immigration and net zero, and \"putting Farage out to draw a crowd\", according to a minister.",
      "Reform sources scent success. They hope they can nab Runcorn from Labour (although they aren't banking on it), but are more confident of winning mayoral races and of taking plenty of council seats.",
      "But anything less than big wins will undermine their exuberant claim that it's credible to see Farage in No 10 one day \u2013 and possibly, for that matter, give pollsters red faces again.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "Reform might be the loudest group, but they're not the only one making life hard for the big boys. The Lib Dems reckon with a good night they might control more councils than the Tories this time next week \u2013 whether it's Oxfordshire or Wiltshire, Buckinghamshire or other parts of the South West.",
      "Leader Sir Ed Davey's been back in his happy place \u2013 carrying out ever more ridiculous stunts on the campaign trail, meeting hedgehogs, and even waving around packets of British pork chops on TikTok this time, (I'm not making that up).",
      "After July last year, the Lib Dems have a taste for making the Tories miserable, not just for the sake of it, but in the hope of taking out another chunk of their party's traditional infrastructure, in the shape of their county councillors.",
      "And party sources suggest their activists are more motivated, and their numbers even increasing, because of US President Donald Trump.",
      "Lastly, but not least, the Greens want to continue their steady march into council seats across England.",
      "In 2023 they had their best showing in 20 years and took majority control of a council for the first time, adding many more councillors to their number last year.",
      "This time round they want to add to the tally in counties like Shropshire, Gloucestershire and Kent, where they already have bums on seats.",
      "The Green MPs have made less noise than their other newbie rivals at the other end of the spectrum, Reform. So at a time when enthusiasm for the climate agenda has been fading, or at least evolving in both the big main parties, next week the Green Party will want to show it is a growing force.",
      "Any election is also a test of our political parties' campaign machines \u2013 the questions different for each this time round.",
      "For Labour, is it firing on all cylinders after its July triumph? Frankly, it doesn't seem to be running a campaign at full throttle this time, which given the geography of the contests, shouldn't surprise.",
      "For the Conservatives, how much of its once legendary campaigning muscle is left after getting whacked in the summer? Some loyalists are heartened there are still members willing to knock on doors. But a rival campaigner now calls them the \"tumbleweed Tories\", claiming they're nowhere to be seen on the ground.",
      "Both the Lib Dems and the Greens have long been playing effective local ground games, concentrating on building power bases in pockets of the country.",
      "The most acute test perhaps then is for Reform, who have proven time and time again they can make a lot of noise nationally, on air, and increasingly, online.",
      "In five-party politics, many races may be won with a relatively small share of the vote, by tiny margins, that \"sliver here and sliver there\".",
      "These elections are likely to result in real-life evidence of a political idea that's all the rage, that there's \"fragmentation\" among the public, the traditional voting blocs are no more. Excitable columns are already being penned in anticipation, proclaiming that two-party politics is dead.",
      "The splitting of the vote among so many groups also seems likely to leave more councils without any a clear majority.",
      "In that case, they go into what's known as \"no overall control\", so the biggest party needs votes from the others to get their way.",
      "It's likely that will pose the Conservatives with a tricky real-life question after many weeks of troublesome hypothetical arguments: will they, or won't they, work with their arch rivals Reform UK on the ground?",
      "Crucially, if Reform makes its expected big advances, it will for the first time have responsibility for decisions that affect people's lives.  That will be a big achievement.",
      "Both senior Labour and Conservative sources agree privately, as one said, \"the biggest thing to come out of Thursday night is that Reform will have a record to defend\".",
      "Next week the smaller parties are on track to have plenty to celebrate.  If the General Election was branded the \"ABC election \u2013 Anyone But the Conservatives\", maybe next week's ballots will be branded the \"ABB election \u2013 Anyone But the Big parties\".",

      "In nearly 25 years in daily journalism, I have never known another issue quite like it.",
      "The arguments over sex and gender, trans and women's rights have a passion, an anger and often a toxicity on both sides greater in their intensity than those over the Iraq war two decades ago, or Brexit in more recent years.",
      "The abuse and vitriol that fly into my inbox every time I report on it are really quite something.",
      "Last week's decision by the Supreme Court was a landmark moment in this debate, providing the prism through which arguments will now be conducted.",
      "But it won't mark an end to those arguments, as a debate in the Commons on Tuesday evening proved.",
      "The Conservative benches were packed and the Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch, took the unusual decision to answer for her party herself, something she would normally do in response to a statement from the prime minister rather than any other minister.",
      "It was clear why she wanted to do so, displaying a greater confidence and sense of self-assurance than at any point since she became Conservative leader last autumn.",
      "Some of her own MPs have grumbled privately that she has lacked oomph and cut-through in her opening months in the job.",
      "She wasn't lacking oomph this time, arguing the Supreme Court had vindicated what she had long argued, and pretty much saying \"I told you so\" to the Labour Party.",
      "And yes, Labour in recent years, from Sir Keir Starmer down, have been in something of a bind on this issue, frequently tangled in anguish when confronted by questions such as \"Can a woman have a penis?\"",
      "Many senior Labour figures regarded such questions as reductive and trivialising and wanted to be openly thoughtful about the rights of trans people.",
      "They maintain, as do the Conservatives, that they still are, but it is also true that the Labour leadership's position is the opposite of what it was.",
      "The Supreme Court's decision prompts lots of questions about the practicalities of what it concluded \u2013 for organisations large and small, public and private, trans people and others.",

      "The world's rainforests are often referred to as the \"lungs of the earth\".",
      "They store billions of tonnes of carbon and in doing so help to reduce the impacts of climate change.",
      "But with more than one and half trillion trees, measuring exactly how much carbon they store has been virtually impossible, until now.",
      "On Tuesday, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched a first-of-a-kind satellite which uses a special radar system to reveal what lies beneath the canopy.",
      "It is hoped it will help scientists better understand the importance of rainforests in storing carbon and the impact of deforestation.",
      "World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030",
      "Deforestation surges in 2022 despite pledges",
      "The rocket took off from ESA's Kourou station in French Guiana and flying over the Amazon, one of the rainforests it will study.",
      "The satellite on board has been affectionately named \"space brolly\" for its giant 12m diameter antenna which will send out signals.",
      "\"We really want to interrogate these forests. We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.",
      "He said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".",
      "The antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.",
      "\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.",
      "\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.",
      "The 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.",
      "It is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.",
      "Currently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.",
      "\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics.",
      "\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\"",
      "On the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back.",
      "The satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Despite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch.",
      "\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.",
      "Airbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.",
      "L3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.",
      "The team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.",
      "These annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.",
      "\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney.",
      "Another advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.",
      "It is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\"",

      "More than 29,200 hectares (292 sq km or 113 sq miles) has been burnt so far, according to figures from the Global Wildfire Information System, which has recorded burnt area since 2012.",
      "That is more than the previous high of 28,100 hectares for the whole year of 2019.",
      "The prolonged dry, sunny weather in March and early April helped to create ideal conditions for widespread burning, according to researchers.",
      "Wildfires are very common in the UK in early spring, with plenty of dead or dormant vegetation at the end of winter that can dry out quickly.",
      "The switch back to wetter conditions over the past couple of weeks has largely brought an end to the spell of fires for now, but not before reaching record levels.",
      "The figures from the Global Wildfire Information System only capture fires larger than roughly 30 hectares (0.3 sq km).",
      "More than 80 such fires have been detected across the UK since the beginning of the year.",
      "Most fires are deliberately or accidentally started by humans, but favourable weather conditions can make it much easier for fires to ignite and spread quickly.",
      "\"We had an exceptionally dry and sunny March,\" said Will Lang, head of risk and resilience services at the Met Office.",
      "\"This followed quite a wet autumn and winter, which can have the effect of increasing the vegetation that acts as fuel for any fire that does start.\"",
      "A lack of rainfall in March and April can be particularly conducive to fires.",
      "\"The vegetation is coming out of the winter and it has gone dormant, so it's not growing, and therefore it's very dry and doesn't have water,\" explained Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London.",
      "\"Then in the spring, before you start to collect the water into the live tissue, there is a period where it's very flammable.\"",
      "The seven days from 2 to 8 April saw more than 18,000 hectares (180 sq km) burnt, the highest weekly figure on record.",

      "Fires have also been detected by satellite imagery on the Isle of Arran, the Isle of Bute and the Isle of Skye in Scotland, as well as in the Mourne Mountains in south-east Northern Ireland. All occurred in early April.",
      "These early season burns - predominantly grass, heath and shrub fires - have created great strain on fire services, but their ecological impacts can be complicated.",
      "Not all fires, particularly smaller, lower-intensity burns, are necessarily catastrophic to long-term vegetation health.",
      "Certain plants, such as heather, are adapted to fire-prone environments. But increasingly frequent or severe blazes can impair their ability to naturally recover.",
      "Some researchers are concerned about the second peak of the fire season, which typically comes later in the year when temperatures are high and vegetation has dried out again.",
      "\"My number one worry is what is going to happen in the summer,\" said Prof Rein, when \"there are fewer wildfires but they are bigger and they can actually be seriously catastrophic\".",
      "\"You can have 100 [small] wildfires across the whole country and all of them can be handled in one day, or you could have one summer wildfire that actually cannot be stopped in a week and actually goes on to burn houses.\"",
      "The recent widespread burns don't necessarily mean this summer will be a busy fire season.",
      "But scientists expect the UK to see an increase in weather conditions conducive to extreme wildfires in a warming world, even though there's lots of variation from year to year.",
      "A study led by the Met Office found that the extreme \"fire weather\" that helped spread the destructive blazes of July 2022 were made at least six times more likely by human-caused climate change.",
      "Shifts in the way land is used can also play a key role in shaping fire risk.",
      "\"One thing that seems to have consensus is that we are likely to see more fires and possibly worse fires with climate change,\" said Rory Hadden, senior lecturer in fire investigation at the University of Edinburgh.",

      "Butterflies and birds may be particularly prominent, Mr Madge adds.",
      "Some studies suggest warm weather means birds can breed earlier in the year and do not need to incubate their young for as long.",
      "Migratory birds - such as swallows and swifts - that return to the UK because there are more insects to feed on in warmer climes, may be coming back sooner. The Met Office says a swallow was reported in southern England before March this year.",
      "Warm weather can also see butterflies emerge. Hotter days earlier in the year can bring out red admirals, previously an exclusively migratory insect.",

      "Earlier this month, conservationists warned that some of the UK's rarest wildlife is being \"torched alive\" and pushed closer to extinction after weeks of intense grass fires.",
      "Anne McCall, director of RSPB Scotland, says climate change is driving more regular wildfires of greater intensity, and especially so in spring.",
      "\"It is not just vegetation that gets destroyed by wildfire,\" she says. \"This is a critical time of year for our native wildlife \u2013 with birds nesting and other animals such as amphibians and reptiles coming out of winter dormancy and starting to breed.\"",
      "On the coasts, conservation experts say there has been a crop of sightings of whales and dolphins close to British shores \u2013 and though it's difficult to pin down a reason, warming seas and climate change are likely to be a factor.",
      "\"Seeing whales and dolphins in the wild is always an awesome experience but seeing more of them, and more unusual species around UK coast may not be such a good thing,\" says Danny Groves from the charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 23:06:26 GMT",
    "summary": "Climate activists may be going deeper underground.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Justin read this article",
      "Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists are dusting down their placards, digging out their infamous fluorescent orange vests, and charging up their loud hailers \u2014 a routine they have gone through many a time before.",
      "It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads \u2013 for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations.",
      "They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London.",
      "However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start, its existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously.",
      "In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, \"hanging up the hi-viz\" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience.",
      "The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate.",
      "Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a \"joyful celebration\".",
      "\"We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,\" she says.",
      "The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost \u00a320m.",
      "But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action. And there's a bigger strategic question. Despite widespread public concern about the future of the planet, much of the public ended up hostile to JSO. How can the climate movement avoid a repeat of that?",
      "Policed to extinction?",
      "JSO's model involved small groups of committed activists undertaking targeted actions designed to cause maximum disruption or public outrage. But it had strict internal rules. The actions had to be non-violent, and activists had to be held accountable \u2013 they had to wait around to get arrested.",
      "For leaders like Roger Hallam, who was originally jailed for five years for plotting to disrupt traffic on the M25, being seen to be punished was a key part of the publicity.",
      "The police, roused by public anger and hostile media coverage, demanded more powers to stop the \"eco-loons\", as the Sun newspaper dubbed them, and other protesters. And politicians heeded the call.",
      "The biggest change came with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act in 2022. It made \"intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\" a statutory offence. A list of loosely defined actions including causing \"serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity\" were now potentially serious crimes. And that opened up another legal route for the authorities: the charge of conspiracy to intentionally cause public nuisance. Now even planning a potentially disruptive action could bring substantial jail time.",
      "The Public Order Act the following year broadened the police's powers to manage protests and brought in new criminal offences including \"locking on\" to objects, causing serious disruption by tunnelling, and interfering with major infrastructure.",
      "At the same time judges, backed by the higher courts, have blocked the right of protesters to claim they had a \"lawful excuse\" for their actions in the vast majority of protest cases. The Court of Appeal has accepted that the \"beliefs and motivation\" of a defendant are too remote to constitute lawful excuse for causing damage to a property. It means they can no longer argue to juries that their right to splash paint on buildings, sit in the road, or undertake other disruptive activities, is justified by the bigger threat posed by climate change. In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it.",
      "\"We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,\" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon.",
      "David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously \"favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people.\"",
      "The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy.",
      "Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have \"had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe\".",
      "What comes next?",
      "In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability \u2013 they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more.",
      "Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables.",
      "I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore.",
      "\"It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,\" the spokesperson told me. \"Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground.\"",
      "I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works.",
      "This is not the first time protesters in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall.",
      "The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions.",
      "He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people.",
      "\"There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,\" he says.",
      "'Disgruntled people find each other'",
      "Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance \u2013 implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO \u2013 against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies.",
      "The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they \"arrest\" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for.",
      "The group claims to have \"arrested\" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, \"disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,\" she says.",
      "Drawing the line",
      "These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers.",
      "Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed.",
      "But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions.",
      "\"It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,\" he tells me.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority.\"",
      "Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public.",
      "Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way.",
      "But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group.",
      "According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy.",
      "There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO.",
      "Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,\" says Read, \"but that's not the same thing as getting real change.\" They generated a lot of headlines: \"[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause.\"",
      "John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change.",
      "But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. \"I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,\" he says.",
      "His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns.",
      "Public support",
      "XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. \"If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,\" he says.",
      "He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods. The focus will be building support for climate action by focusing on tackling the impacts of extreme weather in local communities.",
      "\"The end game is that we get a situation where the political parties are racing to compete for votes on climate and nature, rather than running away from them,\" explains Read.",
      "Naturalist and presenter Chris Packham believes \"empowering\" voters should be the focus. \"We need a larger number, a larger percentage of our populace, on board when it comes to being able to talk [\u2026] truth to power.\"",
      "But he argues there are real dangers for governments that stifle the voices of those who have legitimate concerns. \"If a government is arrogant enough not to listen to people protesting and they have good grounds for protest [\u2026] there are bound to be those people who say we are going to escalate the protest.\"",
      "He helped organise last year's Restore Nature Now march which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets and was supported by a whole range of nature focused organisations including big charities like the National Trust and RSPB, as well as campaign groups like JSO.",
      "Packham was hoping that by getting a whole range of activists together on a single stage \"they would all see the bigger picture and recognise that there are far more commonalities between them than differences.\"",
      "But peaceful climate action does not get the same attention as non-peaceful action. \"We put between 70,000 and 80,000 people on the streets of London, but because it was a peaceful demonstration made up of kids in fancy dress we didn't get any coverage,\" says Packham.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "The unexpected knock-on effect of Trump's minerals 'deal of the century'",
      "It is in this context that Ms Lunnon of JSO believes new forms of disruptive protest will emerge in time. \"The movement is there and will find new ways to confront the government,\" she says. \"Nobody is shutting up shop and calling it a day.  We know morally that we have to continue.\"",
      "However it is clear that, for now at least, the model that made JSO so notorious is dead.",

      "He was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security in London, which is being attended by delegates from more than 50 governments, including the US and the EU.",
      "Miliband also warned of the risks from energy being \"weaponised\", seen as a reference to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on gas prices.",
      "Delegates will be discussing how to reduce the mounting risks to energy arising from the wars in Europe and the Middle East, the ongoing trade war between the US and China, extreme weather, attacks on undersea cable and cyber warfare.",
      "In his opening remarks, Ed Miliband said he recognised the value of fossil fuels in the energy mix but made clear that, at least for the UK, the future of energy is low-carbon.",
      "He said this was not just to help tackle climate change but also to achieve energy security.",
      "The summit is being co-hosted by the UK and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the BBC ahead of the summit that there was increased \"international fragmentation\" leaving countries unable to solve the biggest risks to energy security.",
      "\"Instead of cooperation, we see countries are really challenging each other. In my view the lasting solution to energy security challenges goes through cooperation among the countries.\"",
      "He did not blame any countries specifically for a breakdown in relations, but energy prices have been particularly impacted by the war in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's recent trade war.",
      "Global gas prices spiked following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and have remained nearly 50% higher than pre-Covid levels.",
      "Europe was initially able to plug the shortage of gas, following sanctions of Russia, by purchasing LNG from the US. But that supply is now under threat as relations between the bloc and President Trump worsen.",
      "The US is attending the summit, which should be seen as a \"success\" according to Mr Birol. But the Trump administration has been highly critical of the global energy watchdog for its promotion of clean energy and forecasting declines in oil and gas.",
      "Many think tanks and researchers have defended the IEA's position.",
      "\"On the big calls \u2013 like the future of global oil demand \u2013 the IEA has consistently proven a more reliable forecaster than fossil fuel companies,\" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO, of the European Climate Foundation",
      "\"As countries come together to shape a new energy security paradigm, they need unbiased, dependable data on the future direction of energy,\" he added.",
      "Miliband also read out a letter from King Charles III.",
      "\"As we all navigate the transition to cleaner energy for our planet and energy security for our citizens, summits such as these are of vital importance in facilitating shared learning between nations, particularly those in the global south and across the Commonwealth,\" King Charles wrote.",
      "The UK government wants 95% of Great Britain's electricity mix to come from clean energy by the end of the decade - currently this stands around 60%.",
      "Miliband told the BBC's R4 Today programme that this would guarantee lower energy bills by 2030.",

      "The findings could provide vital clues in understanding how climate change is affecting Antarctica today.",
      "The scientists searched for fingerprints of giant icebergs using very detailed 3D seismic data, collected by oil and gas companies or wind turbine projects doing ocean surveys.",
      "This is a bit like doing an MRI scan of the sediment layers beneath the present-day seafloor, going back millions of years.",
      "The researchers found deep, comb-like grooves, interpreted to have been created by the keels of large icebergs that broke off the British-Irish ice sheet more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "Some of these scratch marks are as close as 90 miles (145km) to Scotland's present-day east coast.",
      "\"We found [evidence of] these gigantic tabular icebergs, which basically means the shape of a table, with incredibly wide and flat tops,\" said James Kirkham, marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new study, published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "\"These have not been seen before and it shows definitively that the UK had ice shelves, because that's the only way to produce these gigantic tabular icebergs.\"",
      "Ice shelves are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend out into the ocean.",
      "By analysing the size of the grooves, the scientists estimate that these icebergs could be five to tens of kilometres wide and 50-180m thick, although it's difficult to be exact.",
      "That means they would have covered an area roughly as big as medium-sized UK cities like Norwich or Cambridge.",
      "The icebergs are comparable in size to some of the smaller icebergs found off present-day Antarctica, such as blocks that calved from the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002.",
      "Dr Kirkham described seeing such an iceberg when working in Antarctica two years ago.",
      "\"Those of us working on this paper were standing together, gazing out onto this iceberg and thinking, 'Wow, that's probably a similar size iceberg to what was found off the shore of Scotland 18,000 years ago, right in front of us in Antarctica today.'\"",
      "Clues for Antarctica?",
      "Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers.",
      "But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide.",
      "Exactly how this plays out, though, is \"one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise\", Dr Kirkham told BBC News.",
      "That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time.",
      "No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate.",
      "By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period.",
      "The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.",
      "That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.",
      "And it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster.",
      "The crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.",
      "Resolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be.",
      "\"These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,\" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\"But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,\" he argued.",

      "The world's rainforests are often referred to as the \"lungs of the earth\".",
      "They store billions of tonnes of carbon and in doing so help to reduce the impacts of climate change.",
      "But with more than one and half trillion trees, measuring exactly how much carbon they store has been virtually impossible, until now.",
      "On Tuesday, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched a first-of-a-kind satellite which uses a special radar system to reveal what lies beneath the canopy.",
      "It is hoped it will help scientists better understand the importance of rainforests in storing carbon and the impact of deforestation.",
      "World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030",
      "Deforestation surges in 2022 despite pledges",
      "The rocket took off from ESA's Kourou station in French Guiana and flying over the Amazon, one of the rainforests it will study.",
      "The satellite on board has been affectionately named \"space brolly\" for its giant 12m diameter antenna which will send out signals.",
      "\"We really want to interrogate these forests. We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.",
      "He said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".",
      "The antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.",
      "\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.",
      "\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.",
      "The 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.",
      "It is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.",
      "Currently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.",
      "\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics.",
      "\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\"",
      "On the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back.",
      "The satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Despite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch.",
      "\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.",
      "Airbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.",
      "L3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.",
      "The team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.",
      "These annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.",
      "\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney.",
      "Another advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.",
      "It is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 23:06:26 GMT",
    "summary": "Climate activists may be going deeper underground.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Justin read this article",
      "Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists are dusting down their placards, digging out their infamous fluorescent orange vests, and charging up their loud hailers \u2014 a routine they have gone through many a time before.",
      "It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads \u2013 for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations.",
      "They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London.",
      "However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start, its existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously.",
      "In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, \"hanging up the hi-viz\" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience.",
      "The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate.",
      "Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a \"joyful celebration\".",
      "\"We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,\" she says.",
      "The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost \u00a320m.",
      "But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action. And there's a bigger strategic question. Despite widespread public concern about the future of the planet, much of the public ended up hostile to JSO. How can the climate movement avoid a repeat of that?",
      "Policed to extinction?",
      "JSO's model involved small groups of committed activists undertaking targeted actions designed to cause maximum disruption or public outrage. But it had strict internal rules. The actions had to be non-violent, and activists had to be held accountable \u2013 they had to wait around to get arrested.",
      "For leaders like Roger Hallam, who was originally jailed for five years for plotting to disrupt traffic on the M25, being seen to be punished was a key part of the publicity.",
      "The police, roused by public anger and hostile media coverage, demanded more powers to stop the \"eco-loons\", as the Sun newspaper dubbed them, and other protesters. And politicians heeded the call.",
      "The biggest change came with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act in 2022. It made \"intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\" a statutory offence. A list of loosely defined actions including causing \"serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity\" were now potentially serious crimes. And that opened up another legal route for the authorities: the charge of conspiracy to intentionally cause public nuisance. Now even planning a potentially disruptive action could bring substantial jail time.",
      "The Public Order Act the following year broadened the police's powers to manage protests and brought in new criminal offences including \"locking on\" to objects, causing serious disruption by tunnelling, and interfering with major infrastructure.",
      "At the same time judges, backed by the higher courts, have blocked the right of protesters to claim they had a \"lawful excuse\" for their actions in the vast majority of protest cases. The Court of Appeal has accepted that the \"beliefs and motivation\" of a defendant are too remote to constitute lawful excuse for causing damage to a property. It means they can no longer argue to juries that their right to splash paint on buildings, sit in the road, or undertake other disruptive activities, is justified by the bigger threat posed by climate change. In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it.",
      "\"We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,\" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon.",
      "David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously \"favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people.\"",
      "The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy.",
      "Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have \"had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe\".",
      "What comes next?",
      "In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability \u2013 they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more.",
      "Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables.",
      "I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore.",
      "\"It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,\" the spokesperson told me. \"Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground.\"",
      "I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works.",
      "This is not the first time protesters in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall.",
      "The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions.",
      "He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people.",
      "\"There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,\" he says.",
      "'Disgruntled people find each other'",
      "Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance \u2013 implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO \u2013 against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies.",
      "The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they \"arrest\" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for.",
      "The group claims to have \"arrested\" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, \"disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,\" she says.",
      "Drawing the line",
      "These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers.",
      "Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed.",
      "But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions.",
      "\"It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,\" he tells me.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority.\"",
      "Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public.",
      "Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way.",
      "But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group.",
      "According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy.",
      "There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO.",
      "Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,\" says Read, \"but that's not the same thing as getting real change.\" They generated a lot of headlines: \"[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause.\"",
      "John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change.",
      "But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. \"I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,\" he says.",
      "His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns.",
      "Public support",
      "XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. \"If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,\" he says.",
      "He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods. The focus will be building support for climate action by focusing on tackling the impacts of extreme weather in local communities.",
      "\"The end game is that we get a situation where the political parties are racing to compete for votes on climate and nature, rather than running away from them,\" explains Read.",
      "Naturalist and presenter Chris Packham believes \"empowering\" voters should be the focus. \"We need a larger number, a larger percentage of our populace, on board when it comes to being able to talk [\u2026] truth to power.\"",
      "But he argues there are real dangers for governments that stifle the voices of those who have legitimate concerns. \"If a government is arrogant enough not to listen to people protesting and they have good grounds for protest [\u2026] there are bound to be those people who say we are going to escalate the protest.\"",
      "He helped organise last year's Restore Nature Now march which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets and was supported by a whole range of nature focused organisations including big charities like the National Trust and RSPB, as well as campaign groups like JSO.",
      "Packham was hoping that by getting a whole range of activists together on a single stage \"they would all see the bigger picture and recognise that there are far more commonalities between them than differences.\"",
      "But peaceful climate action does not get the same attention as non-peaceful action. \"We put between 70,000 and 80,000 people on the streets of London, but because it was a peaceful demonstration made up of kids in fancy dress we didn't get any coverage,\" says Packham.",

      "It is in this context that Ms Lunnon of JSO believes new forms of disruptive protest will emerge in time. \"The movement is there and will find new ways to confront the government,\" she says. \"Nobody is shutting up shop and calling it a day.  We know morally that we have to continue.\"",
      "However it is clear that, for now at least, the model that made JSO so notorious is dead.",

      "Miliband also warned of the risks from energy being \"weaponised\", seen as a reference to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on gas prices.",

      "He said this was not just to help tackle climate change but also to achieve energy security.",
      "The summit is being co-hosted by the UK and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the BBC ahead of the summit that there was increased \"international fragmentation\" leaving countries unable to solve the biggest risks to energy security.",
      "\"Instead of cooperation, we see countries are really challenging each other. In my view the lasting solution to energy security challenges goes through cooperation among the countries.\"",
      "He did not blame any countries specifically for a breakdown in relations, but energy prices have been particularly impacted by the war in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's recent trade war.",
      "Global gas prices spiked following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and have remained nearly 50% higher than pre-Covid levels.",
      "Europe was initially able to plug the shortage of gas, following sanctions of Russia, by purchasing LNG from the US. But that supply is now under threat as relations between the bloc and President Trump worsen.",
      "The US is attending the summit, which should be seen as a \"success\" according to Mr Birol. But the Trump administration has been highly critical of the global energy watchdog for its promotion of clean energy and forecasting declines in oil and gas.",
      "Many think tanks and researchers have defended the IEA's position.",
      "\"On the big calls \u2013 like the future of global oil demand \u2013 the IEA has consistently proven a more reliable forecaster than fossil fuel companies,\" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO, of the European Climate Foundation",

      "\"These have not been seen before and it shows definitively that the UK had ice shelves, because that's the only way to produce these gigantic tabular icebergs.\"",
      "Ice shelves are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend out into the ocean.",
      "By analysing the size of the grooves, the scientists estimate that these icebergs could be five to tens of kilometres wide and 50-180m thick, although it's difficult to be exact.",
      "That means they would have covered an area roughly as big as medium-sized UK cities like Norwich or Cambridge.",
      "The icebergs are comparable in size to some of the smaller icebergs found off present-day Antarctica, such as blocks that calved from the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002.",
      "Dr Kirkham described seeing such an iceberg when working in Antarctica two years ago.",
      "\"Those of us working on this paper were standing together, gazing out onto this iceberg and thinking, 'Wow, that's probably a similar size iceberg to what was found off the shore of Scotland 18,000 years ago, right in front of us in Antarctica today.'\"",
      "Clues for Antarctica?",
      "Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers.",
      "But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide.",
      "Exactly how this plays out, though, is \"one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise\", Dr Kirkham told BBC News.",
      "That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time.",
      "No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate.",
      "By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period.",
      "The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.",
      "That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.",
      "And it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster.",
      "The crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.",
      "Resolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be.",
      "\"These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,\" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\"But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,\" he argued.",

    "summary": "Skeletons and artefacts unearthed from the site near Cardiff Airport are baffling archaeologists.",
    "story": [
      "A medieval cemetery unearthed near Cardiff Airport is continuing to confound archaeologists, as the mysteries surrounding it are multiplying.",
      "The discovery of the site, dating to the 6th or 7th Century, was announced last year, with dozens of skeletons found lying in unusual positions with unexpected artefacts.",
      "Now researchers have learned nearly all of those buried in the cemetery are women, and while their bones show signs of wear and tear - indicating they carried out heavy manual work - there are also surprising signs of wealth and luxury.",
      "Another unexpected find has been a woman tossed in a ditch, in stark contrast to all  the other people who were buried with great care.",
      "\"Every time we think we understand something, something else crops up and the picture gets more intriguing,\" said Andy Seaman from Cardiff University, who is leading the project.",
      "About half the site, which lies in an unremarkable field in the grounds of Fonmon Castle, has now been excavated.",
      "So far researchers have found 39 adult skeletons lying in graves carved out of the thick limestone bedrock. A full analysis is still ongoing, but it's thought that all apart from one are female.",
      "\"I'm not entirely sure what it means just yet,\" said Dr Seaman.",
      "\"It could be that it's something particular about this community, or it could be that this is perhaps just one cemetery within a broader kind of landscape or it might be that there's more men in another part of the cemetery.\"",
      "The skeletons of two children have also been found - a surprisingly small number given the high infant mortality of the time. Their burials also have some intriguing features.",
      "\"The earth that's been used to backfill the grave looks slightly different to that in the adults' graves,\" explained Dr Marion Shiner, an archaeologist from Cardiff University.",
      "\"It's darker and seems more organic, so potentially some time had elapsed between the burial of the adults and the burial of these two children - it's more mystery.\"",
      "Artefacts at the site are also adding to the puzzle of who these people were.",
      "Shards of pottery and fine, etched glass unearthed in the graves were most likely brought to the cemetery by people feasting while they visited the dead.",
      "\"Glass is rare, and where it is found these are sites of quite significant status,\" said Dr Seaman.",
      "\"It was probably made in the Levant - the Egypt area - and then was manufactured into vessels, we think, in southern France, and probably arrived here alongside wine in barrels.\"",
      "The presence of these items suggest this was no ordinary community. And each person here has been buried with painstaking care, some laid flat, others crouching, all facing from east to west.",
      "The team don't yet know why the woman flung into the ditch was treated so differently, but believe she could have been an outcast or a criminal.",
      "They have taken her bones to the lab at Cardiff University to try to find out more about her.",
      "Osteologist Dr Katie Faillace says she thinks the woman was in her late 30s or early 40s.",
      "Her skeleton shows a healed fracture to her arm, while her tooth was infected and had an abscess, which exposed the roots and must have been painful.",
      "Ten of the skeletons are also now undergoing more detailed analysis.",
      "The results show the people buried in the cemetery aren't all from the immediate area - they come from all over Wales and possibly from the south-west of England too.",
      "Further DNA analysis will also reveal whether any of them were related.",
      "The team are particularly interested in the skeletons' teeth.",
      "Because of the way teeth grow, they provide a unique record of everything someone has eaten from the time they are weaned right through to their death.",
      "\"They've been eating a very consistent diet based on lots of carbs - but not a lot of meat,\" said Dr Faillace. \"And that's true from their childhood into their adulthood, and that's something we're seeing across the population.",
      "\"But there was no fish whatsoever. As soon as the Romans leave, we see an absence of fish signals in the diet. It's one of the big mysteries.\"",
      "The dig is continuing this summer and the archaeologists will start to unearth the other half of the cemetery.",
      "Andy Seaman is hoping to be able to answer the questions the site has thrown up.",
      "\"We're hoping to tell the story of the individuals within the cemetery, but also the broader community,\" he said.",
      "\"We know a lot about the lives of kings and queens, but much less about everyday people. And never before really have we been able to explore a single community in so much detail and all the interesting inter-relationships.\"",
      "But for the moment there are still many contradictions that remain unsolved.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 23:06:26 GMT",
    "summary": "Climate activists may be going deeper underground.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Justin read this article",
      "Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists are dusting down their placards, digging out their infamous fluorescent orange vests, and charging up their loud hailers \u2014 a routine they have gone through many a time before.",
      "It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads \u2013 for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations.",
      "They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London.",
      "However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start, its existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously.",
      "In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, \"hanging up the hi-viz\" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience.",
      "The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate.",
      "Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a \"joyful celebration\".",
      "\"We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,\" she says.",
      "The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost \u00a320m.",
      "But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action. And there's a bigger strategic question. Despite widespread public concern about the future of the planet, much of the public ended up hostile to JSO. How can the climate movement avoid a repeat of that?",
      "Policed to extinction?",
      "JSO's model involved small groups of committed activists undertaking targeted actions designed to cause maximum disruption or public outrage. But it had strict internal rules. The actions had to be non-violent, and activists had to be held accountable \u2013 they had to wait around to get arrested.",
      "For leaders like Roger Hallam, who was originally jailed for five years for plotting to disrupt traffic on the M25, being seen to be punished was a key part of the publicity.",
      "The police, roused by public anger and hostile media coverage, demanded more powers to stop the \"eco-loons\", as the Sun newspaper dubbed them, and other protesters. And politicians heeded the call.",
      "The biggest change came with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act in 2022. It made \"intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\" a statutory offence. A list of loosely defined actions including causing \"serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity\" were now potentially serious crimes. And that opened up another legal route for the authorities: the charge of conspiracy to intentionally cause public nuisance. Now even planning a potentially disruptive action could bring substantial jail time.",
      "The Public Order Act the following year broadened the police's powers to manage protests and brought in new criminal offences including \"locking on\" to objects, causing serious disruption by tunnelling, and interfering with major infrastructure.",
      "At the same time judges, backed by the higher courts, have blocked the right of protesters to claim they had a \"lawful excuse\" for their actions in the vast majority of protest cases. The Court of Appeal has accepted that the \"beliefs and motivation\" of a defendant are too remote to constitute lawful excuse for causing damage to a property. It means they can no longer argue to juries that their right to splash paint on buildings, sit in the road, or undertake other disruptive activities, is justified by the bigger threat posed by climate change. In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it.",
      "\"We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,\" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon.",
      "David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously \"favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people.\"",
      "The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy.",
      "Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have \"had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe\".",
      "What comes next?",
      "In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability \u2013 they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more.",
      "Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables.",
      "I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore.",
      "\"It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,\" the spokesperson told me. \"Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground.\"",
      "I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works.",
      "This is not the first time protesters in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall.",
      "The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions.",
      "He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people.",
      "\"There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,\" he says.",
      "'Disgruntled people find each other'",
      "Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance \u2013 implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO \u2013 against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies.",
      "The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they \"arrest\" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for.",
      "The group claims to have \"arrested\" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, \"disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,\" she says.",
      "Drawing the line",
      "These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers.",
      "Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed.",
      "But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions.",
      "\"It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,\" he tells me.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority.\"",
      "Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public.",
      "Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way.",
      "But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group.",
      "According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy.",
      "There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO.",
      "Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,\" says Read, \"but that's not the same thing as getting real change.\" They generated a lot of headlines: \"[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause.\"",
      "John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change.",
      "But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. \"I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,\" he says.",
      "His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns.",
      "Public support",
      "XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. \"If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,\" he says.",
      "He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods. The focus will be building support for climate action by focusing on tackling the impacts of extreme weather in local communities.",
      "\"The end game is that we get a situation where the political parties are racing to compete for votes on climate and nature, rather than running away from them,\" explains Read.",
      "Naturalist and presenter Chris Packham believes \"empowering\" voters should be the focus. \"We need a larger number, a larger percentage of our populace, on board when it comes to being able to talk [\u2026] truth to power.\"",
      "But he argues there are real dangers for governments that stifle the voices of those who have legitimate concerns. \"If a government is arrogant enough not to listen to people protesting and they have good grounds for protest [\u2026] there are bound to be those people who say we are going to escalate the protest.\"",
      "He helped organise last year's Restore Nature Now march which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets and was supported by a whole range of nature focused organisations including big charities like the National Trust and RSPB, as well as campaign groups like JSO.",
      "Packham was hoping that by getting a whole range of activists together on a single stage \"they would all see the bigger picture and recognise that there are far more commonalities between them than differences.\"",
      "But peaceful climate action does not get the same attention as non-peaceful action. \"We put between 70,000 and 80,000 people on the streets of London, but because it was a peaceful demonstration made up of kids in fancy dress we didn't get any coverage,\" says Packham.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "The unexpected knock-on effect of Trump's minerals 'deal of the century'",
      "It is in this context that Ms Lunnon of JSO believes new forms of disruptive protest will emerge in time. \"The movement is there and will find new ways to confront the government,\" she says. \"Nobody is shutting up shop and calling it a day.  We know morally that we have to continue.\"",
      "However it is clear that, for now at least, the model that made JSO so notorious is dead.",

      "Dame Rachel de Souza said a total ban was needed on apps which allow \"nudification\" - where photos of real people are edited by AI to make them appear naked.",
      "She said the government was allowing such apps to \"go unchecked with extreme real-world consequences\".",
      "A government spokesperson said child sexual abuse material was illegal and that there were plans for further offences for creating, possessing or distributing AI tools designed to create such content.",
      "Deepfakes are videos, pictures or audio clips made with AI to look or sound real.",
      "In a report published on Monday, Dame Rachel said the technology was disproportionately targeting girls and young women with many bespoke apps appearing to work only on female bodies.",
      "Girls are actively avoiding posting images or engaging online to reduce the risk of being targeted, according to the report, \"in the same way that girls follow other rules to keep themselves safe in the offline world - like not walking home alone at night\".",
      "Children feared \"a stranger, a classmate, or even a friend\" could target them using technologies which could be found on popular search and social media platforms.",

      "\"We cannot sit back and allow these bespoke AI apps to have such a dangerous hold over children's lives.\"",
      "It is illegal under the Online Safety Act to share or threaten to share explicit deepfake images.",

      "\"Under the Online Safety Act platforms of all sizes now have to remove this kind of content, or they could face significant fines,\" they added.",

      "Other customers have described having to cancel orders for clothes which they were expecting to collect before going on holiday, or being unable to return goods they had previously bought.",
      "But some have expressed sympathy for the staff at the stores, who they say have been on the receiving end of abuse from angry customers, or having to deal with shopping abandoned at the tills when customers were unable to pay when contactless payments were down.",

      "M&S remains silent on how the cyber attack unfolded, the nature of the attack and how specifically it has been affected by it - leaving cyber security experts to speculate as to what might have happened.",
      "It is known it has hired external cyber security experts, who are likely to be a team of incident response specialists who will be working around the clock either at the headquarters of the company or remotely.",
      "Their first priority is likely to be find out where the hackers are in the IT system and kick them out.",

      "They might also have taken these offline to stop the hackers from spreading their malicious software into those previously unaffected areas.",

    "summary": "Bug hunters make money by funding flaws in software, but AI is changing the way they work.",
    "story": [
      "Few technology careers offer the chance to demonstrate your skills in exclusive venues worldwide, from luxury hotels to Las Vegas e-sports arenas, peers cheering you on as your name moves up the leaderboard and your earnings rack up.",
      "But that's what Brandyn Murtagh experienced within his first year as a bug bounty hunter.",
      "Mr Murtagh got into gaming and building computers at 10 or 11-years-old and always knew \"I wanted to be a hacker or work in security\".",
      "He began working in a security operations centre at 16, and moved into penetration testing at 20, a job that also involved testing the security of clients' physical and computer security: \"I had to forge false identities and break into places and then hack. Quite fun.\"",
      "But in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back.",
      "Internet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash \"bounty\" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s.",
      "Eventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities.",
      "As Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a \"morally agnostic skill set\", bug hunters do have to operate within the law.",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the \"scope\" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate \"hammering\" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money.",
      "The payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. \"We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes.\"",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd mean \"you can use hackers as a force for good,\" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered \u2013 and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one \"we deem very severe\". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.",
      "So, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.",
      "But while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.",
      "Mr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"",
      "Yet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.",
      "Mr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.",
      "\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".",
      "Dr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.",
      "And it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.",
      "But modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.",
      "He says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".",
      "Mr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"",
      "But these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"",
      "But the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.",
      "\"If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws.\"",
      "Dr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but \"I think it's just a matter of time\".",
      "In the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. \"The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe.\"",
      "That is unlikely to put off the bug hunters in the meantime. As Mr De Ceukelaire says: \"Once a hacker, always a hacker.\"",

      "For the first one up - 71-year-old Yunice Abbas - this was done through a \"enqu\u00eate de personnalit\u00e9\", a sort of background report on a person accused of a crime which French courts regularly include in their trials. These reports take in elements of the defendant's family history, behaviour and work to paint a picture of their lives and help jurors make a decision.",

      "The bald, stocky man - who has spent almost a third of his life in jail - has already admitted to his role in the heist, and even wrote a memoir entitled I Held Up Kim Kardashian. The president of the court, David De Pas, suggested that the book shows Abbas was proud of what he did - something Abbas has repeatedly denied.",

      "At the time, Gary worked as a customer service agent in airports for the transport company. His task was to welcome VIPs arriving at Paris airports and escort them through passport and customs checks. Through this job, he met the Kardashians several times.",
      "But he also worked at a caf\u00e9 owned by another defendant, Florus H\u00e9roui, 52, to whom investigators believe Madar passed on information about Kim Kardashian.",

      "Malta's so-called golden passport scheme that lets people become citizens through financial investment is contrary to European law, the EU's top court has ruled.",
      "The EU commission took Malta to court in 2022 over the scheme, which grants foreigners a Maltese passport and thereby the right to live and work in any EU country in return for paying at least \u20ac600,000 (\u00a3509,619), buying or renting property of a certain value, and donating \u20ac10,000 to charity.",

      "Assad al-Nassasra was missing for three weeks until the International Committee of the Red Cross received information he was in Israeli detention.",
      "He was reportedly one of 10 detainees freed at an Israeli border crossing with Gaza on Tuesday.",
      "The Israeli military has not commented. But it had confirmed it was holding Mr Nassasra during a briefing on an internal inquiry into the attack, which identified \"several professional failures\".",

      "At the end of the video, the ambulances are seen having pulled over on the roadside. The sound of gunfire can then be heard just as Radwan gets out of his ambulance. It continues for more than five minutes and Radwan is heard saying his last prayers, before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching.",
      "On 20 April, the military released a summary of its internal inquiry which said the shooting of the 14 PRCS and Civil Defence workers resulted from \"an operational misunderstanding\" by troops from a reconnaissance battalion \"who believed they faced a tangible threat\".",
      "It found the killing of the Unrwa employee meanwhile \"involved a breach of orders during a combat setting\".",
      "The military said the deputy commander of the reconnaissance battalion was dismissed \"due to his responsibilities as the field commander in this incident and for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief\".",

      "\"The results of the occupation's investigation hold the usual fallacious allegations of rescue teams in Gaza being part of Hamas in order to justify the war crime of targeting medical missions in general, and the war crime of attacking teams and vehicles carrying the protected emblems of the Geneva Conventions in particular,\" it said.",

      "One week after a devastating militant attack near the mountain resort of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, the town wears a look of quiet desolation, although tourists have begun trickling back in small numbers.",
      "The main high street, abandoned by visitors last week - with shops shuttered and hotels completely emptied out - is seeing fleeting signs of life again.",
      "Last Tuesday, militants opened fire on people, mostly tourists, who were visiting Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5 km) from Pahalgam, often described as the \"Switzerland of India\".",
      "The attack was one of the deadliest in recent years, devastating the lives of many families and sparking widespread anger in India.",
      "In the days since, tensions between India and Pakistan, which both claim Kashmir in full but administer it only in part, have significantly risen, with each side announcing retaliatory measures against the other.",
      "There is now growing speculation about whether there will be a military response from Delhi. The government in Kashmir has closed down over half the tourist destinations in the valley, as authorities review the security situation and carry out search operations.",
      "While violence has often broken out in the region, with militants targeting security forces and civilians since an insurgency broke out in 1989, the brazen killing of tourists has been rare and has shocked local businesses and tourists alike.",
      "Tourism is a mainstay of the economy in places like Pahalgam and there's now fear that many livelihoods might be irrevocably hit.",
      "At a \"selfie point\" outside town, overlooking lush meadows and a rushing river, Akshay Solanki, a tourist from Mumbai, said there was \"panic\" among his group of travellers on the day of the attack. But they had decided to continue with their journey because flights back home had become unaffordable.",
      "Other tourists said constant reassurances from the locals and security forces had given them a sense of comfort. A driver who had brought visitors from the capital, Srinagar, told BBC Hindi that he was pleading with those visiting not to \"distance\" themselves from Kashmir.",
      "After a washout three days, shawl-seller Rafi Ahmed said he'd managed to sell just a few pieces and feared for his livelihood in the long run if tourists stopped coming.",
      "Among those exhorting tourists to come to Pahalgam was Bollywood actor Atul Kulkarni, who visited the town days after the attack. He told BBC Hindi, if the message from the militants was \"don't come here, we should respond by coming in even larger numbers\".",
      "\"Don't cancel bookings, cancel your other plans and come here,\" Kulkarni said.",
      "But uncertainty and apprehension loom large in Pahalgam and it could take several years before a sense of normalcy is restored, local business owners and residents told the BBC.",
      "Indian authorities have launched combing operations in the region, detaining hundreds of people and destroying homes belonging to alleged militants.",
      "India and Pakistan have also reportedly exchanged small arms fire across the border.",
      "The escalation in tensions is keeping tourists and business owners on tenterhooks.",
      "Indian authorities have often claimed Kashmir witnessed a period of relative peace after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked its autonomous status in 2019. Ahead of India's general elections in 2024, Modi hailed the \"freedom\" that had come to the region, saying Kashmir was touching new heights of development because it was breathing freely.",
      "Top leaders pointed to high tourism numbers - some 23 million last year and millions more in the years before - as proof of a big boom after years of unquiet. But last week's attacks have, yet again, shattered any idea of lasting peace in the restive valley.",
      "\"This [attack] is a blot on us\u2026How we wipe it off is a long-term concern,\" Rafi Ahmed Meer, a politician from Pahalgam told BBC Hindi, urging tourists to remember that it was local Kashmiris who rushed to help after the attacks, even picking up bodies.",
      "The cancellation rate for trips planned from cities like Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru are very high, Abhishek Sansare, a Mumbai-based tour operator told the BBC. A group of prominent tour operators said in a press conference that some 80-90% of all bookings had been cancelled.",
      "\"After the attack, there's a sense that a war is looming. So tourists are confused about what to do,\" said Sansare. \"Some of those who've already made advance bookings are going ahead with their plans. I'm also going there on the 2nd of next month.\"",
      "The attack on tourists is also likely to weigh on Kashmir in other ways. The inauguration of the world's highest single-arch rail bridge, set to connect the Kashmir valley with the rest of India was slated to happen this month after several delays.",
      "The timeline for the opening of this showpiece project now \"looks uncertain\", a source told the BBC.",
      "The region was just beginning to attract fledgling business investments, but those too could dry up if hostilities go up.",
      "\"People who were investing in logistics and other sectors will now think twice because of the security environment. Until they regain some confidence, I don't foresee investments coming to Kashmir immediately,\" said Ubair Shah, who owns one of Kashmir's largest cold storage facilities for fruits in Pulwama district in south Kashmir.",
      "As the region continues to boil over, local leaders have expressed deep anguish to the families who lost their loved ones.",
      "In an impassioned speech in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly on Monday, the state's chief minister and tourism minister Omar Abdullah paid tributes to the victims by reading out names of all the 26 people.",
      "He said people from every part of the country had come under attack, and while they'd come to Kashmir at his invitation he could not ensure their safe return.",
      "\"I had no words to apologise to them. What could I say to the children who saw their father drenched in blood? To the widow of the navy officer who was married barely a few days ago?",
      "\"Some people told me they'd come to Kashmir for the first time, but will have to pay for their holiday life long,\" he said, adding that the attack had \"hollowed out\" Kashmir."

      "It said the strikes had \"killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders\", including senior officials overseeing missile and drone programmes.",

      "Most of them are intending to cross into neighbouring Saudi Arabia to find work. Instead, they face exploitation, detention, violence, and dangerous journeys through active conflict zones, according to the IOM.",
      "In 2024 alone, it says, almost 60,900 migrants arrived in the country, often with no means to survive. The majority of them are Ethiopians and Somalis.",
      "Thousands of migrants are thought to be held in detention centres like the one in Saada, but there are no official statistics from the Houthi-run authorities. Rights groups say detainees experience dire conditions, including overcrowding, abuse and poor sanitation.",
      "Earlier this month, the Houthi-run government said a series of US air strikes on the Ras Isa oil terminal on the Red Sea coast killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others. It said the terminal was a civilian facility and that the strikes constituted a \"war crime\".",
      "Centcom said the attack destroyed the ability of Ras Isa to accept fuel and that it would \"begin to impact Houthi ability to not only conduct operations, but also to generate millions of dollars in revenue for their terror activities\".",
      "Last month, Trump ordered large-scale strikes on areas controlled by the Houthis and threatened that they would be \"completely annihilated\". He also warned Iran not to arm the group - something it has repeatedly denied doing.",
      "On Sunday, Centcom said it would \"continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region\".",
      "On Monday evening, the Houthis' military spokesman said its forces had retaliated for the US \"aggression and massacres against civilians\" by targeting the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier battle group with \"a number of cruise and ballistic missiles and drones\".",
      "He also said the group had launched a drone towards the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon. Israel's military announced earlier that it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen.",
      "Since November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.",
      "The Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.",
      "The Houthis were not deterred by the deployment of Western warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to protect merchant vessels last year, or by multiple rounds of US strikes on military targets ordered by former President Joe Biden.",
      "After taking office in January, Trump redesignated the Houthis as a \"Foreign Terrorist Organisation\" - a status the Biden administration had removed due to what it said was the need to mitigate the country's humanitarian crisis.",
      "Yemen has been devastated by a civil war, which escalated in 2015 when the Houthis seized control of the country's north-west from the internationally-recognised government, and a Saudi-led coalition supported by the US intervened in an effort to restore its rule.",
      "The fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered a humanitarian disaster, with 4.8 million people displaced and 19.5 million - half of the population - in need of some form of aid."

      "It follows the death of Pope Francis who died at the age of 88 on Easter Monday and whose funeral was held on Saturday.",
      "There is no timescale as to how long it will take to elect the next pope, but the previous two conclaves, held in 2005 and 2013, lasted just two days.",

      "Authorities said 140,000 people had lined the streets, clapping and waving as the hearse - a repurposed white popemobile - crossed the Tiber river and drove past some of Rome's most recognisable sights: the Colosseum, the Forum and the Altare della Patria national monument on Piazza Venezia.",

    "story": [
      "A child has damaged a painting worth millions of pounds by the American artist Mark Rothko at a museum in Rotterdam.",
      "A spokesperson for the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen said it was considering the \"next steps\" for the treatment of Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8.",
      "The damage occurred during an \"unguarded moment\", a museum spokesperson told the Dutch media outlet Algemeen Dagblad (AD) last week.",
      "A spokesperson for the museum told the BBC the damage was \"superficial\", adding: \"Small scratches are visible in the unvarnished paint layer in the lower part of the painting\".",
      "The abstract painting is estimated to be worth up to \u20ac50m (\u00a342.5m), according to newspaper AD.",
      "\"Conservation expertise has been sought in the Netherlands and abroad. We are currently researching the next steps for the treatment of the painting\", the museum spokesperson told the BBC.",
      "\"We expect that the work will be able to be shown again in the future,\" they added.",
      "Sophie McAloone, the conservation manager at the Fine Art Restoration Company, said that \"modern unvarnished\" paintings like Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 are \"particularly susceptible to damage\".",
      "This is \"owing to a combination of their complex modern materials, lack of a traditional coating layer, and intensity of flat colour fields, which make even the smallest areas of damage instantly perceptible,\" she said.",
      "\"In this case, scratching of the upper paint layers can have a significant impact on the viewing experience of the piece,\" Ms McAloone said.",
      "The Rothko painting was hanging in the museum's Depot \u2013 a publicly accessible storage facility beside the main museum \u2013 as part of an exhibition displaying a selection of \"public favourites\" from the gallery's collection.",
      "Jonny Helm, a marketing manager at the art restoration service Plowden & Smith, said the incident had implications for UK institutions such as V&A East and the British Museum, which are considering \"opening up the display of things that would otherwise be obscured in archives.\"",
      "\"How will this event affect other UK institutions who are opening up their archives in the same way?\" Mr Helm said.",
      "Restoring a Rothko painting is a difficult task because \"Rothko's mixture of pigments and resins and glues were quite complex\", Mr Helm said.",
      "He said the fact the painting is unvarnished \u2013 meaning it is \"open to the environment\" \u2013 will pose an additional challenge to conservators.",
      "Conservators working to restore the painting will now likely be in the process of documenting the extent of the damage and researching \"historic successful treatments\" of Rothko paintings.",
      "\"Rothko works seem to have terrible luck \u2013 this isn't the first damaged Rothko we've heard about,\" Mr Helm said.",
      "Rothko's 1958 work, Black on Maroon, was deliberately vandalised by Wlodzimierz Umaniec at London's Tate Modern gallery in October 2012.",
      "Umaniec was sent to prison for two years and subsequently apologised for his actions.",
      "During his trial, prosecuting barrister Gregor McKinley said the cost of repairing the work would be about \u00a3200,000. It took conservators 18 months to repair the painting.",
      "Rachel Myrtle, Head of Specie and Fine Arts at Aon, a company that offers insurance broking to its clients, said fine art insurance policies typically cover \"all risks associated with physical loss and damage to artwork\".",
      "This includes \"accidental damage caused by children or visitors, albeit with certain exclusions\", she said.",
      "She said that when an artwork is damaged, a gallery's insurer will appoint a specialist fine art loss adjuster to visit the museum.",
      "The loss adjustor typically \"reviews the damage to the artwork, examines any CCTV footage to determine the exact cause of the loss, and assesses conservation options\", Ms Myrtle said.",
      "The museum did not comment on who will be held liable for the damage to the 1960 painting, which the gallery reportedly bought in the 1970s.",
      "The Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen has previously billed visitors who have caused damage to artworks on display.",
      "In 2011, the museum asked an unsuspecting tourist who stepped on Wim T. Schippers' peanut butter floor artwork, called Pindakaasvloer, to pay for repairs to the work.",
      "Sharon Cohen, a spokesperson for the museum at the time, was quoted by AD as saying: \"It is normal procedure for people to pay if they damage art.\"",
      "The Rothko painting is described by the museum as an example of colour field painting, a term used to describe art characterised by large blocks of flat, solid colour spread across a canvas.",
      "Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 painting is one of several works of modern art that have been damaged in the Netherlands in recent years.",
      "In November 2024, multiple screen prints by the US pop artist Andy Warhol were damaged by thieves during an attempted robbery of the MPV art gallery in the town of Oisterwijk.",

      "In August last year, a four-year-old boy accidentally smashed a 3,500-year-old jar into pieces at the Hecht Museum in Israel.",
      "At the time, Hecht Museum worker Lihi Laszlo told the BBC the museum would not treat the incident \"with severity\" because \"the jar was accidentally damaged by a young child\".",

    "summary": "The Spanish grid operator said the preliminary assessment suggests there was no cyber attack.",
    "story": [
      "The Spanish grid operator has ruled out a cyber attack as the cause of a massive power cut that crippled Spain, Portugal and parts of France on Monday.",
      "Red El\u00e9ctrica's operations director Eduardo Prieto said preliminary findings suggest \"there was no kind of interference in the control systems\" to imply an attack, echoing Portuguese Prime Minister Lu\u00eds Montenegro the day before.",
      "But the exact reason behind the cut is still unclear.",
      "The grid operator said on Tuesday they \"cannot draw conclusions\" until they get concrete data. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said investigators were trying to pinpoint the cause, and then would take all necessary measures \"to ensure that this does not happen again.\"",
      "Information is trickling out about what happened at the time of the cut, leading to theories about what could have caused it. Experts told the BBC it was likely caused by several failures.",
      "Here is what we know and what questions remain unanswered.",
      "Follow live: Travel chaos continues",
      "Was the power cut caused by renewable energy?",
      "S\u00e1nchez on Monday evening said 15GW of power - the equivalent to 60% of demand at that time - was \"suddenly lost from the system... in just five seconds\".",
      "Mr Prieto said during a news conference on Tuesday that there were two \"disconnection events\" barely a second apart in the south-west of Spain, where there is substantial solar power generation.",
      "One issue that the Spanish grid operator may have been referring to was when power companies identify a mismatch of supply and demand for electricity that could lead to instability, and disconnect temporarily in order to protect their systems.",
      "However, S\u00e1nchez later said the power cut was \"not a problem of excessive renewables\". He said there was not a failure of coverage - meaning supply - and there was a relatively low demand for electricity that was quite normal in the days running up to the crisis.",
      "So what exactly happened? It is unclear, especially as many systems fail in electricity supply quite frequently, not only renewables, and outages on this scale happen somewhere in the world around once a year on average.",
      "The mismatch between supply and demand of electricity can change the frequency of the electricity grid, which is 50Hz in Europe and the UK.",
      "If that frequency changes out of a narrow range, it could lead to damage to equipment.",
      "\"When a big company detects that the frequency is moving out of their tolerance, they can go offline to protect their equipment,\" said Prof Hannah Christensen at the University of Oxford.",
      "If lots of companies do that in quick succession, it can have \"cascading effects\" and lead to a black-out, she added.",
      "But when it comes to renewables, operators have very accurate short-term weather forecasts to predict when there will be a surplus of wind of solar power, so they adjust power supply accordingly, Prof Christensen said.",
      "Renewable power has different challenges to fossil fuel energy \"because of its intermittency\", she said, but it is a well-known issue that is planned for.",
      "\"It is a little perplexing that this wouldn't have been predicted,\" she said.",
      "Prof Keith Bell, at the University of Strathclyde, added that \"if a system is relying on solar and wind, they design a system to reflect that,\" suggesting that the additional supply of energy from renewables will not have been a surprise to the grid.",
      "\"Spain has a lot of experience of wind and solar, and a long-standing system of forecasting weather and its impacts,\" he said.",
      "\"All sorts of systems fail,\" he added. \"Things can and do go wrong, whether that is from renewables, fossil fuels or nuclear power. This could be the Swiss cheese model, where the holes in the system have happened to align.\"",
      "Was it related to Spain's connection to France?",
      "Red El\u00e9ctrica also suggested that the drop of power caused a grid interconnection between Spain and France to trip.",
      "Two basic technologies are used to interconnect parts of a grid or countries - a standard transmission line that carries alternating currents, and increasingly, high voltage direct current lines.",
      "Spain has a high voltage line that came into service seven years ago, meaning it is well-tested, Prof Bell said.",
      "The Iberian peninsula is often referred to as an \"electricity island\" because it relies on just a few connections through the Pyrenees to France, meaning it can be vulnerable to failures.",
      "S\u00e1nchez said power was brought back online thanks to connections with France and Morocco as well as gas and hydropower sources.",
      "Was it linked to a 'rare atmospheric event'?",
      "Portugal's grid operator REN refuted initial reports, attributed to the agency on Monday, which said the blackout was caused by a rare atmospheric event.",
      "The message in Portuguese said that \"due to extreme temperature variations in the interior or Spain, there were anomalous oscillations in the very high voltage lines (400 KV), a phenomenon known as 'induced atmospheric vibration'\".",
      "\"These oscillations caused synchronisation failures between the electrical systems, leading to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network.\"",
      "However, REN spokesman Bruno Silva told AFP on Tuesday that the grid operator \"did not put out this statement,\" without giving further details.",

    "summary": "Mark Carney's party pull off an election win that once looked near-impossible, until the US president targeted Canada.",
    "story": [
      "Mark Carney and the Liberal Party have claimed a remarkable victory in the Canadian election \u2013 and it appears to have come with a big assist from Donald Trump.",
      "The US president's constant badgering of America's northern neighbour and taunts about making it the 51st US state since his return to office in January coincided with a dramatic reversal in fortune for the centre-left party.",
      "Carney has been almost singularly focused on his neighbour, and this was reflected in his victory speech. After warning that the US wanted Canada's land and resources, Carney declared: \"President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.\"",
      "Until Trump's return to power, Pierre Poilievre's Conservative Party had held what looked like high and insurmountable ground in voter preference polls amidst general dissatisfaction with the state of the Canadian economy and almost a decade of Liberal government under then leader Justin Trudeau.",
      "The past year has been devastating for incumbent governments around the world, with parties all along the political spectrum losing ground or outright control \u2013 with the US, UK, Japan, Germany, France and India among the most prominent examples.",
      "This Canadian general election broke that trend, as the Liberals forced Trudeau to resign and picked a political outsider, former Bank of England chief Carney, as their leader.",
      "He ran hard against what the party continuously characterised as the real threat Trump posed not just to their economy but also to Canada's very sovereignty.",

      "No one should expect those Liberals to say thank you to the American leader, however \u2013 or for Trump to soften his rhetoric, even though last month he said he preferred a Liberal prime minister. (He would go on to say that he really didn't care who won.)",
      "Instead, more of the same is the likely result \u2013 more pointed quips about Canada joining the US, more threats of a trade war and more willingness to cast longstanding ties and agreements with America's northern neighbour into doubt.",
      "The irony, however, is that Trump's derisive focus on Canada may have denied him a northern neighbour run by, if not a kindred spirit, at least a politician more in line with his populist conservative priorities than Liberal Carney.",
      "While Poilievre, a veteran politician, will never be mistaken for the American businessman-turned-president, they have some similarities \u2013 a goal of shrinking government, lowering taxes and trimming social services, a desire to promote fossil fuel production, and a distaste for what they both deride as \"woke\" leftist culture.",
      "A Conservative victory in this election would have been viewed by many \u2013 in America and throughout the world \u2013 as a new sign that the Trump win last year was more than just a singular American event. It would have represented what many in Trump's orbit like to believe is a global movement toward their brand of culturally conservative, anti-elite, anti-immigration, and pro-working-class politics.",
      "Although Trump doesn't appear to have the same distaste for Carney that he clearly held for Trudeau, his political and policy interests and those of Canada now appear destined to continue to diverge.",
      "Already there are indications that Canada is looking more toward Europe as a reliable partner, rather than Trump's America \u2013 a move that is sure to irk the American leader.",
      "Carney has pledged to quickly begin new trade negotiations with Trump in an attempt to stave off US tariffs on Canadian auto exports set to kick in on 3 May.",
      "The Canadian economy, which heavily depends on exports to the US, is at considerable risk if a full trade war erupts, and Carney \u2013 an economist by training and a veteran central banker - has promised voters that he will do everything in his power to keep Canada from tumbling into a recession.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump belly-flopped into Canadian politics one more time on Monday, while voters were casting their ballots, again calling the US-Canadian border \"artificially drawn\" and saying the nation would be better off as a \"cherished\" American state.",
      "Carney ascended to political power quite suddenly, at a time when his country is facing a generational challenge from its superpower neighbour. Many world leaders are still working out how to deal with Donald Trump in his second term, but few will face this kind of test."

      "It was not until 11:15 (09:15 GMT) on Tuesday, almost 23 hours after the system collapsed that Spain's electricity grid declared it was back to normal.",
      "The trains have started running again although some lines are suspended and most homes have got their power back.",
      "So how did it get back up and running and why did it take so long?",
      "For most of Monday, Spain was in chaos.",
      "The issue appears to relate to two separate connection problems in the south west within moments of each other and then a disconnection from the French network for almost an hour.",
      "Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez highlighted the sudden loss of 15 gigawatts of electricity at 12:33 on Monday, when about 60% of Spain's power generation suddenly vanished.",

      "Only the Canary Islands, the Balearics and Ceuta and Melilla on the North African coast were unaffected.",
      "An increasing number of public figures are blaming a saturation of solar power and an over-reliance on renewable energy.",

      "However diversified and advanced Spain's energy mix is, the national power collapse at 12:35 on Monday required an enormous effort to get Spain back up and running.",
      "The initial focus was to get the northern and southern power generating regions working again, which grid operator Red El\u00e9ctrica said was key to \"gradually re-energising the transmission grid as the generating units are connected\".",
      "The risk lay in overloading the system by turning everything on at the same time and triggering another massive outage.",
      "So everything had to be carefully phased for what experts call a \"black start\" working out as a success.",
      "The initial focus was on hydro-electric plants, in particular pumped-storage plants  with reservoirs full at this time of year and able to produce electricity fast from a standing start.",
      "Combined-cycle gas plants also played a significant part in repowering the grid, but four nuclear power reactors at Almaraz, Asc\u00f3 and and Vandell\u00f3s were automatically shut down by the outage, and three others were already offline anyway.",
      "Spain's neighbours France and Morocco also came to its aid.",
      "Morocco said 900MW of power had been transferred through two high-voltage lines that cross the Strait of Gibraltrar from Fardioua to Tarifa in southern Spain.",
      "French operator RTE said it had been \"gradually transferring more electricity to the Spanish border\" via its power lines supplying Catalonia in north-east Spain and the Basque country in the north-west.",
      "RTE said the Iberian network had been disconnected from 12:38 to 13:30 on Monday, when the 400kV line to Catalonia was restored. Within minutes, France had supplied 700MW and RTE said it was later able to increase that by up to 2,000 MW.",
      "Power was then eventually restored to Spain's electricity substations in the north, south and west of the peninsula.",
      "By 19:20 on Monday, the grid operator said more than a fifth of demand had been restored by way of Spain's own electricity generation and from France.",
      "Electricity provider Endesa said it had restored almost 3.5 million customers by 19:15 and had prioritised hospitals and other strategic infrastructure.",
      "Just over an hour later the head of Red El\u00e9ctrica boss Eduardo Prieto said about 9,200 MW of demand - about 35.1% - had been restored.",

    "summary": "Historians say there were three popes of North African descent, the last one more than 1,500 years ago.",
    "story": [
      "Now predominantly Muslim, North Africa was once a Christian heartland, producing Catholic popes who left their mark on the Church to this day.",
      "Their papacies were in the era of the Roman Empire, which stretched across modern-day Tunisia, the north-east of Algeria and the coast of western Libya.",
      "\"North Africa was the Bible Belt of ancient Christianity,\" says Prof Christopher Bellitto, a historian at Kean University in the US.",
      "Many Catholics in Africa are hoping that the papacy will return to the continent  for the first time in more than 1,500 years, as a successor to Pope Francis is chosen.",
      "Here, we look at the three previous African popes - and how they got Christians to celebrate Easter Sunday and St Valentine's Day.",
      "All three have been recognised in the Church as saints.",
      "Victor I (189-199)",
      "Thought to be of Berber origin, Pope Victor I was in charge of the Catholic Church at a time when Christians were sometimes being persecuted by Roman officials for refusing to worship Roman gods.",
      "He is perhaps best known for ensuring Christians celebrate Easter on a Sunday.",
      "In the 2nd Century, some Christian groups from the Roman province of Asia (in modern-day Turkey) celebrated Easter on the same day that Jews celebrated Passover, which could fall on different days of the week.",
      "However, Christians in the Western part of the Empire believed that Jesus was resurrected on a Sunday, so Easter should always be celebrated on that day.",
      "The debate over when the resurrection took place made it an extremely contentious issue.",
      "The \"Easter controversy\" was symbolic of larger conflicts between East and West, and whether or not Christians should follow Jewish practices.",
      "Victor I called the very first Roman Synod - a gathering of Church leaders - to resolve the impasse.",
      "He did this by threatening to excommunicate from the Church those bishops who refused to comply with his wishes.",
      "\"He was a rather forceful voice for getting everyone on literally the same page,\" Prof Bellitto told the BBC.",
      "This was an impressive feat, the historian said, because \"he was the Bishop of Rome when Christianity was illegal in the Roman empire.\"",
      "Another important part of Victor I's legacy was to introduce Latin as the common language of the Catholic Church. Previously Ancient Greek was the primary language of the Catholic Liturgy as well as official communication for the Church.",
      "Victor I himself wrote in - and spoke - Latin, which was widely spoken in North Africa.",
      "Miltiades (AD311-314)",
      "Pope Miltiades is believed to have been born in Africa.",
      "During his reign, Christianity gained increasing acceptance from successive Roman emperors, eventually becoming the Empire's official religion.",
      "Before this, the persecution of Christians had been widespread at different points in the Empire's history.",
      "However, Prof Bellitto pointed out that Miltiades was not responsible for this change, saying the Pope was the \"recipient of the Roman benevolence\" rather than being a great negotiator.",
      "Miltiades was given a palace by the Roman Emperor Constantine, becoming the first pope to have an official residence.",
      "He was also granted permission by Constantine to build the Lateran Basilica, now the oldest public church in Rome.",
      "While modern popes live and work in the Vatican, the Lateran church is sometimes referred to in Catholicism as \"the mother of all churches\".",
      "Gelasius I (AD492-496)",
      "Gelasius I is the only one of the three African popes who historians believe was not born in Africa.",
      "\"There's a reference to him being... Roman-born. So we don't know if he [ever] lived in North Africa, but it seems clear that he was of North African descent,\" Prof Bellitto explained.",
      "He was the most important of the three African church leaders, according to Prof Bellitto.",
      "Gelasius I is widely recognised as the first pope to officially be called the \"Vicar of Christ\", a term that signifies the Pope's role as Christ's representative on Earth.",
      "He also developed the Doctrine of the Two Swords, which emphasised the separate-but-equal powers of the Church and the state.",
      "Gelasius I made the critical distinction that both powers were given to the Church by God, who then delegated earthly power to the state, making the Church ultimately superior.",
      "\"Later on, in the Middle Ages, popes sometimes tried to veto the selection of an emperor or a king, because they said God gave them that power,\" said Prof Bellitto.",
      "Gelasius I is remembered, too, for his response to the Acacian Schism - a split between the Eastern and Western Christian Churches from 484 to 519.",
      "During this period, Gelasius I asserted the supremacy of Rome and the papacy over the entire Church, East and West, which experts believe went further than any of his predecessors.",
      "Gelasius is also responsible for a popular celebration which is still marked every year - establishing St Valentine's Day on 14 February in 496 to commemorate the Christian martyr St Valentine.",
      "Some accounts say Valentine was a priest who continued to perform weddings in secret when they were banned by Emperor Claudius II.",
      "Historians believe that Valentine's Day is rooted in the Roman love and fertility festival, Lupercalia, and was a move by Gelasius I to Christianise pagan traditions.",
      "What did Africa's popes look like?",
      "Prof Bellitto says there is no way of knowing with any degree of accuracy what the three popes looked like.",
      "\"We have to remember that the Roman Empire, and indeed the Middle Ages, didn't think of race as we think of it nowadays. It had nothing to do with skin colour,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"People in the Roman Empire didn't deal with race, they dealt with ethnicity.\"",
      "Prof Philomena Mwaura, an academic at Kenya's Kenyatta University, told the BBC that Roman Africa was very multicultural, with local Berber and Punic groups, freed slaves and people who had come from Rome found there.",
      "\"The North African community was quite mixed, and it was a trade route also for many people who were involved in trade in the earlier antiquity,\" she explained.",
      "Rather than identifying with specific ethnic groups, \"most people who belonged to areas within the Roman Empire regarded themselves as Roman\", Prof Mwaura added.",

      "Who will be the next Pope?",
      "How a Pope is elected",
      "Why the conclave is so unpredictable",
      "Why hasn't there been an African pope since?",
      "None of of the 217 popes since Gelasius I are believed to have come from Africa.",
      "\"The church in North Africa was weakened by very many forces, including the fall of the Roman Empire and also the incursion of Muslims [into North Africa] in the 7th Century,\" Prof Mwaura said.",
      "However, some experts argue that the prevalence of Islam in North Africa does not explain the absence of a pope from the entire continent over more than 1,500 years.",
      "Prof Bellitto said the process of electing a new pontiff became an \"Italian monopoly\" for many years.",
      "However, he said there was a strong chance of a pope from Asia or Africa in the near future because Catholics in the southern hemisphere outnumber those in the north.",
      "In fact, Catholicism is expanding more rapidly in sub-Saharan Africa today than anywhere else.",
      "The latest figures show there were 281 million Catholics in Africa in 2023. This accounts for 20% of the worldwide congregation.",
      "Three Africans are in the race to succeed Pope Francis - the Democratic Republic of Congo's Fridolin Ambongo Besungu, Ghana's Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson and Guinea's Robert Sarah.",
      "But Prof Mwaura argued that \"although Christianity is very strong in Africa, the power of the Church is still in the north, where the resources have been\".",
      "\"Maybe, as it continues to be very strong within the continent and supporting itself, then a time will come when there could be an African pope,\" she said.",

      "The head of Israel's Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency has resigned.",
      "Ronen Bar made the announcement that he would leave his position on 15 June at a memorial event for Shin Bet members who have died in service.",
      "It came after he had been engaged in a fierce trading of recriminations with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who dismissed him last month. A challenge to the Supreme Court by the attorney general and the opposition had put the move on hold.",
      "Ronen Bar said he had chosen to announce his resignation on an evening that, in his words, symbolised \"remembrance, heroism and sacrifice\".",
      "He said every public servant who failed to stop the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, which triggered the Gaza war, needed to bow their heads \"humbly before those who were killed, or wounded, or taken hostage, and act accordingly\".",
      "On Sunday, Netanyahu presented an affidavit to the Supreme Court in which he accused Bar of being a liar.",
      "In his own affidavit, the Shin Bet chief had accused the prime minister of demanding excessive personal loyalty and ordering his agency to spy on anti-government protesters.",
      "The confrontation has further exposed the deepening rifts in Israeli politics and society between the right-wing and hardliners supporting Netanyahu and the more liberal elements in the country, who took to the streets to protest against the government's moves to curb the powers of the judiciary for many months before the 7 October attacks.",
      "It centres on Netanyahu's insistence that he fired the Shin Bet head for professional failures.",
      "Bar countered by saying that his dismissal was motivated by political and personal considerations.",
      "In his affidavit last week, the spy chief said that it was \"clear\" that if there were to be a constitutional crisis, Netanyahu would expect him to obey the prime minister and not the courts.",
      "He also said Netanyahu had put pressure on him to use the Shin Bet to spy on Israelis leading or providing financial support to anti-government protests.",
      "Many in Israel reacted with alarm, saying it was evidence of what appeared to be an unprecedented effort to overstep the powers of the domestic intelligence agency.",
      "In his affidavit, which functioned as a form of rebuttal, Netanyahu excoriated the Shin Bet head.",
      "\"The accusation according to which I allegedly demanded action against innocent civilians, or against a non-violent and legitimate protest during the protests of 2023, is an absolute lie,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu also trained his sights on the security failures in the lead-up to and during the 7 October attacks, saying that Bar bore \"massive and direct responsibility\" for them and had \"failed in his role as chief of Shin Bet and lost the confidence of the entire Israeli government as far as his ability to continue to manage the organisation\".",

      "The Supreme Court was facing a quandary over who to believe - which Bar's resignation may have to some extent pre-empted.",
      "However, Bar made clear on Monday that he would play a part, if necessary, in any future proceedings.",

      "The issues which have been exposed in the fierce recriminations between the two men have once again focused attention on the increasing bitterness between opposed sections of Israeli society.",
      "These have been further exacerbated by the ever-growing fault line between those who support Netanyahu and his hard-line government in wanting to continue the war in Gaza to eliminate Hamas at all costs, and those who believe the fate of the living Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas must be put first, even if it means ending the war.",

    "story": [
      "When is a ceasefire a genuine attempt to secure peace? And when is it simply PR?",
      "It's a question that's been asked a lot lately.",
      "Mostly in relation to Russia's president.",
      "Short ceasefires are becoming quite the Kremlin thing.",
      "First, Vladimir Putin declared a 30-hour cessation of hostilities over Easter, portraying it as a \"humanitarian\" gesture.",
      "Now the Kremlin leader has announced a three-day unilateral truce for early May. It will run from 8 May to 10 May to coincide with events marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two.",
      "In a statement, the Kremlin said that for 72 hours all military actions would cease. It cited \"humanitarian\" considerations (again) and made it clear Moscow expected Ukraine to follow suit.",
      "In response to the proposal, Ukraine questioned why Russia could not commit to a ceasefire immediately and called for one to be implemented for at least 30 days.",
      "\"If Russia truly wants peace, it must cease fire immediately,\" Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said, adding: \"Why wait until May 8th?\"",
      "So, from the Russian president who launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago, is this a sincere effort to end the fighting?",
      "Or simply a public relations exercise by the Kremlin to impress Donald Trump?",
      "Kremlin critics will suspect PR.",
      "During the extremely brief so-called Easter ceasefire, Ukraine had accused Russian troops of violating it repeatedly.",
      "Moscow had used its announcement of a 30-hour pause in the fighting to send a signal to the White House: that in this war Russia is the peacemaker and Kyiv the aggressor. It accused Ukraine of ignoring what Moscow presented as an olive branch and of prolonging the war.",
      "Trump questions Putin's desire for peaceCritical week for US's future in war talks",
      "Trump questions Putin's desire for peace",
      "Critical week for US's future in war talks",
      "Recent comments by Trump suggest the US president hasn't bought that.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social platform at the weekend, Trump wrote that \"there was no reason\" for Putin \"to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns [in Ukraine], over the last few days\".",
      "\"It makes me think,\" he added, \"that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through 'Banking' or 'Secondary Sanctions?' Too many people are dying!!!\"",
      "Cue today's announcement of another Russian ceasefire. This one slightly longer: three days. And, again, that claim of \"humanitarian\" concerns.",
      "Another attempt to signal to Washington that the Kremlin has only the best of intentions? That Russia is really the good guy in all of this?",
      "If so, it doesn't appear to have worked. Not immediately. The White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt noted Moscow's offer of a temporary ceasefire, but said: \"The president [Donald Trump] has made it clear he wants to see a permanent ceasefire first to stop the killing, stop the bloodshed.",
      "\"He is increasingly frustrated with leaders of both countries,\" Leavitt said.",
      "It's an indication that the US president may be losing patience now with the Kremlin, despite having directed most of his public criticism in recent months towards President Zelensky.",
      "Last month the Trump administration was pushing both Russia and Ukraine to agree to a 30-day comprehensive unconditional ceasefire. Ukraine had signed up to that. Russia did not.",
      "Already senior Russian officials are using President Putin's three-day ceasefire offer to try to cast Ukraine in a bad light.",
      "\"It is doubtful that [President] Zelensky will support the decision of our president and accept the ceasefire,\" the speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, told Russian state TV.",
      "Hardly an encouraging sign, so soon after the announcement of another brief ceasefire."

    "story": [
      "The members of Kenya's security forces who shot dead anti-tax protesters at the country's parliament last June have been identified by the BBC.",
      "The BBC's analysis of more than 5,000 images also shows that those killed there were unarmed and not posing a threat.",
      "The East African nation's constitution guarantees the right to peaceful protest, and the deaths caused a public outcry.",
      "Despite a parliamentary committee ordering Kenya's Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) to investigate the deaths on the streets of the capital, Nairobi - and make public its findings - no report regarding the killings at parliament has yet been issued and no-one has been held to account.",
      "The BBC World Service team analysed videos and photos taken by protesters and journalists on the day. We determined when each was taken using camera metadata, livestream timings and public clocks visible in the shots.",
      "We plotted three of the killings on a 3D reconstruction of Kenya's parliament, allowing us to trace the fatal shots back to the rifles of a police officer and a soldier.",
      "What follows is BBC Africa Eye's detailed timeline of events as Kenya's MPs entered parliament for the final vote on the government's controversial finance bill, while protesters amassed on the streets outside on Tuesday 25 June 2024.",
      "Warning: This story contains images of dead bodies",
      "Young people, labelled Gen Z protesters who had mobilised themselves on social media, began streaming into central Nairobi early in the morning - in what would be the capital's third large-scale protest since the finance bill was introduced on 9 May.",
      "\"It was a beautiful party,\" says prominent human rights activist Boniface Mwangi, who was there.",
      "\"Kids came out with Bluetooth speakers and their water. It was a carnival.\"",
      "Protests earlier in the week had already led lawmakers to axe tax increases on bread, cooking oil, mobile money and motor vehicles, as well as an eco levy that would have raised the cost of goods like nappies and sanitary towels.",
      "But other measures to raise the $2.7bn (\u00a32bn) the government said it needed to cut its reliance on external borrowing, such as higher import taxes and another on specialised hospitals, remained.",
      "\"For the first time it was the Kenyan people - the working class and the middle class and the lower class - against the ruling class,\" says Mwangi.",
      "The protesters had one target - parliament, where the final vote was taking place.",
      "By 09:30 local time, the last of the MPs filed into the lower house.",
      "Outside, thousands pushed towards Parliament Road from the east, north and west of the city.",
      "\"For me, it was just a normal day,\" says 26-year-old student journalist Ademba Allans.",
      "People were livestreaming on their TikTok and Instagram accounts, while events were broadcast live on national TV, he adds.",
      "At first, protesters were held back at roadblocks by tear gas and truncheons, then police started using water cannons and rubber bullets.",
      "By 13:00, more than 100,000 people were on the streets.",
      "\"The numbers start getting bigger and people actually start getting arrested,\" says Allans. \"The police are everywhere. They're trying to push people back. People are even climbing on top of those water cannons.\"",
      "Despite the growing chaos outside, MPs remained in the chamber and the voting began.",
      "By 14:00, protesters had pushed police all the way back to the north-eastern corner of parliament.",
      "Inside at 14:14, the Finance Bill 2024 was voted in: 195 in favour, 106 against. Opposition MPs stormed out and word instantly reached the masses outside.",
      "\"This is when everybody is saying: 'Whatever happens, we are going to enter the parliament and show the MPs that we believe in what we're fighting for,'\" says Allans.",
      "At 14:20, protesters finally broke through the police blockade and reached the road running alongside parliament.",
      "An abandoned police truck stationed outside the gates was set on fire. Fences were torn down and protesters set foot on parliamentary grounds. The incursion was short-lived. Parliamentary security forces quickly cleared them out.",
      "At the same time, police officers went back up Parliament Road in force to drive the protesters back.",
      "While this was happening, journalists were filming, producing minute-by-minute footage from many angles.",
      "One of those videos captured a plain-clothes police officer shouting \"uaa!\", the Swahili word for \"kill\". Seconds later, a police officer knelt, gunshots were heard and protesters in the crowd collapsed - seven in total.",
      "David Chege, a 39-year-old software engineer and Sunday-school teacher, and Ericsson Mutisya, a 25-year-old butcher, were shot dead. Five other men were wounded, one of whom was left paralysed from the waist down.",
      "Footage shows Allans, the student journalist, holding up a Kenyan flag as he tried to reach Chege and another casualty bleeding out after the gunfire.",
      "But who fired those shots?",
      "In the video of the officer shouting, \"uaa!\", the shooter's back was to the camera. But the BBC compared his body armour, riot shield and headgear with that of every police officer at the scene.",
      "In his case, he had an upturned neck guard. We matched his distinctive uniform to an officer in a video recorded seconds later. There, he made sure to hide his face before firing into the crowd. We do not know his name.",
      "Even after the fatal shots, the plain-clothes officer could still be heard urging his colleagues forward to \"kill\". He was not so cautious about concealing his identity: his name is John Kaboi.",
      "Multiple sources have told the BBC he is based at the Central Nairobi Police Station.",
      "The BBC put its allegations to Kenya's police service, which said the force could not investigate itself, adding that the IPOA was responsible for investigating alleged misconduct.",
      "Kaboi has been approached for comment and not replied.",
      "No-one has been held accountable for the deaths of Chege or Mutisya. The BBC found that neither of them was armed.",
      "But these would not be the only lives lost. Rather than spook the demonstrators, the killings galvanised them and they tried for parliament again.",
      "At 14:57 they made it in.",
      "Footage shows them breaking down the fences and walking across the parliament's grounds. Many had their hands up. Others were holding placards or the Kenyan flag.",
      "Warning shots were fired. The demonstrators ducked down, then continued towards the building, filming on their phones as they went.",
      "Once inside, momentum turned to mayhem. Doors were kicked in, part of the complex was set alight and the last of the MPs fled the building.",
      "The destruction was severe but, after five minutes, footage showed them leaving the same way they had come in.",
      "At 15:04, shots rang out again and protesters tumbled across the flattened fence. As the smoke cleared, camera footage showed three bodies lying on the ground. Two were wounded - one raised his hand but could not get up.",
      "The third, 27-year-old finance student Eric Shieni, was dead - shot in the head from behind as he was leaving the grounds. The BBC again found, as in the cases of Chege and Mutisya, that he had been unarmed.",
      "BBC Africa Eye analysed more than 150 images taken during the minutes before and after Shieni was shot. We are able to identify the soldier who fired at the back of his head from 25m (82ft) away - again, we do not know his name.",
      "\"The video is very clear,\" says Faith Odhiambo, president of the Law Society of Kenya.",
      "\"The aim was to kill those protesters. They could have had him arrested. But the fact that you shoot his head - it was clearly an intention to kill.",
      "\"You have become the judge, the jury and the sentence executioner for Eric.\"",
      "The Kenyan Defence Forces (KDF) told the BBC the IPOA had not forwarded any request to look into any of its personnel involved in the operations at parliament.",
      "It added: \"The KDF remains fully committed to upholding the rule of law and continues to operate strictly within its constitutional mandate.\"",
      "After the shooting Allans is seen again, leading the evacuation. Footage shows him carrying a man with blood gushing from his leg.",
      "\"I feared for my life, that my parents would never see me again,\" he says.",
      "\"But I also feared to let other people die when I could help.\"",
      "People outside the UK can watch here",
      "As the sun set on 25 June, the country was reeling. After a week of protests, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights declared that 39 people had died and 361 had been injured around the country.",
      "That evening President William Ruto thanked his security officers for their \"defence of the nation's sovereignty\" against \"organised criminals\" who had \"hijacked\" the protests.",
      "The following day, the finance bill was dropped.",
      "\"Listening keenly to the people of Kenya, who have said loudly that they want nothing to do with this Finance Bill 2024, I concede,\" the president said in a national televised address, adding he would not sign it into law.",
      "But to this day no security officer has been held to account for the deaths and no official investigation has been published.",

    "story": [
      "During last year's presidential campaign, Donald Trump constantly repeated his intention to bring about dramatic change as soon as he returned to the White House.",
      "But few expected it to come at such breakneck speed.",
      "In the three months since he took the oath of office, the 47th president has deployed his power in a way that compares to few predecessors.",
      "In stacks of bound documents signed off with a presidential pen and policy announcements made in all caps on social media, his blizzard of executive actions has reached into every corner of American life.",
      "To his supporters, the shock-and-awe approach has been a tangible demonstration of an all-action president, delivering on his promises and enacting long-awaited reforms.",
      "But his critics fear he is doing irreparable harm to the country and overstepping his powers - crippling important government functions and perhaps permanently reshaping the presidency in the process.",
      "Here are six turning points from the first 100 days.",
      "A social media post sets off a constitutional firestorm",
      "For once, it wasn't a Trump social media post that sparked an outcry.",
      "Three weeks into the new term, at 10.13am on a Sunday morning, Vice-President JD Vance wrote nine words that signalled a strategy which has since shaped the Trump administration's second term.",
      "\"Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" he declared on X.",
      "In the media frenzy that followed, legal experts lined up to challenge that assertion, pointing to a 220-year-old principle which lies at the heart of American democracy.",
      "Courts have the power to check and strike down any government action - laws, regulations and executive orders - they think violates the US Constitution.",
      "Vance's words represented a brazen challenge to judicial authority and, more broadly, the system of three co-equal branches of government crafted by America's founders.",
      "But Trump and his team remain unapologetic in extending the reach of the executive branch into the two other domains - Congress and the courts.",
      "The White House has moved aggressively to wrest control of spending from Congress, unilaterally defunding programmes and entire agencies.",
      "This erosion of its power has been largely met by silence on Capitol Hill, where Trump's Republicans hold slim majorities in both chambers.",
      "The courts have been more resistant, with well over 100 rulings so far halting presidential actions they deem to be unconstitutional, according to a tally by the New York Times.",
      "Some of the biggest clashes have been over Trump's immigration crackdown. In March, more than 200 Venezuelans deemed a danger to the US, were deported to El Salvador, many under sweeping wartime powers and without the usual process of evidence being presented in court.",
      "A Republican-appointed judge on a federal appeals court said he was \"shocked\" by how the White House had acted.",
      "\"Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both,\" Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote.",
      "Trump and White House officials have said they will obey court rulings, even as the president lambasts many of the judges who issue them and the administration at times moves slowly to fully comply.",
      "It all amounts to a unique test of a constitutional system that for centuries has operated under a certain amount of good faith.",
      "While Trump has been at the centre of this push, one of his principal agents of chaos is a man who wasn't born in the US, but who built a business empire there.",
      "Brandishing a chainsaw, dressed in black",
      "Elon Musk, dressed in black from head to toe and wearing sunglasses, stood centre stage and basked in the adulation of the Conservative Political Action Conference crowd.",
      "The richest man in the world, who wants to cut trillions of dollars from the federal government, said he had a special surprise.",
      "Argentinian President Javier Milei, known for his own budget-slashing, emerged from backstage and handed him a shiny gold chainsaw.",
      "\"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,\" Musk exclaimed. \"CHAINSAW!!\"",
      "It was a dramatic illustration not only of Musk's enthusiasm for his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (Doge) assignment, but also of the near rock-star status that the South African-born technologist has developed among the Trump faithful.",
      "Since that appearance, Musk has dispatched his operatives across the federal government, pushing to access sensitive government databases and identify programmes to slash.",
      "Although he has not come anywhere near to finding the trillions of dollars of waste he once promised, his cuts have drastically reduced dozens of agencies and departments - essentially shutting down the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and attempting to dismantle the Department of Education.",
      "While pledges to cut \"waste, fraud and abuse\" in government and trim the ballooning federal deficit typically have broad appeal, the manner in which Musk has used his metaphorical chainsaw has led to conflict with senior government officials and stoked anger among some of the American public.",
      "Some Trump supporters may approve of the administration's aggressive budget-cutting but other constituents have berated Republican legislators at town hall events.",
      "Hecklers have expressed fear that the cuts will adversely affect popular government programmes like Social Security retirement plans, veterans benefits, and health insurance coverage for the poor and elderly.",
      "Their concerns may not be entirely misplaced, given that these schemes make up the bulk of federal spending.",
      "If these programmes are not cut back, sweeping tax cuts that Trump has promised would further increase the scale of US government debt and put at risk arguably his biggest election promise - economic prosperity.",
      "'I had to think fast as billions was lost before my eyes'",
      "When trader Richard McDonald saw Trump hold up his charts in the White House Rose Garden showing a list of countries targeted by US tariffs, he knew he had to act fast.",
      "\"I jumped to my feet because I wasn't expecting a board [of charts] - I was expecting an announcement,\" he says.",
      "McDonald expected tariff cuts of 10% or 20%, but says \"nobody expected these huge numbers\".",
      "He raced to understand which companies might be worst hit. Then he sold.",
      "\"There are billions being wiped off share prices every second, so it's really 'fastest finger first'.\"",
      "He is one of the many traders who were at the coal face of global markets when share prices plunged everywhere following Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement.",
      "The S&P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US was hit particularly hard - and even though the White House has reversed course on some of the highest tariffs, it hasn't fully recovered since.",
      "The economy was the biggest concern for US voters in November's election, and Trump rode a tide of deep unhappiness over Biden's handling of inflation all the way to victory.",
      "His pledge to cut prices, pare back government regulation and boost homegrown industry was a pro-business message warmly welcomed on Wall Street and by many working Americans.",
      "But as Trump tries to follow through on his promise of new tariffs, the economic costs, at least in the short term, have become painfully apparent.",
      "The stock market is sinking, interest rates - including for home mortgages - are rising, and consumer confidence is down. Unemployment is also ticking up, in part due to the growing number of federal employees forced out of their jobs.",
      "The Federal Reserve Bank, along with economic experts, warn Trump's plan will shrink economic growth and possibly lead to a recession.",
      "While the president's approval ratings on his handling of the economy have tumbled, many of his supporters are sticking with him. And in former industrial areas hollowed out by the loss of manufacturing jobs, there are hopes that tariffs could even the global playing field.",
      "\"Trump has earned back the respect,\" says truck driver Ben Maurer in Pennsylvania, referring to tariffs on China. \"We are still the force to be reckoned with.\"",
      "Economic concerns have contributed to Trump's overall decline in the polls, but in one key area, he is still largely on solid ground in the public's eye - immigration.",
      "Spotted in a photo - 'My son, shackled in prison'",
      "\"It's him! It's him! I recognise his features,\" says Myrelis Casique Lopez, pointing at a photo of men shackled and cuffed on the floor of one of the most infamous prisons in the world.",
      "She had spotted her son in the image, taken from above, of a sea of shaven heads belonging to men in white T-shirts sat in long, straight rows.",
      "At home in Maracay, Venezuela, Ms Casique was shown the photograph, first shared online by the El Salvador authorities, by a BBC reporter.",
      "When she last had contact with her son, he was in the US and facing deportation to Venezuela but now he was 1,430 miles (2,300 km) away from her, one of 238 men sent by US authorities to a notorious mega-jail in El Salvador.",
      "The Trump administration says they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang - a powerful, multi-national crime operation - but Ms Casique insists her son is innocent.",
      "A tough stance on immigration was a central plank of Trump's re-election campaign, and the president has used his broad powers of enforcement to deliver that pledge.",
      "Illegal border crossings were falling at the end of the Biden presidency, but are now at their lowest monthly total for more than four years.",
      "A majority of the US public still backs the crackdown, but it has had a chilling effect on communities of foreign students who have found themselves caught up in the blitz.",
      "Some, including permanent residents, have been detained and face deportation because of their role in pro-Palestinian campus protests. They have rejected accusations that they support Hamas.",
      "Civil rights lawyers warn that some migrants are being deported without due process, sweeping up the innocent among the \"killers and thugs\" that Trump says are being targeted.",
      "While so far there haven't been the level of mass deportations that some hoped for and others feared, newly empowered immigration enforcement agents have taken action across the US in businesses, homes and churches.",
      "They have been active in universities too, which have become a prominent target of President Trump in several other ways.",
      "A clash with academic, media and corporate worlds",
      "On 21 April, Harvard University's president, Alan Garber, decided to confront the White House head-on.",
      "In a letter to the university community, he announced a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's move to freeze billions of dollars in federal grants.",
      "It was, he said, an illegal attempt to \"impose unprecedented and improper control\" over Harvard's operations.",
      "The White House said it had to take action because Harvard had not tackled antisemitism on campus - an issue that Garber said the university was taking steps to address.",
      "But the Ivy League college's move was the most prominent display of resistance against Trump's use of presidential power to target American higher education, a longstanding goal energised by pro-Palestinian protests that engulfed campuses in 2024.",
      "The president and his officials have since impounded or threatened to withhold billions of dollars in federal spending to reshape elite institutions like Harvard, which the president and many of his supporters think push a liberal ideology on students and researchers.",
      "Earlier in the month, Columbia University in New York City had agreed to a number of White House demands, including changes to its protest policies, campus security practices and Middle Eastern studies department.",
      "A similar dynamic has played out in the corporate and media worlds.",
      "Trump has used the withholding of federal contracts as a way to pressure law firms to recruit and represent more conservatives.",
      "Some of the firms have responded by offering the Trump administration millions of dollars in free legal services, while two firms have filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the administration's punishments.",
      "A defamation lawsuit Trump brought against ABC News has led to the media company contributing $15m (\u00a311m) to Trump's presidential foundation.",
      "CBS is also in talks to settle a separate lawsuit over a Kamala Harris interview, as its parent company Paramount seeks federal approval for a merger with Skydance Media.",
      "The Associated Press, by contrast, has resisted administration pressure to accept Trump's \"Gulf of America\" name change despite the White House's efforts to block the news agency from coverage of the president.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump warned about the runaway power of the federal government. Now in office, he is wielding that power in a way no previous modern president has attempted.",
      "Nowhere, however, have the impacts of his efforts been more visible than within the federal government agencies and departments that he now controls.",
      "A retreat on race and identity",
      "The press conference at the White House began with a moment's silence for the victims of an aircraft collision over the Potomac River.",
      "Within seconds of the pause coming to an end, however, Trump was on the attack.",
      "A diversity and inclusion initiative at the Federal Aviation Agency was partly to blame for the tragedy, the president claimed, because it hired people with severe intellectual disabilities as air traffic controllers. He did not provide any evidence.",
      "It was a startling moment that was emblematic of the attack his presidency has launched against inclusivity programmes that have proliferated in recent years across the US government and corporate world.",
      "Trump has directed the federal government to end its diversity and equity (DEI) programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\".",

    "summary": "Suspects who are accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at gunpoint in October 2016 stand trial in Paris.",
    "story": [
      "The morning after the heist, burglar Yunice Abbas went home to catch up on some sleep.",
      "When he woke up, his wife was glued to the TV. The headline news of the day was that American reality TV star Kim Kardashian, then 35, had been tied up and robbed at gunpoint in a luxury Paris apartment.",
      "All her jewellery - worth about $10m (\u00a37.5m), and including the engagement ring her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m (\u00a33m) - had been taken.",
      "Yunice Abbas' wife glared at him. \"This has you written all over it,\" she grumbled.",
      "She was right. The 62-year-old had dabbled in crime his whole life, from petty offences to bank heists.",
      "The Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement.",
      "But a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017 - three months after the robbery - Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested.",
      "Ten of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks.",
      "Out of those, five are accused of taking part in the heist, and six are accused of being accessories to the crime.",
      "Most of them were born in the 1950s, leading French media to dub them the \"grandpa robbers\".",
      "Abbas and a 68-year-old man, Aomar Ait Khedache, have confessed; the others have not.",
      "One has since passed away, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he is suffering from advanced dementia.",
      "By the time the trial starts, almost nine years will have gone by since the heist.",
      "Gun wielding robbers fled on bikes and on foot",
      "On the night between 2 and 3 October 2016, Abbas and four accomplices allegedly staked out Kardashian's discreet suite in Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s, in the glitzy Madeleine neighbourhood in Paris, not far from the Op\u00e9ra and Place Vendome.",
      "At around 03:00 local time, they burst into the hotel's entrance hall, dressed as policemen and wielding a gun.",
      "They threatened and handcuffed Abderrahmane Ouatiki, an Algerian PhD student who regularly took up shifts as night receptionist, and marched him up to Kardashian's room.",
      "She was resting on her bed, tired from days of attending Paris Fashion Week events, when she heard stomping up the stairs.",
      "She called out for her sister Kourtney and her stylist Stephanie, but when they didn't answer she panicked.",
      "\"I knew someone was there to get me,\" she recalled in an interview with US interviewer David Letterman years later. \"You just feel it.\"",
      "Kim dialled 911 but the number, of course, didn't work outside of the US. As she was calling her then-security guard Pascal Duvier - who had accompanied her sister to a club - the men burst in, pushed her on the bed and started shouting.",
      "\"They kept on saying: the ring, the ring! And I was so startled that it didn't compute for a minute,\" she told Letterman.",
      "The language barrier meant Ouatiki had to act as an interpreter.",
      "They found the ring and stuffed it in a bag along with several other jewels, as well as \u20ac1000 in cash. One of the men grabbed her and pulled her towards him.",
      "Because she was wearing a robe with nothing underneath, she thought he was going to assault her, Kim later told Letterman, wiping tears away.",
      "But instead \u2013 using the technique of saucissonnage, or the practice of tying victims up like a saucisson, a salami - the man bound her with zip ties and duct tape, and left her in the bathroom.",
      "Then, he and the rest of the burglars fled on bikes and on foot. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up.",
      "Traumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn.",
      "It wasn't until later that day, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was.",
      "\"There were breaking news alerts saying Kim Kardashian had been robbed at gunpoint \u2013 that's how important it was,\" says LA-based entertainment journalist KJ Matthews.",
      "Blunders meant heist was doomed from the start",
      "\"We were so fascinated with her and her family and their rise to fame... When the heist happened we were so surprised. How could burglars have gotten so close to her?\" Matthews says.",
      "But while mistakes were made in terms of Kardashian's security, serious errors were made on the burglars' side, too.",
      "\"They didn't take into account the progress made by police techniques, which can now find micro traces of DNA anywhere,\" said Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and the author of \"Kim and the Grandpa Robbers\" - a thorough account of the heist and of the lives of its perpetrators.",
      "\"When they dressed up as police they thought 'that's it, nobody will be able to recognise us',\" she adds.",
      "But in 2016 Paris was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of the previous year, and there were a huge number of CCTV cameras all round the city, meaning police were able to spot the thieves and see them make off with the jewels.",
      "Other details of this story suggest that the thieves' planning was rather haphazard. When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels.",
      "The next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from.",
      "Police arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as \"Omar the Old\".",
      "French media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian caf\u00e9 that winter, just before their arrest.",
      "The question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian's schedule.",
      "Court documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements.",
      "But how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard?",
      "The documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael's firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim's whereabouts.",
      "Mr Madar was arrested in January 2017. His lawyer Arthur Vercken vehemently pushed back against the accusations, telling the BBC that \"since the start the case was built on assumptions, theses, theories - but no proof [of Madar's involvement] was ever found\".",
      "He added that although the Madar brothers exchanged texts about the Kardashians during Fashion Week it was just because they were \"bored\" and that when the heist took place Gary was asleep.",
      "Gary's brother, Michael, is not a defendant.",
      "\"Five men did this. You don't think one of them was keeping an eye on who was coming and going from her hotel?\" he said, suggesting that Mr Madar had only been arrested \"to prove that the French justice system works\".",
      "The trial will also attempt to determine where the jewels ended up.",
      "Police tracking of the gang's phones showed that soon after the heist Omar the Old travelled from Paris to Antwerp in Belgium, where 50% of the world's polished diamonds and 80% of rough diamonds are sold, according to the Diamond Investment Office.",
      "Many jewels were reportedly melted or broken up and sold. Abbas got \u20ac75,000 (\u00a364,000); others far less.",
      "As for Kim's engagement ring, Omar the Old said the gang was too scared to sell it on as it would be too easily traceable. It has never been found.",
      "Kim was undoubtedly spooked by the event, which marked the start of her social media hiatus.",
      "In an episode of the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she tearfully recalled the night of the heist and said had been scared for her life; later she also said the robbery had made her a \"less materialistic person\".",
      "Soon after the incident her sister Khloe told The Ellen DeGeneres Show that, for safety reasons, the Kardashian family were making some changes to how freely they posted on social media.",
      "\"The biggest change was her security detail,\" KJ Matthews told the BBC.",
      "'They're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is'",
      "Patricia Tourancheau, the author of the book about the heist, said she was \"fascinated\" by the \"clash between these old-style burglars from the Parisian banlieue and this global social media star\".",
      "\"They fled on bikes and she flies around on private jets,\" she laughed.",
      "\"These are a group of elderly down-and-out thieves, they're always broke, they're forever involved in convoluted plans\u2026 and they're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is.\"",
      "The gang was not \"elite\" as it was suggested in the early days, she added.",
      "\"This isn't the creme de la creme of French banditry. They're a bit of a bunch of losers, really. They're the same kind of people who in the 60s and 70s would burglar banks or post offices and who then rebranded to drug trafficking and then moved on to jewels because it was easier,\" she said.",
      "Around mid-May, Kim will face the suspects for the first time in years when she takes the stand as a witness.",
      "Cameras are not allowed in French courts but her arrival to the tribunal on Ile de la Cit\u00e9 alone will inevitably spark the same media frenzy that has accompanied her for over a decade.",
      "In his memoir, Abbas expressed the hope the victim's status and the global resonance of the case would not influence judges unduly.",
      "However, he also said that on the last day of the trial he would bring a duffle bag with his belongings, ready to be sent to jail.",
      "\"The problem with the past,\" he wrote, \"is that it sticks with you as long as you live\".",

    "summary": "The impact of what President Trump has done so far is being felt in every corner of American life.",
    "story": [
      "During last year's presidential campaign, Donald Trump constantly repeated his intention to bring about dramatic change as soon as he returned to the White House.",
      "But few expected it to come at such breakneck speed.",
      "In the three months since he took the oath of office, the 47th president has deployed his power in a way that compares to few predecessors.",
      "In stacks of bound documents signed off with a presidential pen and policy announcements made in all caps on social media, his blizzard of executive actions has reached into every corner of American life.",
      "To his supporters, the shock-and-awe approach has been a tangible demonstration of an all-action president, delivering on his promises and enacting long-awaited reforms.",
      "But his critics fear he is doing irreparable harm to the country and overstepping his powers - crippling important government functions and perhaps permanently reshaping the presidency in the process.",
      "Here are six turning points from the first 100 days.",
      "A social media post sets off a constitutional firestorm",
      "For once, it wasn't a Trump social media post that sparked an outcry.",
      "Three weeks into the new term, at 10.13am on a Sunday morning, Vice-President JD Vance wrote nine words that signalled a strategy which has since shaped the Trump administration's second term.",
      "\"Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" he declared on X.",
      "In the media frenzy that followed, legal experts lined up to challenge that assertion, pointing to a 220-year-old principle which lies at the heart of American democracy.",
      "Courts have the power to check and strike down any government action - laws, regulations and executive orders - they think violates the US Constitution.",
      "Vance's words represented a brazen challenge to judicial authority and, more broadly, the system of three co-equal branches of government crafted by America's founders.",
      "But Trump and his team remain unapologetic in extending the reach of the executive branch into the two other domains - Congress and the courts.",
      "The White House has moved aggressively to wrest control of spending from Congress, unilaterally defunding programmes and entire agencies.",
      "This erosion of its power has been largely met by silence on Capitol Hill, where Trump's Republicans hold slim majorities in both chambers.",
      "The courts have been more resistant, with well over 100 rulings so far halting presidential actions they deem to be unconstitutional, according to a tally by the New York Times.",
      "Some of the biggest clashes have been over Trump's immigration crackdown. In March, more than 200 Venezuelans deemed a danger to the US, were deported to El Salvador, many under sweeping wartime powers and without the usual process of evidence being presented in court.",
      "A Republican-appointed judge on a federal appeals court said he was \"shocked\" by how the White House had acted.",
      "\"Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both,\" Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote.",
      "Trump and White House officials have said they will obey court rulings, even as the president lambasts many of the judges who issue them and the administration at times moves slowly to fully comply.",
      "It all amounts to a unique test of a constitutional system that for centuries has operated under a certain amount of good faith.",
      "While Trump has been at the centre of this push, one of his principal agents of chaos is a man who wasn't born in the US, but who built a business empire there.",
      "Brandishing a chainsaw, dressed in black",
      "Elon Musk, dressed in black from head to toe and wearing sunglasses, stood centre stage and basked in the adulation of the Conservative Political Action Conference crowd.",
      "The richest man in the world, who wants to cut trillions of dollars from the federal government, said he had a special surprise.",
      "Argentinian President Javier Milei, known for his own budget-slashing, emerged from backstage and handed him a shiny gold chainsaw.",
      "\"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,\" Musk exclaimed. \"CHAINSAW!!\"",
      "It was a dramatic illustration not only of Musk's enthusiasm for his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (Doge) assignment, but also of the near rock-star status that the South African-born technologist has developed among the Trump faithful.",
      "Since that appearance, Musk has dispatched his operatives across the federal government, pushing to access sensitive government databases and identify programmes to slash.",
      "Although he has not come anywhere near to finding the trillions of dollars of waste he once promised, his cuts have drastically reduced dozens of agencies and departments - essentially shutting down the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and attempting to dismantle the Department of Education.",
      "While pledges to cut \"waste, fraud and abuse\" in government and trim the ballooning federal deficit typically have broad appeal, the manner in which Musk has used his metaphorical chainsaw has led to conflict with senior government officials and stoked anger among some of the American public.",
      "Some Trump supporters may approve of the administration's aggressive budget-cutting but other constituents have berated Republican legislators at town hall events.",
      "Hecklers have expressed fear that the cuts will adversely affect popular government programmes like Social Security retirement plans, veterans benefits, and health insurance coverage for the poor and elderly.",
      "Their concerns may not be entirely misplaced, given that these schemes make up the bulk of federal spending.",
      "If these programmes are not cut back, sweeping tax cuts that Trump has promised would further increase the scale of US government debt and put at risk arguably his biggest election promise - economic prosperity.",
      "'I had to think fast as billions was lost before my eyes'",
      "When trader Richard McDonald saw Trump hold up his charts in the White House Rose Garden showing a list of countries targeted by US tariffs, he knew he had to act fast.",
      "\"I jumped to my feet because I wasn't expecting a board [of charts] - I was expecting an announcement,\" he says.",
      "McDonald expected tariff cuts of 10% or 20%, but says \"nobody expected these huge numbers\".",
      "He raced to understand which companies might be worst hit. Then he sold.",
      "\"There are billions being wiped off share prices every second, so it's really 'fastest finger first'.\"",
      "He is one of the many traders who were at the coal face of global markets when share prices plunged everywhere following Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement.",
      "The S&P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US was hit particularly hard - and even though the White House has reversed course on some of the highest tariffs, it hasn't fully recovered since.",
      "The economy was the biggest concern for US voters in November's election, and Trump rode a tide of deep unhappiness over Biden's handling of inflation all the way to victory.",
      "His pledge to cut prices, pare back government regulation and boost homegrown industry was a pro-business message warmly welcomed on Wall Street and by many working Americans.",
      "But as Trump tries to follow through on his promise of new tariffs, the economic costs, at least in the short term, have become painfully apparent.",
      "The stock market is sinking, interest rates - including for home mortgages - are rising, and consumer confidence is down. Unemployment is also ticking up, in part due to the growing number of federal employees forced out of their jobs.",
      "The Federal Reserve Bank, along with economic experts, warn Trump's plan will shrink economic growth and possibly lead to a recession.",
      "While the president's approval ratings on his handling of the economy have tumbled, many of his supporters are sticking with him. And in former industrial areas hollowed out by the loss of manufacturing jobs, there are hopes that tariffs could even the global playing field.",
      "\"Trump has earned back the respect,\" says truck driver Ben Maurer in Pennsylvania, referring to tariffs on China. \"We are still the force to be reckoned with.\"",
      "Economic concerns have contributed to Trump's overall decline in the polls, but in one key area, he is still largely on solid ground in the public's eye - immigration.",
      "Spotted in a photo - 'My son, shackled in prison'",
      "\"It's him! It's him! I recognise his features,\" says Myrelis Casique Lopez, pointing at a photo of men shackled and cuffed on the floor of one of the most infamous prisons in the world.",
      "She had spotted her son in the image, taken from above, of a sea of shaven heads belonging to men in white T-shirts sat in long, straight rows.",
      "At home in Maracay, Venezuela, Ms Casique was shown the photograph, first shared online by the El Salvador authorities, by a BBC reporter.",
      "When she last had contact with her son, he was in the US and facing deportation to Venezuela but now he was 1,430 miles (2,300 km) away from her, one of 238 men sent by US authorities to a notorious mega-jail in El Salvador.",
      "The Trump administration says they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang - a powerful, multi-national crime operation - but Ms Casique insists her son is innocent.",
      "A tough stance on immigration was a central plank of Trump's re-election campaign, and the president has used his broad powers of enforcement to deliver that pledge.",
      "Illegal border crossings were falling at the end of the Biden presidency, but are now at their lowest monthly total for more than four years.",
      "A majority of the US public still backs the crackdown, but it has had a chilling effect on communities of foreign students who have found themselves caught up in the blitz.",
      "Some, including permanent residents, have been detained and face deportation because of their role in pro-Palestinian campus protests. They have rejected accusations that they support Hamas.",
      "Civil rights lawyers warn that some migrants are being deported without due process, sweeping up the innocent among the \"killers and thugs\" that Trump says are being targeted.",
      "While so far there haven't been the level of mass deportations that some hoped for and others feared, newly empowered immigration enforcement agents have taken action across the US in businesses, homes and churches.",
      "They have been active in universities too, which have become a prominent target of President Trump in several other ways.",
      "A clash with academic, media and corporate worlds",
      "On 21 April, Harvard University's president, Alan Garber, decided to confront the White House head-on.",
      "In a letter to the university community, he announced a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's move to freeze billions of dollars in federal grants.",
      "It was, he said, an illegal attempt to \"impose unprecedented and improper control\" over Harvard's operations.",
      "The White House said it had to take action because Harvard had not tackled antisemitism on campus - an issue that Garber said the university was taking steps to address.",
      "But the Ivy League college's move was the most prominent display of resistance against Trump's use of presidential power to target American higher education, a longstanding goal energised by pro-Palestinian protests that engulfed campuses in 2024.",
      "The president and his officials have since impounded or threatened to withhold billions of dollars in federal spending to reshape elite institutions like Harvard, which the president and many of his supporters think push a liberal ideology on students and researchers.",
      "Earlier in the month, Columbia University in New York City had agreed to a number of White House demands, including changes to its protest policies, campus security practices and Middle Eastern studies department.",
      "A similar dynamic has played out in the corporate and media worlds.",
      "Trump has used the withholding of federal contracts as a way to pressure law firms to recruit and represent more conservatives.",
      "Some of the firms have responded by offering the Trump administration millions of dollars in free legal services, while two firms have filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the administration's punishments.",
      "A defamation lawsuit Trump brought against ABC News has led to the media company contributing $15m (\u00a311m) to Trump's presidential foundation.",
      "CBS is also in talks to settle a separate lawsuit over a Kamala Harris interview, as its parent company Paramount seeks federal approval for a merger with Skydance Media.",
      "The Associated Press, by contrast, has resisted administration pressure to accept Trump's \"Gulf of America\" name change despite the White House's efforts to block the news agency from coverage of the president.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump warned about the runaway power of the federal government. Now in office, he is wielding that power in a way no previous modern president has attempted.",
      "Nowhere, however, have the impacts of his efforts been more visible than within the federal government agencies and departments that he now controls.",
      "A retreat on race and identity",
      "The press conference at the White House began with a moment's silence for the victims of an aircraft collision over the Potomac River.",
      "Within seconds of the pause coming to an end, however, Trump was on the attack.",
      "A diversity and inclusion initiative at the Federal Aviation Agency was partly to blame for the tragedy, the president claimed, because it hired people with severe intellectual disabilities as air traffic controllers. He did not provide any evidence.",
      "It was a startling moment that was emblematic of the attack his presidency has launched against inclusivity programmes that have proliferated in recent years across the US government and corporate world.",
      "Trump has directed the federal government to end its diversity and equity (DEI) programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\".",
      "His directive has accelerated moves among leading global companies like Meta and Goldman to cut back or eliminate these programmes.",
      "First introduced in the 1960s in the wake of civil rights victories, early forms of DEI were an attempt to expand opportunities for black Americans. They later expanded to take in women, LGBT rights and other racial groups.",
      "Efforts were stepped up and embraced by much of corporate America in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matters protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis Police officers.",
      "But to its critics, DEI was putting politics and race above talent, creating division and was no longer needed in modern America.",
      "While Trump's directive seems to have support from a narrow majority of voters, some of the unexpected consequences have raised eyebrows.",
      "Arlington National Cemetery scrubbed from its website all mentions of the history of black and female service members. And the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan was initially flagged for removal from Pentagon documents, apparently due to the word \"gay\".",
      "Donald Trump's first 100 days have been an unprecedented display of unilateral power exercised by a modern American president.",
      "His efforts to dismantle large swaths of the federal government will take years, if not decades, for subsequent presidents to restore - if they so desire.",
      "In other ways, however, Trump's efforts so far may end up being less permanent. Without the support of new laws passed by Congress, many of his sweeping reforms could be wiped away by a future president.",
      "And so to what extent this whirlwind start leads to lasting change remains an open question.",
      "Later this year, the narrow Republican majorities in Congress will attempt to provide the legislative backing for Trump's agenda, but their success is far from guaranteed.",
      "And in next year's mid-term congressional elections, those majorities could be replaced by hostile Democrats bent on investigating the administration and curtailing his authority.",
      "Meanwhile, more court battles loom - and while the US Supreme Court has a conservative tilt, its decisions on a number of key cases could ultimately cut against Trump's efforts.",
      "The first 100 days of Trump's second term have been a dramatic show of political force, but the next 1,361 will be the real test of whether he can carve an enduring legacy.",

      "Nunavut is Canada's largest federal district. The entire territory - all 1.8 million sq km (695,000 sq miles) and its 40,000 people - will be represented by one person in parliament.",
      "\"Nunavut is at least three times the size of France. If it was its own country, it would be the 13th largest behind Greenland,\" Kathy Kettler, the campaign manager for local Liberal candidate Kilikvak Kabloona, told the BBC.",
      "Located in the Arctic, where average temperatures in the capital city Iqaluit are below freezing for eight months of the year, it is so vast and inaccessible that the only way to travel between its 25 communities is by air.",
      "\"Yesterday, in 24 hours, we travelled 1,700 km (1,050 miles) by air and campaigned in Pangnirtung, Iqaluit, Rankin Inlet, and Arviat,\" said  Ms Kettler.",
      "\"There are not very many people who understand the reality of the north,\" Ms  Kettler said, describing the challenges of running a campaign where so much is different from southern Canada.",
      "She recalled knocking on doors earlier this month as she campaigned for her candidate in -24C (-11F) temperatures.",
      "She said it's rare in northern communities for people to knock before entering someone's home. Instead, the tight-knit culture permits visitors to simply \"walk in and say hello\" - almost unthinkable in other parts of the country.",
      "As an Inuk from northern Quebec, she said it \"feels weird\" even for her to knock and wait for a response.",
      "In Nunavut, one of Canada's three northern territories, the majority-Inuit population speak Inuktitut.",
      "Ms Kettler said one of the biggest expenses was translating campaign signs and hiring an interpreter for Kabloona, the candidate.",
      "Election issues for northerners too are unique.",
      "\"The national campaign is really focused on Arctic security and sovereignty, whereas our campaign here is focused on food security and people being able to survive,\" Ms Kettler said.",
      "Food can be prohibitively expensive and there are infrastructure challenges to accessing clean water for a number of Indigenous and northern communities.",
      "She was boiling water to drink while campaigning in Arviat, she said, and described being unable to rely on calling voters as she canvasses because a phone plan is the first thing they sacrifice to afford food.",

      "James Arreak is the Conservative candidate.",
      "Jean-Claude Nguyen, the returning officer in Nunavut, is responsible for conducting the election in the district.",
      "He described how difficult it is to ensure ballots and voter lists get to every community - including to workers at remote gold mines.",
      "\"[Elections Canada] sent a team from our Ottawa headquarters via Edmonton and Yellowknife to the mine where they work, gave them sufficient time to vote, and then they brought the ballots back,\" he said.",
      "Mr Nguyen also spoke about security considerations.",
      "Once polls close, the ballots are counted at the polling station and then stored safely either with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), or a local hamlet - a small community that provides municipal services to its residents.",
      "The ballot boxes are then flown to Iqaluit, and then to Ottawa.",
      "Mr Nguyen recalled how in the 2019 election, a ballot box arrived with a big hole.",
      "\"When we asked the charter flight company what happened, they said it was eaten by a raven,\" he said laughing.",
      "\"That's part of the reality here in the territories, you have wild animals eating the ballot boxes.\"",
      "No ballots were damaged by the bird.",
      "Beyond all the challenges, Kathy Kettler said she is most drawn to the spirit of the people.",
      "\"The generosity, love, and care that people have for each other in every community shines through,\" she said.",
      "\"That's what keeps me going, and it's what makes campaigning across Nunavut so meaningful.\"",

      "Home to about 3,000 people, a few shops, two roundabouts and a tiny hospital, Streaky Bay is an idyllic beach town.",
      "For Dr Bradley, though, it is anything but. The area's sole, permanent doctor, she spent years essentially on call 24/7.",
      "Running the hospital and the general practitioner (GP) clinic, life was a never-ending game of catch up. She'd do rounds at the wards before, after and in between regular appointments. Even on good days, lunch breaks were often a pipe dream. On bad days, a hospital emergency would blow up her already punishing schedule.",
      "Burnt out, two years ago she quit \u2013 and the thread holding together the remnants of the town's healthcare system snapped.",
      "Streaky Bay is at the forefront of a national crisis: inadequate government funding is exacerbating a shortage of critical healthcare workers like Dr Bradley; wait times are ballooning; doctors are beginning to write their own rules on fees, and costs to patients are skyrocketing.",
      "A once-revered universal healthcare system is crumbling at every level, sometimes barely getting by on the sheer willpower of doctors and local communities.",
      "As a result, more and more Australians, regardless of where they live, are delaying or going without the care they need.",
      "Health has become a defining issue for voters ahead of the nation's election on 3 May, with both of Australia's major parties promising billions of dollars in additional funding.",
      "But experts say the solutions being offered up are band-aid fixes, while what is needed are sweeping changes to the way the system is funded \u2013 reform for which there has so far been a lack of political will.",
      "Australians tell the BBC the country is at a crossroads, and needs to decide if universal healthcare is worth saving.",
      "The cracks in a 'national treasure'",
      "Healthcare was the last thing on Renee Elliott's mind when she moved to Streaky Bay - until the 40-year-old found a cancerous lump in her breast in 2019, and another one four years later.",
      "Seeing a local GP was the least of her problems. With the expertise and treatment she needed only available in Adelaide, about 500km away, Mrs Elliott has spent hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars accessing life-saving care, all while raising three boys and running a business.",
      "Though she has since clawed back a chunk of the cost through government schemes, it made an already harrowing time that much more draining: financially, emotionally and physically.",
      "\"You're trying to get better\u2026 but having to juggle all that as well. It was very tricky.\"",
      "When Australia's modern health system was born four decades ago \u2013 underpinned by a public insurance scheme called Medicare \u2013 it was supposed to guarantee affordable and accessible high-quality care to people like Mrs Elliott as \"a basic right\".",
      "Health funding here is complex and shared between states and federal governments. But the scheme essentially meant Australians could present their bright green Medicare member card at a doctor's office or hospital, and Canberra would be sent a bill. It paid through rebates funded by taxes.",
      "Patients would either receive \"bulk billed\" \u2013 completely free \u2013 care, mostly through the emerging public system, or heavily subsidised treatment through a private healthcare sector offering more benefits and choice to those who wanted them.",

      "There is no denying that healthcare in Australia is still miles ahead of much of the world, particularly when it comes to emergency care.",
      "But the core of the crisis and key to this election is GP services, or primary care, largely offered by private clinics. There has historically been little need for public ones, with most GPs choosing to accept Medicare rebates as full payment.",
      "That is increasingly uncommon though, with doctors saying those allowances haven't kept up with the true cost of delivering care. At the same time, staff shortages, which persist despite efforts to recruit from overseas, create a scarcity that only drives up prices further.",
      "According to government data, about 30% of patients must now pay a \"gap fee\" for a regular doctor's appointment - on average A$40 (\u00a319.25; $25.55) out of pocket.",
      "But experts suspect the true figure is higher: it's skewed by seniors and children, who tend to visit doctors more often and still enjoy mostly bulk-billed appointments.

      "When the clinic was on the verge of closure, the town desperately rallied to buy it. When it was struggling again, the local council diverted funding from other areas to top up its coffers. And even still most standard patients \u2013 unless they are seniors or children \u2013 fork out about A$50 per appointment.",

      "\"At this election, this little card here, your Medicare card, is what is at stake,\" Albanese has said.",
      "His government has started fixing things already, he argues, and has pledged an extra A$8.5bn for training more GPs, building additional public clinics, and subsidising more medicines.",

      "Democrats have struggled to land a unified message in President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, with fractures both in Congress and among supporters. What comes next for a party in a difficult spot?",
      "The rural, agricultural town of Bakersfield, California, is an odd stop for a pair of East Coast progressive politicians.",
      "After all, Trump won the surrounding county by 20 points, and the dusty fields and endless orchards feel a world away from the party's power centres in Los Angeles and the Bay Area.",
      "Yet Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Independent Senator Bernie Sanders packed a local auditorium during a recent stop on their Fighting Oligarchy tour. The rally felt like a 1960s-style sit-in with attendees singing along to a gentle rendition of Woody Guthrie's This Land is Your Land. They launched rowdy boos and jeers every time Sanders inveighed against Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "The visit also felt like an answered prayer for local Democrats and left-leaning Independents who oppose Trump and his policies, while directing much of their fury at their own party, which they feel has failed to mount an effective opposition.",
      "The Democratic party \"should be doing more to try to protect everybody,\" said Karla Alcantar, 26, who attended the rally. \"I feel like some of them have just folded over completely, and there are some that are trying to do the work of all.\"",
      "\"I definitely feel like they should be doing way more,\" she said.",
      "Democrats at a crossroads",
      "It is not a great time to be a Democratic politician in the United States. The party is out of power. Elected officials cannot agree on a course of action to counter Trump's agenda. No clear leader has emerged to unify the unwieldy coalition. Various ideological and generational factions are warring against each other and nobody seems to be winning.",
      "\"I understand that they don't have the power to, like, change like things drastically, but they do have the power to slow down like things even a little bit,\" said rally attendee Juan Dominguez, 26. \"It honestly feels like I'm not seeing any of that.\"",
      "The anger extends beyond the rally-goers.",
      "Fifty-two percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said their party's leadership is moving in the wrong direction, according to a CNN/SSRS poll conducted in mid-March, as opposed to 48% who said it is moving in the right direction.",
      "That same survey suggested a desire for strong opposition: 57% wanted Democrats in Congress to try and stop the Republican party's agenda. It's a complete reversal of a poll in 2017, the year after Trump first won the presidency, that suggested 74% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents wanted leaders to work with Republicans following a divisive election.",
      "\"What they're pressing for is not just Democratic leaders to lash out because that's going to make their followers feel good,\" said former Pennsylvania congressman Conor Lamb, who held a town hall-style event in Pittsburgh last week.",
      "Though Lamb said he is not currently running for office, he felt a hunger within the Democratic base.",
      "\"I think they feel like the survival of the system we have all counted on is itself on the line, and they want us to act with that level of urgency,\" Lamb told the BBC. \"I think it's important for us not to forget just to be advocates for things that are specific and concrete, and really affecting people.\"",
      "Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez's tour is just one attempt to solve that. It stops in conservative-dominated areas and remains laser-focused on the economy, citing cost of living grievances that propelled Trump to a second term, while framing him and his billionaire supporters like Musk as the culprits.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez put the argument simply: \"Oligarchy or democracy?\"",
      "But the Fighting Oligarchy tour is only one theory about how the Democratic Party should evolve.",
      "\"It is completely normal when a party loses, especially the presidency, for there to be this period of soul searching and asking, 'What's next?'\" said Professor Christian Grose, a political scientist at the University of Southern California.",
      "Some Democrats accused their party of falling out of step with more conservative Americans on subjects like transgender rights, or failing to accommodate diverse viewpoints within the party's ideological spectrum. Without widening their potential base, these Democrats argue, they stand little chance of regaining power.",
      "One such gambit by California Governor Gavin Newsom involves moving the party's branding more to the center. Though Newsom has long brushed off White House ambitions, he is among a new generation of Democrats who could vie for the presidency in 2028.",
      "The governor, known nationwide as a liberal defender of abortion and LGBTQ rights, recently launched a podcast to host conversations with politicos who disagree with him.",
      "Newsom's decision to interview right-wing strategist Steve Bannon infuriated many Democrats.",
      "\"I think it's important to have difficult conversations or even have a civil conversation that may be difficult for people to listen to, because everyone is out there trying to tear each other down,\" Newsom said at a recent press conference.",
      "New guard or old guard?",
      "While such debates over whether to moderate or play to the base feature in every party's soul-searching, this year does have a new twist, Mr Grose noted.",
      "\"Some of the questions for the Democrats' strategy is the age question - is it time for a new generation? That is a little unique,\" he said.",
      "David Hogg, 25, a gun safety organiser and vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, is currently locked in a heated public debate with a party elder statesmen, strategist James Carville.",
      "Hogg recently pledged $20m through his political group to fund primary challengers to Democrats in safe seats.",
      "\"We cannot win back the majority if we do not convince the American people that our party offers something that isn't just, not Donald Trump, but something substantially better,\" he said. \"I think it's time for some new voices in our party.\"",
      "Carville, credited with shepherding Bill Clinton to the White House, called the plan \"insane.\"",
      "\"Aren't we supposed to run against Republicans?\" he asked on CNN.",

      "\"Never,\" supporters shouted back. Many waved Canadian flags taped to ice hockey sticks.",

      "The Conservative leader has drawn large crowds to rallies across the country, where \"Bring it Home\" is a call to arms: both to vote for a change of government and a nod to the wave of Canadian patriotism in the face of US tariff threats.",
      "In the final hours of a 36-day campaign, Donald Trump's shadow looms over everything. The winner of Monday's election is likely to be the party able to convince voters they have a plan for how to deal with the US president.",
      "National polls suggest the Liberals have maintained a narrow lead entering last stretch.",
      "Still, Trump is not the only factor at play - he was only mentioned once in Poilievre's stump speech.",
      "The Conservative leader has focused more on voters disaffected by what he calls a \"Lost Liberal decade\", promising change from a government he blames for the housing shortage and a sluggish economy, and for mishandling social issues like crime and the fentanyl crisis.",
      "His pitch resonates with voters like Eric and Carri Gionet, from Barrie, Ontario. They have two daughters in their mid-20s and said they were attending their first ever political rally.",
      "\"We're pretty financially secure - but I worry about them,\" said Eric Gionet. While he and his wife could buy their first home while young, he said, \"there's no prospect\" their children will be able to do the same.",

      "Tapping into voter frustration has helped opposition parties sweep governments from power in democracies around the world. Canada seemed almost certain to follow suit.",
      "Last year, the Conservatives held a 20-point lead in national polls over the governing Liberals for months. Poilievre's future as the country's next prime minister seemed baked in.",
      "Then a series of shockwaves came in quick succession at the start of 2025, upending the political landscape: Justin Trudeau's resignation, Carney's subsequent rise to Liberal leader and prime minister; and the return of Trump to the White House with the threats and tariffs that followed.",
      "By the time the election was called in mid-March, Carney's Liberals were polling neck-and-neck with the Conservatives, and by early April they had pulled slightly ahead, national surveys suggest.",
      "It has been a stunning reversal of fortunes. Seemingly dead and buried, the Liberals now believe they could win a fourth successive election, and even a majority in Parliament.",
      "Carney is pitching himself as the man most ready to meet this critical moment - a steady central banker who helped shepherd Canada's economy through the 2008 financial crisis and later, the UK through Brexit.",
      "For Conservative voter Gwendolyn Slover, 69, from Summerside in the province of Prince Edward Island, his appeal is \"baffling\".",
      "\"Many people think Mark Carney is some kind of Messiah,\" she said. \"It's the same party, he's one person. And he's not going to change anything.\"",
      "For Carney's supporters, they see a strong CV and a poise that has calmed their anxieties over Trump's threats of steep tariffs and repeated suggestions the country should become the 51st US state - though the president has been commenting less frequently on Canada during the campaign.",
      "\"I'm very impressed by the stability and the serious thought process of Mark Carney,\" said Mike Brennan from Kitchener, Ontario, as he stood in line to meet the Liberal leader at a coffee shop in Cambridge, about an hour outside Toronto.",
      "Mr Brennan is a \"lifelong Liberal\" who did not initially plan to vote for the party in this election because of his dislike for Trudeau.",
      "The departure of former prime minister Trudeau, who had grown increasingly unpopular over his decade in power, released \"a massive pressure valve\", said Shachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute, a non-profit public opinion research organisation.",
      "\"All of these angry Liberals who are either parking their votes with the [left-wing] NDP or parking their votes with the Conservatives start re-coalescing,\" she said.",
      "Then more disaffected Liberals and other progressive voters began to migrate towards Carney's Liberals, driven by Trump, this election's \"main character\", Ms Kurl said.",
      "\"The threats, the annexation talk, all of that has been a huge motivator for left of centre voters.\"",
      "It has worked to Carney's advantage, with Trump's tariffs threats giving the political neophyte - he is the first prime minister never to have held elected public office - the chance to publicly audition to keep his job during the campaign.",
      "Trump's late-March announcement of global levies on foreign automobile imports allowed Carney to step away from the trail and take on the prime minister's mantle, setting up a call with the president and meeting US Cabinet ministers.",
      "He's never been tested in a gruelling federal election campaign, with its relentless travel, high-pressure demands for retail politics and daily media scrutiny. Yet on the campaign trail, and in the high-stakes debate with party leaders, he is considered to have performed well.",
      "Poilievre, in contrast, is a veteran politician and polished performer. But on the shifting political ground, Conservatives appeared to struggle to find their footing, pivoting their message from Canada being broken to \"Canada First\".",
      "Poilievre had to fend off criticism from political rivals that he is \"Trump lite\", with his combative style, his vows to end \"woke ideology\", and willingness to take on the \"global elite\".",

      "A young female South African doctor has sparked a nationwide conversation about a form of domestic abuse often shrouded in silence - financial abuse.",
      "In a series of viral videos Dr Celiwe Ndaba opened up about how she said she had been financially exploited by her husband, how it had spiralled and led to their separation.",
      "Often sitting in her car on her way to work, the mother of three vlogged over two weeks about how despite her successful career she had become trapped in a toxic marriage for years, feeling manipulated to fund her husband's lifestyle - in particular his desire to drive a Mercedes Benz.",
      "Taking out loans for him to buy such vehicles was the \"worst decision\" of her life, putting the family under huge financial pressure, said Dr Ndaba - who since sharing her story has reverted to using her maiden name and the number of her followers has ballooned.",
      "Despite pleas for her husband to downgrade, she said he refused - accusing her of wanting to \"turn him into a laughing stock by making him drive a small car\".",
      "The medic said she was speaking out as she wanted to issue a warning to others - that it was not only \"uneducated\" and \"less fortunate\" women who find themselves in abusive relationships.",
      "Her estranged husband, Temitope Dada, has not responded to a BBC request for comment.",
      "In the wake of the social media storm, he set up a TikTok account, where in one of his first videos he acknowledged: \"You may know me as\u2026 'Mr Benz or nothing.'\"",
      "The few posts he has made are accompanied by hashtags such as #divorcetrauma - saying the accusations are lies.",
      "Nonetheless, the comments section on Dr Ndaba's TikTok and other social media platforms have transformed into support groups, filled with female breadwinners sharing eerily similar stories.",
      "\"You are brave to speak out so publicly\u2026 I have been suffering in silence,\" one person commented.",
      "Bertus Preller, a lawyer based in Cape Town, believes this is because although South African women are becoming doctors, lawyers and entrepreneurs, getting well-paid jobs does not necessarily free them from the clutches of the patriarchy.",
      "Women's financial independence clashes with \"cultural norms that prioritise male authority\", he says.",
      "If anything, their success appears to make them targets.",
      "Financial abuse occurs when one partner dominates or exploits the other's financial resources, the lawyer explains.",
      "\"It is a subtle yet potent tactic of domestic violence, aimed at keeping the victim under control,\" he says.",
      "In South Africa, this is legally classified as economic abuse under the Domestic Violence Act.",
      "Mr Preller says things like \"unjustly withholding money for essentials or interfering with shared assets,\" are covered by the act.",
      "A university lecturer, who requested anonymity, told the BBC how her husband had lied about his qualifications and eventually left her in financial ruin.",
      "It started with her car that he mostly drove but never refuelled. Then loans she took out for his multiple failed business ventures. Finally, there came an eviction notice as she said he had stopped contributing towards rent, leaving her to shoulder all the expenses for their family, which included three children.",
      "Despite this, they stayed together for close to a decade - even though he was also physically abusive.",
      "\"He's very smart... I was in love with his smartness, his big dreams. But he couldn't follow them up with actions. His pride was his downfall,\" she said.",
      "Even when he managed to get some money, he still did not contribute.",
      "\"He started withholding whatever money he had for himself. He'd go out drinking with his friends, come back - the salary is gone,\" she said.",
      "Legal financial expert Somila Gogoba says that beyond the control of money, financial abuse often has deep psychological roots.",
      "\"For the abuser, this behaviour may stem from feelings of inadequacy, fear of abandonment, or the need for dominance,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"For the victim, the psychological impact includes feelings of worthlessness, fear, and dependence, which can be paralysing.\"",
      "Research from the University of South Africa suggests these are not isolated cases \u2013 and that women who out-earn their partners face significantly higher risks of intimate partner violence.",
      "Out of their in-depth study of 10 women who were the primary breadwinners of their families, only two were married.",
      "\"For eight of the participants, their choice of being single resulted from their experiences of physical, emotional and sexual violence\u2026 All the women said they believed that their role as female breadwinners was viewed as threatening to the traditional male role of a provider,\" said researcher Bianca Parry.",
      "Ms Gogoba says female breadwinners are less valued than their male counterparts, despite their economic contributions: \"This cultural backdrop can encourage some partners to feel entitled to control the finances, even when they do not contribute equally.",
      "\"This control is not just about money - it is also about power and maintaining a grip on the relationship dynamics.\"",
      "Nombulelo Shange, sociologist lecturer at the University of the Free State, says it is part of a growing pattern in South Africa of middle-class women being financially exploited.",
      "\"Black women face a double patriarchy: Western expectations at work, traditional expectations at home. When these collide, harmful ideologies escalate,\" she told the BBC.",
      "She explained that balancing the pressures of being a successful woman, but playing the role of \"the caregiver, the mother, the good wife, the good neighbour and community member who goes to church every Sunday\", was difficult as women were always taught to tiptoe around men's egos.",
      "Since Dr Ndaba's revelations, women on social media have shared stories of giving their male partners their debit or credit cards when they go out to eat so it appears as though he is paying for the meal.",
      "For Dr Shange this shows how the burden of a happy home is often placed on the woman's shoulders.",
      "\"You think: 'If I just get them a car, they'll be happy.' Love makes you blind. When your person struggles, you struggle too - you want to fix it,\" she said.",
      "By the time the university lecturer divorced her husband, she was left with debts of 140,000 rand ($7,500; \u00a35,600) - all racked up in her name.",
      "\"Before, I could plan things like holidays. Now they are a luxury,\" she said.",

      "They strongly suspect RSF fighters took some of the valuables to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). They produced no evidence. However the UN panel of experts on Sudan has reported that the RSF has been exporting significant quantities of gold to the UAE, since even before the war.",
      "The UAE has also been widely accused of funding the RSF, although both parties have always denied these accusations.",
      "\"We had a strong room for the gold collection, they managed to open it and took all the gold,\" Ms Ahmed said.",
      "\"Maybe they kept it for themselves, or maybe they traded it in the market.\"",
      "So the whereabouts of pieces like a gold collar from the pyramid of King Talakhamani at Nuri, which dates to the 5th Century BC, are unknown.",
      "Asked about the value of what was taken, Ms Ahmed replied simply: \"There is no value for the museum artefacts, it's more expensive than you could imagine.\"",
      "The de facto government of Sudan says it will contact Interpol and Unesco to attempt to recover artefacts looted from the National Museum and elsewhere.",
      "However recovering the artefacts seems a difficult and perhaps even dangerous task, with little immediate prospect of success.",
      "The government, and other Sudanese observers, say the RSF's attacks against museums, universities and buildings like the National Records Office are a conscious attempt to destroy the Sudanese state - but, again, the RSF denies this.",
      "Amgad Farid, who runs the Fikra for Studies and Development think-tank, is particularly critical of the looting.",
      "\"The RSF's actions transcend mere criminality,\" he wrote in a piece shared by his organisation.",
      "\"They constitute a deliberate and malicious assault on Sudan's historical identity, targeting the invaluable heritage of Nubian, Coptic, and Islamic civilisations spanning over 7,000 years, constituting a cornerstone of African and global history, enshrined within these museums.",
      "\"This is not an incidental loss amid conflict - it is a calculated endeavour to erase Sudan's legacy, to sever its people from their past, and to plunder millennia of human history for profit.\"",
      "The story of the National Museum \u2013 taken over by armed men, its gold and valuables looted and stolen \u2013 mirrors the individual stories of so many Sudanese in this conflict: they have been forced to flee, their houses occupied, their gold stolen.",
      "According to the UN, nearly 13 million people have been forced from their homes since the fighting began in 2023, while an estimated 150,000 people have been killed.",
      "\"The war is against the people of Sudan,\" Ms Ahmed says, bemoaning the war's human cost, as well as the unimaginable loss of centuries of heritage.",
      "She - along with other like-minded individuals - intend to restore the National Museum and other looted institutions.",

    "summary": "In Alberta, many voters feel alienated by the country\u2019s elite - some are even tempted by Trump\u2019s call to join the US.",
    "story": [
      "The threat to Canada's sovereignty from US President Donald Trump has dominated the election, but the country also faces a challenge from within. Some western Canadians, fed up with a decade of Liberal rule, are openly calling for separation.",
      "Standing in front of a crowd of about 100 squeezed into a small event hall in the city of Lethbridge, Dennis Modry is asking locals about Alberta's future.",
      "Who thinks Alberta should have a bigger role in Canada, he asks? A dozen or so raise their hands.",
      "Who thinks the province should push for a split from Canada and form its own nation? About half the crowd raise their hands.",
      "\"How many people would like Alberta to join the US?\" Another show of support from half the crowd.",
      "Mr Modry, a retired heart surgeon, is a co-leader of the Alberta Prosperity Project, a grassroots organisation pushing for an independence referendum.",
      "The possibility of a split has long been a talking point in this conservative-leaning province. But two factors have given it new momentum: Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st US state, and the subsequent boost that has given the Liberal Party in the polls ahead of Monday's federal election.",
      "Mr Modry told the BBC the separatist movement has grown in recent months - driven in part, he believes, by the president's rhetoric.",
      "\"We're not interested in that\", he said. \"We're interested in Alberta sovereignty.\"",
      "Jeffrey Rath, however - a lawyer and rancher from Calgary who is another of the project's co-founders - was not as dismissive of Trump's 51st state suggestion. Although he agrees independence is the priority, he could see a future where Alberta joined with the US.",
      "\"We have a lot more culturally in common with our neighbours to the south in Montana\u2026 [and] with our cousins in Texas, than we do anywhere else,\" he said.",
      "Previously on the political fringes, the possibility of a unity crisis is now being discussed out in the open.",
      "In an opinion piece for national newspaper the Globe and Mail, Preston Manning - an Albertan considered one of the founders of the modern conservative movement in Canada - warned \"large numbers of Westerners simply will not stand for another four years of Liberal government, no matter who leads it\".",
      "Accusing the party of mismanaging national affairs and ignoring the priorities of western Canadians, he added: \"A vote for the Carney Liberals is a vote for Western secession \u2013 a vote for the breakup of Canada as we know it.\"",
      "This sense of \"western alienation\", a term used to describe the feeling that the region is often overlooked by politicians in Canada's capital, is nothing new. For decades, many in the oil and gas-rich prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan have bemoaned how they are underrepresented, despite the region's economic significance for the country as a whole.",
      "That resentment grew under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, which brought in environmental policies some Albertans view as a direct attack on the region's economic growth.",
      "National polls suggest the Liberals, now under the leadership of Mark Carney, could be headed for their fourth consecutive win come election day on Monday. That it could come in part because of a surge of support in Ontario and Quebec - the eastern provinces where so much of the population is concentrated - only adds to the regional divide.",
      "Judy Schneider, whose husband works in the oil industry in Calgary, told the BBC she would vote \"yes\" in an independence referendum.",
      "She said she didn't see Carney, who spent much of the last decade away from Canada but was raised in Edmonton, Alberta's capital, as a westerner.",
      "\"He can come and say 'I'm from Alberta,' but is he?\" Ms Schneider said.",
      "An independent Alberta remains an unlikely prospect - a recent Angus Reid poll suggested that only one in four Albertans would vote to leave Canada if a referendum were held now. A majority of Canadians, however, feel the issue should be taken seriously, a separate Nanos poll indicated.",
      "Political analysts say the divide will pose a challenge to the country's next prime minister, especially if Carney wins. And even a victory for Calgary-born Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre would \"not solve the imbalance that presently exists between the East and the West,\" Mr Modry, the activist, said.",
      "That wider sentiment has pushed Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, who leads the United Conservative Party, to strike her own path in trade talks with the US, while other provincial leaders and the federal government have co-ordinated their efforts closely. She even visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.",
      "In Canada, Smith has publicly warned of a \"national unity crisis\" if Alberta's demands - which centre around repealing Trudeau-era environmental laws to accelerate oil and gas production - are not met by the new prime minister within six months of the election.",
      "While Smith has dismissed talk of outright separation as \"nonsense\", critics have accused her of stoking the flames at such a consequential time for Canada's future.",
      "Even those within the separatist movement have different ideas on how best to achieve their goals.",
      "Lorna Guitton, a born-and-bred Albertan and a volunteer with the Alberta Prosperity Project, told the BBC in Lethbridge that her aim was for the province to have a better relationship with the rest of Canada.",
      "She described the current union as \"broken\", and believes a referendum, or the threat of it, will give Albertans \"leverage\" in future negotiations with Ottawa.",
      "But Ms Guitton also dismissed any notion of it becoming a 51st US state.",
      "\"They've got enough of their own problems. Why would I want to be part of that?\" she said. \"I would rather be my own independent, sovereign province, or a province with a better deal in Canada.\"",

      "He is currently putting together a \"fact-finding\" delegation to travel to Washington DC and bring the movement directly to the Trump administration.",

      "Ten people \u2014 nine men and a woman \u2014 are on trial on charges of robbery and kidnapping of the media personality and the concierge of the residence where she was staying on the night of Oct. 2, 2016. Two of them acknowledged their participation and the others denied it.",
      "Kardashian was in France for Fashion Week when men dressed as police officers allegedly tied her up with zip ties and duct tape, held her at gunpoint and stole $10 million worth of jewelry, including a $4 million diamond ring given to her by her then-husband Kanye West.",
      "In interviews and on her family's reality TV show, Kardashian described being terrified, thinking she was going to be raped and killed when the criminals broke into her bedroom and pointed a gun at her.",

      "Bobby Darin was a major pop star \u2026 a singer, dancer, musician, and an Oscar nominee. He was the entertainer who did it all, except Broadway. Until now!",
      "Tony Award-winner Jonathan Groff (\"Merrily We Roll Along\") plays the icon of the late 1950s and '60s in the musical \"Just in Time.\" \"He was at the height of his powers, when he was on the floor of a nightclub with the audience in the palm of his hand,\" said Groff.",
      "For Darin, a live audience was oxygen. So, too, for Groff: \"You can feel this vibration between performer and audience member. [It's], to me, the most essential thing to ignite in the telling of his story.\"",
      "It's taken seven years and a whole lot of sweat to bring the show to Broadway. The casting of Groff \u2013 beloved for his roles on stage, and as Kristoff in the \"Frozen\" movies \u2013 might not seem obvious. Groff grew up on a horse farm in Pennsylvania Mennonite country; Darin was a scrappy Italian kid from the Bronx.",

And you can't roughhouse with kids' ('cause he was frail and sickly). 'But you can learn to sing. You can learn to dance. You can learn to play piano.' And it opened a whole world.\"",
      "\"Frail and sickly\" was no exaggeration. Born Walden Robert Cassotto, Darin suffered several bouts of rheumatic fever as a child, permanently damaging his heart. When he was a boy, he overheard a family doctor say that he wouldn't live beyond his teenage years. \"Put yourself in that position,\" said Dodd. \"So, he was ambitious. He was driven. He was always on the go. He was trying to jam it all in, 'cause he knew he didn't have time.\"",
      "With no time to waste, he began writing songs, and at 22, Bobby Darin made waves with a recording of \"Splish Splash.\"",
      "Bobby Darin performs \"Splish Splash\" (1958):",
      "Not one to play it safe, for his second album, in 1959, Darin took a dark ballad from the German \"Threepenny Opera\" and made it swing. \"When my dad took 'Mack the Knife' before it was released and had Dick Clark listen to it, he said, 'Why are you doing this? This is gonna bomb!'\" Dodd said.",
      "It won the Grammy for record of the year, and became the biggest hit of Darin's career.",
      "The next year, he was on his way to Italy to make his motion picture debut opposite America's sweetheart, Sandra Dee. \"We hit it right off,\" Darin said. \"She hated me and I loved her, and that was it.\"",
      "The teen idol married the teen movie star in December of 1960, and welcomed their son, Dodd, a year later. Dodd would later write, \"My father made his destiny. Destiny made my mother.\"",
      "What did he mean by that? \"Well, my mom went through a lot,\" he said. \"Never really wanted fame. She really didn't crave it. It just sort of happened. Unlike my dad, who loved performing, loved show business.\"",
      "Dee was looking for a home life, said Dodd, but Bobby Darin wasn't ready to slow down. The marriage ended after six years. Darin never stopped playing the clubs.",
      "Sammy Davis Jr. once said that Bobby Darin was the one person he wouldn't want to have to follow. \"Absolutely true,\" said Dodd. \"My dad idolized Sammy.\"",
      "The feeling was mutual, as seen in a 1959 broadcast of \"This Is Your Life\":",
      "Also featured during the episode was Nina, the woman Darin thought was his sister. But almost a decade later he would learn a long-held family secret: Nina was in fact Bobby's mother, having given birth to him out of wedlock as a teenager. Which made Polly, the woman he thought was his mother, his grandmother. \"He was never the same,\" said Dodd. \"He said that his whole life was a lie; he was, like, a fraud. It's just devastating. There's no sugarcoating it.\"",
      "Looking at that tape today, says Dodd, it all seems obvious. \"That's a mother's love,\" he said. \"That's not a sister, okay? That's the adulation of, 'This is my son,' but you can't say it.\"",
      "Dodd, who was seven years old when his father found out, remembers a change in your father from that time: \"I'm not gonna say it's directly attributed to that incident; I'm sure that's part of it. But he got into the Bob Darin stage, you know? He took off his toupee. No more tuxedo. Started doing folk music, protest music, writing music, and dropped out of show business for a while.",
      "\"And that was some of the best times I had with him. He was a regular dude. We were up in Big Sur in a trailer, hanging out. And yeah, he let his hair down, if you will. It was good times.\"",
      "Bobby Darin performs \"Simple Song of Freedom\" (1970):",
      "In December of 1973, Bobby Darin's heart finally gave out. He was 37. Dodd had just turned 12. Now 63, Dodd Darin is grateful that, with the new Broadway show, a new generation can learn the story of his father.",
      "\"It's so beautiful that all these years later \u2013 he's been gone over 50 years \u2013 we're here talking about him. We're remembering him,\" said Dodd. \"He did something right.\"",

    "story": [
      "Legendary trumpeter Herb Alpert celebrated his 90th birthday last month by taking the stage at Jazz at Lincoln Center with a new iteration of the Tijuana Brass, marking his return to the iconic group format for the first time in 40 years.",
      "The milestone performance coincides with the 60th anniversary of his landmark album \"Whipped Cream & Other Delights,\" which spent eight weeks at No. 1 after its 1965 release and helped define the sound of the era.",
      "\"It has been overwhelming. I didn't realize I'd get this much attention at 90,\" Alpert said.",
      "Alpert's distinctive brass sound, inspired by bullfights in Tijuana, dominated the 1960s music landscape \u2014 appearing in television commercials, game shows like \"The Dating Game,\" and films including \"Casino Royale.\" At his commercial peak in 1966, Alpert had three albums in the top five simultaneously and outsold The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Frank Sinatra.",
      "\"Sometimes I was even a little embarrassed by it all,\" Alpert admitted.",
      "His classic hit \"Ladyfingers\" recently found new life on TikTok, generating what Alpert described as \"three billion streams\" on YouTube, a phenomenon he finds \"strange, because I recorded it like 60 years ago.\"",
      "The trumpet virtuoso's career hasn't been without challenges. By 1969, while going through a divorce, Alpert faced a personal crisis with his instrument. He described the trumpet as \"my enemy\" as he struggled with confidence and technique. A breakthrough came after consulting New York brass teacher Carmine Caruso, who reminded him that the trumpet was \"just a piece of plumbing\" and that \"the instrument comes from deep inside you.\"",
      "Alpert also co-founded A&M Records with the late Jerry Moss, operating on a handshake agreement from 1962 until they sold the company in 1990. The two never signed a formal contract, a fact that still moves Alpert to tears when he recalls their partnership.",
      "Now touring with a newly assembled Tijuana Brass, Alpert says the music feels fresh again. Alpert continues to perform with his wife of 52 years, singer Lani Hall, whom he met when his label signed Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66.",
      "\"I try to be as authentic as I can when I play,\" he said. \"I'm playing in the moment of my life. And it's a hard place to get to. But that's the place I'm always looking for.\"",

    "story": [
      "All David Hyde Pierce has to do is step out on stage, and he gets applause, even before he launches into the idiotic tongue-twister from \"The Pirates of Penzance\":",
      "I am the very model of a modern Major-General,I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral,I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historicalFrom Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical",
      "With practically no expression on his face, babbling away, all kinds of commotion around him, he's funny.",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think 'less is more' can be funny?\"",
      "\"Well, I think so much of theater, rightly, is MORE,\" Pierce replied. \"Sometimes, what's unexpected in theater is someone doing less.\"",
      "\"Is there a temptation to overact?\"",
      "\"Always,\" he said. \"You remind me of a great line from 'Frasier,' which was, 'If less is more, think how much more MORE will be!'\"",
      "It is thanks to his 11-year run on the TV mega-hit \"Frasier\" that Pierce has the recognition, and can afford to pick and choose his roles. He's the Major-General in \"Pirates! The Penzance Musical,\" a jazzy re-working of the Gilbert & Sullivan classic, transplanted to New Orleans.",
      "Pierce showed us one of the Gilbert & Sullivan scores from his summer camp from the 1970s (\"It's almost as old as I am\"), which was also the score he used for an episode of \"Frasier\" where he, Kelsey Grammer and David Ogden Stiers sang from \"Penzance.\"",
      "I asked, \"What does Gilbert & Sullivan mean to you?\"",
      "\"Hmm. Well, it must mean something, 'cause it's \u2026 I'm getting emotional,\" Pierce replied. \"Thinking about the question, I guess it's just, it's just because it's been threaded through my life for so long.\"",
      "In his dressing room at the Roundabout Theatre, the wall is covered with photographs of people who were in the dressing room before: \"Famous people, a lot of them dear friends of mine,\" he said. \"I'll be up there eventually. Tradition is very important to us. It's being aware that you're part of something bigger.\"",
      "Pierce's \"Pirates\" dressing room is full of nods to the emotional touchstones that define him, including one of the most important: a photograph of him talking to his dad about a show he was doing, \"at a time when I didn't even know that that's what I was going into, had no idea what was lying ahead,\" he said.",
      "Pierce's father and his grandfather were amateur performers. \"The disease runs in the family,\" he said. \"I just hadn't been diagnosed, I guess!\"",
      "He set out to be a concert pianist. He still plays every day, but decided to become an actor instead while he was a student at Yale.",
      "And what brought him to comedy? \"I think it has to do with what I was drawn to,\" Pierce said. \"I watched reruns of 'The Dick Van Dyke Show' and 'Mary Tyler Moore' and 'All in the Family.' When I was a teenager, 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' came to American television on PBS, and my head blew off. I loved Alec Guinness. Oh, and Buster Keaton. Oh my God, Buster Keaton!\"",
      "It's impossible not to see a hint of Buster Keaton in Pierce's famous ironing board scene from \"Frasier\":",
      "Pierce said, \"I do want people to be able to laugh.\"",
      "\"Why? What does that mean to you? Why is it important?\"",
      "\"I guess it's the perception of connection,\" he said. \"For example, doing a comic film is not nearly as enjoyable for me as doing a comic play. In a comic play, you feel from the audience the connection. That's what I'm in it for. That's where I started out. I love that.\"",
      "For almost as long as he's been in it, his partner along the way, his husband since 2008, has been actor-writer Brian Hargrove. They met at an audition, became friends, and only later discovered they were both gay. \"Brian had me over to dinner at his apartment to do my taxes,\" said Pierce.",
      "\"I used to have a tax business as well as an actor,\" said Hargrove.",
      "\"That's not a metaphor; that's actually what he was doing. Tax practitioner! And then we were going to see this movie, and it came up. We went back to his apartment, and then, as Brian puts it, I never left.\"",
      "That was in 1983. It was Hargrove who suggested moving to California, which led to Pierce being cast as Dr. Niles Crane alongside Kelsey Grammer in \"Frasier.\" Forty years, four Emmys and two Tonys later, he chose not to be in the \"Frasier\" reboot. At the time he was playing Julia Child's husband, Paul, on HBO. \"I've been very happy with what originally came to me, and then when I've been able to make choices in my career and the choices I've made,\" Pierce said. \"My creativity is fueled by change and by diversity.\"",
      "Which is why David Hyde Pierce said yes to \"Pirates\" \u2013 and a new chance to make people laugh in one of his old favorites.",

You could do whatever you wanna do and I'm gonna be right there to help make it happen.\"",
      "Impact on parenting",
      "Knowles spoke with King about how different her daughters were growing up. She said once a teacher recommended Beyonc\u00e9 repeat a grade in school. Knowles said, now a global superstar, Beyonc\u00e9 was shy and quiet until she got to know people.",
      "\"Never shy around us,\" Knowles said. \"At home, she was entertaining. She was singing, she was dancing and she was doing all the things that I did. \u2026 So she would get quiet until she got to know you.\"",
      "A former teacher told Knowles in her evaluation that Beyonc\u00e9 was a bright student.",
      "\"I took her to Ms. Little. ... Was an ex-teacher there who was very stern, but she said, 'there's nothing wrong with this girl. This girl is very bright. She just doesn't care to let you know it.'\"",
      "Conversely, Knowles described Solange as \"very outgoing\" and would \"walk into the room and be like, 'yes, I'm here.'\"",
      "When Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange were 12 and 7 years old, Knowles put them in therapy together. It was a controversial decision within her own family as her then husband, Mathew Knowles, objected.",
      "\"He was like, 'I don't want any parts of that,'\" Knowles said.",
      "For Knowles it was important as she started to see separation between her two daughters.",
      "\"Beyonc\u00e9 had become like this little star in the town and she was always so close to Solange and so kind to her, but then she was in the singing group, so everything took place in our house,\" she said. The other girls in the group would tell Solange to shut up and be quiet and all that and I started noticing that she wasn't protecting her sister.\"",
      "Knowles' goal through therapy was to ensure the two grew up close, telling King, \"whatever I have to do to make that happen.\"",
      "Beginnings of Destiny's Child",
      "Knowles said she tried to be a singer, and although for her it didn't work out, she used her skills to help her daughters achieve their dreams.",
      "\"God has always given me these tools from day one that I could go back and pull out and who would've ever thought that I would wind up making costumes for Destiny's Child? Or that I would be doing hair and all the things I did for our group and even the rehearsals and the discipline of that and the harmonies \u2026 I got to use it with the girls,\" she said.",
      "But Knowles admits there were problems along the way. She said the label didn't like the way she styled Destiny's Child.",
      "\"They dressed like an R&B group. We love the big glamour. And their hair was too big 'cause we came from Texas,\" she said. \"They just thought that it was too much for those young girls and that they should be in jeans and t-shirts like all the pop icons at the time. In the meantime, everywhere we went, people were saying,' Where can we get these outfits?'\"",
      "Knowles said the criticism from the label hurt her feelings, but it was a moment she remembers her husband, Mathew, pushing back.",
      "\"He was just bold and when I talk about him, that's one of the things that he went to bat for me all the time, he fought, he protected me.\"",
      "Navigating marriage and parenting criticisms",
      "Knowles also wrote candidly in her memoir about the highs and lows of her 30-year marriage to Mathew Knowles.",
      "She said from the beginning, there was infidelity in their marriage on his part and she realized she needed to be prepared.",
      "\"I was pregnant and things were \u2014 they just got really bad at that time. I knew that I had to make a move and I didn't want to be dependent on him,\" she said.",
      "She started planning what she called her escape plan. Knowles opened a hair salon called Headliners, which was so successful it became the family's main source of income and helped to fund Beyonc\u00e9's budding musical career. Mathew Knowles left his sales executive role at Xerox and started working as Destiny's Child's manager full-time. Their partnership as parents helped to hold their marriage together.",
      "\"People say to me, 'how did you stay so long?' And I'm like, 'well, I was married for 33 years, but 33 years were not bad.' \u2026 You know, maybe 15 of them were bad, but we would have these long stretches where we would do really great.\"",
      "While their marriage struggled, Knowles said they were always present parents, but subject to scrutiny. She recalled the criticism people would say after Solange became pregnant as a teenager.",
      "\"Crazy stuff like, 'well you wasn't paying no attention. You're so busy running behind B that you couldn't see' \u2014 blah, blah, blah. I'm like, 'that is absolutely not true.'\"",
      "Knowles went on to say, people didn't understand Solange's history.",
      "\"They didn't know the backstory of Solange losing her best friend and wanting to hurry up and be a grownup 'cause she thought she wouldn't live so long.\"",
      "Knowles said Solange made it clear she was getting married.",
      "\"I said, 'OK, well let me at least give you a wedding,' you know, and made it memorable for her,\u00a0 but you can't control somebody else's life. It's their life.\"",
      "Knowles also wrote about an untrue rumor that surfaced during Beyonc\u00e9's first pregnancy, where people said she wasn't carrying the baby.",
      "\"She went on a show in Australia and she had this very broad cloth type of dress,\" Knowles said about Beyonc\u00e9. \"She wasn't huge pregnant. She was very proud of her little stomach and she bent over and the fabric of the dress bent \u2026 they started this vicious, horrible rumor that she wasn't pregnant.\"",
      "Knowles expressed her heartache over the situation and anger over people thinking her daughter faked a pregnancy and used prosthetics.",
      "\"I was never so enraged because this should have been a sacred experience and what they didn't know is that my child had been through a couple miscarriages, which were so painful.\"",
      "Knowles admitted she did not speak up even as the devastating rumor escalated, saying that Beyonc\u00e9 thought it would go away and handles these situations well.",
      "\"I'm not so good at that. I will cuss you out about my kids,\" Knowles said. \"That was one of the worst times of my life. It really was. I would cry, I would get so mad and I would get so upset.\"",
      "Divorces and moving forward",
      "When she decided to get divorced from Mathew Knowles, she said she spent a week in bed depressed. Her longtime therapist gave her an exercise to do: Make a list of accomplishments and failures.",
      "\"I had such an easy time writing the bad stuff. When I got to the positive stuff, I had such a hard time,\" she said. \"What I realized about myself is that I wasn't really comfortable with people telling me great things about me.\"",
      "She said she had not taken credit for some of her accomplishments in the past, like her work with Destiny's Child in an effort to be humble. She would tell herself, \"it's not about you.\"",
      "But then she started making her list.",
      "\"I started getting mad and writing those things down,\" she said. \"I started my salon. It was a success. You know, I raised some great kids. All the people I've met in my life, like I have had a hell of a life.\"",
      "Four years after her divorce from Mathew Knowles, Tina Knowles married actor Richard Lawson. They were together for 10 years. She said she feels grateful for the relationship, even though it ultimately ended.",
      "\"I've known Richard for 40-something years and I think he's a great person,\" she said. \"So I don't have any regrets about the time that we spent together. I did feel a lot of pressure about ending the marriage because I had so many people to come up to me and tell me about that hope, but \u2013 it's not a tragedy.\"",
      "She said she would love to find love again, but is at peace if she doesn't.",
      "\"I am finally feeling \u2014 it is sad that I'm 71 years old and I know that I am enough and if I don't I'm gonna be just fine because I got such a full, great life. And I'm so blessed, and you know, it's gonna be \u2013 it's all good.\"",

      "The plans outlined by NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to amass a broad swath of confidential health data, as part of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s autism research effort, have been the subject of intense criticism in recent days by advocacy groups and autism researchers.",

    "summary": "The drop-off in shipments could lead to empty store shelves this summer as retailers deem China-made goods too expensive to import.",
    "story": [
      "Shipments of goods from China to the U.S. are dropping sharply with the Trump administration's steep tariffs in place, leading major U.S. retailers to warn about impending supply shortages.",
      "The trade war between China and the U.S. has escalated over the past few weeks, with each nation hiking its import duties multiple times in a tit-for-tat. While Trump has given other countries a 90-day pause on the tariffs, as their leaders pledged to negotiate with the U.S., China has remained the exception.",
      "U.S. import duties on Chinese products now stand as high as 145%. China, meanwhile, has hit back with 125% tariffs on U.S. products.",
      "At the Port of Los Angeles, which, along with the Port of Long Beach, receives roughly 40% of all imports from Asia, shipments last week were down 10% compared with the same period one year earlier. That number is expected to keep falling.",
      "\"We are now beginning to see the flow of cargo to the Port of Los Angeles slow,\" Port of Los Angeles executive director Eugene Seroka said at a Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners meeting on April 24. \"It's my prediction that in two weeks time, arrivals will drop by 35%,\" he added.",
      "U.S. retailers had rushed to import goods into the country ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariffs going into effect, leading to a spike in imports since last summer. Now, with the 145% tariffs making goods from China roughly two-and-a-half times more expensive than they were last year, \"essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers have ceased,\" Seroka said.",
      "By another estimate, container bookings from China to the U.S. are down by as much as 60%, according to Flexport, a supply chain management company.",
      "The dip comes during what is usually a busy period for imports to the U.S. \"We would normally see an increase in bookings across the board, because this is the beginning of the shipping year,\" said Nathan Strang, director of ocean freight at Flexport. \"It's when back-to-school items and Halloween items start to come in.\"",
      "What's more, retailers have likely stockpiled sufficient inventory to last a couple of months, Seroka said, adding that come summer, consumers could find that many products are out of stock. All manner of goods flow through the Port of Los Angeles to end up in households across the U.S.",
      "The port's top five import categories are furniture, auto parts, clothing, plastics and footwear, a port spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Empty shelves?",
      "Major retailers and small establishments alike are warning that consumers could soon face tariff-related inventory shortages. Goods that do land on store shelves could be subject to price hikes, once \"tariff surcharges\" are added.",
      "Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chef economist at private equity firm Apollo Global Management, said in a recent blog post that tariffs will\u00a0lead to \"empty shelves in U.S. stores in a few weeks and COVID-like shortages for consumers and for firms using Chinese products as intermediate goods.\"",
      "Last week, the CEOs of Walmart and Target privately cautioned\u00a0President Trump that his sweeping tariff policy could lead to gaps on store shelves, if it remains in effect,\u00a0Axios first reported.",
      "\"We had a productive meeting with President Trump and his team and appreciated the opportunity to share our insights,\" Walmart\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "Target also said in a statement that it \"had a productive meeting with President Trump and our retail peers to discuss the path forward on trade, and we remain committed to delivering value for American consumers.\"",
      "Both retailers had previously publicly warned that the levies could lead to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"We never want to raise prices,\" but \"there probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers,\" Walmart CFO John David Rainey\u00a0told CNBC.",
      "Last month, Target CEO Brian Cornell\u00a0told CNBC, \"the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days\" as a result of tariffs planned on imports from Mexico.",
      "Widespread booking freeze",
      "Logistics groups are also reporting sharp declines in cargo shipments from China.",
      "For the week of April 14, booking volumes from China to the U.S. dropped 45% compared with the same period one year earlier, according to Vizion, a container tracking service.",
      "\"This dramatic drop aligned with two key developments: the April 4th U.S. tariff announcement, followed by China's retaliatory measures announced on April 5th. The result? A widespread booking freeze, as shippers paused mid-shipment cycle to reassess costs, timelines and broader trade strategy,\" Vizion said in a report.",
      "Freightos, a freight booking platform, notes that carriers are canceling sailings from China at a fast clip, because they can't fill their ships with goods. Ocean container prices have dropped from $8,100 in July 2024 for a standard 40-foot container, to roughly, $2,327, the group noted.",
      "Many importers are pausing shipments until they gain more clarity into Mr. Trump's tariff plans. A Freightos survey of 195 small importers found that 33% of businesses planned to pause shipments in response to the tariffs.",
      "Kristin Bear, owner of a U.S.-based lingerie company, Kilo Brava, is hoping Mr. Trump softens his stance on tariffs, so that she can continue to manufacture garments in China and import them to the U.S. She can't afford to import goods with 145% tariffs in place, and if they don't come down, \"we'll just have to abandon the goods and close the company,\" she said.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 08:51:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Early in his second term, President Trump is struggling to deliver on his campaign trail promises to invigorate the U.S. economy.",
    "story": [
      "During his campaign last year, President Trump repeatedly attacked former President Joe Biden for his handling of the economy, vowing to boost economic growth and\u00a0lower inflation. But 100 days into his second term in the White House, the president is struggling to deliver on those promises.",
      "Mr. Trump's signature policies on trade, immigration and government spending have not only failed to spark economic growth \u2014 they're contributing to a sharp contraction in activity and threaten to re-ignite inflation, data shows. Economists also\u00a0warn that the chances of a U.S. recession\u00a0are rising.",
      "For millions of employers around the country, the Trump administration's helter-skelter approach to imposing tariffs on key trading partners, along with just about every other country on the planet,\u00a0has been challenging, corporate executives and small business owners have told CBS News.",
      "\"I can't think of a precedent for anything like this,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at investment advisory firm Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch of the impact of Mr. Trump's first 100 days on the economy.",
      "\"President Reagan, for instance, implemented a lot of changes in terms of tax policy and defense spending and cuts, and those things had big impacts,\" she added, \"but the element here that's quite different is the approach, which has been quite inconsistent and chaotic.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump's loyal base of supporters continues to voice support, among other voters there's also a widespread and growing belief that the administration is too focused on\u00a0tariffs\u00a0and not focused enough on lowering prices, according to CBS News polling about the president's first 100 days in office.",
      "Such concerns come as the White House makes a sharp break with the country's traditional playbook on global trade. The result, say critics, includes the highest tariffs in more than a century; sudden, confusing\u00a0shifts in tariff policy\u00a0and major damage to the U.S.' geopolitical relationships.",
      "\"Tariffs have been an unmitigated disaster, economically,\" former Senator Phil Gramm, a Republican and erstwhile economics professor at Texas A&M University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There's no doubt about it that the tariff policy in and of itself will drive up prices because tariffs are a tax. And remember, 61% of imports are component parts to be used in the production of goods and services in America.\"",
      "Gramm added, \"I want to emphasize that the harm of tariffs isn't just inflation \u2014 it's what they do for efficiency and economic growth.\"",
      "The Trump administration stands by its economic record to date, with White House spokesman Kush Deai saying in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch that \"President Trump's America First policies are delivering much-needed economic relief for everyday Americans while laying the groundwork for a long-term restoration of American Greatness.\"",
      "\"Within 100 days of President Trump's second term in office, Americans saw the first monthly price drop in years in the March inflation report, while industry leaders ranging from Apple to Hyundai to Nvidia have made trillions in historic investment commitments to reshore manufacturing back to the United States,\" Desai added. \"President Trump delivered a historic economy in his first term, and he's running back the success in his second term.\"",
      "Economic slowdown",
      "Already, the U.S. economy is showing signs of slowing. Business surveys in April suggest the U.S. is headed for \"a sluggish pace of growth,\" according to Pantheon Macroeconomics, which pointed to what it calls an \"an existential crisis\" for businesses, created by Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The country's gross domestic product \u2014 the total annual value of all the goods and services produced in the U.S. \u2014 is forecast to slow to 0.8% in the first three months of 2025, a sharp decline from 2.4% in the fourth quarter of last year, according to economists polled by financial services firm FactSet. For the year, economic growth is predicted to slow to 1.9%, versus 2.8% in 2024, FactSet data shows.",
      "Economists warn that the U.S. could slip into a recession due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Prior to Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, economists largely gave the U.S. economy a good rating, pointing to its strong growth, low unemployment and progress in bringing inflation under control.",
      "Businesses large and small say the tariffs will cause disruptions, with almost 900 companies in the last 30 days alone citing the barrage of new U.S. levies in their earnings calls. That compares with 100 mentions in December 2024, according to transcripts posted by FactSet. Earlier this month, the CEOs of Walmart and Target\u00a0privately warned Mr. Trump that the tariffs could disrupt supply chains and lead to empty shelves within weeks.",
      "\"Most businesses plan to pass these costs on to their consumers, which will make things more expensive, and we're going to see cuts in consumer spending as a result,\" Vanden Houten of Oxford Economics said, adding that her firm isn't forecasting a recession although it has pared its GDP outlook. \"That's less revenue for businesses.\"",
      "Inflation fears flare",
      "Mr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to end the \"inflation nightmare,\" vowing that if he would bring down prices \"very quickly\" in a second term.",
      "But 100 days into his new administration, consumers are skeptical about Mr. Trump's vow to tackle inflation, with 63% telling CBS News in new polling that they believed his policies would cause grocery prices to go up. Only 15% said they believe his administration will help lower their grocery bills.",
      "Consumers are clearly worried about tariffs, with the same CBS News poll finding that 55% of respondents said Mr. Trump doesn't have a clear plan for tariffs and trade. Americans now expect inflation to rise to 6.5% a year,\u00a0according\u00a0to the University of Michigan's closely watched consumer sentiment index \u2014 a potentially self-fulling outlook that could cause consumers to pull back on spending.",
      "So far, however, inflation data shows that price increases eased to 2.4% in March, down from 2.8% in February. Falling gas prices have come as a relief for motorists, with the national average for a gallon of regular gas now at $3.17, compared with $3.66 a year ago, according to AAA.",
      "Still, many economists forecasts that inflation will pick up later this year as the impact of tariffs works its way through the economy.",
      "The case for tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump maintains that his tariff policies will benefit the U.S. economy over the long term. In his view, the cost of the tariffs will spur both U.S. and foreign businesses to expand in the U.S., spawning jobs for American workers and reinvigorating the U.S. manufacturing sector.",
      "Since Mr. Trump's inauguration, some businesses have said they are investing in domestic manufacturing, with Apple planning a $500 billion expansion of its U.S. facilities over four years and IBM on Monday announcing a $150 billion investment to \"fuel the economy.\"",
      "The president also maintains that tariffs will bring in trillions in new federal revenue , helping to offset an extension of his 2017 tax cuts currently being hammered out by Republican lawmakers. But many economists are skeptical that his tariffs could bring in as much as Mr. Trump claims, as consumers will likely reduce their spending on foreign goods\u00a0when their prices rise.",
      "\"Consumers have to be confident to affect their spending,\" noted Donald Boudreaux, an economist at George Mason University (whose book with Sen. Gramm, \"The Triumph of Economic Freedom: Debunking the Seven Great Myths of American Capitalism,\" will be published next month). \"The current policy is reducing their confidence.\"",
      "For his part, Mr. Trump has acknowledged that the impact of U.S. tariffs will cause \"some pain\" for Americans, while adding in a February social media post that \"IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.\"",
      "Market turmoil",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the Trump administration's economic policies has been clear: The S&P 500 index has lost 10% of its value since reaching a post-inauguration high on February 19, putting the broad-based market into correction territory.",
      "The dollar has lost about 9% of its value since Mr. Trump's inauguration, according to the U.S. dollar index, which compares the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies. Typically, investors rush to the bond market in times of economic uncertainty, but in recent weeks\u00a0bond prices have slid and yields have risen \u2014\u00a0 signs investors are rattled by the impact of Trump administration policies.",
      "\"I would emphasize that this movement in the asset markets is indeed unusual, and it happened particularly after April 2, 'Liberation Day',\" or the day when Mr. Trump announced tariffs on almost every nation on Earth, Boudreaux said. \"It can only be explained by global investor fears of what might happen in the U.S. economy.\"",
      "He added, \"It's too soon to tell how far those fears will go, but the early signs aren't cheery.\"",
      "A boost from tax cuts and deregulation?",
      "To be sure, mounting anxieties among consumers, businesses and investors don't by themselves herald an inevitable economic downturn. And so far, the economy remains resilient, with unemployment near a 50-year low and inflation edging down to 2.4% in March.",
      "Some economists also point to what they view as positives in Mr. Trump's agenda, such as prospects for tax cuts and deregulation, which could spur economic growth. And Mr. Trump has touted his administration's efforts to slash federal spending, overseen by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, as a win for taxpayers.",
      "\"We found hundreds of billions of dollars of waste, fraud and abuse,\" Mr. Trump told Time Magazine in an interview this month.",
      "DOGE, by its account, has cut about $160 billion in costs, or about 2.4% of the federal government's roughly $6.8 trillion in annual spending. But some critics have pointed out that the cuts will ultimately cost taxpayers\u00a0due to rehiring federal workers who were mistakenly fired, lower productivity of remaining workers and through lower tax collections from the IRS, which is reducing its staffing under DOGE's direction.",
      "In the meantime, some observers say the biggest hurdle to Mr. Trump's economic goals is of his own creation.",
      "\"We want Trump to succeed \u2014 in criticizing this trading policy, it's the policy we're criticizing,\" Sen. Gramm said. \"I don't believe the president can achieve what he wants to achieve for America unless his trade policy changes.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/is-college-worth-the-money-heres-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 17:26:58 -0400",
    "summary": "Although attending college still offers a payoff, a recent study by New York Fed economists suggests it might not make financial sense for some people.",
    "story": [
      "Getting a college education has traditionally been seen as a way to move up the economic ladder. But an analysis by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that the cost of a degree may not always be worth it.",
      "The value of a college education has increasingly come into question in recent years, especially as tuition costs steadily climb and millions of Americans grapple with student loans. As a result, only one in four U.S. adults say it's extremely or very important to have a four-year college degree to get a well-paying job, according to a 2024\u00a0Pew Research poll.",
      "To be sure, the case for attending college remains strong. Another study by the New York Fed\u00a0found\u00a0that in recent years the typical college graduate with a bachelor's degree had annual income of roughly $80,000, versus $47,000 for people with only a high school diploma \u2014a 68% premium.",
      "Yet a recent study by the Fed bank suggests a college degree hasn't paid off for at least 25% of college graduates in recent decades.",
      "Of course, not everyone goes to college chiefly to earn a high income \u2014 education can be its own reward, after all. But how you\u00a0 navigate your college career \u2014 or whether you choose to attend at all \u2014 is among the most important financial decisions a person will make.",
      "Here's when a diploma may not deliver much of a bang for the buck.",
      "When might a college degree not be worth it?",
      "Not surprisingly, the more a student must spend on out-of-pocket expenses, the lower their typical return on investment. The average college student pays about $30,000 out of pocket for four years of college, according to the New York Fed study. However, students could face significantly higher costs if they choose to live on campus, or if they miss out on financial aid and are forced to pay a school's full price.",
      "The typical college graduate sees a return on investment (ROI) of roughly 12.5% according to the New York Fed. That rate has remained mostly unchanged over the past three decades, and still exceeds the returns on most other investments, including the stock market, which over time offers long-term return of about 8%.",
      "Despite that payoff, certain factors can lower a college grad's ROI. For example, the researchers found that living on campus increased the price tag for college by nearly $30,000 \u2013 from $180,000 to $207,000 \u2013 reducing the return on investment to about 11%. The 1.5% drop in ROI may seem nominal, but it can translate to hundreds of thousands in lost dollars.",
      "\"This extra cost and the associated return are comparable to attending a more expensive school that is roughly twice the average price,\" the researchers, economists\u00a0Jaison Abel and\u00a0Richard Deitz, said in the study.",
      "Among college graduates, 25% actually see little return on investment. This group was making less than $10,000 more in income than the median high school graduate in 2024. Their rate of return was only 2.6% compared to the average of 12.5% \u2014 meaning they see much less of a payoff.",
      "Another factor that can reduce the value of a college degree is how long it takes to obtain. The typical bachelor's program runs for four years, but in some cases students might extend the timeline if they haven't completed their course load. That can have major financial implications.",
      "Taking an extra one to two years to get your degree adds \"considerably to the cost,\" the New York Fed\u00a0found. There's the direct cost students have to pay for the additional tuition, but also higher \"opportunity costs\" \u2014 for example, a student who starts their career later misses out on years of working experience and can end up earning less over their lifetime.",
      "\"All in all, we estimate that taking five years to complete college pushes the median rate of return down to about 9% and taking six years pushes it down to 7%,\" the researchers found.",
      "Graduating in five years, rather than four, pushes up the total cost of college from $180,000 to $272,000, while taking six years would cost $364,000.",
      "How much does a student's major matter?",
      "Another important consideration in deciding if going to college is a sound investment is a student's major. After all, certain fields tend to lead to higher incomes.",
      "So-called STEM majors tend to earn the most, both in the early and mid-stages off their career, according to New York Fed\u00a0data. For instance, a computer engineering major stands to make a median wage of $122,000 mid-career, versus $55,000 for an education major, according to the bank's data.",
      "Among the fields of study with the highest returns are engineering, business and health sciences. The return is lowest for those majoring in fine arts, liberal arts, leisure, and hospitality and education, which ranked last.",
      "\"While some of it may come down to choices people make for the jobs they wish to have, one significant consideration is college major, something over which students have direct control,\" Abel and Dietz wrote.",

    "summary": "The push by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to slash federal funding will cost taxpayers money, nonpartisan group finds. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, says it has saved $160 billion through its push to root out wasteful or fraudulent government spending. But that effort may also have come at a cost for taxpayers, with a new estimate from a nonpartisan research and advocacy group estimating that DOGE's actions will cost $135 billion this fiscal year.",
      "The analysis seeks to tally the costs associated with putting tens of thousands of federal employees on paid leave, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers and lost productivity, according to the Partnership for Public Service (PSP), a nonpartisan nonprofit that focuses on the federal workforce.",
      "PSP's estimate is based on the $270 billion in annual compensation costs for the federal workforce, calculating the impact of DOGE's actions, from paid leave to productivity hits. The $135 billion cost to taxpayers doesn't include the expense of defending multiple lawsuits challenging DOGE's actions, nor the impact of estimated lost tax collections due to staff cuts at the IRS.",
      "DOGE has sought to slash federal spending by urging government workers to accept a deferred resignation plan, which allowed many employees to retain full pay and benefits through September without working. Another 24,000 government employees who were fired as part of the reform effort have since been\u00a0rehired after a court ruling.",
      "Other agencies also have rehired some workers after mistakenly firing them, such as bird flu experts\u00a0who were dismissed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Federal workers have also had to take on tasks such as documenting their weekly accomplishments, which has lowered productivity, Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We haven't seen much focus on the waste [DOGE] is creating,\" Stier told CBS MoneyWatch about his group's decision to analyze the costs of DOGE's cuts. \"This is an effort that was created to address waste, but we were seeing the opposite.\"",
      "\"Ultimately it's the public that will end up paying for this,\" he added, noting that he expects the taxpayers costs to grow after other DOGE cuts take effect.",
      "The White House took issue with the analysis.",
      "\"The continued attempts to sow doubt in the massive accomplishments of this never-before-seen effort to make government more efficient speaks more about the illegitimacy of those peddling these falsehoods than good work of DOGE,\" White House spokesman Harrison Fields said. \"The American public are in lockstep with the president's mission and will not be swayed by more lies coming from the legacy media.\"",
      "Meanwhile, DOGE's efforts aren't winning over most voters, with a new\u00a0Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll finding that 57% of Americans disapprove of the way Musk is handling his job in the Trump administration. About 6 in 10 said they're worried President Trump will do too much to cut the size and role of the federal government, the poll found.",
      "Why job cuts could raise costs",
      "The IRS, which is planning on cutting roughly\u00a040% of its workforce, could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, according to an estimate from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "To be sure, the DOGE cuts could pay off over time, with a leaner, more focused federal workforce. For example, the direct savings from those layoffs will amount to $38 billion over 10 years, the Partnership for Public Service estimated.",
      "But Stier maintains that the costs for taxpayers could grow as they ripple through the economy, such as reductions in funding of health and science research. One analysis by researchers at institutions including the University of Maryland and University of Pennsylvania estimates that cuts to health research will result in a $16 billion annual economic loss, with 68,000 jobs lost.",
      "\"One can always imagine a miracle occurring, but none of this makes sense on so many different levels,\" Stier said.",
      "DOGE's \"wall of receipts\"",
      "DOGE keeps a running public tally of the federal money the task force says it has saved, posted on its\u00a0website in what is called a \"wall of receipts.\" But some of those savings have been overstated, a February CBS News investigation found.",
      "At the same time, DOGE's $160 billion in savings is far less than Musk's previously stated goal of shrinking annual government spending by $2 trillion, or almost one-third of the federal budget. Many experts say that far more ambitious objective is unlikely to be achieved without cutting major federal programs like Social Security and Medicare, which Mr. Trump has vowed not to touch.",
      "Musk said Tuesday that he'll curtail his work at DOGE starting in May. His decision comes as Tesla, the electric vehicle maker he runs, saw a 71% plunge in first-quarter profit and a 20% decline in vehicle sales as some consumers snubbed the brand due to objections to Musk's government work.",
      "Musk said he still plans to spend one to two days a week on DOGE-related work, focusing on eliminating government waste.",
      "\"I'll have to continue to keep doing it for the remainder of the president's term to make sure the waste and fraud doesn't come roaring back,\" he said during Tesla's first-quarter earnings call on Tuesday.",

      "Since the start of President Trump's second term in office, a number of corporations have announced plans to expand their production capabilities in the U.S.",
      "The announcements come as some of the Trump administration's new tariffs\u00a0take effect, with other import duties still pending. Although not all the companies expecting to grow their manufacturing footprint in the U.S. have directly cited the tariffs as a motivating factor, the White House has touted such moves as furthering Mr. Trump's goal of stoking job-creation on home soil.",

      "For most companies, making such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories, economists say.",
      "Many trade experts are skeptical that even the threat of higher tariffs and political pressure from the White House are enough to spur companies to make such strategic pivots. More commonly, they note, the decision on where to locate factories hinges far more on factors including labor and energy costs; tax rates; political instability; and the regulatory environment.",
      "Economists note that tariffs can help nurture emerging industries and create manufacturing jobs in sectors where consumers can easily substitute a cheaper domestic product for a higher cost foreign one. Levies on foreign imports that aren't key components in other products may also drive domestic investment.",
      "To date, however, the Trump administrations tariffs have been broad-based, rather than narrowly targeted to support a given industry. That is likely to suppress their potential to foster job growth, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "\"The broader statistical evidence points to negative net employment effects\" of tariffs, analysts with the investment bank said in an April 13 report. \"While the range of estimates is wide, academic studies generally find that a 10 [percentage point] increase in tariff rates raises employment in protected industries by 0.2-0.4% but that each 1 [percentage point] increase in tariff-driven costs lowers employment by 0.3-0.6%.\"",

      "Those opening days, in public opinion terms, have been marked by Mr. Trump's continued support from a loyal base of supporters, but also a widespread and growing belief among others that the administration is focused too much on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices. That's weighing on his approval ratings on the economy and inflation, which have gone down.",
      "Alongside that, he continues to get majority approval for his deportation program, though more Americans prioritize the economy in their evaluations of him.",
      "MAGA Republicans, in contrast, say their evaluations are based more on immigration and overwhelmingly approve of his efforts there. Plus they have a much rosier outlook on the U.S. economy than Americans overall now that Trump is in office, and most of them say it is too soon to judge him.",
      "Others who voted for him, but who don't identify as MAGA, have become a little less approving of his handling of the economy and inflation in recent months. And since the start of his term, his approval rating has slid among some groups he made gains with in the 2024 election, including independents, young people, and Hispanic people.",
      "Overall, Mr. Trump sees disapproval on the economy from those who think he's put too much focus on tariffs.",
      "And meanwhile, Democrats overwhelmingly disapprove of what they see from him, want their party to oppose him more and say they're \"frustrated\" with the Democratic Party's response so far. Mr. Trump's approval rating among people who sat out the '24 election started out higher, too.",
      "Those perceived changes elicit different judgments, though. Republicans say they are for the better, and Democrats, the worse. Asked how Trump's presidency so far has made them feel, most Republicans say they're satisfied, while Democrats and independents say they're frustrated and nervous.",
      "Measuring a president at 100 days is something of a contrivance that is based on a marker set during Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first term back in the 1930s. Then again, many presidents come in promising a lot of action quickly. Most Americans do think they can judge this administration in that time frame. Mr. Trump's 2024 voters, and most of his current approvers, are less likely to think it's enough time, whereas his disapprovers think it's enough.",

      "People who think Mr. Trump is putting too much focus on tariffs are more likely to say he's doing different things from what he promised.",
      "Here's how differences on economics play out:",
      "MAGA Republicans stand apart in their outlook for the U.S. economy. While most Americans say it is getting worse, MAGA Republicans say it is getting better. They also rate the current economy much better than others do. So, while evaluations of the economy remain mostly bad, Republicans' views have pushed the overall ratings up a bit, with an even larger partisan gap now.",
      "Overall, more Americans continue to say Trump's policies are making them financially worse off than better off. Expectations at the start of his term were different \u2014 more expected his policies to improve their finances.",
      "Two-thirds of those who think they're being made worse off say he isn't doing what he promised.",
      "And that has led to declining approval of his handling of the economy and inflation, specifically. Both ratings are now their lowest levels of the term so far. His rating on inflation is driven very much by the impact of his policies people see on prices.",
      "Support for tariffs has been declining, as a rising number of Americans feel the administration is focusing too much on the issue. And over recent weeks, fewer now believe Mr. Trump has a clear plan for tariffs and trade.",
      "When asked to pick what issue is most important to them in judging the Trump administration, the economy and immigration top the list. Those judging Mr. Trump on immigration heavily approve of his overall job performance, while those judging him on the economy disapprove in large numbers.",
      "Mr. Trump's overall approval rating is down from the high at the start of this term.",
      "Immigration and deportation",
      "Most Americans think Mr. Trump's policies have reduced border crossings. Most also continue to approve of his deportation program in general.",
      "Meanwhile, three-quarters say it isn't acceptable if some legal residents are detained by mistake as part of that program. A large 8 in 10 say it wouldn't be acceptable if some legal residents are deported to foreign countries.",
      "And most who don't think these things would be acceptable disapprove of his overall handling of immigration.",
      "(On this, MAGA Republicans do stand differently from others, coming in about twice as likely as Americans overall to say legal residents being detained would be acceptable.)",
      "It may be that the perceived implementation of the deportation plan is affecting larger views of how Mr. Trump is handling immigration, even as a majority approve of the deportation program in general. On balance, his handling of immigration, generally, is lower than it was earlier in term. Independents, especially those with college degrees, have become less approving over time.",
      "Most Americans also think Mr. Trump is trying to expand the powers of the presidency \u2014 a view driven heavily by Democrats and those who disapprove of his job performance. And those who think he is are more likely to feel democracy and rule of law in the U.S. is threatened.",
      "Most Americans do support limits to Mr. Trump's powers as president, though. A majority think he should get his policies enacted by working with Congress to pass legislation rather than through executive orders, and majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents alike feel Mr. Trump should follow a Supreme Court ruling if it goes against his administration. Republicans also say their party in Congress should push back on Mr. Trump if they disagree with him.",

      "Senator Ed Markey, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, said in a letter to the Small Business Administration (SBA) on Friday that smaller enterprises deserve exemptions from the Trump administration's tariffs, which the Massachusetts Democrat criticized as \"recklessly imposed.\"",
      "Markey also noted that the Trump administration has moved to shield corporate giants such as Apple and Google from the impact of some its trade policies, and he pressed the White House to protect small businesses. The U.S. earlier this month moved to exempt smartphones, computers and other high-tech products from the new tariffs, a boon to major tech manufacturers.",
      "\"Small businesses are the lifeblood of the American economy, but because they operate on razor-thin margins, they are uniquely vulnerable to rising costs caused by the Trump Tariffs. These businesses simply do not have the financial cushion to absorb price shocks or the resources to navigate sudden changes to an already complex supply channel,\" Markey wrote.",
      "Under President Trump, the U.S. has hiked tariffs on Chinese imports to as much as 145%, while products from most other countries are subject to 10% tariffs. Mr. Trump also announced steep \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of U.S. trading partners, but earlier this month\u00a0paused them for 90 days.",
      "Trump administration officials have defended the tariffs, saying they will protect the domestic manufacturing sector, foster economic growth as more companies shift their production to the U.S. and generate billions in federal revenue.",

      "Some small business owners say tariffs are already having an adverse impact.

    "story": [
      "American consumers are starting to feel the impact of President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, especially online.",
      "Since the second week in April, sellers on Amazon have raised their prices on nearly 1,000 products, according to data from SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike \u2014 nearly 30%, according to the company's analysis.",
      "Costs rose on a wide range of items, from tech accessories such as phone chargers to women's clothing, SmartScout founder and CEO Scott Needham told CBS MoneyWatch. Anker, a top-selling brand on Amazon that sells mobile charging devices, has increased prices on roughly 25% of its products on the site, for example.",
      "\"It's one of first concerted efforts I've seen where nothing explains the price hikes other than tariffs,\" Needham said.",
      "Tariffs are paid by importers, and they typically pass on much or even all of those additional costs to consumers. Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy told CNBC\u00a0earlier this month that he expected U.S. tariffs to boost prices on a host of consumer goods.",
      "The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports, while China has retaliated with levies of 125% on U.S. goods entering the country. Mr. Trump has long accused China of unfair trade practices, saying that tariffs will reinvigorate the domestic manufacturing sector and spur economic growth.",
      "Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\"",
      "\"Amazon consistently offers the lowest prices across the widest selection. We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, and we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items,\" Amazon said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Shein, Temu prices also rising",
      "Other major e-commerce players and retailers have also lifted prices to offset higher import costs, sometime by adding \"tariff surcharges\" to customers' bills. Chinese e-commerce sites Shein and Temu each announced\u00a0last week that they would hike prices after the U.S. closed a loophole that had allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free.",
      "Those price hikes took effect today. On Temu's site, a pair of running sneakers that last week cost $14 now runs about $27.",
      "The jump illustrates retailers' struggles to navigate President Trump's tariff agenda. Sky-high tariffs can make manufacturing goods in countries like China uneconomical. But revamping supply chains or moving manufacturing to another country can take years and cost hundreds of millions or even billions dollars, experts say.",
      "Uncertainty over tariff rates and how long such levies could remain in place is also making it difficult for companies to plan.",
      "Mr. Trump said this week that the U.S. and China were actively negotiating over how to resolve their trade differences and that he expected tariffs on Chinese imports to fall \"substantially.\" But officials in Beijing quickly\u00a0denied the sides were in talks, and instead reiterated its demand that the U.S. revoke its tariffs against the nation.",
      "\"The chances are that tariffs on China are cut from their current more than 100% effective rate, but there is no clear timeline,\" analysts with Oxford Economics, an investor advisory firm, said in a report on Friday.",

    "summary": "President Trump said that a baby bonus provided to new parents could be a \"good idea.\" Here's how it's worked in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are having fewer babies, with the annual birth rate now standing near a record low. It's a trend that has implications for the nation's long-term outlook \u2014 and has drawn attention from the Trump administration, with the New York Times reporting that a proposal for a $5,000 \"baby bonus\" may be one option for juicing the birth rate.",
      "\"Sounds like a good idea to me,\" President Trump said on Tuesday at a White House event when asked about the possibility of a federal baby bonus.",
      "Yet the idea may be far from becoming a reality, with a White House official telling CBS MoneyWatch that no final decision on such a plan has been made.",
      "A declining birth rate can spell long-term economic problems, including a shrinking labor force that's financially strapped to pay for medical services and retirement benefits for an aging population. But reversing a nation's declining birth rate could take far more than a one-time payment that, for most parents, would be quickly consumed by the costs of diapers, child care and other essentials.",
      "Other countries with similar demographic trends have tried an array of strategies to revive their birth rates, but in most cases with short-lived results or no impact at all.",
      "Some experts point out that by tackling long-standing economic issues \u2014 such as providing affordable day care and paid parental leave after the birth of a child \u2014 the government could provide a more hospitable environment for families. The U.S. is one of a only a handful of nations that doesn't provide paid leave for parents, including countries such as Papua New Guinea and Suriname.",
      "\"President Trump is proudly implementing policies to uplift American families, from securing order [at the] border to keep violent criminals out of our communities, to lowering taxes and the cost of living,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in an email in response to a question about the baby bonus idea. \"The President wants America to be a country where all children can safely grow up and achieve the American dream.\"",
      "By 2050, 26 states will take an economic hit due to their aging populations changes, with GDP declining by $162.3 billion from 2050 to 2100 over that period, according to a new analysis from PwC. Those states range from Maine to Mississippi.",
      "Here's what to know about baby bonuses.",
      "How much has the U.S. birth rate declined?",
      "About 3.6 million babies were born in the U.S. last year, according to the most recent CDC data. That's little changed from the prior year, when the number of births hit a new record low.",
      "The fertility rate, or the average number of children born to each woman in the U.S., dropped to about 1.6 in 2023, down from 3.7 in 1960, when the nation was in the midst of the post-war baby boom, according to data from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "What's causing the decline?",
      "That's unclear from an economic or policy standpoint, according to economists Melissa Kearney of University of Maryland, Philip Levine of Wellesley College and Luke Pardue of the Aspen Economic Strategy Group, the authors of a 2022\u00a0analysis of the birth rate decline in the economics publication Econofact.",
      "But, they added, \"Shifting priorities could be the primary driver for the decline in the birth rate since 2007.\"",
      "Survey and anecdotal data suggests that \"young adults have different preferences for having children, aspirations for life and views about parenting norms that are driving the decline in the U.S. birth rates,\" they wrote.",
      "Could financial incentives increase the birth rate?",
      "Other countries that have tried similar monetary incentives have had mixed success.",
      "Australia introduced a baby bonus in 2004, providing $3,000 Australian dollars to parents for each birth, an amount that was eventually hiked to A$5,000.",
      "After an initial bump in births when the policy was introduced, Australia's birth rate has continued to decline, dropping from about 2 children on average for each woman to about 1.5 in 2023, below the U.S. rate, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.",
      "Likewise, Hungary has introduced a number of incentives to convince its citizens to have more children, from providing baby grants to tax breaks for families with three or more children. Its birth rate increased slightly in the 2010s after hitting a record low of about 1.2 in 2011.",
      "But after rising to 1.6 in 2021, Hungary's birth rate is once again dropping, demographic data shows.",
      "\"Baby bonuses have not worked for Hungary. Why would we replicate this here in [the U.S.]?\" wrote Gabriella Hoffman, the director of the Center for Energy and Conservation at Independent Women's Forum, in a social media post.",
      "How much does it cost to raise a child?",
      "Raising a child in the U.S. doesn't come cheap, with one recent analysis finding parents will spend about $300,000 to raise a child to age 18.",
      "How would a U.S. baby bonus work?",
      "Typically such incentives are paid either through a tax credit or a government check, similar to the stimulus checks that were given to millions of households during the pandemic.",
      "Already, the U.S. has a Child Tax Credit of about $2,000 per child, but that is claimed on a parent's annual tax return, which means families must wait until tax season to collect the benefit.",
      "\"Unlike the Child Tax Credit, a baby bonus could come right after a child is born \u2014 there would be no wait until next year's tax season to get the money that parents need for a crib and a car seat today,\" wrote senior policy analyst Leah Sargeant in a recent post at the Niskanen Center, a political think tank. \"It can be more generously structured than the CTC because it is a supplement for a single, critical year, not an ongoing payment.\"",
      "How much would a $5,000 baby bonus cost the U.S.?",
      "If the parent of every child born in the U.S. annually qualified for a $5,000 bonus, the cost could mount to more than $15 billion a year.",
      "That could be tough to pass at a time when Republican lawmakers are seeking to reduce federal spending in order to pay for an extension of Mr. Trump's tax cuts, which is currently part of a bill advancing in Congress.",

      "Mr. Trump had adopted a softer stance on trade in recent days, allaying investors' concerns and helping trigger a three-day relief rally following a volatile trading day on Monday. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a Friday research note that negative activity in the market played a \"key role\" in the president's decision to reconsider his steep tariffs on imported Chinese goods, which currently total 145%.",
      "Meanwhile, the markets are also reacting to mixed signals from the White House about potential trade deals.",
      "Mr. Trump this week hinted at a possible trade deal with China, but the Chinese government has denied the two countries are in\u00a0active negotiations.\u00a0CNN did report\u00a0that China was rolling back the 125% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. semiconductors, a sign it could be relaxing its stance.",
      "\"We're in a headline driven market, and we're prone to volatility spikes and outsized trading ranges in both directions,\" said Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment analyst at eToro. \"And you know, it's probably going to remain that type of market until we at least have more clarity on what's going on.\"",

Its stock fell 6.8% even though its results for the beginning of the year topped expectations.",
      "Eastman Chemical fell 5.9% after it gave a forecast for profit this spring that fell short of analysts' expectations.

      "Skechers U.S.A., the shoe and apparel company, pulled its financial forecasts for the year due to \"macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies\" even though it just reported a record quarter of revenue at $2.41 billion. Its stock fell 4.3%.",
      "Trade deals",
      "Over the last few weeks, the president and members of his administration have been meeting with different countries to discuss bi-lateral trade deals. This comes after Mr. Trump paused the implementation of so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for 90 days \u2014 providing a sigh of relief to markets and consumers alike. This pause, UBS analysts said, demonstrates that the president is aware of how tariffs might be negatively impacting market activity.",
      "\"So, while we expect equity markets to remain choppy, the risk-reward for stocks is looking more appealing, especially now that we know that Trump is attuned to the risks from his tariff policies,\" said David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management in a research note.",
      "Lefkowitz said that the tariff-induced slowdown will hinder corporate profit growth, but projected the economy would rebound next year as businesses and consumers acclimate to tariffs and the Fed introduces rate cuts.",
      "Tariffs on China could be slashed to as low as 50 to 65%, the Wall Street Journal this week\u00a0reported. But even if tariffs do come down as a result of trade negotiations, that doesn't mean the U.S. economy is out of the woods yet. The remaining levies could still stifle economic growth, analysts say.",
      "\"The April 2 rose garden start on tariffs might have been the high water mark, but you're still talking about a significant burden that is being imposed on companies and the economy from tariffs,\" said Adam Crisafulli, an analyst at Vital Knowledge. \"And that's not going away.\"",

    "story": [
      "Learning Resources CEO Rick Woldenberg thinks the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs will be catastrophic for both his family-owned toy business and for the broader U.S. economy. That's why he's suing President Trump.",
      "Woldenberg's business has 500 employees and sells thousands of learning-based toys like Spike the Fine Motor Hedgehog and the Pretend & Play Calculator Cash Register. Its lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., accuses Mr. Trump and other members of his administration of overreaching the president's authority in imposing the broad-based import duties. Congress has historically held the power to authorize new tariffs or make trade deals with other nations.",
      "With the administration's higher tariffs in place, the math is dire for Learning Resources, Woldenberg said. The company's import duties are set to increase from $2.3 million prior to the Trump administration to $100 million \u2014 a roughly 4,000% increase, he said.",
      "\"This path is catastrophic\"",
      "At the same time, Woldenberg said he expects his company's sales to drop 25% this year as consumers scale back spending due to the economic impact of the tariffs. Prior to Mr. Trump's trade war, the CEO had forecast an 8% increase in sales. Economists on Wall Street\u00a0say the tariffs\u00a0will slow U.S. economic growth while boosting inflation.",
      "\"This path is catastrophic,\" Woldenberg told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Forces have been unleashed in the economy \u2014 the world economy as well as the U.S. economy \u2014 that will have consequences that will be irreparable.\"",
      "Learning Resources' suit asks the court to find that Mr. Trump's tariffs are unlawful and to block the administration from collecting the levies. Based in Vernon Hills, Illinois, Learning Resources is a private, family-owned business founded in 1984.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the suit or the company's financial challenges caused by the tariffs.",
      "For now, Woldenberg said he's focused on figuring out how to shift manufacturing out of China, where about 60% of his products are produced. Goods imported from that nation are now facing U.S. tariffs of 145%.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by the companies that import the products, Woldenberg's business \u2014 not China \u2014 is on the hook for paying for Mr. Trump's high import duties.",
      "One question facing Woldenberg is whether he can shift production out of China fast enough to keep ahead of Mr. Trump's tariffs. In recent years, Learning Resources has added factories in India and Vietnam, but that effort has only moved the needle so far, he said.",
      "\"In a two- or three-year period we moved 16% of our product from China to those markets and got things going,\" Woldenberg said. \"That took a lot of effort, cost us a couple million dollars, at least, in out-of-pocket expenses to move it from Point A to Point B, and a huge amount of man hours on our side to essentially redevelop all those products.\"",
      "Despite that effort, however, the company has to date moved only about 16% of its manufacturing capacity out of China to other countries, Woldenberg said.",
      "Reshoring realities",
      "Mr. Trump maintains that tariffs will revive the domestic manufacturing sector because the costs of the import taxes will spur both American and foreign businesses to reshore their factories to the U.S. But economists \u2014 and Woldenberg \u2014 are skeptical, pointing out that such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories.",
      "\"The fact that [Mr. Trump] believes in it is something that I think is irrelevant \u2014 there are people that believe in ghosts, OK?\" Woldenberg said.",
      "Learning Resources' financial resources aren't deep enough to build its own factory, Woldenberg said. He noted that he's also tried to find plants in the U.S. that could make some of his products because he believed toys with a \"Made in USA\" label could appeal to some customers.",
      "\"If we had six to 10 products that were made in America, we could go and say, 'Look! Made in America. You want made in America? Here's Made in America,\" he said. \"We can't even find somebody to make six or 10 products.\"",
      "The reason, he said, is U.S. manufacturers don't have the capability to make the types of products he's selling, while the costs of manufacturing them himself would be prohibitive. \"I cannot produce a factory that can produce our product at a competitive price,\" Woldenberg said.",
      "To be sure, some businesses have announced plans to build new U.S. plants or hire more workers in recent months. They include tech giant Apple, which in February\u00a0said\u00a0that it's committed to spending more than $500 billion on expanding its U.S. manufacturing capabilities over four years.",
      "But Apple \"is in a different stratosphere than me,\" Woldenberg noted. \"They also have like a dozen products. We have 2,000.\"",
      "Skittish workers",
      "Meantime, Woldenberg said he's committed to keeping his 500 workers employed, likening the current challenges to those his business faced during the pandemic. Now, as then, his employees are worried about the impact of Mr. Trump's trade war and whether their jobs might be at risk, he said.",
      "\"Two days before we were kicked out of our office in March of 2020, I had an all-company meeting and I said, 'We define this as a community problem ... the goal is to get everybody across the river.' And we did that,\" he said. \"No one lost an hour of pay.\"",
      "Woldenberg added, \"I have a very strong commitment to getting them through this, and it's unwavering, and I'll do everything that I can.\"",
      "Even so, Woldenberg wants to see the Trump administration drop their tariff plans.",

It operates out of eight hubs across the U.S., flying out of the following airports: Concord-Padgett Regional Airport in North Carolina; Hollywood Burbank Airport in California; Lakeland International Airport in Florida; Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina; Sonoma County Airport in California; Tweed-New Haven airport in Connecticut; Wilmington Airport in New Hampshire; and Wilmington International Airport in North Carolina.",
      "The company previously operated charter flights as Casino Express Airlines before rebranding as Avelo in 2021, according to S&P Capital IQ.",
      "Avelo declined to comment further on its contract with the government. DHS confirmed to CBS MoneyWatch that Avelo is contracting with ICE to assist with deportation flights.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has long contracted with CSI Aviation, an aviation broker that provides private air charter services, medical flights for patients in emergencies and government flight services. Under its new contract with ICE, Avelo will operate as a sub-carrier of CSI.",
      "DHS also subcontracts with other air charter companies, which provide planes and operate the flights. One such charter outfit is GlobalX. It handles roughly 70% of DHS' flights, according to immigrant advocate Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border, an activist group monitoring ICE operations.",
      "GlobalX did not reply to a request for comment on its work with DHS.",
      "Cartwright, who tracks ICE flights through publicly available sources, expressed surprise at Avelo agreeing to shuttle migrants destined for detention centers or deportation.",
      "\"I have never seen a retail airline that sells to consumers being used in this way,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Typically, charter companies that don't fly retail-type flights. They are not selling tickets directly to consumers.\"",
      "According to data on USAspending.gov, a U.S. government website that tracks federal spending, DHS' roughly 6-month contract this year with CSI Aviation is worth at least $78.1 million. Its value could rise to as much as $162.2 million.",
      "The purpose of the agreement, the site states, \"is to provide daily scheduled large aircraft & special high risk charter flights to facilitate ICE's enforcement and removal of operations of illegal aliens.\"",
      "CSI Aviation did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on its contract with the federal government.",
      "Cruising for revenue",
      "Airline industry experts said charter outfits like CSI typically aren't familiar to the general public.",
      "\"Nobody has usually ever heard of the airlines,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals site, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They are charter airlines that don't have a set schedule on a website,\" he said.",
      "However, an upstart airline hunting for additional revenue streams outside of selling tickets to members of the flying public is not unusual.",
      "\"It's very difficult to compete with the Deltas and Uniteds of the world, so they try any number of tactics,\" Keyes explained. \"They fly to and from smaller cities, they offer bargain-basement prices. There are all different types of counter-positioning things they do.\"",
      "But Avelo's move is more surprising because most commercial airlines don't have enough spare aircraft and crew for specialized operations like migrant flights, noted Seth Miller, founder and editor in chief of PaxEx Aero, an aviation consulting service. Miller said he opposes Avelo working with U.S. immigration authorities on ethical grounds.",
      "Avelo's contract with DHS is also drawing criticism from an immigrant advocacy group. A petition started by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition urging people to boycott Avelo until it severs ties with ICE has collected more than 34,650 signatures.",
      "\"We reject the Trump Administration's inhumane deportation practices, reject cooperation from the State of Connecticut in support of Avelo as long as they are complicit in these practices and pledge to boycott Avelo as long as they are profiting from ICE flights,\" the petition states.",
      "Although federal contracts can provide steady business for airlines and charter carriers, Avelo's partnership with DHS poses a reputational risk, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I still think it's morally questionable to run these charters for the federal government and think it poses a very real reputational risk for Avelo,\" Miller said, citing protests against the airline at some of Avelo's hubs.",
      "Will Humphries, a traveler at Sonoma County Airport, in Santa Rosa, California, where Avelo operates, is among those members of the flying public who plan to boycott Avelo because of its work with ICE.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 13:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Shortening permitting procedures for mining and oil drilling could adversely affect the environment, communities and endangered species, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said it will accelerate permit approvals for mining, drilling and fossil fuel production and transportation on public land, fast-tracking a review process that would normally take years.",
      "In announcing the emergency procedures Wednesday, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the management of federal lands and natural resources, said the permitting process will now take up to \"28 days at most\" \u2014 a drastic departure from the current one- to two-year timeline.",
      "The government agency said the move is in response to President Trump's January 20 declaration of a national energy emergency. In an executive order on the first day of his second term, the White House said it would \"eliminate harmful, coercive 'climate' policies that increase the costs of food and fuel.\"",
      "The speedy permitting policy opens the door for the U.S. to expand oil and gas projects and for Mr. Trump to make good on his promise to \"Drill, baby, drill\" \u2014 a common refrain on his campaign trail. The new guidelines will apply to a wide range of energy projects, including crude oil, natural gas and coal.",
      "The U.S. leads the world in\u00a0oil\u00a0and\u00a0gas\u00a0production, with an output of 20 million barrels of oil a day and accounting for roughly a quarter of global gas production, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "The DOI said it would use emergency authorities under the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act to expedite the permitting process.",
      "\"The United States cannot afford to wait,\" Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday. \"President Trump has made it clear that our energy security is national security, and these emergency procedures reflect our unwavering commitment to protecting both.\"",
      "Lawsuits to come, experts say",
      "Environmental advocates rebuked the announcement, saying that in addition to adverse environmental impacts on public land and water sources, the expedited procedures will strip away community members' ability to weigh in on projects happening in their own backyards. Experts say the move is expected to draw legal challenges.",
      "\"What they're proposing to do is basically forgo environmental review or public participation or anything meaningful,\" said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. \"The implications of that are extreme.\"",
      "The environmental review process has developed over time, he said, and goes back decades. The Endangered Species Act, one of three statues the DOI is targeting, was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973. Section 7 of the Act requires consultation among agencies \"to ensure their activities are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence\" of federally protected species, according to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.",
      "A win for oil and gas industries",
      "The announcement on Wednesday was a win for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, which has\u00a0cheered\u00a0Mr. Trump's energy agenda.",
      "\"Our nation's permitting system is broken, and reform is essential to ensuring access to affordable, reliable energy,\" Holly Hopkins, VP of upstream policy at the American Petroleum Institute, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Former officials from several different federal agencies who served under Mr. Trump's previous term and the Biden administration have told CBS News on background that looming workforce reductions could throw a wrench in the department's plans to speed up the permitting process. Also, breaking with long-standing practices could lead to major slipups, such as oil spills, they added.",
      "The Department of the Interior employs about 70,000 staff members, according to its website. But cuts could be on the horizon. An internal White House document obtained by The Washington Post indicated that as many as 1 in 4 department employees could be let go as a part of a broader series of staff cuts across government agencies.",
      "\"How can you accomplish so much with fewer and fewer people?\" said Burger of Columbia's Sabin Center. \"The only result is less and less oversight.\"",
      "Athan Manuel, director of the Lands Protection Program at the Sierra Club, agreed, adding that gutting the federal agency could hinder the Trump administration's objectives.",
      "\"They just don't seem to understand that these employees run the gamut from wildlife biologists to firefighters, to people who permit oil and gas drilling or permit mines on federal lands,\" he said. \"If it's going to wholesale cut staff, some of the things they care about are going to get caught up in that.\"",
      "The Department of Interior did not respond to request for comment on how layoffs might impact its ability to issue permits on a tighter timetable.",
      "According to the new procedural guidelines issued by the agency this week, companies seeking a permit are required to confirm in writing that they want their project covered by the expedited process \u2014 meaning that not everyone will necessarily opt in. Those that do could stand to lose big, Manuel said.",
      "\"Companies are very cautious before they sink millions of dollars into a well or to a mining project,\" he said. \"So I think they benefit from going slowly because they don't want to be stuck with a stranded asset or literally drill a dry hole here.\"",

      "Scott Keyes, founder and CEO of flight deals website Going.com, said search interest in travel to Rome for April 21-23 has nearly tripled since the pope's death, compared with the three previous days.",
      "For tourists thinking of booking a jaunt to Italy, the bad news is that the surge in demand for fights to Rome is driving up airfares, according to Going.com.

      "After the dinner offer was posted on the $TRUMP meme coin website and X account, the value of the meme coin surged as much as $5.32, or 58%, to $14.32 on Wednesday afternoon. That gain only partially erased the meme coin's decline in value, which hit a peak of $75.35 on January 19 the day before Mr. Trump's inauguration.",
      "The dinner offer promises $TRUMP coin investors the opportunity to \"Hear close-up, from President Trump, about the future of Crypto!\" Mr. Trump, who has vowed to turn the U.S. into the cryptocurrency capital of the world, has also pushed his own ventures into the realm of digital products, issuing everything from NFTs billed as \"Trump digital trading cards\" to a cryptocurrency platform called World Liberty Financial.",
      "CIC Digital LLC, an affiliate of The Trump Organization, and Fight Fight Fight LLC together own 80% of the meme coins, according to the Trump coin site. Fight Fight Fight is a Delaware LLC, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "The White House and the Trump Organization didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the promotion.",
      "Invitations to the dinner event with Mr. Trump will only be offered to those who own the most $TRUMP meme coins, according to the website. The top 25 holders will get a bonus of \"an Exclusive Reception before Dinner with YOUR FAVORITE PRESIDENT!\" the website marketing the dinner said.",
      "\"Our leaderboard updates hourly in real time. Your $TRUMP coin count puts you in the running. The competition is fierce. Own $TRUMP \u2014 or watch from the sidelines,\" according to the website marketing the coin.",
      "The leaderboard will be determined by the average holdings of $TRUMP owners from April 23 to May 12, according to the website. \"The more $TRUMP you hold \u2014 and the longer you hold it \u2014 the higher Your Ranking will be,\" it said.",
      "The dinner will take place on May 22 at the Trump National Golf Club in Washington, D.C., according to the site.",
      "Offer draws swift criticism",
      "Meme coins, which have no economic or transactional value, are cryptocurrencies linked to celebrities or internet trends, such as Dogecoin, which was inspired by the\u00a0image of a Shiba Inu dog. Elon Musk named his federal cost-cutting group, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, after the token.",
      "Both Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, debuted meme coins just days before his inauguration, although both tokens have lost much of their value since their debuts. The $MELANIA meme coin now sells for about 49 cents each, down from a peak of $13.76 on Jan. 20.",
      "The presidential dinner promotion drew criticism from lawmakers and anti-corruption groups. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, on social media blasted the offer as the \"most brazenly corrupt thing a President has ever done.\"",
      "Tony Carrk, U.S. executive director with Accountable.US, a nonpartisan advocacy group focused on corporate and government ethics, said in a statement that Mr. Trump \"is openly inviting investors to have a bidding war over who can buy the most access to him while he laughs all the way to the bank.\"",

The moves came after weeks of escalation between the administration and Harvard, which had\u00a0rejected the administration's\u00a0demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\"",

      "The former professional tennis player and ophthalmologist made headlines in the 1970s, when after transitioning to female she sued and won the right to play in the U.S. Open. During her half-decade pro career, the doctor peaked at 20th in the world and in 1977 made the U.S. open finals in doubles, where she lost to a pair that included tennis legend Martina Navratilova.",
      "Half a century later, her views have evolved \u2014 she believes transgender women who transition after puberty should not compete in women's sports \u2014 but she's aghast at broader restrictions on transgender rights during the Trump administration's first 100 days.",
      "The State Department has halted the practice of issuing passports with \"X\" gender markers. The Office of Personnel Management directed agency heads to strip \"gender ideology\" from websites, contracts and emails. An executive order calls on the federal government \"to rescind all funds from educational programs\" that allow transgender girls and women to compete. Another order restricts access to gender-affirming care for youth. The Department of Defense has reinstated President Trump's first term transgender military ban, and transgender federal inmates are now regarded by their sex at birth. The changes are the subject of ongoing lawsuits.",
      "First and foremost on Richards' mind: the Navy veteran believes transgender Americans should be able to serve openly in the military.",
      "\"That's terrible. You know, I can only think of myself because I was in the Navy when nobody knew that I was a transgender. I hadn't had surgery yet, but it was still me,\" said Richards, who won the All-Navy tennis championship while serving. \"That goes a long way back, but I'm still representative of the same ilk even though they didn't know it at the time.\"",
      "Richards is the subject of a forthcoming book, tentatively titled \"Finding Ren\u00e9e,\" by former Sports Illustrated editor Julie Kliegman. Richards believes the fierce debate over transgender athletes has fueled a \"jump\u2026from the sports to the military, to the education, to the bathrooms, to the passports, to the existence, to the teaching of any kind of gender.\"",
      "It's a trend that has played out in state legislatures, before and during the current Trump administration, according to Logan Casey, the director of policy research at the nonprofit Movement Advancement Project, which tracks state laws and executive orders regulating gender.",
      "Casey said state-level bans on sports prior to the current Trump administration \"laid the groundwork for all of the anti-transgender and anti-LGBTQ attacks more broadly.\"",
      "\"It sort of put sports as a foot in the door, and a framework, for how many people who had not previously thought about transgender people very much \u2014 let alone in the context of policy and law \u2014 are now thinking about it and framing it,\" said Casey, who noted the vast majority of state legislation targeting LGBTQ rights fails to become law.",
      "Ash Lazarus Orr, a spokesperson for Advocates for Trans Equality, said the language of Mr. Trump's executive orders bore similarities to orders and legislation coming out of state capitals.",
      "\"It signals back to states that, yes, this is a priority. You should continue to do this, and in fact do this and other attacks,\" said Orr, who is also the title plaintiff in a lawsuit over the Trump administration's policy requiring U.S. passports to reflect sex assigned at birth. \"While we were seeing attacks on the trans community escalating at a state level under the Biden administration, what we are seeing now under the Trump administration is absolutely an escalation.\"",
      "Former Olympic swimmer Nancy Hogshead, a Democrat who founded the nonprofit advocacy group Champion Women, believes the party is suffering from self-inflicted wounds.",
      "Hogshead, who supports efforts to align participation in sports with gender at birth, said Trump and Republicans have found a galvanizing issue.",
      "\"It is a winner for them. It is a winner for Republicans,\" Hogshead said. \"Fifty percent of all girls play sports. That is a meat and potatoes issue for them. It's not a fringe issue.\"",
      "Richards believes Trump has a similar view. She said, as an ophthalmologist, she treated one of his sisters and has met Mr. Trump once.",
      "\"He knows I'm not an ogre,\" she said. \"He sees, and his advisors advise him, that his popularity rests with the small group of people that hate the idea of transgender, period.\"",
      "Richards, whose professional tennis career began in 1977 when she was more than 40 years old, largely agrees with Hogshead. In April 2024, she provided the Women's Tennis Association with a position paper on participation of transgender women in sports, and this year allowed Sports Illustrated to publish it. In the paper, Richards concluded that people who have undergone male puberty should be ineligible to compete against biological females.",
      "Richards's paper included reflections on her time playing both as an amateur and professionally, analysis of \"the current literature on the subject,\" citing her decades as a doctor, and policy recommendations.",
      "It also touched on golf.",
      "\"My lifetime in sports is still ongoing,\" she wrote. \"I have been a member of the ladies' golf league at the public/private club near my home for the past 20 years.\"",
      "Richards spoke to CBS News on opening day last week. She said, despite politics, the women in her league still welcome her competition.",
      "\"Not only welcome and accepted, but if I didn't show up, they would have a cemetery ceremony, believe me,\" Richards said.",
      "Are there a lot of 90-year-olds there, still hitting the links?",
      "\"Yeah, me. Amongst the men and the women, I'm the only one,\" Richards said, adding that she guesses the average age at the club is 60. \"I play the forward tee, but I don't play any gold tees that are in front of that \u2014 and I hit the ball as well as they do, too.\"",

      "Despite U.S. pressure on Ukraine and to a lesser extent, Russia, there is no peace yet, or even a temporary ceasefire. The administration is now threatening to walk from negotiations with Russia and Ukraine, as Russia\u00a0continues its attacks.",
      "The promise: Pardon Jan. 6 rioters",
      "This was one of the first promises Mr. Trump delivered on upon taking office. Hours after he was sworn in, he granted clemency to about 1,500 defendants who had been convicted of crimes related to the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Among those who received clemency are people who were convicted of violent and serious crimes, including assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.",
      "Mr. Trump also ordered the Justice Department to end all pending cases connected to the riot, abruptly ending the department's massive effort under former President Joe Biden to hold those who participated in the attack accountable.",
      "The promise: \"Save\" TikTok",
      "Before taking office, Mr. Trump promised to \"save\" the short-form video app used by 170 million Americans. In 2024, Congress passed a law that required TikTok to divest from its Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, or be cut off from U.S. app-hosting stores. Despite lengthy legal wrangling, when ByteDance failed to cut ties with TikTok by Jan. 19, the deadline set by Congress, the app was effectively banned in the U.S.",
      "On his first day in office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that directed the Justice Department not to enforce the law for 75 days and TikTok later reappeared in app stores. The president on April 4 again delayed enforcement of the law for another 75 days as a sale remained elusive.",
      "The promise: Make IVF free",
      "In August, Mr. Trump told voters that the government or insurance companies \"will be mandated to pay for all costs associated with IVF treatment.\" He did not elaborate how he would enact it.",
      "That has not yet come to fruition, though the president directed his administration to find ways to reduce the high costs of IVF for Americans struggling with fertility. The Feb. 18 order requested policy recommendations within 90 days.",
      "The promise: Release JFK assassination records",
      "The Trump administration released about 80,000 government documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy in mid-March. The documents had been released before, but sections were redacted for national security purposes. Many of those portions were made public with the new release.",
      "The declassified versions did not appear to contain significant new revelations about the assassination. Some documents are available in person at the National Archives, but others are still being uploaded. Additional documents remain under court seal, including some for reasons of grand jury secrecy. There are also IRS-related documents that must be unsealed before release, and the Archives and Justice Department are working on making these available.",
      "The promise: Close the Education Department",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order last month to begin the process of dismantling the Department of Education \"once and for all.\" The Education Department's workforce has already been cut in half, and there are plans to transfer some of its functions to other agencies. Still, fully eliminating the department would require an act of Congress.",
      "The promise: Carry out the largest mass deportation in U.S. history",
      "\"On Day One, I will launch the largest deportation program of criminals in the history of America,\" Mr. Trump said on the campaign trail.",
      "The Trump administration has aggressively pursued deportations, perhaps most notably by invoking an 18th century law known as the Alien Enemies Act that has only been used during wartime to immediately deport some migrants accused of being gang members to a prison in El Salvador.",
      "The president's attempt to use the Alien Enemies Act for this purpose is being litigated in the courts.",
      "The promise: \"Tariff the hell\" out of countries that have taken \"advantage\" of the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump vowed to \"tariff the hell\" out of countries that he believes haven't treated the U.S. fairly on trade. He followed through on that threat for just under a week, imposing heavy tariffs on most countries based on their trade deficits with the U.S. He blinked in the face of a bond market sell-off, suspending most of the tariffs for 90 days while he and top administration officials try to negotiate trade deals with individual nations. He still kept in place tariffs adding up to 145% against China.",
      "The promise: Withdraw from the Paris climate accords",
      "Just like he did in his first term, one of Mr. Trump's first moves when he took office in January was to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, after former President Joe Biden rejoined the agreement. Countries who have signed onto the Paris accord agree to specific efforts meant to help curb climate change.",
      "The promise: Make expiring tax cuts permanent",
      "Congress is working to make the income tax cuts enacted in Mr. Trump's first term permanent. It's not something the president can do on his own. Key provisions of Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "The promise: Eliminate taxes on tips",
      "One of Mr. Trump's repeated campaign promises was eliminating federal income taxes on tips, something he found was popular with his working-class base. Republicans on the House Budget Committee estimate eliminating income taxes on tips would cost more than $100 billion over a decade.",
      "But eliminating taxes on tips would require an act of Congress, and it's not yet clear whether it will be included in the budget reconciliation package.",
      "The promise: Eliminate taxes on seniors' Social Security income",
      "Eliminating federal taxes on Social Security income is also something Mr. Trump has pledged to do. This, too, will take an act of Congress. And Congress hasn't made serious moves toward that end. Some economists warn that eliminating taxes on Social Security would create an even larger federal deficit.",
      "The promise: Stop funding for schools with vaccine and mask mandates",
      "Mr. Trump pledged during the campaign that he \"would not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate.\" He issued an executive order in February that prohibits schools and colleges with COVID-19 vaccine mandates from receiving federal money, though no states currently have such a requirement. It only applies to the COVID-19 vaccine.",
      "The promise: End birthright citizenship",
      "The president's executive order on birthright citizenship, which has long been interpreted as guaranteed under the 14th Amendment, was one of the first that he signed after he was sworn in. The order denied birthright citizenship to children born after Feb. 19 to a mother who is unlawfully present in the U.S. or who is lawfully present on a temporary basis; or whose father is neither a citizen nor lawful permanent resident.",
      "Mr. Trump's mandate has been blocked by federal courts in several states as being unconstitutional. The Supreme Court\u00a0will hear arguments in May on a Trump administration request to partially enforce the order.",
      "The promise: Cut federal funding to schools that teach \"critical race theory\" and \"transgender\" matters",
      "In January, Mr. Trump ordered schools to stop teaching what he views as \"critical race theory\" and other material related to race and sexuality. The executive order declared that K-12 schools could not use federal money on the \"indoctrination\" of children, including \"radical gender ideology and critical race theory.\"",
      "He signed a separate executive order in February to ban transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams that match their gender identity. The order mandates that Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in schools, be interpreted as prohibiting the participation of transgender girls and women in female sports. Those not in compliance jeopardize any federal funding they receive, Mr. Trump said.",
      "In:\n          Donald Trump\nTrump Administration",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/100-days-of-doge-elon-musk-trump/",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:11:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Elon Musk and DOGE amassed vast power in President Trump's administration \u2014 reshaping federal agencies and spearheading deep cuts to the federal workforce.",
    "story": [
      "Since President Trump returned to office 100 days ago, Elon Musk has amassed vast power \u2014 leading the administration's efforts to shutter government agencies and slash the federal workforce.",
      "Musk's ruthless approach to leading the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 epitomized by a speech in which the Tesla CEO brandished a chainsaw \u2014 has drawn lawsuits, pushback from federal workers and criticism from Tesla investors. But he's also held onto broad support from Republican voters and, at least publicly, from Mr. Trump himself.",
      "Musk gained influence \u2014 and spent heavily \u2014 in 2024 race",
      "Musk \u2014 the world's richest person \u2014 endorsed Mr. Trump minutes after the then-presidential candidate's July 2024 assassination attempt. Musk had oscillated on backing Mr. Trump: The one-time Obama backer suggested Mr. Trump \"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset\" in 2022, and later supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis's 2024 GOP primary bid.",
      "The alliance between the two billionaires was defined by campaign cash. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Mr. Trump and other GOP candidates in 2024, much of it through Musk's America PAC. The group helped lead Mr. Trump's get-out-the-vote efforts, and became known for using its massive war chest in unorthodox and often controversial ways. One plan to dole out $1 million a day to swing state voters who signed a petition drew a lawsuit from Philadelphia's district attorney, who accused Musk's super PAC of running an illegal lottery.",
      "Mr. Trump floated a Musk-led \"government efficiency commission\" during the later months of the campaign. The scope of Musk's role was initially unclear: In a post-election statement, Mr. Trump framed DOGE as an external body that would offer \"advice and guidance,\" a far more limited role than the one Musk took on.",
      "Musk promises $2 trillion in cuts but slashes far less",
      "In an October campaign rally, the billionaire predicted he could find at least $2 trillion in annual savings, which would require him to slash the budget by nearly 30% \u2014 a daunting goal considering that almost half of all government spending goes toward the military, Medicare and Social Security, three politically difficult-to-cut areas. Earlier this year, Musk cited a still-ambitious $1 trillion as his target.",
      "So far, DOGE's stated cost savings haven't come close to the trillion-dollar mark. Musk said earlier this month he anticipates $150 billion in savings in the 2026 fiscal year by cutting waste and fraud. Meanwhile, the DOGE website says it has saved $160 billion through a combination of cancelling contracts and grants, selling assets and ferreting out fraud.",
      "But many of the cost savings touted by DOGE have been called into question. DOGE keeps a running tally of spending cuts on its website, but this \"wall of receipts\" has included errors and unverified claims, including an $8 million cancelled contract that was erroneously listed at $8 billion, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "White House spokesman Harrison Fields defended DOGE's cost-cutting goals and called $1 trillion a year an achievable benchmark. He also said mistakes are rare and \"corrected immediately,\" and the statistics on DOGE's site go through a \"lengthy assessment and analysis.\" The $8 billion mistake dates back to the prior administration, DOGE has argued.",
      "\"The goal is to cut as much waste, fraud and abuse from the federal government as possible,\" Fields told CBS News. \"The president is very happy and supportive of the achievements of DOGE, and knows that we are just now getting started.\"",
      "Some of Musk's claims about the size of the government's fraud problem are also difficult to prove. He told Fox Business' Larry Kudlow last month the government could save $500 billion to $700 billion by cutting fraud and waste from entitlement programs, but there's little evidence that fraud exists on anywhere near that scale, which would equal 20% to 30% of all annual spending on Social Security and Medicare. The Government Accountability Office estimates the government loses $233 billion to $521 billion per year due to fraud. When asked about Musk's $700 billion fraud estimates, Fields said \"I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility.\"",
      "And DOGE's efforts to slash the federal workforce could end up costing $135 billion due to paid leave and productivity costs, an analysis by the Partnership for Public Service estimates.",
      "That estimate was dismissed by the White House. \"The continued attempts to sow doubt in the massive accomplishments of this never-before-seen effort to make government more efficient speaks more about the illegitimacy of those peddling these falsehoods than good work of DOGE,\" Fields told CBS News last week.",
      "Thousands of federal workers cut since Trump and Musk's \"fork in the road\"",
      "When the Trump administration emailed millions of federal workers in January to offer months of pay in exchange for quitting their jobs, the message's subject line \u2014 \"Fork in the Road\" \u2014 was identical to the one Musk used to coax staff into leaving Twitter after he bought the site.",
      "Since then, Musk has played a central role in efforts to cut up to 10% of the civilian workforce.",
      "The White House says 75,000 people took the \"Fork in the Road\" deferred resignation deal, which offered to pay employees until the end of September if they resigned from their positions by early February. As many as 200,000 workers were expected to participate. Tens of thousands of federal employees have also been laid off, including large numbers of probationary workers with less than one or two years of service.",
      "The job cuts have hit across the federal government. DOGE staffers visited the Pentagon in February as the military plans to eliminate tens of thousands of civilian roles. The Social Security Administration has lost thousands of workers, and the Internal Revenue Service could cut its staff by 25% according to the Associated Press.",
      "Health agencies have been hit by the administration's cuts. The National Institutes of Health is expected to face steep budget cuts, a move former NIH Director Francis Collins warned could have dire consequences for public health in an interview with \"60 Minutes.\" The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has lost 10% of its staff, CBS News reported.",
      "Some 1,000 National Park Service workers were laid off, raising fears about understaffing.",
      "Fields told CBS News the Trump administration's job cuts are designed to avoid any disruption to critical government services, but added: \"To a bureaucracy that has gone untouched for decades, it's going to be disruptive.\"",
      "In some cases, laid-off probationary workers have been rehired due to now-paused court orders that halted the job cuts, causing confusion. \"We're supposed to be OK. But one minute we're in a good space, and the next minute we could just lose everything,\" one rehired Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services staff member told CBS News.",
      "Meanwhile, Musk has publicly blasted the federal workforce, claiming DOGE is on a mission to eliminate a \"dictatorship of the bureaucracy\" that's hostile to Mr. Trump's agenda.",
      "In February, federal employees received an email with the subject line, \"What did you do last week?\" instructing them to reply with a list of five things they'd accomplished. Musk warned on X that any non-responses \"will be taken as a resignation.\" The move set off confusion, with some agencies telling workers not to respond. Musk later called the emails a \"pulse check\" designed to root out dead or nonexistent people that he claims are collecting paychecks.",
      "DOGE tries to shut down agencies: USAID, CFPB and more",
      "Even if DOGE's cuts could fall short of Musk's goals, its influence has been sweeping.",
      "Within days of Mr. Trump's inauguration, DOGE began touting cancelled contracts, and its staff became embedded in scores of departments. Musk told Fox Business last month his team of over 100 people was in \"pretty much\" every agency. Many of the funding cuts have been abrupt, and Musk has admitted DOGE has made mistakes in its rapid push to slash spending.",
      "In some cases, Musk's team has participated in the near-dismantling of federal agencies. The gambit has often begun with DOGE staffers accessing an agency's offices \u2014 in some cases clashing with employees \u2014 followed by mass job cuts.",
      "The U.S. Agency for International Development, a foreign aid agency that Musk described as a \"criminal organization\" awash with fraud, was one of his earliest targets. Two USAID security officials were put on leave for trying to stop DOGE staffers from accessing internal systems (a Trump administration spokesperson said at the time classified information wasn't accessed without security clearances). The Trump administration later placed many of USAID's staff on leave, halted foreign aid programs and began absorbing what remained of USAID into the State Department.",
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has also drawn Musk's ire. In early February, DOGE personnel entered the financial regulator's office and \"camped out in the basement,\" a former agency staffer told CBS News' \"60 Minutes.\" Hours later, Musk posted on X, \"CFPB RIP.\" The administration has tried to lay off 90% of CFPB staff and halt the agency's work, though a federal judge has temporarily blocked those moves.",
      "DOGE's efforts at the U.S. Institute of Peace triggered a legal standoff, with several fired board members suing the administration and accusing DOGE personnel of engaging in a \"literal trespass and takeover by force\" at the agency's headquarters. The White House defended cuts to the organization at the time, telling CBS News, \"Taxpayers don't want to spend $50 million per year on a publicly-funded 'research institute' that has failed to deliver peace.\"",
      "Musk accesses federal data",
      "Personnel at DOGE gained access to the Treasury Department's internal payment system in the first few weeks of Mr. Trump's term, which Musk cast as a way to catch fraud. The move prompted concern from Democrats due to the sensitive personal data handled by the system and the possibility that DOGE could try to cut off spending authorized by Congress. The Trump administration said at the time Musk's team has \"read-only\" access.",
      "In mid-February, a staffer linked to DOGE also sought access to the Internal Revenue Service's taxpayer data system, drawing criticism from Democratic lawmakers. Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller said the administration is planning a \"basic anti-fraud review to ensure that people are not engaging in large scale theft of federal taxpayer benefits.\"",
      "Musk has scrutinized the Social Security Administration, which he claims is rife with fraud, suggesting tens of millions of dead people are receiving payments and immigrants are abusing the system en masse, though he's never offered any evidence for either of these assertions. He's described Social Security as a \"Ponzi scheme,\" though both Musk and Mr. Trump have said they would not cut benefits. At one point earlier this year, the SSA considered requiring Social Security recipients to verify their identities in person instead of over the phone, but the agency reversed course after seniors and their advocates objected.",
      "Musk clashes with Democrats, courts \u2014 and even Trump allies",
      "Musk's rise to power has drawn outrage from Democrats, who argue DOGE has unilaterally slashed spending appropriated by Congress. Most Republican lawmakers defended DOGE, though some have raised concerns about sweeping cuts to public health agencies and programs important to their districts.",
      "Public opinion on Musk is similarly divided. Some 52% of Americans said in late February Musk and DOGE had too much influence over federal worker firing decisions, including 81% of Democrats and 57% of independents but just 21% of Republicans, according to a CBS News poll with a margin of error of 2.5 points.",
      "Musk has occasionally clashed with other Trump loyalists. His pick for interim IRS leader \u2014 Hunter Biden whistleblower Gary Shapley \u2014 left the role after just 48 hours, after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent privately complained to Mr. Trump. And Musk publicly feuded with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro over tariffs, calling him \"dumber than a sack of bricks.\"",
      "DOGE's aggressive moves have also drawn lawsuits arguing the agency has exceeded its authority. At various points, judges have halted DOGE's efforts to lay off workers and access the Treasury payment system, though in many cases, those rulings were stayed.",
      "Some legal challenges have zeroed in on Musk's official status in the administration. The White House says Musk is a \"special government employee,\" which allows him to serve for up to 130 days in a single yearlong period. The administration has argued in court papers that Musk isn't officially DOGE's administrator and \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"",
      "DOGE clashes with Musk's business interests",
      "Musk's business empire benefits heavily from federal programs. Tesla sells billions of dollars a year in credits to automakers that fall short of federal emission rules, and its cars are subsidized by tax incentives for electric vehicles \u2014 though Mr. Trump has called for a rollback of electric car subsidies. Mr. Trump has also offered his public endorsement, promising to buy a Tesla in a White House event. Musk's aerospace company SpaceX has valuable contracts with NASA, and its satellite internet division Starlink could take over a contract to modernize the air traffic control system, the Associated Press reports.",
      "Musk has pushed back on conflict-of-interest concerns, saying in an Oval Office appearance with Mr. Trump, \"all of our actions are maximally transparent.\"",
      "But DOGE has caused agita for Tesla investors, some of whom fear Musk is too distracted to run the company or his polarizing image could hurt the carmaker's brand. The company's sales and profits have fallen over the past year, and its share price is down nearly 25% from early January, prompting some investors to urge him to step back from the Trump administration.",
      "Musk said on a Tesla earnings call last week his \"time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly\" in May. But he added that he'll remain involved for the rest of Mr. Trump's term.",
      "There's no indication DOGE or Musk's work at the White House will end next month. \"Elon Musk will still be a common face here,\" Fields said.",

    "summary": "As President Trump marks his first 100 days in the White House, many of the plans he has rolled out since the start of his second term closely align with those detailed in Project 2025's sprawling policy book.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump repeatedly distanced himself from Project 2025 on the campaign trail, saying he had \"nothing to do with\" the initiative spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation, had not read it and didn't have any plans to.",
      "But as the president marks 100 days in the White House, many of the plans he has rolled out since the start of his second term closely align with those in the pages of Project 2025's sprawling, 900-page policy blueprint, which lays out an overhaul of the executive branch.",
      "Overseen by the Heritage Foundation, Project 2025 was an initiative that was designed to provide a roadmap for the next Republican president, now Mr. Trump. On the campaign trail, the president called some of its proposals \"abysmal\" and said he knew nothing about it, though CBS News' analysis showed many of its proposals were similar to his own.",
      "The authors of some of the policy guide's chapters served in his first administration and have returned for the second. Russ Vought is leading the Office of Management and Budget, and John Ratcliffe is in place as CIA director, while Peter Navarro, who was a top trade adviser to Mr. Trump in his first administration, returned for a second stint in the White House.",
      "Some of Mr. Trump's actions taken in his first days in office reinstate measures he put in place during his first term that were revoked by President Biden. But in other instances, Mr. Trump has taken new executive actions that echo policies outlined in Project 2025's policy book.",
      "Abolishing the Department of Education",
      "Republicans have long called for the Department of Education to be dismantled, and that recommendation was also made in Project 2025, which declared that \"federal education policy should be limited and, ultimately, the federal Department of Education should be eliminated.\"",
      "Mr. Trump took steps to begin that process with an executive order he signed in March. The administration has already cut the Education Department's staff and is making plans to move some of its functions to other agencies.",
      "Shuttering the Department of Education, however, would require an act of Congress.",
      "Ending diversity, equity and inclusion practices",
      "The president frequently rails against diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, practices, and he signed an executive order on the day he returned to the White House ending all DEI programs within the federal government.",
      "Mr. Trump claimed in his order that DEI policies can violate federal civil rights laws and shut out Americans \"who deserve a shot at the American dream\" because of their race or sex.",
      "Project 2025 likewise calls for the \"DEI apparatus\" at a variety of agencies to be dismantled.",
      "Project 2025's policy book also calls for deleting a variety of terms, including DEI, abortion and gender equality \"from every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists.\"",
      "Some of the Trump administration's early efforts to purge mentions of gender or race resulted in missteps that prompted a public outcry and were later reversed.",
      "Shifting FEMA costs to the states",
      "Shortly after the start of his second term, Mr. Trump established a review council to advise him on the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, \"to capably and impartially address disasters occurring within the United States.\" The council will also advise the president on recommended changes related to FEMA, his order states.",
      "Mr. Trump's directive came after he suggested that he could \"get rid\" of FEMA and leave disaster response management to the states.",
      "\"That's what states are for, to take care of problems,\" he said in late January.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in March that declares it is the policy of the U.S. that \"state and local governments and individuals play a more active and significant role in national resilience and preparedness,\" and says that his administration will \"enable state and local governments to better understand, plan for and ultimately address the needs of their citizens.\"",
      "The overhaul at FEMA has sparked concerns about the agency's capabilities to deliver disaster assistance ahead of hurricane season. FEMA has already denied requests for federal aid in response to severe storms and tornadoes\u00a0in Arkansas, flooding in parts of\u00a0West Virginia and storms\u00a0in Washington.",
      "Project 2025's sweeping book of policy proposals calls for \"reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government.\"",
      "It also urges Congress to change the cost-sharing arrangement so the federal government covers 25% of the costs for small disasters and up to 75% for \"truly catastrophic disasters.\" Currently, for Public Assistance, which provides financial and direct assistance to state and local governments for disaster response and recovery work, FEMA covers a minimum of 75% of costs, and the president can increase the federal cost-share at his discretion, according to a 2023 report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The recommendation follows a warning from Project 2025's authors that FEMA is \"overtasked, overcompensates for the lack of state and local preparedness and response, and is regularly in deep debt.\" Project 2025's book also calls on Congress to end preparedness grants for states and localities.",
      "\"DHS should not be in the business of handing out federal tax dollars: These grants should be terminated,\" it states.",
      "Targeting PBS and National Public Radio",
      "Brendan Carr, head of the Federal Communications Commission, informed the heads of National Public Radio and PBS in a letter earlier this year that the agency had opened an investigation into the airing of their programming across their roughly 1,500 broadcast member stations, according to The New York Times.",
      "Those stations are licensed by the FCC to operate, but are limited to operating as noncommercial educational broadcast stations. These stations, or NCEs, are exempt from licensing fees and operate on a specific \"reserved\" frequency band. Federal law prohibits these noncommercial educational broadcast stations from airing commercial advertisements.",
      "In his letter, Carr wrote that he is \"concerned that NPR and PBS broadcasts could be violating federal law by airing commercials. In particular, it is possible that NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting underwriting announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements.\"",
      "Carr also said that he also does not see a reason for Congress to continue approving federal dollars for NPR and PBS \"given the changes in the media marketplace.\" PBS CEO Paula Kerger said the cuts \"would devastate PBS member stations and the essential role they play in communities, particularly smaller and rural stations.\"",
      "Carr authored the section of Project 2025's policy book that deals with the FCC, but another portion of the blueprint urges Congress to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides grants to NPR and PBS.",
      "According to Project 2025, \"stripping public funding would, of course, mean that NPR, PBS, Pacifica Radio, and the other leftist broadcasters would be shorn of the presumption that they act in the public interest and receive the privileges that often accompany so acting.\" The outlets should therefore no longer be qualified as noncommercial educational broadcast stations, according to the book.",
      "Freezing federal assistance",
      "One of Mr. Trump's first actions as president was to establish the White House's Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 DOGE \u2014 run by Elon Musk, to slash regulations and spending, and restructure federal agencies.",
      "On the heels of that move, the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, issued a two-page memo in January that ordered a freeze on grant, loan or federal assistance programs covered by Mr. Trump's executive orders, which would allow his administration \"time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of the funding for those programs consistent with the law and the president's priorities.\"",
      "The memo sparked widespread confusion and prompted concerns about whether programs providing meals for the elderly, pre-school funding for low-income children, medical research and other priorities approved by Congress would be impacted by the order.",
      "The White House then rescinded the memo but maintained the funding pause \"to end any confusion\" created by a federal court order temporarily pausing implementation of the freeze. Federal courts have since ordered the administration to reinstate any money that was frozen subject to the memo.",
      "Vought, the head of OMB, authored the section of Project 2025's policy book covering the Executive Office of the President, which includes the agency he has been tapped to lead.",
      "In it, he likens the budget office to an air-traffic control system for the president \"with the ability and charge to ensure that all policy initiatives are flying in sync and with the authority to let planes take off and, at times, ground planes that are flying off course.\"",
      "The memo may have been aimed at sparking a legal challenge to the Impoundment Control Act, a 1974 law that limits the president's ability to unilaterally freeze certain funds appropriated by Congress, and in most cases requires the president instead to ask Congress to rescind spending legislation.",
      "In Project 2025's policy blueprint, Vought also wrote the director of OMB must have \"sufficient visibility into the deep caverns of agency decision-making,\" and can achieve this by ensuring political appointees on his staff sign off on apportionments of funding authorized by Congress.",
      "Vought cited a 1870 law known as the Anti-Deficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending federal dollars in advance and requires funding be doled out in installments.",
      "\"This process, whereby agencies come to OMB for allotments of appropriated funding, is essential to the effective financial stewardship of taxpayer dollars,\" he wrote. \"OMB can then direct on behalf of a president the amount, duration, and purpose of any apportioned funding to ensure against waste, fraud, and abuse and ensure consistency with the president's agenda and applicable laws.\"",
      "Restricting gender-affirming care for minors",
      "Mr. Trump issued an executive order in January that seeks to bar the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care \u2014 puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures \u2014 for people under the age of 19.",
      "Called \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\" the order directs certain executive agencies to take steps to ensure medical institutions that receive federal grants \"end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\"",
      "It also instructs the secretary of defense to take regulatory action to exclude gender-affirming care for minors from insurance coverage provided by TRICARE, the Defense Department's health care program, and federal employee health benefit programs.",
      "Mr. Trump's order directs the head of the Department of Health and Human Services to withdraw March 2022 guidance on gender-affirming care.",
      "Project 2025's chapter on the Department of Health and Human Services calls for its Office of Civil Rights to \"remove all guidance issued under the Biden administration concerning sexual orientation and gender identity,\" including the March 2022 document.",
      "The book generally criticizes gender-affirming care as causing \"irreversible physical and mental harm to those who receive them\" and argues there is a lack of evidence surrounding it.",
      "Many families and doctors who care for transgender youth dispute that assessment, and a group of families filed a lawsuit claiming the order is discriminatory. Two different federal district courts have blocked the president's directive, and those injunctions are being appealed.",
      "Revoking security clearances",
      "Mr. Trump took executive action to start the process of revoking the security clearances of dozens of former intelligence officials who signed a letter in 2020 claiming emails found on a laptop owned by Hunter Biden bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign. He also announced he would revoke the security clearances of a number of prominent Democrats including former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton.",
      "Project 2025 also proposed stripping former intelligence officials of security clearances, under a more narrow set of circumstances, in a section on the intelligence community authored by Dustin Carmack, who worked at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "\"The president should immediately revoke the security clearances of any former directors, deputy directors, or other senior intelligence officials who discuss their work in the press or on social media without prior clearance from the current director,\" he wrote.",
      "Stripping civil servants of employment protections",
      "Among the slew of actions Mr. Trump took on his first day back in the White House was to reinstate an executive order issued during his first term that created \"Schedule F in the Excepted Service.\" The order creates a new employment category for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of employment protections.",
      "The order states that in recent years, \"there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership.\"",
      "\"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character,\" Mr. Trump's order reads.",
      "The order makes some minor changes to the president's prior measure from October 2020. But it notably adds a section that states that while employees in these new \"Schedule Policy/Career Positions,\" are not required to personally or politically support the current president or his policies, they are \"required to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability, consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive authority solely in the president.\"",
      "Failure to do so is grounds for termination of employment, Mr. Trump's executive order states. Critics say the change would enable the administration to fire government employees for no cause and replace them with Trump loyalists.",
      "Project 2025 repeatedly calls for Mr. Trump's Schedule F proposal to be reinstated.",
      "Reinstating service members who refused COVID-19 vaccines",
      "The president directed the secretaries of Defense or Homeland Security to reinstate service members, both active-duty and reserve, who were discharged after refusing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. (The vaccine requirement was lifted in 2023.) His order also states they should be reverted to their former rank and receive full back pay, benefits, bonus payments or compensation.",
      "The Project 2025 blueprint's section on the Defense Department, authored by Chris Miller, calls for the next administration to \"reinstate servicemembers to active duty who were discharged for not receiving the COVID vaccine, restore their appropriate rank, and provide back pay.\"",
      "Miller served as acting defense secretary in the final weeks of Mr. Trump's first term. His chief of staff, Kash Patel, is now serving as director of the FBI.",
      "Banning transgender people from the military",
      "During his first four years in the White House, Mr. Trump prohibited transgender people from serving in the military. President Biden repealed that ban, but Mr. Trump has issued an order that effectively bars transgender people from serving in the armed forces and withdraws his predecessor's order.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order states that \"expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\" Identifying as transgender, it continues, \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.\"",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States Government to establish high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity. This policy is inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria,\" the president's order states. \"This policy is also inconsistent with shifting pronoun usage or use of pronouns that inaccurately reflect an individual's sex.\"",
      "Project 2025 calls for a reversal of policies \"that allow transgender individuals to serve in the military. Gender dysphoria is incompatible with the demands of military service.\"",
      "SPARTA Pride, a nonprofit group comprising thousands of transgender service members, veterans and their supporters, disputed such claims, saying: \"Transgender Americans have served openly and honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces for nearly a decade. Thousands of transgender troops are currently serving, and are fully qualified for the positions in which they serve.\"",
      "The transgender military ban has since been blocked by two different federal courts, though the decisions have been appealed. The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene in one of those cases and is seeking to begin enforcing the ban.",
      "There are more than 1.2 million active-duty members of the military, according to the Defense Department. A January report from the Congressional Research Service found that roughly 1,892 active-duty service members received gender-affirming care from the Pentagon between January 2016 and May 2021. A Feb. 26 memo from the Pentagon found that between 2015 and 2024, it spent $52 million on care for active-duty members of the military to treat gender dysphoria.",
      "A hiring freeze",
      "On his first day in the White House, Mr. Trump issued a memorandum freezing hiring of federal civilian employees, which he extended to July 15. Positions that were vacant as of his inauguration at noon on Jan. 20 should also not be filled, he said.",
      "The order was part of his plans to reduce the size of the federal workforce, also a recommendation made in the Project 2025 policy roadmap.",
      "The book, though, warns that while \"reducing the number of federal employees seems an obvious way to reduce the overall expense of the civil service,\" prior attempts to do so by presidents of both parties \"did not lead to permanent and substantive reductions in the number of nondefense federal employees.\"",
      "Instead, Project 2025 suggests a \"freeze on all top career-position hiring to prevent 'burrowing-in' by outgoing political appointees.\"",
      "Withdrawing from World Health Organization",
      "Mr. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization in 2020 due to what his first administration said was a mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden reversed that decision when he took office, and Mr. Trump rolled back that move on his first day back in the White House.",
      "His latest order directed the secretary of state to inform the secretary-general of the United States and World Health Organization leadership of the U.S. decision to withdraw from the group. Health officials in the U.S. and around the world have warned the move will leave people at greater risk of dangerous outbreaks and give China a more dominant role at the World Health Organization.",
      "Project 2025, too, criticized the World Health Organization for its handling of the pandemic.",
      "\"The manifest failure and corruption of the World Health Organization (WHO) during the COVID-19 pandemic is an example of the danger that international organizations pose to U.S. citizens and interests,\" its book states.",
      "It said that when institutions act contrary to U.S. interests, the government \"must be prepared to take appropriate steps in response, up to and including withdrawal.\"",
      "Sending active-duty troops to the southern border",
      "Immigration was the topic of several executive actions taken by Mr. Trump on the first day of his presidency, including one order that assigns troops \"the mission to seal the borders and maintain the sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of the United States.\"",
      "The chapter of Project 2025's blueprint that covers the Department of Homeland Security was authored by Ken Cuccinelli, who served in the first Trump administration, and it, too, sees a role for the Defense Department in securing the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The Pentagon, Cucinelli writes, should \"explicitly acknowledge and adjust personnel and priorities to participate actively in the defense, including using military personnel and hardware to prevent illegal crossings between ports of entry and channel all cross-border traffic to legal ports of entry.\"",
      "A section on the Justice Department urges the next administration to \"take a creative and aggressive approach\" to tackling criminal organizations at the southern border.",
      "\"This could include use of active-duty military personnel and National Guardsmen to assist in arrest operations along the border \u2014 something that has not yet been done,\" Project 2025's chapter on the Justice Department states.",
      "Limiting refugee admissions",
      "Entry into the U.S. by refugees under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program was suspended earlier this year in accordance with an order by Mr. Trump on Jan. 20. His directive also orders the secretary of Homeland Security to suspend decisions on applications for refugee status.",
      "Mr. Trump has claimed that during the Biden administration, the U.S. has been \"inundated\" with high levels of migration, including through the Refugee Admissions Program.",
      "Project 2025, too, blames the Biden administration for overseeing what it says was a \"collapse\" of U.S. border security and immigration enforcement. To address this \"crisis,\" Project 2025 calls for \"rightsizing refugee admissions.\"",
      "\"The federal government's obligation to shift national security\u2013essential screening and vetting resources to the forged border crisis will necessitate an indefinite curtailment of the number of USRAP refugee admissions,\" its chapter on the State Department reads.",
      "The policy book calls for the State Department bureau that administers the Refugee Admissions Program to shift resources to challenges \"until the crisis can be contained and refugee-focused screening and vetting capacity can reasonably be restored.\"",
      "Rescinding temporary protected status designations",
      "As part of Mr. Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown, his administration has moved to end the Temporary Protected Status program for Haitians and Venezuelans.",
      "The TPS designation was created by Congress in 1990, and it allows the federal government to grant temporary immigration protections to migrants from countries facing war, environmental disasters or other crises that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The program allows beneficiaries to apply for renewable work permits and deportation deferrals.",
      "A federal judge in late March agreed to delay the Trump administration's attempt to end the TPS program that shields roughly 350,000 Venezuelan migrants, and a federal appeals court declined to pause that order while proceedings continue.",
      "Project 2025 calls on Congress to \"repeal temporary protected status designations.\"",
      "Capping indirect costs for university-based research",
      "The National Institutes of Health announced in a February memo that it would be capping the amount of funding for \"indirect costs\" at 15%, a cut from an average of between 27% and 28%. Indirect costs cover general expenses like facilities and administration.",
      "NIH said in its memo that it has spent billions on indirect costs for more than 2,500 universities, medical schools and other research institutions across the country, and noted that \"most private foundations that fund research provide substantially lower indirect costs than the federal government, and universities readily accept grants from these foundations.\"",
      "Project 2025 also focused on indirect costs and called on Congress to \"cap the indirect cost rate paid to universities so that it does not exceed the lowest rate a university accepts from a private organization to fund search efforts.\"",
      "\"This market-based reform would help reduce federal taxpayer subsidization of leftist agendas,\" the policy book read.",
      "While Project 2025 said it is up to Congress to cap the indirect cost rate, the Trump administration took this step unilaterally, prompting legal challenges from universities, states and organizations that represent medical colleges and schools.",
      "Universities and the NIH said the cuts will have a \"dire impact\" on lifesaving research, including clinical trials for cancer and Alzheimer's patients.",
      "Requiring disclosures of foreign gifts to universities",
      "As part of a series of executive orders addressing the education system, Mr. Trump issued a directive on April 23 that directs the education secretary to enforce a provision of the Higher Education Act that requires higher education institutions that receive federal dollars to disclose any gifts of contracts from a foreign source valued at $250,000 or more in a calendar year.",
      "The move is also part of Project 2025, which calls on the next administration to enforce that statute, investigate higher education institutions that do not honor the obligations laid out in the law and make \"appropriate referrals\" to the Justice Department.",
      "Asserting the president's power to remove federal officials",
      "Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has sought to fire the members of independent agencies and inspectors general, despite federal laws that lay out the grounds for their removals.",
      "The terminations have sparked multiple court fights that appear aimed at asserting what the Trump administration believes is the president's unrestricted power to remove executive branch officials. But a 90-year-old Supreme Court decision, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "In a February letter to Congress, then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said the Justice Department \"intends to urge the Supreme Court to overrule that decision, which prevents the president from adequately supervising principal officers in the executive branch who execute the laws on the president's behalf, and which has already been severely eroded by recent Supreme Court decisions.\"",
      "Project 2025, too, suggested the next Republican presidential administration should seek the reversal of Humphrey's Executor.",
      "\"The next conservative administration should formally take the position that Humphrey's Executor violates the Constitution's separation of powers,\" it states.",
      "Targeting NOAA",
      "Project 2025's policy book calls for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, known as NOAA, to be \"dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories.\"",
      "The guide says NOAA's six main components should either be downsized or broken up, including Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, or OAR, which Project 2025 claims is the \"source of much of NOAA's climate alarmism.\"",
      "The Trump administration has proposed sweeping changes and job cuts for NOAA, including a 25% cut to its 2026 budget, according to an internal memo obtained by CBS News in April. The proposal calls for OAR to be eliminated as an office, as well as funding for climate, weather and ocean laboratories, cooperative institutes and other programs.",
      "Current and former officials with NOAA have said the memo's objectives are \"devastating,\" and have argued that research is crucial to improving services such as severe weather forecasts\u00a0for the public.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 09:35:27 -0400",
    "summary": "Canadian Prime Minster Mark Carney's Liberal Party will retain its hold on power, in a reversal of fortunes seen largely as a reaction to Mr. Trump's actions and rhetoric.",
    "story": [
      "Canada's Liberal Party won Monday's federal election, marking a sharp political turnaround seemingly powered largely by the territorial threats and tariff tactics of President Trump.",
      "Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberals were projected to win more of the Canadian Parliament's 343 seats than the rival Conservatives. It wasn't immediately clear if the Liberals would claim an outright majority of at least 172 seats, or if they'd be forced to rely on lawmakers from a smaller party or parties to get new legislation passed.",
      "Canadians decided with Monday's vote to grant the Liberal Party a fourth term in power, now with Carney at the helm, rather than to transfer control to the Conservatives and their populist leader Pierre Poilievre, who only months earlier had been projected to win the election decisively.",
      "The Liberal Party's popularity had been declining for years, eventually leading to former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation in March, and the Conservatives appeared poised to take control of the federal government \u2014 until Mr. Trump stepped in.",
      "The American president's repeated\u00a0threats to annex Canada and his sweeping tariffs, which have undermined Canada's economy, dominated the campaign and influenced voters' choices. Domestic issues including affordability, immigration, jobs and crime remained significant factors.",
      "\"As I have been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country. Never,\" declared Carney in a victory speech on Monday evening. \"These are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.\"",
      "Calling it a \"hinge moment\" in history, Carney said Canada's \"old relationship with the United States \u2014 a relationship based on steadily increasing integration \u2014 is over. The system of open global trade, anchored by the United States, a system that Canada has relied on since the Second World War, a system that, while not perfect, has helped deliver prosperity for our country for decades, is over. These are tragedies, but it's also our new reality... We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons. We have to look out for ourselves and, above all, we have to take care of each other.\"",
      "Poilievre, a seasoned politician for the Conservatives, lost his parliamentary seat in Ottawa, casting doubt on his continued leadership of the party. Monday's election marked a significant turn of events for the leader, who was first elected to the parliament in 2004.",
      "Despite the blow, Poilievre vowed to remain in his position as party leader, and he pledged in a speech Monday night to keep fighting for change.",
      "\"Every single day, our conservative caucus and I will be holding the government to account on behalf of millions of Canadians who believed in the message of change,\" Poilievre told his party's supporters.",
      "According to Elections Canada, a record number of Canadians \u2014 an estimated 7.3 million \u2014  cast their votes in advance, a 25% increase compared to the 2021 elections.",
      "A diverse group of voters gathered Monday inside a school gym in Milton City, Ontario, to cast their ballots. While they were divided on who would be best to deal with Mr. Trump, they all agreed that Canada's sovereignty, tariffs and the affordability of everyday goods were the main issues on their minds as they cast their votes.",
      "\"Trump's decisions are affecting not just Canada but the rest of the world,\" a couple who voted for the Liberals told CBS News outside a polling station. \"The tariffs affected the market; it affected prices of all goods, food, anything.\"",
      "Opponents cast the Conservatives' leader Poilievre as having similarities with Mr. Trump, which may have ended up costing him on election day.",
      "\"A couple of things that, unfortunately, Pierre has come out with which we didn't agree with,\" the couple in Milton City, who wished to remain anonymous, told CBS News. \"Might sound silly, but the fact he wants to bring back plastic bags and straws \u2014 I didn't like that idea.\"",
      "One voter named Peter said he considered the issue of Canadian sovereignty while casting his vote. Although he did not specify which party he believed could best address concerns over Mr. Trump's threats to make Canada a \"51st state,\" he stressed the need for Canadian unity.",
      "John Ivsky, a self-employed businessman from Milton, said he considered the election crucial, emphasizing the issue of tariffs. He said Canada should seek more and different global partners.",
      "\"Canada needs to build its own economy and broader partnerships,\" Ivsky told CBS News. \"America shouldn't be the only economic, military, or political partner. We need partners all over the world, so we don't suffer from one political change in one country.\"",
      "\"I respect and vote for every party that can support family values, conservative values, freedom of speech, and I vote for the one that can reflect my beliefs, whether that's Liberal or Conservative,\" said Ivsky. \"At this point, Conservatives are the ones that can do that.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump once again injected himself into the election campaign. In a post on Truth Social, he repeated his idea of making Canada the 51st U.S. state and called on Canadian voters to vote for the person who could make that possible \u2014 without naming either political party.",
      "\"Good luck to the Great people of Canada. Elect the man who has the strength and wisdom to cut your taxes in half, increase your military power, for free, to the highest level in the World, have your Car, Steel, Aluminum, Lumber, Energy, and all other businesses, QUADRUPLE in size,\u00a0 WITH ZERO TARIFFS OR TAXES, if Canada becomes the cherished 51st State of the United States of America,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "In response to his remarks, Poilievre said Canada would never become the 51st state, and he urged the American president to stay out of Canadian elections.",
      "\"President Trump, stay out of our election. The only people who will decide the future of Canada are Canadians at the ballot box,\" Poilievre said in French in a social media\u00a0post. \"Canada will always be proud, sovereign and independent and we will NEVER be the 51st State. Today Canadians can vote for change so we can strengthen our country, stand on our own two feet and stand up to America from a position of strength.\"",
      "In his campaign, Carney pleaded with voters to deliver him a strong mandate to deal with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"President Trump has some obsessive ideas, and that is one,\" Carney said of the annexation threats. \"It's not a joke. It's his very strong desire to make this happen. It's one of the reasons why this crisis is so serious.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 09:32:29 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump and his nominee for surgeon general, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, have made claims about her certification and schooling that appear to be misleading.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to be the U.S. surgeon general, the Fox News contributor and family medicine physician Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, has described herself as a double board-certified physician with a degree from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine \u2014 credentials the president touted\u00a0in his announcement.",
      "But those claims about her certification and schooling appear to be misleading.",
      "Nesheiwat actually earned her medical degree from the American University of the Caribbean (AUC) School of Medicine, located in St. Maarten, in the Caribbean, according to records reviewed by CBS News. A spokesperson for the University of Arkansas confirmed to CBS News she completed her residency through its family medicine program in Fayetteville, Arkansas, but did not obtain her medical degree there.",
      "Nesheiwat has not yet come before the U.S. Senate's health committee for a confirmation hearing, where she is expected to face questions about her credentials. The U.S. surgeon general is known for setting the national agenda on public health. Past surgeons general have marshaled attention for priority issues such as the dangers of cigarette smoking, gun violence and an epidemic of loneliness.",
      "Currently, Nesheiwat's LinkedIn profile incorrectly lists a Doctor of Medicine from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine, while omitting any mention of AUC. In at least one instance on social media, she has referenced attending \"American University\" when describing her education \u2014 without clarifying that it was not the similarly named American University in Washington, D.C., which does not have a medical school. In that same posting she said she \"completed the majority of my studies in London, England, at St. Thomas & Guy's Hospital.\" CBS News was unable to verify that with the foundation that runs those London hospitals.",
      "Questions about Nesheiwat's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 were first reported by independent freelance writer Anthony Clark\u00a0on Substack.",
      "AUC's medical degree is generally a four-year program: the first two years consist of classroom training in St. Maarten, and the final two years consist of clinical rotations at a medical facility.",
      "According to AUC, Nesheiwat was enrolled at the school for six years, from 2000 to 2006.",
      "This extended enrollment period reflects broader concerns that have drawn federal attention in recent years and fueled stigma against medical schools in the Caribbean, which are sometimes perceived as a last resort for students who couldn't qualify for a U.S. medical school. The schools themselves and many graduates strongly dispute that assessment.",
      "Senators Dick Durbin and Bill Cassidy have introduced a bill in several congressional sessions aimed at closing a loophole that allowed certain Caribbean medical schools, including AUC, to bypass standards imposed on other foreign institutions. This loophole enabled the schools to remain eligible for federal funds despite lower on-time graduation rates. According to Durbin's office, students at these schools often take longer to complete their medical degrees, which results in higher debt and greater difficulty securing residency placements.",
      "\"They don't have to meet the same high standards U.S. medical schools must meet, but also don't have to meet the same requirements as schools located outside of the U.S. to access hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding,\" Durbin said.",
      "Some organizations, including the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, argue that these schools are important for helping to alleviate the physician shortage America is facing. The group's founder, Robert Goldberg, told CBS News, \"In a perfect world, everyone would tell the truth and something like this to me is not an issue.\"",
      "Goldberg says that in this time when some people are down on expertise, this could work to her advantage. \"Don't be afraid to talk about it. Maybe this will be a teachable moment for her,\" he said.",
      "The claims regarding her board certification have also raised questions. Nesheiwat is frequently described as double board-certified, including on her own website. The claim has gone unchallenged during her many past media appearances \u2014 including on CBS News. CBS News has only been able to verify her certification in family medicine.",
      "Nesheiwat's\u00a0Physcian Profile\u00a0for New York State only lists her certification in family medicine. The American Board of Medical Specialties, the largest and oldest certification organization in the U.S., told CBS News the only certification they had for her was for family medicine.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Nesheiwat and the White House for comment but have not received a response.",
      "Dr. Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University, says these inaccurate or misleading statements are \"very, very troubling.\" Caplan says the surgeon general's job \"depends on trust and credibility. You don't actually control anything. You are a spokesperson and educator for the public. If you begin by not being totally transparent or making a false claim about your training it's a really bad start.\"",
      "\"She must be to do the job crystal clear and transparent about her background, and being nervous about her background doesn't mean she should cover up her background,\" he told CBS News.",
      "In her 2024 autobiographical book, \"Beyond the Stethoscope: Miracles in Medicine,\" Nesheiwat makes no mention of her Caribbean medical education. Instead, she writes: \"I studied at the University of South Florida where I enrolled in an Army ROTC program. I did basic training in Fort Lewis, Washington, and completed my medical training at the University of Arkansas where I served as chief resident.\"",
      "Nesheiwat attended the University of South Florida for her undergraduate degree in biology and participated in Army ROTC. According to the U.S. Army Cadet Command, she completed the program's requirements but was \"medically disenrolled\" in June 2000, prior to commissioning as an officer.",
      "Her upbringing includes both personal tragedy and perseverance. Her family immigrated to the U.S. from Jordan following political unrest in the 1950s. At age 13, Nesheiwat was involved in a tragic accident in which she accidentally shot and killed her father. She and her four siblings were raised by her mother, who was a nurse.",
      "After completing her residency, Nesheiwat began working at CityMD, an urgent care provider in New York and New Jersey. She has been variously described in media appearances and press materials as \"medical director,\" \"CityMD Medical Director for emergency and family medicine,\" and \"a medical director at CityMD.\" On her website she describes herself as \"the Medical Director at CityMed.\" The exact nature of her role remains unclear. CBS News reached out to CityMD for clarification and received comment from the company's COO stating that \"She is an exceptional physician who truly stands out,\" but did not provide clarification on her job title or position at the company.",
      "Nesheiwat gained public visibility as a Fox News contributor during the COVID-19 pandemic, offering practical health advice and personal insights from her clinical work. As an urgent care physician practicing in the New York metropolitan area at the time, she saw firsthand COVID's devastating effects. Nesheiwat has acknowledged that she initially prescribed hydroxychloroquine but stopped when studies showed it was ineffective. She has said the COVID vaccine has been helpful but has also criticized the Biden administration over lockdowns during the pandemic.",
      "Her sister, Julia Nesheiwat, is a national security expert who served in the Obama administration and is married to Mike Waltz, a former member of Congress who now serves as national security adviser to President Trump.",
      "If confirmed, Neshewat would oversee 6,000 uniformed officers who are part of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services. She would also be in charge of communicating to the public about \"the best scientific information available on how to improve their health and reduce the risk of illness and injury.\"",
      "Some of her views may conflict with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spread the unfounded theory of a connection between vaccines and autism. In her book, she wrote: \"Science and rigorous testing have shown these vaccines to be safe and highly effective at suppressing disease. Leading to increased vaccine hesitancy has been the proliferation of poorly researched studies purporting to link vaccines to autism and other problems.\"",

      "President Trump is marking the first 100 days in office of his second term on Tuesday evening with a\u00a0speech in Macomb County, Michigan, outside Detroit.",
      "He's expected to hit the highlights of his second term so far, including mass deportation operations, efforts to shrink the size and scope of government and the changes he's making to the global trade landscape. Those endeavors have not gone unopposed, prompting scores of lawsuits filed by ousted government employees, migrants fighting their deportation and business owners who argue the president's tariffs are unlawful.",

      "\"[I]nflation has cooled, consumer prices dropped month-over-month for the first time in three years, and gas prices are lower across the country,\" the White House said in announcing the speech, and it went on to praise the Department of Government Efficiency for rooting out \"waste, fraud, and abuse across the executive branch\" and canceling \"numerous discriminatory DEI contracts.\"",
      "DOGE's work continues apace, with billionaire Elon Musk unofficially guiding efforts to downsize government. So far, however, DOGE's cuts aren't anywhere close to approaching the $2 trillion Musk initially said he'd slash from annual spending. Those efforts have also landed the federal government in multiple courtrooms over the firings, downsizing and elimination of government-funded programs.",
      "The Trump administration claims it has done more to secure the border in the president's first 100 days in office than any other president in history. Illegal border crossings\u00a0have reached\u00a0lows not seen in decades, and the administration has been working to deport migrants accused or convicted of violent crimes and drug-related offenses. But Mr. Trump's decision to invoke wartime authorities to send migrants to an El Salvador prison without due process has resulted in lawsuits, as has the president's efforts to end\u00a0birthright citizenship.",
      "The 100-day mark comes as the Trump administration is hashing out trade negotiations with countries across the world after Mr. Trump levied nearly worldwide tariffs on foreign imports, tariffs that most economists say will make goods more expensive and worsen economic prospects. Mr. Trump claimed in an interview with TIME that he's reached 200 trade deals with other countries since April 2, but declined to name any of the countries. Americans are skeptical of the president's tariff approach, CBS News polling shows, and most worry they'll contribute to higher prices at a time when high prices are a top concern for voters.",
      "It's unclear how much the president will focus on foreign policy matters, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt argued the administration has made significant progress on the foreign policy front. After repeatedly saying he would end the war in Ukraine before even taking office, Mr. Trump is now saying those comments were made in \"jest.\"",
      "\"We are closer today to a peace deal in Russia and Ukraine, certainly, than we were when we took office on Jan. 20,\" Leavitt told reporters Monday. \"If you look at the situation in the Middle East, Israel has never had a stronger friend than they do right now in the Oval Office with President Trump.

Mr. Trump's use of executive authority over the past 100 days also surpasses the number of executive orders signed by Obama and Bush during their entire second terms. Obama hit 129 executive orders, and Bush 118.",

As well, these misbehaviors are cues to where the nominee will go if ceded the position of United States Attorney.\"",

      "Shortly after 6 a.m., the pair began livestreaming their conversation, while Booker warned of a \"moment of moral urgency\" as Congress is set to return from a two-week recess on Monday. The New Jersey Democrat had pledged to sit and discuss the coming fight for \"a good number of hours,\" a promise he kept by remaining on the steps for more than half a day.",
      "Booker noted the protest had gotten approximately 6 million views online through various platforms as of Sunday evening. The sit-in came less than a month after Booker delivered a record-breaking\u00a025-hour speech\u00a0on the Senate floor to protest the Trump administration's policies.",
      "Congressional committees are set to begin work this week on the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's first-year agenda, after both the House and Senate adopted a budget resolution that serves as a blueprint before leaving town for recess. The plan is a key step toward implementing Mr. Trump's priorities on border security, defense, energy and taxes, and GOP leaders in Congress have circled an ambitious goal of getting it to the president's desk by Memorial Day.",
      "Republicans are pursuing the plan under the budget reconciliation process, which allows the party in power the ability to approve major legislation without working across the aisle. Meanwhile, Democrats have vehemently opposed the plan, pushing back chiefly against potential cuts to Medicaid.",
      "\"As we prepare to come back into session tomorrow, this is a time to choose,\" Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said as the conversation kicked off early Sunday. \"And we're either going to choose the side of the American people, or we're going to choose this cruel budget that Republicans are trying to jam down the throats of the American people.\"",
      "Jeffries and Booker were joined by other lawmakers throughout the conversation, including Sens.

      "In the early part of the sit-in, the conversation ranged from the budget plan to more broad opposition to the Trump administration, along with personal stories that centered on faith.

      "After both the House and Senate adopted a budget resolution that serves as a blueprint earlier this month, congressional committees are set to begin work this week on the massive plan key to implementing Mr. Trump's priorities on border security, defense, energy and taxes. The legislation aims to extend the 2017 tax cuts, along with authorizing additional tax cuts, while raising the debt ceiling by as much as $5 trillion. And GOP leaders have circled an ambitious goal to pass Mr. Trump's \"one big, beautiful\" bill by Memorial Day.",

      "The committee work marks the next step in the budget reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance a bill in the Senate and grants the party in power the ability to approve major legislation without working across the aisle. But finding the cuts, and getting the necessary Republican support, will be a heavy lift.",
      "Meanwhile, congressional Democrats spent the recess rallying their ranks against the key GOP budget plan and forthcoming legislation, after months of handwringing over how to respond to the Trump administration and Republican majorities in Congress.",
      "On Sunday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Sen. Cory Booker took to the Capitol steps for more than 12 hours for a sit-in protest against the Republican budget plan, warning of a moment of \"moral urgency\" when Congress returns. They were joined throughout the day by a slew of House and Senate Democrats eager to oppose the forthcoming GOP legislation.",

      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer outlined in a dear colleagues letter Sunday that soon Republicans are expected to take the next steps on their budget plan, claiming they intend to \"cut taxes for billionaires while slashing Medicaid into oblivion.\" The New York Democrat urged that Democrats \"must hammer away at the Republican agenda at every opportunity.\"",
      "Democrats have sounded the alarm over possible cuts to Medicaid in the GOP plan, with the House Energy and Commerce Committee that oversees Medicaid instructed to find the biggest spending cuts \u2014 at least $880 billion over the next decade. And the Congressional Budget Office backed up the concerns in an analysis released last month, which found that the budget goals outlined in the House GOP plan could not be reached without reducing spending on the popular program, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans.",
      "House Republican leadership has insisted that they will protect peoples' benefits, instead working to root out \"fraud, waste and abuse\" within the program. But the dispute over Medicaid has put some moderate Republicans in an awkward position, while sparking GOP disagreement over the scope of reshaping the program.",
      "Republicans are also working to reconcile other lingering disagreements that could stall the process, like division over the depth of spending cuts, after the House and Senate adopted a resolution that sets low minimum floors in the Senate, at just $4 billion, while House committees must cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending. Senate Majority Leader John Thune assured skeptical House Republicans that the upper chamber is committed to finding more cuts earlier this month as they prepared to move on the budget resolution, but the chasm remains.",
      "As congressional Republicans move forward, the timetable has appeared to slip in recent days, with an initial goal to have the entire package passed by both chambers and to the president's desk by Memorial Day that may become solely a deadline to get the legislation through the House. But the real deadline pressure could come with the Treasury Department's estimate of the \"X-date,\" which marks when the government could run out of borrowing power and face an unprecedented default without action from Congress to address the debt limit.",

    "story": [
      "Is 100 days enough time to evaluate this president? His supporters generally don't think so, but others do \u2014 perhaps because most Americans think President Trump is already making major changes to how the government \u2014 and the U.S. economy \u2014 work.",
      "Those opening days, in public opinion terms, have been marked by Mr. Trump's continued support from a loyal base of supporters, but also a widespread and growing belief among others that the administration is focused too much on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices. That's weighing on his approval ratings on the economy and inflation, which have gone down.",
      "Alongside that, he continues to get majority approval for his deportation program, though more Americans prioritize the economy in their evaluations of him.",
      "MAGA Republicans, in contrast, say their evaluations are based more on immigration and overwhelmingly approve of his efforts there. Plus they have a much rosier outlook on the U.S. economy than Americans overall now that Trump is in office, and most of them say it is too soon to judge him.",
      "Others who voted for him, but who don't identify as MAGA, have become a little less approving of his handling of the economy and inflation in recent months. And since the start of his term, his approval rating has slid among some groups he made gains with in the 2024 election, including independents, young people, and Hispanic people.",
      "Overall, Mr. Trump sees disapproval on the economy from those who think he's put too much focus on tariffs.",
      "And meanwhile, Democrats overwhelmingly disapprove of what they see from him, want their party to oppose him more and say they're \"frustrated\" with the Democratic Party's response so far. Mr. Trump's approval rating among people who sat out the '24 election started out higher, too.",
      "Those perceived changes elicit different judgments, though. Republicans say they are for the better, and Democrats, the worse. Asked how Trump's presidency so far has made them feel, most Republicans say they're satisfied, while Democrats and independents say they're frustrated and nervous.",
      "Measuring a president at 100 days is something of a contrivance that is based on a marker set during Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first term back in the 1930s. Then again, many presidents come in promising a lot of action quickly. Most Americans do think they can judge this administration in that time frame. Mr. Trump's 2024 voters, and most of his current approvers, are less likely to think it's enough time, whereas his disapprovers think it's enough.",
      "Tariffs, promises and prices",
      "Mr. Trump's voters widely believe he's doing what he promised in the campaign. Most of the public agrees \u2014 whether or not they like what he's doing \u2014 though the percentage is down from the early weeks of his term.",
      "People who think Mr. Trump is putting too much focus on tariffs are more likely to say he's doing different things from what he promised.",
      "Here's how differences on economics play out:",
      "MAGA Republicans stand apart in their outlook for the U.S. economy. While most Americans say it is getting worse, MAGA Republicans say it is getting better. They also rate the current economy much better than others do. So, while evaluations of the economy remain mostly bad, Republicans' views have pushed the overall ratings up a bit, with an even larger partisan gap now.",
      "Overall, more Americans continue to say Trump's policies are making them financially worse off than better off. Expectations at the start of his term were different \u2014 more expected his policies to improve their finances.",
      "Two-thirds of those who think they're being made worse off say he isn't doing what he promised.",
      "And that has led to declining approval of his handling of the economy and inflation, specifically. Both ratings are now their lowest levels of the term so far. His rating on inflation is driven very much by the impact of his policies people see on prices.",
      "Support for tariffs has been declining, as a rising number of Americans feel the administration is focusing too much on the issue. And over recent weeks, fewer now believe Mr. Trump has a clear plan for tariffs and trade.",
      "When asked to pick what issue is most important to them in judging the Trump administration, the economy and immigration top the list. Those judging Mr. Trump on immigration heavily approve of his overall job performance, while those judging him on the economy disapprove in large numbers.",
      "Mr. Trump's overall approval rating is down from the high at the start of this term.",
      "Immigration and deportation",
      "Most Americans think Mr. Trump's policies have reduced border crossings. Most also continue to approve of his deportation program in general.",
      "Meanwhile, three-quarters say it isn't acceptable if some legal residents are detained by mistake as part of that program. A large 8 in 10 say it wouldn't be acceptable if some legal residents are deported to foreign countries.",
      "And most who don't think these things would be acceptable disapprove of his overall handling of immigration.",
      "(On this, MAGA Republicans do stand differently from others, coming in about twice as likely as Americans overall to say legal residents being detained would be acceptable.)",
      "It may be that the perceived implementation of the deportation plan is affecting larger views of how Mr. Trump is handling immigration, even as a majority approve of the deportation program in general. On balance, his handling of immigration, generally, is lower than it was earlier in term. Independents, especially those with college degrees, have become less approving over time.",
      "Most Americans also think Mr. Trump is trying to expand the powers of the presidency \u2014 a view driven heavily by Democrats and those who disapprove of his job performance. And those who think he is are more likely to feel democracy and rule of law in the U.S. is threatened.",
      "Most Americans do support limits to Mr. Trump's powers as president, though. A majority think he should get his policies enacted by working with Congress to pass legislation rather than through executive orders, and majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents alike feel Mr. Trump should follow a Supreme Court ruling if it goes against his administration. Republicans also say their party in Congress should push back on Mr. Trump if they disagree with him.",

      "Trump administration border czar Tom Homan argued Sunday that \"due process\" was applied when a 2-year-old child who is a U.S. citizen was removed to Honduras along with her mother, who was deported.",
      "Louisiana Federal District Court Judge Terry Doughty wrote in an order Friday that there was a \"strong suspicion that the Government just deported a U.S. citizen with no meaningful process,\" after the 2-year-old was sent to Honduras with her mother and 11-year-old sister.",
      "But Homan said \"the judge was due process,\" adding on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the 2-year-old's mother \"had due process at great taxpayer expense and was ordered by an immigration judge after those hearings, so she had due process.\"",
      "Doughty, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, sought to arrange a phone call with the mother of the 2-year-old on Friday, but Justice Department lawyers informed him that a call with the child's mother would not be possible, according to court documents. Meanwhile, the 2-year-old's father tried to petition the court to have the child's legal custody temporarily transferred to a relative who is a U.S. citizen.",
      "When asked by Brennan about the timeframe and process allowed, Homan reiterated that \"there was due process.\"",
      "\"The 2-year-old went with the mom. The mom signed the paper, saying 'I want my 2-year-old to go with me,'\" Homan said. \"That's a parent's decision, it's not a government decision.\"",
      "The 2-year-old is among three children who are American citizens who were deported Friday with their mothers from the U.S. to Honduras, according to court documents reviewed by CBS News. Homan disputed the characterization, saying, \"we don't deport U.S. citizens\" and added that in these cases, \"the mother chose to take the children with her.\"",
      "\"This is parenting 101,\" Homan said. \"You can decide to take that child with you, or you can decide to leave a child here with a relative or another spouse.\"",
      "Among the children deported was a 4-year-old with Stage 4 cancer, advocates said. The \"border czar\" said he wasn't aware of that specific case. Homan argued that when someone enters the country illegally and chooses to have a child, automatically granting the child American citizenship, \"that's on you, that's not on this administration.\"",
      "\"Having a U.S. citizen child after you enter this country illegally is not a get out jail free card,\" Homan said. He added that it doesn't make people \"immune from our laws.\"",
      "The development comes as the Trump administration has conducted rapid deportations as it pursues an aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration. The moves have at times led to several court battles, including in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who lived in Maryland who the Justice Department has admitted was mistakenly among a group of men deported to a prison in El Salvador last month.",
      "More than 230 men, mostly Venezuelans, were deported on March 15 to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, although U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C., had ordered that the planes be turned around. The Trump administration says it can remove immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which was previously used during wartime. The case worked its way up to the Supreme Court, which at first ruled the deportations could continue as long as they were given due process.",
      "The Supreme Court last week temporarily blocked any new deportations from a detention center in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act.",

    "summary": "Columbus Day, the second Monday in October, was also recognized as Indigenous Peoples Day during former President Joe Biden's term in 2021.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump made clear Sunday that he would not follow his predecessor's practice of recognizing\u00a0Indigenous Peoples Day\u00a0alongside Columbus Day in October, accusing Democrats of denigrating the explorer's legacy as he pressed his campaign to restore\u00a0what he argues are traditional American icons.",
      "Democrat Joe Biden was the\u00a0first president\u00a0to mark Indigenous Peoples Day, issuing a\u00a0proclamation\u00a0in 2021 that celebrated \"the invaluable contributions and resilience of Indigenous peoples\" and recognize \"their inherent sovereignty.\"",
      "The proclamation noted that America \"was conceived on a promise of equality and opportunity for all people\" but that promise \"we have never fully lived up to. That is especially true when it comes to upholding the rights and dignity of the Indigenous people who were here long before colonization of the Americas began.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Sunday used a social media post to declare, \"I'm bringing Columbus Day back from the ashes.\" He said on his Truth Social site that \"the Democrats did everything possible to destroy Christopher Columbus, his reputation, and all of the Italians that love him so much.\"",
      "He said he is \"hereby reinstating Columbus Day under the same rules, dates, and locations, as it has had for all of the many decades before!\"",
      "The federal holiday, the second Monday in October, was still known as Columbus Day during Biden's term, but also as Indigenous Peoples Day. It remained a federal holiday and the former president didn't make any changes as to how or when Columbus Day is recognized in his proclamation, in which he directed\u00a0the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings \"in honor of our diverse history and the Indigenous peoples who contribute to shaping this Nation.\"",
      "Biden's recognition had been a longtime goal of activists who wanted to shift the focus from commemorating Columbus' navigation to the Americas to his and his successors' exploitation of the indigenous people he encountered there.",
      "Several years before Biden's proclamation, some states and local governments \u00a0\u2014 including\u00a0Columbus, Ohio,\u00a0Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Denver and Austin, Texas \u2014 had opted to recognize Indigenous Peoples Day over Columbus Day as a way of recognizing victims of colonialism. New York is among many places that acknowlodge both names of the federal holiday, with Gov. Kathy Hocul first recognizing Indigenous Peoples Day in 2021 while New York City continues to hold the largest Columbus Day parade in the country.",
      "Though Mr. Trump has long objected to telling the country's history through a lens of diversity and oppression, the holiday he seeks to restore to its primacy was added to the calendar as a nod to the country's growing diversity.",
      "Columbus' expeditions never touched the North American continent, let alone any land that is now part of the United States. But the native of Genoa became increasingly commemorated in the United States as Italian immigrants flocked to the country and politicians sought to win their support.",
      "Indeed, it was the lynching of 11 Italian-American immigrants in New Orleans in 1891 that led to the first Columbus Day celebration in the United States, led the following year by President Benjamin Harrison.\u00a0President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u00a0designated Columbus Day as a national holiday in 1934.",
      "Mr. Trump has long complained about Democrats tearing down statues of Columbus, a complaint he made again in Sunday's post. In 2017, he spoke out against a review of the 76-foot-tall statue of the explorer in New York's Columbus Circle that then-Mayor Bill de Blasio had ordered. It remains in place today, but other statues have been defaced or torn down.",
      "In 2020, the Trump administration paid to restore a Columbus statue in Baltimore that was dumped in the harbor during protests against the police murder of\u00a0George Floyd\u00a0in Minneapolis. Dozens of other Columbus statues across the country were taken down or in the process of being removed, and many of them were vandalized after the renewed Black Lives Matter protests began.",

      "The National Center for Victims of Crime, in Landover, Maryland, warned CBS News on Thursday that it planned to shutter its national crime victims hotline because of the cancellation of its Justice Department grant. The hotline receives approximately 16,000 calls from crime victims every year.

      "Renee Williams, the executive director of the National Center for Victims of Crime, said she's grateful the Justice Department restored her grant funding, but told CBS News \"our partners are still battling.\" Williams said the organization's crime victim hotline is a critical tool for those who suffer violence. Williams told CBS News, \"After calling us, countless victims indicated that they had nowhere else to turn, but found hope, help, and comfort from our services.\"",
      "Joe Griffin, executive of director of California-based Youth Alive! told CBS News the interruption of his group's federal grant would have a devastating impact on community initiatives.",

    "summary": "\"The fact is, Pete Hegseth was not qualified to take the job as Secretary of Defense, and he has shown that time and again,\" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said Sunday.",
    "story": [
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said Sunday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has \"created chaos\" at the Pentagon amid staffing shakeups\u00a0and recent reporting surrounding information about airstrikes in Yemen shared in Signal group chats.",
      "\"The fact is, Pete Hegseth was not qualified to take the job as Secretary of Defense, and he has shown that time and again,\" Shaheen said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Hegseth, a 44-year-old Army veteran and former Fox News host, faced scrutiny during the confirmation process early this year, becoming among President Trump's most embattled picks for top posts in his administration. The Senate ultimately approved his confirmation in a narrow vote. But in recent weeks, he's faced renewed scrutiny over the use of the encrypted messaging app Signal.",
      "Last week, reports circulated that Hegseth shared details about impending U.S. airstrikes in Yemen in a private Signal group, which included his wife, his brother and personal attorney. It was the second Signal group chat where Hegseth shared the information, after it was revealed last month a journalist was inadvertently included in a group chat where the timing and targets of the attack on Houthis in Yemen was shared.",
      "CBS News reported Friday that the Pentagon set up a system in Hegseth's office that enabled him to check messages on Signal while at the office. Two of the sources said the system bypasses standard Defense Department security protocols. A Defense Department spokesperson denied there is currently any use of Signal inside Hegseth's office.",
      "Meanwhile, a number of political appointees have resigned or been fired at the Pentagon in recent days, leaving Hegseth without some key staff.",
      "Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, argued that Hegseth has shown he isn't qualified for the role by sharing the information over Signal and by not having appropriate staff to support him, accusing him of creating \"chaos that is now embroiling our uniform military.\" She added that he has \"not taken responsibility for his actions.\"",
      "\"For those people who serve under him, he has shown that he is not the kind of role model, not the kind of leader that we need at this time,\" Shaheen said.",
      "In response to Shaheen's comments, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell instead pointed to the previous administration. Parnell cited \"Chaos at the Pentagon\" as evidenced by the Afghanistan withdrawal and \"a divisive DEl culture that destroyed service member morale.\" He also pointed to a \"weak leadership\" that he said led to Russia invading Ukraine, Hamas attacking Israel, and Houthi rebels shooting at U.S. ships, along with the \"the invasion of our U.S. southern border by transnational criminal gangs.\"",
      "\"During all this very real chaos, not a single person was fired or held accountable and Sen. Shaheen stayed silent,\" Parnell said. \"Secretary Hegseth is bringing accountability and warfighting back to the Pentagon. The American people care about results \u2014 so far SecDef gets an A+.\"",
      "In March, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, announced a bipartisan request for an expedited watchdog investigation into the Signal chat leak. Shaheen said it's \"important\" that the request was bipartisan, adding that she's hopeful \"they will come out soon with recommendations.\"",
      "The GOP-led Senate Armed Forces Committee advanced Hegseth's appointment in January, and Shaheen was joined by all fellow Democrats on the committee in voting against advancing him. Vice President JD Vance had to break the tie to confirm Hegseth, the first time in history a vice president broke the tie on a Defense Secretary.",
      "Hegseth pushed back on the criticism last week, telling reporters that \"a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out.\"",
      "\"We're changing the Defense Department, putting the Pentagon back in the hands of warfighters,\" Hegseth said. \"And anonymous smears from disgruntled former employees on old news doesn't matter.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to New Hampshire. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen. Senator President Trump repeated his threat Saturday to look at potential sanctions on Russia. Senator Lindsey Graham tweeted he's got nearly 60 co-sponsors for a sanctions bill. Yet in our interview, Minister Lavrov basically said their economy is self-sufficient and sanctions don't matter. Are they actually leverage at all?",
      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, I think we ought to take up the Graham legislation, and we ought to pass it through both houses and put those secondary sanctions on Russia. And the fact is I've been watching Minister Lavrov for 16 years since I've been in the Senate, and he is very adept at talking a lot and saying nothing. And in that interview, as we know, he refused to acknowledge Russia's aggression into Ukraine. He refused to acknowledge that it's Russia that's firing on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, not the Ukrainians. He refused to acknowledge the children from Ukraine who have been disappeared into Russia, kidnapped there he he does not. He's a an excellent prevaricator who never takes a position that is in opposition to what he believes is Russia's interest.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Fair summary there as to his abilities to evade direct answers, but he did directly answer on the sanctions bit, saying trying to brush off these threats. Given the vote count, do you think that you could actually get this to be veto proof? That you could force President Trump to put these sanctions on Russia and get congressional leadership to actually allow you to vote in the first place?",
      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well I do, and I think in fact, the administration has been working with Senator Graham, and certainly understands that this is legislation that is in the works and that there is some real benefit as Vladimir Putin continues to drag his feet, to do everything he can to play for more time, so that they're able to take more territory in Ukraine and to better advance Russia's position, this is something that can help slow them down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the oversight roles you have on some of the committees you serve on. At the State Department, Secretary of State Rubio announced a major reorganization this past week with plans to reduce staff by 15%, eventually. It will also condense certain bureaus or eliminate them. One of them is the Office of Global Women's Issues. And I know you have personally worked with many of these diplomats. Can Rubio just eliminate it with the stroke of a pen?",
      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, I noticed that one of the things in your polling that people were not happy about was the actions by the administration without oversight and advice and consent from Congress. And this is what this administration is talking about, what Secretary of State Rubio is talking about. They're talking about going in, making these changes without really consulting with Congress. The reason we have an Office of Global Women's Issues is because what we know about foreign policy is that those countries that have women who are empowered are more stable. We know that women give back more to their communities, to their countries, to their families, than men do. And there's a good reason why we have an Office of Global Women's Issues, because it helps us as we think about our foreign policy, and it's been one of the advantages that the United States has had over our adversaries like China and Russia and Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And had previously received support from the president's daughter Ivanka Trump, who I know you worked with during that first administration.",
      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: I worked very closely with Ivanka, and she was very supportive of the Office of Global Women's Issues.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll, watch what happens to it. I need to ask you about Armed Services Committee in which you also serve. A number of political appointees at the Pentagon have been fired or resigned in recent days, which means the Secretary of Defense currently has no chief of staff, no deputy chief of staff, and no senior advisor for policy. Does it concern you that he doesn't have this kind of architecture around him, and what is Congress doing in terms of oversight?",
      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: It concerns me greatly that he he has created chaos at the Pentagon. The fact is, Pete Hegseth was not qualified to take the job as Secretary of Defense, and he has shown that time and again. He showed it with his sharing classified information on a Signal chat with the recent sharing of information again with his wife, with his brother, with his lawyer, on a Signal chat inappropriate to take classified information and then share it in an unclassified source with people who do not have the credentials to hear that information. He has created chaos that is now embroiling uniform- our uniform military in the chaos that he's creating at the Pentagon without having the appropriate people to run things, and he's not taken responsibility for his actions. And for those people who serve under him, he has shown that he is not the kind of role model, not the kind of leader that we need at this time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, it's sensitive information the Pentagon is looking into through this inspector general inquiry, whether it was classified. Do you have any idea when you will get a clear answer?",
      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: I don't, and I think it's important that that's a bipartisan request to have that investigation done to see what was appropriate, and hopefully they will come out soon with recommendations. You know, one of the things the concerns that I raised with the Secretary of Defense was what the tariffs are doing to the supply chain for our Department of Defense, we know that the Ukraine war showed us that we have some real challenges with our defense industrial base. Those are being made worse by these tariffs. I was at a company in New Hampshire last week that does ball bearings for the aerospace industry. They told me that because of the tariffs on steel, that what used to take them 20 weeks to get steel. They're now having a two and a half year backlog that puts a real strain on our Department of Defense.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by President Trump's border czar, Tom Homan. Good morning to you, sir.",
      "TOM HOMAN: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We see in our polling some support for the President's policies, here. We know that overall border crossings are at the lowest monthly level we have seen, just over 7000 migrants came across in March and were apprehended, but given the fact that you're still waiting on Congress to give you funding, do you think that's going to handicap your ability to carry out these policies?",
      "TOM HOMAN: Well, look, I think we've been very successful, and we got we got the most secure border in the history of this nation, and President Trump was able to accomplish that in seven weeks. That's something that Joe Biden didn't- wouldn't do in four years. But yeah, the more money we have, the more we can do. The border's more secure it's ever been in the history of this nation. But we need more funding for interior operations- ICE operations, to arrest those public safety threats, national security threats and others from the United States. Again, the numbers about three times higher than they were during the Biden administration, as far as ICE arrests in the interior, but with more money we can do more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's talk about what's happening on the interior. On Friday, there were three American citizen children- born here, who were deported along with their mothers from Louisiana down to Honduras, and according to advocates, one of them is a four year old child with stage four cancer- a rare form of metastatic cancer, who was sent back to Honduras without getting to talk to a doctor and without medication. I understand this child's mother entered this country illegally, but isn't there some basis for compassionate consideration here that should have allowed for more consultation or treatment.",
      "TOM HOMAN: Well, it certainly is- discretion- I'm not aware of specific case, but no U.S. citizen child was deported. Deported means you got to be ordered reported by an immigration judge. We don't deport U.S. citizens--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The mother was deported along with the children.",
      "TOM HOMAN: These children were- children aren't deported. The mother chose to take the children with her when you enter the country legally, and you know you're here illegally, and you choose to have a U.S. citizen child that's on you. That's not on this administration. If you choose to put your family in that position, that's on them. But having a U.S. citizen child after you enter this country illegally. It's not a get out of jail free card. It doesn't make me- make you immune from our laws. If that's the message we sent the entire world, women are gonna keep putting themselves at risk and come to this country. We send a message. You can enter country illegally, which is a crime. That's okay. You can have due process, great taxpayer expense. Get ordered removed. That's okay. Don't leave. But have a U.S. citizen child and you're immune from removal? That's not the way it works.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't think there should be compassionate consideration for a four year old child undergoing treatment for cancer?",
      "TOM HOMAN: I didn't say that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well that was the question.",
      "TOM HOMAN: I said the ICE officers do have discretion. ICE officers do have discretion. I'm not familiar with the specific case. I don't know what facts around this case. I've just made aware of this when you- when you mentioned this morning. I was not aware of that case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, a federal judge who was appointed by President Trump, said a two year old American citizen child had been sent to Honduras with the mother who was deported. But the judge said, quote, there was no meaningful process. So again, this is another similar situation and dynamic. Shouldn't there be special care when these deportation cases involve small, American born children?",
      "TOM HOMAN: First of all, I disagree with the judge. It was due process. That female had due process at great taxpayer expense, and was ordered by an immigration judge after those hearings, so she had due process. Again, this is parenting 101. You can decide to take that child with you, or you can decide to leave a child here with a relative or another spouse. Having a U.S. citizen child doesn't make you immune from our laws of the country. American families get separated every day by law enforcement. Thousands of times a day, when a parent gets put in jail, the child can't go with them. These- if you're an illegal alien, come to this country and you decide to have your assistant child that's on you. You put yourself in that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when it came to this particular case- you just pointed out that that they could have made arrangements. The father tried, actually, to make arrangements as we understand it, through our reporting, but he and the mother, who were separated- since she was in detention after showing up for her appointment, was only allowed a very brief phone call. The father tried to petition to get the child handed over to an American citizen relative. So the mother had to make this decision and took the child with her. It just seems like there could be some more time frame here around due process allowed. That's what the judge is saying- is saying there should have been more of a process here.",
      "TOM HOMAN: There was due process, the two year baby- the two year old baby was left with the mother because the mother signed the document requesting her two year old baby go with her. That's the parents' decision. I don't- you know, I don't think the judge knows specifics of this case, two year old went with a mom. The mom signed the paper saying, I want my two year old to go with me. That's a- that's a parent's decision. It's not a government decision, it's a parent's decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The father wrote a note. Anyhow, we have to leave it there, director, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we saw the stock market rebound this week, and yet, you see in our polling data, you see in economic indicators that there is real concern about what is coming, even recession predictions. What are you seeing?",
      "COHN: So I think we need to take a step back here. We entered the year with just unbelievable euphoric excitement about what was going to happen. We also entered the year with the market sort of priced for perfection. I think now, as we roll forward to where we are today, we're sort of in a world where we're in a price for realistic uncertainty, and uncertainty is not good for growth. So we've gone from this excitement to unpredictability, and the unpredictability has to do with where are we on the economy. And I think a lot of your data showed there's still a little bit of confusion on the economy right now. What we have seen for the beginning of the last three months, in the early stages of the presidency, is we've seen the consumers starting to be a little bit concerned about tariffs. The concern about tariffs has driven them to preload or front-end buy a lot of the larger items that they were going to buy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Buy them now, because they might be cheaper than in a few months.",
      "COHN: We've seen automobile sales almost all-time record highs. So we see people buying automobiles because they're trying to avoid tariffs. They're buying consumer goods, they're buying washing machines, they're buying technology items. So we've seen the economy actually be in relatively good shape. So if you look at the actual data, what people would call hard data coming out of the economy right now, it looks pretty solid. If you look at the softer data, and the softer data is polling data, and you just showed some polling data, there's an awful lot of economic polling data. You start to see much more weakness in the polling data. So if you look at consumer confidence, consumer confidence is an indication of what I'm thinking I'm going to do going forward, you start to see a lot more weakness in consumer sentiment and in consumer data. And I think that's starting to play through the economy. This week, we started to see a lot of the major companies in America report earnings for the first quarter.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "COHN: Now, remember that's backwards looking, the first quarter, but companies also have a view of what's going on in the second quarter. So you started to see some of the major consumer-facing brands say, look, our first quarter was pretty good, but we're starting to see signs the second quarter is not going to be as good as we hoped. We saw it in fast food restaurants like Chipotle. We saw it in snack foods for Pepsi Cola. We saw it in the airlines. The airlines have talked about how difficult their restaurants are, and we've also seen it in the very high-end product. We saw it in LVMH is warning about sales slowing down. So we're in this part of the economy where there's this lack of predictability, there's uncertainty and the consumers acting that way by sort of withdrawing from the market and only buying the essentials and the necessity products or products they think they can buy today because they may be more expensive tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or perhaps not on shelves tomorrow. That's something that we heard some of these retail CEOs privately told the White House in meetings this week. And our Richard Escobedo reports that in a separate meeting, the Treasury Secretary told investors the booking of container ships that carry goods between China and the U.S., it's down more than 60%.",
      "COHN: Well, we're seeing the data. We're seeing the data coming out of China, and --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That means if people even want to buy it, it won't be there.",
      "COHN: So what people need to understand is the cycle from a good being sold in China, loaded on a vessel, sailed across the ocean, unloaded in the United States, put in a factory, distributed to a shelf, is about eight weeks in the United States. So if you go back to the April 2nd date when the tariffs kicked in, you're talking about seeing the effect really May 2nd. So I would say the last couple weeks of, of, of, of May you'll start, you'll start seeing this effect here. So you know we're a few weeks away from starting to see the early effects of what will happen in the transportation of goods. You're also starting to see many of the small businesses, and this is where it's really interesting, you know, small businesses who have to order goods, and you saw a lot of data out of the toy industry recently, the toy industry, which is really small industry runs the vast majority of retail toy sales. You know, people are ordering their toys for Christmas today, have to order those toys. Those toys are now coming with a massive 145% tariff. The vast majority of small business toy stores cannot order toys today because they cannot afford the 145% tariff. So they're making a conscientious decision. They're either going out of business or they're just going to wait and see what happens. So you're right, the lag effect of getting goods this country will not be felt for another two to four weeks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And there are no active trade negotiations underway, according to the Treasury Secretary. There may be contact between the U.S. and China, but that's not going to be a quick fix.",
      "COHN: That said, the Treasury Secretary did acknowledge this week that the relationship between China and the United States is unsustainable. And I think we have to acknowledge that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He, he said the trade war, right?",
      "COHN: He said, he did say --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He pumped the brakes on that.",
      "COHN: He did. He did. But at the end of the day, the trading issue really has started, for better, to coalesce around the China issue. I think we're all starting to realize that the country we're most dependent upon in the United States and for our shelves and what we would miss the most would be what comes out of China.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We knew that. You knew that.",
      "COHN: We've always known that. We've always known that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You told President Trump that during the first term.",
      "COHN: We've known it. But the fact that the Treasury Secretary is acknowledging that we are in an unsustainable situation, and we have to start negotiating with the, with the Chinese is very important.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They also have to say we're ready to talk, and they haven't yet. In fact, the Chinese seem to be really holding the line on this so far. But I also want to ask you about what President Trump has said because when you're talking about what's coming down the line, he's indicated that it could be up to the Fed, the Federal Reserve, to cut interest rates to sort of make up for what happened. He did pull back on his threat to fire the Fed chair. Do you think there is an interest rate cut that's necessary?",
      "COHN: So I think the Fed is doing exactly what they were empowered to do. The Fed is an independent agency with a dual mandate. And their dual mandate, very simply stated, is full employment on one side, and stable prices. And their definition of stable prices is an inflation rate at or around 2%.They are in a position right now where they're basically at full employment, inflation at about 2.4%. So they're basically saying we have done our job right now. So there is, in essence, really no reason for us to take action at this moment. And on top of that, we have this unpredictable economy. We have this potential instability. We know that the Customs Border Patrol is starting to collect more and more tariff money every day. We know that those costs have to feed through the economic system. We predict that that will be inflationary, even if it's just a one time price shock.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "COHN: So there are those that say, look, it is a one time price shock, it's not inflationary. But the one time you move prices up, if you're not moving wages up commensurate with the one time price move, every American is losing purchasing power. So if you have a fixed price wage, but the cost of goods goes up once, you can purchase less.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on that point, the President also says you may pay more here, right, but I got you on the tax cuts. In fact, he tweeted when tariffs cut in, just this morning he said this, many people's income taxes will be reduced or eliminated, and he's going to focus on those making less than $200,000 a year. This is not going to get done by Memorial Day, is it?",
      "COHN: Look, I don't, I don't know. That would be very fast for it to get done. The other thing we need to understand about tariffs, and I think this is obvious, is tariffs are highly regressive. Meaning that poorer people end up paying a disproportionate percentage of the tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "COHN: Because they spend 100% of their paychecks on goods. So they're going to Walmart, they're going to their stores. They're buying goods with their paycheck. Wealthier people send it, save a bigger percentage of their paycheck. So the tariffs are going to affect the poorer people more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We got to leave it there, Gary. We're going to watch this though.",
      "COHN: Okay.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, a portion of which aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov. Good morning, Minister Lavrov, I want to ask you about what happened in Kyiv. There was a large Russian attack on that capital city about one o'clock in the morning. President Trump has said publicly, the Russian strikes are not necessary and very bad timing. \"Vladimir, STOP!\" was his quote. What made it worth killing civilians when Ukraine says it's ready for a ceasefire?",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV: We only target military goals or civilian sites used by the military. President Putin expressed this for so many times, and this is not different this time as well. We never consciously target civilian sites unlike- unlike the Zelensky regime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So was this an intentional attack, then? Not a mistake?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: If this was a target used by the Ukrainian military, the Minister of Defense, the commanders in the field have the right to attack them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So just to be clear, when the President of the United States says, \"Vladimir, STOP!\" Is this a rejection of that request? Was the assessment that, because of what you say regarding the concerns that this loss of civilian life made it worth it?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Well, I can assure you that the target attacked was not something absolutely civilian like TV center in Belgrade in 1999- this was an intentional attack against civilian target. In our case, we only target those sites which are used by the military. And regarding the ceasefire and the regarding the call to stop, President Putin immediately supported President Trump's proposal few weeks ago to establish a 30 day ceasefire provided- provided we do not repeat mistakes of the last 10 years, when deals were signed and then Ukraine would violate those deals with the support and with encouragement from Biden administration and from European countries. This was the fate of the deal of February 2014 then the- this was the fate of the Minsk agreements, and this was the fate of the deal reached on the basis of Ukrainian proposals in Istanbul in April 2022. So President Putin said, ceasefire, yes, but we want the guarantees that the ceasefire would not be used again to beef up Ukrainian military and that the support of arms should stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ukraine accepted on March 11, that idea of a U.S. brokered ceasefire without preconditions. You're saying the preconditions are a negotiation to end something else?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: No, it is not a precondition. It is the lessons learned after at least three times the deal's similar to the one which we are discussing now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Russia has not accepted that call for a ceasefire--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: --But Ukrainian regime has a strong support from European capitals and Biden administration. If- if you want a ceasefire, just to continue supply arms to Ukraine, so what is your purpose? You know what- what Kaja Kallas and- what's his name- Mark Rutte said about the- the ceasefire--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The NATO Secretary General and the European Union--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: They bluntly stated that they can support only the deal which, at the end of the day, will make Ukraine stronger, would make Ukraine a victor. So if this is the purpose of the ceasefire, I don't think this is what President Trump wants. This is what Europeans, together with Zelenskyy, want to make out of President Trump's initiative.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will Russia continue targeting Kyiv despite President Trump saying, \"Vladimir, STOP!\"",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: You're not listening to me. We will continue to target the sites used by the military of Ukraine, by some mercenaries from foreign countries and by instructors whom the Europeans officially sent to help target Russian civilian sites. If you- if you take a look at the- at the situation in the Kursk region of Russia, for example, there is no single military target for the last six months which the Ukrainians would- would- would fire at. And there was also a proposal by President Trump immediately support President Putin to have a one month moratorium on that text on energy infrastructure--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right that's expired.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: We never violated this- this commitment of President Putin. And Ukrainians violated what Zelensky seemed to support several hundred times and I sent to Marco Rubio and to the United Nations the list of those attacks. It's really very- very telling and eloquent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And Ukraine disputes that. But putting that aside, I want to ask you about what President Trump said on Wednesday. The President of the United States says he thinks the U.S. and Russia have a deal, let's get it done. Does President Putin agree?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Well, the President of the United States believes, and I think rightly so, that we are moving in the right direction. The statement by the president mentions a deal, and we are ready to reach a deal, but there are still some specific points- elements of this deal which need to be fine tuned. And we are busy with this exact process, and the President of the United States did not spell out the elements of the deal, so it is not appropriate for me to do this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he did say there was a deal, and that he was sending his envoy, Steve Witkoff, to meet with Vladimir Putin Friday in Russia. Is that meeting still happening? And should we expect a deal this week?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Well, you don't trust the word of the President of the United States?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I was asking your president's word. What will he tell the U.S. envoy?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: We- we continue our contacts with the American side on the situation in Ukraine, there are several signs that we are moving in the right direction. First of all, because President Trump is probably the only leader on Earth who recognized the need to address the root causes of this situation, when he said- said that it was a huge mistake to pull Ukraine into NATO, and this was a mistake by Biden administration, and he wants to rectify this. And--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Ukraine is not part of NATO--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: -- Marco Rubio expressed yesterday, I think, also the assessment that they had the American team now is getting a better understanding of the Russian position and of the root causes of this situation. One of this root causes, apart from NATO and creation of direct military threats to Russia just on our borders, another one is the rights of the national minorities in Ukraine. Everything Russian- media, education, culture, anything was prohibited by a law in Ukraine. And to get out of this, of this crisis, you cannot just forget about human rights. When- whenever we discuss--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- It's not illegal to speak Russian--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: -- Iran- North Korea, anything American negotiators put on top human rights. They have claims in this regard to China, to us, to anybody. But whenever Europeans and other Western nations speak about Ukraine, nobody can mumble the words human rights. Just nobody. On the contrary, what- what Ursula von der Leyen and other people, Brussels and in Europe say that- that Ukraine is defending the European values. So one of these values is canceling the Russian language. Imagine, if--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --It is not illegal, Minister Lavrov, to speak Russian. The President of Ukraine speaks Russian--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: -- If Israel cancel Arabic language in- in Palestine. Just imagine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. You mentioned that the US and Russia need to work on some of these fine points of a deal have you--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: -- Yeah, do you want this to be spelled out?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, of course, I'd love that. But my question was--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: This is not the way we--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --European sources say that the US proposal is really just kind of a list of bullet points. Does Russia have details, the details you need at this point in terms of a formal proposal?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: We are really polite people, and unlike some others, we never discuss in public what is being discussed in negotiations. Otherwise, negotiations are not serious. To ask for somebody's opinion regarding the substance, go to Zelensky. He is happy to talk to anybody through media, even to President Trump. He presents his- his claims. We are--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Well, he said he hasn't received a formal proposal, so I was wondering if you had--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: -- We are- we are serious people and we consider serious proposals. We make serious proposals, and this is a process which is not supposed to be public until the end of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so no deal is imminent?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: I didn't say this. Now- now I understand, by the way, why you wanted to get the brief answers to your questions. You want some slogans to be- to be-",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- No, the president of the United States said there was a deal with Russia. So I wanted to ask Russia if there is a deal with the United States. So, I just want to be clear.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: So, we made our comments on this statement. The- the negotiations continue, and until the end of the negotiations. We cannot disclose what it is about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. The National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said last month that President Trump is asking for thousands of Ukrainian children who were taken into Russia to be released now as part of what he called confidence building measures. What steps has Russia taken to meet Mr. Trump's request?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Look, long before the request coming from Washington, we have been addressing the issue of the fate of the kids who during the conflict found themselves outside the- their homes, outside their families. Most of these kids were attending- were attending- what you call it, the place where people without parents--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Orphanage.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Orphanage. Orphanage. And as soon as and we announce whatever- whatever details we have about those kids, and as soon as relevance- I mean, the parents or other relevant- relatives make themselves available. They are getting the kids back. This has been the process for the last almost three years between the ombudsman of Russia and Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there's no new release of thousands of Ukrainian children at the request of President Trump?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: No, there was the- nobody- nobody knows why- why some experts advise the President about thousands of Ukrainian children. Every now and then, once in two- three months, we organize exchanges with Ukrainians with the help of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, who do not, you know, make any noise about what they're doing. They just do something which we are participating in- in very constructive manner. Bringing kids back to the parents or relatives.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what confidence building measure can Russia offer now, particularly after this strike in Kyiv, where the President of the United States is saying, \"Vladimir, STOP!\" How do you convince the United States that Russia is actually serious about peace?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Well, confidence building measures have been plentiful in the last 10 years. I mentioned--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The strike was overnight.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: You want a brief answer, right? As I- as I understand from your initial words, or you want an answer which is explaining the situation. The proposal by President Trump on a 30 days moratorium on the strikes against the energy infrastructure was supported by President Putin and observed strictly. This was a confidence building measure against the policy and action taken by Zelenskyy regime. As I said several hundred times, civilian energy infrastructure was trapped. Another confidence building measure was the proposal of President Trump and his team to resume the deal on Black Sea and the delegations met in Istanbul, in Riyadh, the delegations exchanged the views how this can be implemented in practical terms, and the proposals made by Russia are being considered by the United States. There are many other examples about confidence building measure. But if- if you believe that it's only Ukraine who is interested in confidence building, I think a short answer would be, this is an illusion.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you take President Trump at his word when he says, if Russia is unable to make a deal on ending the bloodshed in Ukraine he'll put secondary tariffs, I think he means sanctions there, on oil coming out of Russia. Or do you think that at this point, the relationship between Russia and America has been rebuilt and that won't happen?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Well, I cannot comment on what you think President Trump meant when he said something.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think he meant when he said secondary tariffs on oil coming out of Russia?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Well, we hear many things coming from President Trump. President Trump said that he's sick and tired of the situation in this settlement, especially yesterday when he commented the statements by Zelenskyy. And President Trump has his own proposals and has his own style in mentioning those proposals in his public speeches. We concentrate, as I said, on the real negotiations which President Trump supports and instructed his people to continue to engage in these negotiations. I'm sorry the answer was a bit longish, but it's difficult to explain otherwise.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I ask about the threat of sanctions, or secondary tariffs, because you recently said in an interview, if you had to personally pick sides, you would keep the existing sanctions in place on Russia. You said you've restructured the economy to be self-sufficient, and there is a growing fear that, quote, \"cunning Americans will lift sanctions all of a sudden to flood our market with services and technologies.\" So if that's the case, why should the United States consider lifting sanctions at all?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 Why do you ask me? You just quoted my statement, and this statement is clear for me and clear to all those who read it. If you have questions to the American side, how they treat the situation. It is not, it is not the right address to raise it with me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you want to keep sanctions in place. Is that really the Russian position?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: I don't want to re-explain what I explained, I think, in quite- in quite clear manner. And you quoted, I think--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I quoted--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: --very close to the real content. Yeah. It was a bit longer than normally you prefer. I know, I know.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, back in February, though, one of your colleagues Kirill Dmitriev, who runs the sovereign wealth fund and has been active in the diplomacy with the United States, said something a bit different. That's why I'm asking for clarification. Because he said there is the expectation that American companies would return to the Russian market in the second half of 2025.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Well, the President of Russia commented upon this situation. He said that we have nothing against American company, but those companies who decided to leave their business in Russia might find that their place has been occupied already by Russian or other foreign investors, and in this case, we would not make any decisions which would discriminate those who came to invest in Russia instead of Americans. If American companies would like to come to a place which is not yet occupied, if they want to- to propose a project, a new project, on top of the previous business ties, of course, we will look into this. And if we found- if we find balance of our interests, I think it would be only natural to get into business together.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what areas has the U.S. offered to lift sanctions on, because it wouldn't be possible for an American, many American companies, to enter the Russian market right now, under the existing sanctions.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: It is up to them to decide.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So no offer has been made?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: No, how can we offer something?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States to Russia?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Well, the United States clearly tells us that they are interested in doing business together. We never reject business proposals, provided they are based on the equal opportunities and the treatment of each other and lead to a balance of interest. Specific proposals which are being mentioned in the media, I cannot comment upon. This is not serious. We are not- people- we are not acting like the people in Kyiv who talk to the world through the media, including talking to Presidents of great countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So if I understand you correctly, you neither fear sanctions nor want them lifted.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Look, you quoted my statement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: And you quoted it right. That's my- that's my position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so when President Trump threatens new sanctions, that's not of concern?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: You're asking this for the third time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, just trying to get--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: This was a brief answer. This was a brief answer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are being brief and direct on that part. I was asking on the sanctions for clarity and directness. Broadly speaking, when you look at what's happening in the battle space in Ukraine right now, analysts say about 18% of Ukrainian territory is under the control of Russian forces. U.S. intelligence says battlefield trends are in Russia's favor. So if that's the case, why should the U.S. believe Russia is serious about ending the war if everything is in your favor?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Well, we judge by the reaction of our American colleagues to what we tell them, and this is being done during negotiations. They're confidential as any serious negotiation, and they know our position. And they, as- as I quoted Marco Rubio, he publicly said that they- now, they better understand the Russian position and the reasons for what is going on. And he said that nobody in Washington lifted a finger to do the same, to understand- to try to understand Russia during the Biden administration, and- and this- this implies that the dialogue continues, that the dialogue is supported by the United States, and I reiterate that it is supported by- by the Russian Federation, and this dialogue continues.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So President Trump said he expects to meet soon with Vladimir Putin. What's an acceptable time and location? Why should they meet?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Look, the presidents are masters of their own destiny and of their own schedule. I heard President Trump say that he is planning to be somewhere mid-May, and that after that, he would be suggesting some days. I cannot add anything else.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. He said- he was asked about meeting with Vladimir Putin, specifically in Saudi Arabia, and he said, most likely not, that's in mid-May, but shortly thereafter.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: You said the same thing as I.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, what are you planning?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: So we read the same newspapers and watch the same channels on TV.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but I can't pick up the phone and call Marco Rubio the Secretary of State, like you can. What plans are you making for the two to meet?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Look, I hope your listeners understand very well that it is not ethical for a foreign minister to prejudge, to presume what presidents might or might not discuss.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you think it would be good for the two leaders to meet soon? Do you expect that that's what Envoy Witkoff is negotiating?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: We're always- we're always in favor of meeting with people who are ready for a dialogue. President Putin repeated this thousands of times, and when we met- when we met in Riyadh together with President Putin's foreign policy adviser Ushakov, with Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz, the American colleagues clearly stated that the U.S. policy is based firmly on U.S. national interests. They understand that the Russian policy, led by President Putin, is also based on Russian national interest, and that it is the responsibility of great powers to make sure that whenever those national interests do not coincide, and this is in most of the cases, this difference should not be allowed to degenerate into confrontation, and that's what dialogue is for. But, they also added that when the national interest of two countries- more countries coincide, it would be stupid to miss an opportunity to translate this coincidence into some material, mutually beneficial projects. And this is absolutely our position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know that President Trump is coming up on 100 days in office, and he has made clear his patience is wearing thin with the diplomacy here. Do you expect the U.S. and Russia to continue to talk after these potential peace talks fall apart? I mean, is the rebuilding of the relationship so significant now that you think it could withstand the peace talks--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Russia--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --in Ukraine falling apart.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 First, Russia is always available for a dialogue, so you have to address your question to the American side. Second, you prejudge the current process by saying that eventual collapse of the talks. We concentrate on doing business, not on thinking, you know, failures or victories about anything. Unless you concentrate on the facts, that's what we do, you cannot be serious about what you are doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, President Trump and Secretary Rubio said that the window was closing, that time is running out here. That's not my opinion, that's what they said. I want to ask you a little- Go ahead, sorry.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 Wait a second, I just quoted Marco Rubio, who yesterday said about better understanding of the Russian position, so maybe, maybe you missed that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, he also said a decision in days needed to be made, and that the U.S. has other things to focus on.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: \u00a0We understand, we understand the impatience, because in- in American culture, you create expectations, and you ignite tension around those expectations. This does not help to do realpolitik. But in our case, as I said, we are always ready for dialogue, ready for negotiations, and we would not, you know, begin by banking on a failure. This would be a characteristic of bad deal makers, inexperienced deal makers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Others in the Russian government have proposed that the U.S. and Russia could work together in the Arctic. Are there specific areas of discussion for cooperating right now?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 You always want me to disclose things--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is a public statement.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: --things- things which might be, might be discussed by respective officials of Russia and the United States, by those who are responsible for trade, economic cooperation, investments and so on and so forth. How do you expect a participant of negotiations which are still to reach some kind of specific understanding to disclose details in public. It is not serious.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I'm just- I'm asking what you think the potential is.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: I read- I read- I read President Trump's book, the art to make a deal, and he does not advise to disclose information before- before it's time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Respectfully, President Trump speaks quite a lot about the things he would like to do with Russia and opportunities to work together. I understand you don't want to. On the specific things President Trump has said in public \u2013 one of the things he brought up is that the U.S. could work with Ukraine to operate the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, which is in an area you know, Zaporizhzhia. Russians control it, that area right now. Do you agree with President Trump's public statements that the best security would be for the U.S. and Ukraine to operate that together?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: \u00a0No, we- we never received such an offer and if we do, we will explain that the power station, Zapor- Zaporizhzhia power nuclear power station is run by the Russian Federation state corporation called Rosatom. It is being under monitoring of the IAEA personnel permanently located on the site. And if not for the Ukrainian regular attempts to attack the station and to create a nuclear disaster for Europe and for Ukraine as well, the safety requirements are fully implemented and it is in very good hands.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So that's a no?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 No, I don't think- I don't think any change is conceivable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Okay, because that was in a public statement from the White House to the media.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 We- we, as I said, we did not receive any proposal which would be specific. So, you know, I understand that journalists have to speculate. We cannot speculate on something which is really not being- not being mentioned during the negotiations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Zaporizhzhia is not being negotiated right now?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 Shall I said it for the third time?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, I'm trying to reconcile public statements, but- I heard you, but I just want to be abundantly clear, because that is also widely reported to be in the U.S. proposal currently on the table.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 Why don't you ask me about President Trump's position on Crimea?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You liked what President Trump said about Crimea yesterday, when he said that it had been under Russian control since 2014?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 It's not about- It's not about liking or disliking. It's about the fact that he said the truth and when--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So he said something specific you liked?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 And when Zelensky said that this is absolutely excluded, because Crimea is part of Ukraine according to the constitution. Nobody in in Europe or in- in the States, by the way, reminded him that, apart from territorial issues, the Ukrainian constitution guarantees, I quote, the free development, the use and protection of the Russian and other national minorities language in Ukraine, and they guarantee the development of ethnic cultural, language and religious identity of all peoples and national minorities in Ukraine. This is also in the constitution, but as I mentioned already, and you decided not to- not to go deeper into this topic, nobody in the west even mentions human rights when they demand that Ukraine defeat Russia in the battlefield.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 President Trump said Crimea is not even being discussed right now.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Yes, because this is a done deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You mean Russia occupies and controls and will not negotiate the future of Crimea? Is that what you're saying?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 Russia- Russia do not negotiate its own territory.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So that's one, one specific thing that you do want in the public space. You said everything else that I've asked you about in the US proposal is too sensitive to discuss. Is there any other part of the U.S. proposal that you do like?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 No, no, no. I only commented what was- what was said publicly, and I also said that normal negotiators, I emphasize this once again, normal negotiate- negotiators do not negotiate by through a microphone. They meet and they discuss, they listen to each other, they try to understand, they try to see where of interest can be reached, and this is how our contacts with the American representatives are organized.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Respectfully, you've been in the top levels of Russian diplomacy for 30 years.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: For how many?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For at least 30 years. I mean, you've been in very key diplomatic roles within the top of the Russian diplomatic system for a very, very long time. I don't think any part of this is- is typical or normal to use the word you used. Steve Witkoff is the envoy. Kirill Dmitriev",
      "is Vladimir Putin's envoy here. Do you think it's unfortunate that the international system of diplomacy isn't being used more, and that it's this kind of one on one personal envoy structure?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 You did not express your disappointment that the international system of diplomacy was not used for the entire duration of the Biden administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 No, I was asking your- whether you were disappointed--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 You did not- you did not mention that Europeans are really very nervous that they're being marginalized. But I can quote a lot of what Europeans stated. I mentioned already Kaja Kallas and also Von der Leyen, who said any deal must make sure that Ukraine is stronger and that Ukraine is on top of Russia. Look, do you need negotiators who believe in this kind of logic and who don't want to look for honest balance of interest? The bi- the Trump administration is interested in searching for a balance of interest. They sincerely want to understand better the Russian position, and they're getting this understanding, and we understand better the American position through negotiations and meetings and discussions which we take- which we have with them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Back in January, Russia signed a deal with Iran to become a strategic partner. Would Russia be willing to sever that relationship at the request of the U.S. if it meant better relations with America?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: There was never any request like this, and we welcome the process which was initiated between the United States and Iran. We are ready to be helpful if the parties believe this can be the case, and they know this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You were the negotiator back in 2015 on behalf of Russia for that landmark international agreement, the JCPOA. And part of how Russia was helpful was destroying Iran's enriched nuclear material. Is that an offer you would do again?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 We were not involved in destroying Iran's nuclear material--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Disposing--",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: The part of- the part of the deal was to move some amount of this material to Russia for keeping.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Okay, so not destroying, but keeping. Would you keep Iran's enriched nuclear material that they've made in the past few years? Is that an offer to the U.S.?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: We are not putting our nose in the negotiations between two countries, one of which is not Russia. And I said very clearly, I believe, but you wanted a brief answer, I will have to be longer, since it is not probably getting through. We welcome the dialogue between the US and Iran. We would be certainly ready to help, if both parties believe this is going to be useful, and they know that we are ready.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, back then, there were sanctions and pressure at the UN. It's a very different dynamic now. I want to ask you quickly about nuclear weapons, because Russia is such a nuclear powerhouse. According to U.S. intelligence, Russia is developing a new satellite meant to carry a nuclear weapon which would knock out other satellites and devastate the U.S., if it's used. That's in publicly published material. Does Russia intend to violate past treaties and actually put a nuclear weapon in space?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Well before asking this question, you have to check whether this is true or not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is what U.S. intelligence says.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: U.S. intelligence. I was listening to President Trump about his views of what is the list of achievements of U.S. intelligence, and I have my own facts on which I- I rely. We have been promoting for many years in the United Nations a resolution prohibiting put- putting any nuclear weapons into outer space. The country which is categorically against it is the United States. At the same time, the United States promotes an approach, according to which they want to prohibit putting- putting conventional weapons in outer space. And they cannot answer the question, \"Does this mean that nuclear weapons, they would be planning to move to the orbit?\" So my answer is very clear: we have been championing in the United Nations a legal prohibition of placing any nuclear weapons in outer space. And the United States, at least during the Biden administration this was the case, they were categorically against it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 It was the Trump administration's intelligence community that published those findings just a few weeks ago. Are you saying the Trump administration's intelligence community findings are incorrect in regard to Russia developing a new satellite meant to carry a nuclear weapon?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 We- we denied those allegations. We, once again, cannot help repeating, have been promoting for years in the United Nations a treaty, not a declaration, a treaty prohibiting placing weapons in outer space. And the United States is against. I cannot comment about the validity of the intelligence reports. As I told you, we never received any facts which would confirm the allegations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Do you have any interest in arms control talks with the United States, with the Trump administration?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 It was- it was the United States which broke the proc- the process of strengthening strategic stability. And as- if the United States is willing to get back to this track, we will see what are- what are the conditions under which this might be possible. As long as in the U.S. doctrinal document- doctrinal documents, we are described as \"adversary,\" when the officials in Washington called, some time ago, called us \"enemy.\" So we want to understand what Washington thinks of our relationship and whether Washington is ready for,I would emphasize once again, an equal, mutually respectful dialogue heading to finding a balance of interest. If this is the approach, everything is possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Minister, we are- we are coming up on time. But just, before I let you go, from everything you laid out, I haven't heard from you that Russia is willing to make any concession on anything to date.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 No, my brief answer is you are wrong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 What concessions has Russia offered?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 Wait a second. Wait a second, please. I have been emphasizing repeatedly, in relation to Ukraine, in relation to strategic relations with the United States, I have been emphasizing our readiness to seek balance of interests. If- if this is not what your station considers readiness for negotiations, then I don't know how to be even less eloquent in trying to be brief in my answers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, there have been very clear, specific things said by the Trump administration, such as the vice president saying that the current lines of contact in Ukraine would freeze and end up fairly close to where troops are right now. Do you actually consider that a concession?",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 I don't discuss publicly the details of what is being subject of negotiations. I understand that you love rumors, because rumors--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 The vice president of the United States said it on camera.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV: Was it a question?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Oh, well, rumor- rumor. You said it was a rumor. The vice president said it. Perhaps you missed it.",
      "MINISTER LAVROV:\u00a0 No, I said about us, we are not discussing things which are subject to negotiations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Okay. Minister Lavrov, thank you for your time this morning.",

    "summary": "A large brood of periodical cicadas is due to emerge in the spring of 2025. These maps show where people should expect to see and hear the bugs this year.",
    "story": [
      "Cicadas are poised to return at some point in the spring of 2025, potentially bringing billions of bugs to neighborhoods across the eastern United States.",
      "The group of cicadas set to appear has been labeled Brood XIV. Emerging once every 17 years, Brood XIV is the second-largest group of periodical cicadas \u2014 which rise from underground en masse \u2014 and will be the only group this spring. That means\u00a0there will likely be fewer cicadas\u00a0above ground than there were in 2024, when\u00a0multiple broods of cicadas\u00a0emerged at the same time.",
      "Where will cicadas emerge in spring 2025?",
      "Cicadas this year will likely be concentrated in Kentucky and much of Tennessee. The insects from Brood XIV are also expected to show up in parts of Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, in addition to smaller pockets farther north in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, central Pennsylvania and Long Island, New York.",
      "CBS News' data team created an interactive map that shows where cicadas are expected to be this year. The map uses information from the University of Connecticut's Cicada Project, which plots the brood's spread based on its known locations in the past.",
      "When will cicadas emerge in spring 2025?",
      "The huge groups of cicadas emerge when the soil reaches about 64 degrees Fahrenheit, according to University of Connecticut researchers. In warmer states, cicadas usually come out in late April or May. In cooler states, their arrival tends to occur in May or early June.",
      "How long will cicadas be above ground?",
      "Researchers say cicadas typically remain in a given area for 4 to 6 weeks after they first emerge. Most individual cicadas live for just a few weeks, but, since the emergence itself happens over two weeks, their eventual fading will also be staggered.",
      "What are cicadas?",
      "Cicadas are a type of insect, related to stink bugs, bed buds and aphids. The ones expected to arrive in droves this year are a variety called periodical cicadas, which appear in huge swarms and often create loud buzzing sounds, according to the National Wildlife Federation. Annual cicadas exist as well.",
      "Periodical cicadas have earned a reputation across eastern North America because of their conspicuous recurrence. Individual \"broods\" are biologically synchronized to crop up simultaneously in 13- or 17-year intervals, when they rise from their burrows underground in populations that can reach up to the trillions. Between intervals, they live in soil as larvae and feed on fluids from plant roots, the wildlife federation explains.",
      "There are three species of cicadas that emerge every 17 years, and four species that materialize every 13 years, according to researchers at the University of Connecticut. When cicadas share the same emergence year, they're considered part of a brood.",

      "Active periodical cicada broods in the U.S.",
      "Select a brood:",
      "Why do cicadas make noise?",
      "The noise people often hear from cicadas is a mating tactic, according to the wildlife foundation, which notes that male cicadas tend to crowd together and produce raucous choruses in efforts to attract females. Once the mating process has ended, female cicadas deposit their eggs in tree branches. When they hatch, the larvae fall to the ground, burrow into the soil, and the cycle starts again.",

    "story": [
      "A massive brood of periodical cicadas will emerge soon across the eastern United States, with the notoriously raucous springtime insects due for their 2025 appearance.",
      "Known for their buzzing hordes and ability to rapidly infiltrate the environments where they show up, cicadas are expected to swarm parts of Kentucky and Tennessee\u00a0this year, while arriving in smaller quantities in various places along the East Coast, from Massachusetts and New York down to western Georgia.",
      "Here's what to know about the infamous creatures.",
      "What are periodical cicadas?",
      "Periodical cicadas are moderately sized bugs with red eyes and translucent wings, usually measuring about an inch long with a wider wingspan. They are sometimes mistakenly associated with locusts, like grasshoppers, but cicadas are actually an entirely different sort of insect, part of the same family as stink bugs and bedbugs.",
      "The synchronized behavior of periodical cicadas is their most defining characteristic. Compared with annual cicadas, which appear in generally modest amounts each summer, periodical cicadas emerge in the spring and essentially rise from the ground in unison, in either 13-year or 17-year intervals. Cicadas that emerge on the same schedule are called a brood, and each is labeled using Roman numerals.",
      "This year, the group belongs to Brood XIV, the second-largest brood of periodical cicadas known to scientists, according to the University of Connecticut. Researchers with the university's Cicada Project note that, while they cannot technically know with certainty where a particular brood is going to emerge next, its last known locations during previous emergence events usually provide valuable insights. Because periodical cicadas typically lay their eggs in or near the areas where they've just emerged, the next generation of broods tend to emerge themselves in similar places.",
      "Cicada map predicts where they will emerge in 2025",
      "Based on University of Connecticut research, CBS News' data team created an interactive map that charts the expected spread of Brood XIV, which last arose 17 years ago and is the only brood emerging in 2025.",
      "The map shows the cicadas primarily concentrated in Kentucky and Tennessee, in addition to parts of Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. Farther north, the brood is also expected to take shape in smaller pockets, in Cape Cod, Massachusetts; Long Island, New York; and central Pennsylvania.",
      "When will Brood XIV emerge?",
      "The brood will emerge before the end of spring on June 21, but cicadas' arrivals in different parts of the U.S. will likely vary.",
      "Cicada expert Matthew Kasson told CBS News in 2024 that\u00a0the exact timing of a brood's emergence\u00a0is linked to the temperature of the soil they're in before moving above ground. Kasson said cicadas are prompted to exit the soil when it reaches 64 degrees, so groups within the larger brood may travel to the surface sooner than others in cooler locations.",
      "What do cicadas do?",
      "The life cycles of periodical cicadas are closely tied to how and where they emerge. Before a brood materializes on land, each of its members \u2014 sometimes trillions of them \u2014 exist underground as larvae, subsiding on fluids from plant roots, according to the National Wildlife Federation. They live in those conditions for 13 or 17 years, depending on their brood. Then, almost all at once, the insects burrow upward and break through the surface of the soil, often making their presence known by erupting in loud and at times constant choruses.",
      "Conspicuous noises from cicada swarms are a mating tactic, the wildlife federation writes, as the male insects gather in groups and create loud sounds to attract females. The mating process begins within a few days of cicadas emerging. When it ends, the females cut shallow grooves into tree branches and lay their eggs inside. Researchers at Arizona State University say\u00a0those eggs usually hatch\u00a0within 8 weeks, and newly born cicadas fall from the branches down to the ground. Called nymphs at that point, the young bugs proceed to dig their way back underneath the soil, where they remain until it's time to emerge again.",
      "Adult cicadas typically remain above ground in a given location for 4 to 6 weeks after they first emerge. Researchers note that most of the individual insects live for less time, but that window accounts for some degree of staggering when the brood emerges, since that happens over a period of about two weeks.",
      "Are cicadas dangerous?",
      "Cicadas are not dangerous to humans or pets, experts say. They don't bite or sting and they aren't poisonous or venomous.",
      "\"If dogs or cats eat many cicadas, this may temporarily cause an upset stomach or vomiting, but there is no need to worry if a pet eats a small number of cicadas,\" the Environmental Protection Agency says.",
      "They are also largely beneficial to the ecosystem. They are a food source for birds and other predators that eat insects. They can aerate soil, and when they decompose, they provide nutrients that can help trees grow.",
      "Cicadas may harm young trees, which can be protected with mesh or netting. They don't eat leaves, flowers, fruits or garden produce, the EPA says.",

      "In announcing the emergency procedures Wednesday, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the management of federal lands and natural resources, said the permitting process will now take up to \"28 days at most\" \u2014 a drastic departure from the current one- to two-year timeline.",
      "The government agency said the move is in response to President Trump's January 20 declaration of a national energy emergency. In an executive order on the first day of his second term, the White House said it would \"eliminate harmful, coercive 'climate' policies that increase the costs of food and fuel.\"",
      "The speedy permitting policy opens the door for the U.S. to expand oil and gas projects and for Mr. Trump to make good on his promise to \"Drill, baby, drill\" \u2014 a common refrain on his campaign trail. The new guidelines will apply to a wide range of energy projects, including crude oil, natural gas and coal.",
      "The U.S. leads the world in\u00a0oil\u00a0and\u00a0gas\u00a0production, with an output of 20 million barrels of oil a day and accounting for roughly a quarter of global gas production, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "The DOI said it would use emergency authorities under the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act to expedite the permitting process.",
      "\"The United States cannot afford to wait,\" Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday. \"President Trump has made it clear that our energy security is national security, and these emergency procedures reflect our unwavering commitment to protecting both.\"",
      "Lawsuits to come, experts say",
      "Environmental advocates rebuked the announcement, saying that in addition to adverse environmental impacts on public land and water sources, the expedited procedures will strip away community members' ability to weigh in on projects happening in their own backyards. Experts say the move is expected to draw legal challenges.",
      "\"What they're proposing to do is basically forgo environmental review or public participation or anything meaningful,\" said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. \"The implications of that are extreme.\"",
      "The environmental review process has developed over time, he said, and goes back decades. The Endangered Species Act, one of three statues the DOI is targeting, was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973. Section 7 of the Act requires consultation among agencies \"to ensure their activities are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence\" of federally protected species, according to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.",
      "A win for oil and gas industries",
      "The announcement on Wednesday was a win for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, which has\u00a0cheered\u00a0Mr. Trump's energy agenda.",
      "\"Our nation's permitting system is broken, and reform is essential to ensuring access to affordable, reliable energy,\" Holly Hopkins, VP of upstream policy at the American Petroleum Institute, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Former officials from several different federal agencies who served under Mr. Trump's previous term and the Biden administration have told CBS News on background that looming workforce reductions could throw a wrench in the department's plans to speed up the permitting process. Also, breaking with long-standing practices could lead to major slipups, such as oil spills, they added.",
      "The Department of the Interior employs about 70,000 staff members, according to its website. But cuts could be on the horizon. An internal White House document obtained by The Washington Post indicated that as many as 1 in 4 department employees could be let go as a part of a broader series of staff cuts across government agencies.",
      "\"How can you accomplish so much with fewer and fewer people?\" said Burger of Columbia's Sabin Center. \"The only result is less and less oversight.\"",
      "Athan Manuel, director of the Lands Protection Program at the Sierra Club, agreed, adding that gutting the federal agency could hinder the Trump administration's objectives.",
      "\"They just don't seem to understand that these employees run the gamut from wildlife biologists to firefighters, to people who permit oil and gas drilling or permit mines on federal lands,\" he said. \"If it's going to wholesale cut staff, some of the things they care about are going to get caught up in that.\"",
      "The Department of Interior did not respond to request for comment on how layoffs might impact its ability to issue permits on a tighter timetable.",
      "According to the new procedural guidelines issued by the agency this week, companies seeking a permit are required to confirm in writing that they want their project covered by the expedited process \u2014 meaning that not everyone will necessarily opt in. Those that do could stand to lose big, Manuel said.",
      "\"Companies are very cautious before they sink millions of dollars into a well or to a mining project,\" he said. \"So I think they benefit from going slowly because they don't want to be stuck with a stranded asset or literally drill a dry hole here.\"",

      "In findings,\u00a0published Thursday in the journal Science, researchers said the caterpillar \"boasts an unprecedented and macabre practice of decorating its portable larval home with the body parts of the spider prey it harvests from the web where it resides.\"",
      "There are other meat-eating caterpillars that \"do lots of crazy things, but this takes the cake,\" said study author Dan Rubinoff with the University of Hawaii at Manoa.",

      "\"It really is an astonishing type of case,\" said Steven Montgomery, an entomology consultant in Hawaii who was not involved with the new study.",
      "Scientists found just 62 of the carnivorous caterpillars in over 20 years of observing.",
      "Predatory caterpillars are extremely rare and the bone collectors found in Hawaii will even eat each other, researchers said.",
      "The bone collector's origins date back at least 6 million years, making the caterpillars more than one million years older than the Hawaiian islands themselves. Today, they dwell on an isolated patch of mountain forest alongside invasive species.",
      "The spider \"is restricted to 15 square kilometers of a single mountain range on the island of O\u02bbahu, meaning that other members of the lineage have disappeared from older islands,\" the scientists wrote.",

The European Commission imposed a 500 million euro ($571 million) fine on Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. The commission, which is the EU's executive arm, also fined Meta Platforms 200 million euros ($228 million) because it forced Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.",
      "The punishments were smaller than the blockbuster multibillion-euro fines that the commission has previously slapped on Big Tech companies in antitrust cases.",
      "Apple and Meta have to comply with the decisions within 60 days or risk unspecified \"periodic penalty payments,\" the commission said.",
      "The decisions were expected to come in March, but officials apparently held off amid an escalating trans-Atlantic trade war with President Trump, who has repeatedly complained about regulations from Brussels affecting American companies.",
      "The penalties were issued under the EU's Digital Markets Act, also known as the DMA. It's a sweeping rulebook that amounts to a set of do's and don'ts designed to give consumers and businesses more choice and prevent Big Tech \"gatekeepers\" from cornering digital markets.",

      "In the App Store case, the Commission had accused the iPhone maker of imposing unfair rules preventing app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels.",
      "Among the DMA's provisions are requirements to let developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options and direct them to those offers.",
      "The commission said it ordered Apple to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to other channels, and to end \"non-compliant\" conduct.",
      "Apple said it has \"spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for.\"",
      "\"Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way,\" the company said.",
      "Apple has also faced a broad antitrust lawsuit in the U.S., where the\u00a0Justice Department alleged\u00a0that the California company illegally engaged in anti-competitive behavior in an effort to build a \"moat around its smartphone monopoly\" and maximize its profits at the expense of consumers. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have joined the suit as plaintiffs.",
      "The EU's Meta investigation centered on the company's strategy to comply with strict European data privacy rules by giving users the option of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Users could pay at least 10 euros ($11) a month to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data. The U.S. tech giant rolled out the option after the European Union's top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users' online interests and digital activity.",
      "Regulators took issue with Meta's model, saying it doesn't allow users to exercise their right to \"freely consent\" to allowing their personal data from its various services, which also include Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp and Messenger, to be combined for personalized ads.",
      "Meta rolled out a third option in November giving Facebook and Instagram users in Europe the option to see fewer personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription. The commission said it's \"currently assessing\" this option and continues to hold talks with Meta, and has asked the company to provide evidence of the new option's impact.",

    "story": [
      "Nearly four months into 2025, the United States recorded the most measles cases in a single year since a 2019 wave, and the number continues to grow, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. The majority of the infections have been reported in an outbreak in West Texas that has led to\u00a0the deaths\u00a0of two children.",
      "The number of cases in Texas alone has grown to more than\u00a0660, while cases nationwide topped 880, with infections confirmed in at least 29 states.",
      "Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases can cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0highly safe and effective.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",
      "The largest outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, but cases have been reported in other states around the country, as well.",
      "The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as new data is released by state health departments and the CDC. (The map below is updated on Fridays when the CDC releases its latest weekly numbers.)",
      "The Texas outbreak is primarily affecting\u00a0children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or have an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the first patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child, and the second was an unvaccinated 8-year-old girl. Neither of the children had underlying health conditions, the Texas health department said. New Mexico also reported the death of an adult with measles.",
      "The last measles death in the U.S. before this year was in 2019, when a 37-year-old man died from measles complicated by meningitis in California, according to CDC data.",
      "The highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven by outbreaks in New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.",
      "Health experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles.",
      "CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is\u00a0down from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year \u2014 a critical threshold to keep people safe.",
      "\"When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity),\" the CDC states.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history\u00a0of making\u00a0false and misleading claims\u00a0about vaccines, voiced support for vaccination as the\u00a0deadly outbreak\u00a0spread in the Southwest.",
      "\"We encourage people to get the measles vaccine,\" Kennedy told CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook in an interview April 8, marking the first time Kennedy has publicly urged people to get the measles vaccine since becoming HHS secretary.",
      "Asked by LaPook what the federal government's official position on the vaccine is, Kennedy reiterated, \"The federal government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine,\" but added, \"The government should not be mandating those.\"",

    "summary": "Ren\u00e9e Richards believes the fierce debate over trans athletes has fueled broader attacks on trans rights.",
    "story": [
      "At age 90, Ren\u00e9e Richards plays a lot of golf.",
      "\"Yesterday I played 18 holes. I'm going to play 18 holes in my league today, and if I feel okay, I'll play 18 holes tomorrow,\" said Richards recently.",
      "The former professional tennis player and ophthalmologist made headlines in the 1970s, when after transitioning to female she sued and won the right to play in the U.S. Open. During her half-decade pro career, the doctor peaked at 20th in the world and in 1977 made the U.S. open finals in doubles, where she lost to a pair that included tennis legend Martina Navratilova.",
      "Half a century later, her views have evolved \u2014 she believes transgender women who transition after puberty should not compete in women's sports \u2014 but she's aghast at broader restrictions on transgender rights during the Trump administration's first 100 days.",
      "The State Department has halted the practice of issuing passports with \"X\" gender markers. The Office of Personnel Management directed agency heads to strip \"gender ideology\" from websites, contracts and emails. An executive order calls on the federal government \"to rescind all funds from educational programs\" that allow transgender girls and women to compete. Another order restricts access to gender-affirming care for youth. The Department of Defense has reinstated President Trump's first term transgender military ban, and transgender federal inmates are now regarded by their sex at birth. The changes are the subject of ongoing lawsuits.",
      "First and foremost on Richards' mind: the Navy veteran believes transgender Americans should be able to serve openly in the military.",
      "\"That's terrible. You know, I can only think of myself because I was in the Navy when nobody knew that I was a transgender. I hadn't had surgery yet, but it was still me,\" said Richards, who won the All-Navy tennis championship while serving. \"That goes a long way back, but I'm still representative of the same ilk even though they didn't know it at the time.\"",
      "Richards is the subject of a forthcoming book, tentatively titled \"Finding Ren\u00e9e,\" by former Sports Illustrated editor Julie Kliegman. Richards believes the fierce debate over transgender athletes has fueled a \"jump\u2026from the sports to the military, to the education, to the bathrooms, to the passports, to the existence, to the teaching of any kind of gender.\"",
      "It's a trend that has played out in state legislatures, before and during the current Trump administration, according to Logan Casey, the director of policy research at the nonprofit Movement Advancement Project, which tracks state laws and executive orders regulating gender.",
      "Casey said state-level bans on sports prior to the current Trump administration \"laid the groundwork for all of the anti-transgender and anti-LGBTQ attacks more broadly.\"",
      "\"It sort of put sports as a foot in the door, and a framework, for how many people who had not previously thought about transgender people very much \u2014 let alone in the context of policy and law \u2014 are now thinking about it and framing it,\" said Casey, who noted the vast majority of state legislation targeting LGBTQ rights fails to become law.",
      "Ash Lazarus Orr, a spokesperson for Advocates for Trans Equality, said the language of Mr. Trump's executive orders bore similarities to orders and legislation coming out of state capitals.",
      "\"It signals back to states that, yes, this is a priority. You should continue to do this, and in fact do this and other attacks,\" said Orr, who is also the title plaintiff in a lawsuit over the Trump administration's policy requiring U.S. passports to reflect sex assigned at birth. \"While we were seeing attacks on the trans community escalating at a state level under the Biden administration, what we are seeing now under the Trump administration is absolutely an escalation.\"",
      "Former Olympic swimmer Nancy Hogshead, a Democrat who founded the nonprofit advocacy group Champion Women, believes the party is suffering from self-inflicted wounds.",
      "Hogshead, who supports efforts to align participation in sports with gender at birth, said Trump and Republicans have found a galvanizing issue.",
      "\"It is a winner for them. It is a winner for Republicans,\" Hogshead said. \"Fifty percent of all girls play sports. That is a meat and potatoes issue for them. It's not a fringe issue.\"",
      "Richards believes Trump has a similar view. She said, as an ophthalmologist, she treated one of his sisters and has met Mr. Trump once.",
      "\"He knows I'm not an ogre,\" she said. \"He sees, and his advisors advise him, that his popularity rests with the small group of people that hate the idea of transgender, period.\"",
      "Richards, whose professional tennis career began in 1977 when she was more than 40 years old, largely agrees with Hogshead. In April 2024, she provided the Women's Tennis Association with a position paper on participation of transgender women in sports, and this year allowed Sports Illustrated to publish it. In the paper, Richards concluded that people who have undergone male puberty should be ineligible to compete against biological females.",
      "Richards's paper included reflections on her time playing both as an amateur and professionally, analysis of \"the current literature on the subject,\" citing her decades as a doctor, and policy recommendations.",
      "It also touched on golf.",
      "\"My lifetime in sports is still ongoing,\" she wrote. \"I have been a member of the ladies' golf league at the public/private club near my home for the past 20 years.\"",
      "Richards spoke to CBS News on opening day last week. She said, despite politics, the women in her league still welcome her competition.",
      "\"Not only welcome and accepted, but if I didn't show up, they would have a cemetery ceremony, believe me,\" Richards said.",
      "Are there a lot of 90-year-olds there, still hitting the links?",
      "\"Yeah, me. Amongst the men and the women, I'm the only one,\" Richards said, adding that she guesses the average age at the club is 60. \"I play the forward tee, but I don't play any gold tees that are in front of that \u2014 and I hit the ball as well as they do, too.\"",

      "A highly invasive species of crab \u2014 capable of climbing over 13-foot-high concrete structures \u2014 has been spotted in the Pacific Northwest for the first time, wildlife officials said.",
      "A commercial fisherman caught what officials identified as a Chinese mitten crab last week in the Lower Columbia River, just south of the Washington state border, according to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, which released a photo of the crab.",
      "\"Chinese mitten crabs have not been confirmed in the Pacific Northwest until now,\" the department said in a news release\u00a0Thursday.",
      "Officials warned that the species wreaked havoc on the San Francisco Bay three decades ago.",
      "\"While this is a rare event in Oregon, mitten crabs caused significant infrastructure and ecological damage in and around San Francisco Bay when the population was at its height in the late 1990s,\" the department said.",
      "Officials said the crab was a large male that could have been introduced illegally into the river by a person or by ballast water from a ship.",
      "What are Chinese mitten crabs?",
      "Chinese mitten crabs are an invasive species that are originally from East Asia. The Smithsonian says that the crabs\u00a0first established an invasive population\u00a0in the San Francisco Bay in the '80s \u2014 but they spread to the East Coast and have recently been spotted in New York.",
      "The crabs, which are named for hairy, mitten-like claws, vary in color from brownish-orange to greenish-brown. Unlike any native crab species, they have four spines on each side as well as a notch between their eyes.",
      "The crabs are capable of climbing over concrete structures at least 13 feet tall, according to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "\"Mitten crabs can also pass through lock systems and possibly climb fish ladders, or leave the water and walk around barriers where the terrain is suitable,\" the bureau says.",
      "The creatures have been known to steal fishing bait and damage fishing gear, block power plant cooling systems and even amplify flooding risk by burrowing in banks, causing them to become unstable and erode.",
      "Chinese mitten crabs spend most of their lives in freshwater, but adults can only reproduce in saltwater, according to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\"Newly hatched larvae are in open saltwater in bays and estuaries and fully molted juveniles are found in brackish and freshwater areas within a few miles upstream of saltwater,\" the department says.",
      "What's next",
      "Oregon wildlife biologists are working with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and NOAA to determine if other mitten crabs are in the area. Officials said they will set up trap lines and collect water and samples \"to look for environmental genetic markers specific to the mitten crab.\"",
      "In the meantime, officials are urging the public to keep an eye out for the furry creatures and report any sighting to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife or the Oregon Invasive Species Council.",
      "\"It is important to correctly identify this species and report it to your local ODFW office with the location found,\" the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife said.",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. Coast Guard crew seized roughly 10,000 pounds of cocaine from a fishing boat in the Atlantic Ocean, the agency said\u00a0on Monday. The haul was worth an estimated $74 million.",
      "The drug seizure took place in mid April, after the crew of the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Calhoun identified what the agency described as a suspicious fishing vessel some 1,200 miles west of Las Palmas in the Canary Islands. Sailing through international waters, the boat's behavior raised alarms about narcotic trafficking, according to the Coast Guard, which sent a small cutter to intercept it and ultimately found the contraband on board.",
      "Five suspected smugglers were apprehended and are in U.S. custody, the Coast Guard said.",
      "\"This interdiction demonstrates the Coast Guard's unwavering commitment to combating transnational criminal organizations,\" said Vice Adm. Nathan Moore, commander of the Coast Guard Atlantic Area, in a statement. \"Our dedicated crews, in close coordination with interagency and international partners, continue to disrupt the flow of illicit narcotics, which serves as a critical strategic action that disrupts the financial networks of TCOs, undermining their ability to fund further illicit activities that threaten our communities.\"",
      "Coast Guard crews have intercepted multiple massive drug hauls over the last few months, in several different regions.",
      "Last week, the Coast Guard cutter Kimball offloaded approximately 18,898 pounds of cocaine \u2014 with an estimated street value of more than $214 million \u2014 in San Diego, after intercepting six trafficking vessels off the coasts of Mexico and Central America and South America between February and April,\u00a0federal officials said. Two weeks earlier, CBS Miami reported\u00a0that another pair of Coast Guard cutters, James and Mohawk, offloaded more than 48,000 pounds of seized illegal drugs valued at more than $509 million at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale.",
      "That offload in Florida came from 13 separate incidents where Coast Guard ships intercepted drug trafficking operations in the eastern Pacific Ocean. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said at the time that the hauls included almost 45,000 pounds of \"pure cocaine\" and another 3,800 pounds of marijuana.",
      "Earlier this year, the Coast Guard cutter Waesche offloaded more than 37,000 pounds of cocaine seized from smuggling boats off the coasts of Mexico, Central America and South America between December and February. The cutter ship intercepted 11 vessels in that time period, the Coast Guard said, and the haul altogether was valued at more than $275 million.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:09:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As President Trump marks his first 100 days in the White House, many of the plans he has rolled out since the start of his second term closely align with those detailed in Project 2025's sprawling policy book.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump repeatedly distanced himself from Project 2025 on the campaign trail, saying he had \"nothing to do with\" the initiative spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation, had not read it and didn't have any plans to.",
      "But as the president marks 100 days in the White House, many of the plans he has rolled out since the start of his second term closely align with those in the pages of Project 2025's sprawling, 900-page policy blueprint, which lays out an overhaul of the executive branch.",
      "Overseen by the Heritage Foundation, Project 2025 was an initiative that was designed to provide a roadmap for the next Republican president, now Mr. Trump. On the campaign trail, the president called some of its proposals \"abysmal\" and said he knew nothing about it, though CBS News' analysis showed many of its proposals were similar to his own.",
      "The authors of some of the policy guide's chapters served in his first administration and have returned for the second. Russ Vought is leading the Office of Management and Budget, and John Ratcliffe is in place as CIA director, while Peter Navarro, who was a top trade adviser to Mr. Trump in his first administration, returned for a second stint in the White House.",
      "Some of Mr. Trump's actions taken in his first days in office reinstate measures he put in place during his first term that were revoked by President Biden. But in other instances, Mr. Trump has taken new executive actions that echo policies outlined in Project 2025's policy book.",
      "Abolishing the Department of Education",
      "Republicans have long called for the Department of Education to be dismantled, and that recommendation was also made in Project 2025, which declared that \"federal education policy should be limited and, ultimately, the federal Department of Education should be eliminated.\"",
      "Mr. Trump took steps to begin that process with an executive order he signed in March. The administration has already cut the Education Department's staff and is making plans to move some of its functions to other agencies.",
      "Shuttering the Department of Education, however, would require an act of Congress.",
      "Ending diversity, equity and inclusion practices",
      "The president frequently rails against diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, practices, and he signed an executive order on the day he returned to the White House ending all DEI programs within the federal government.",
      "Mr. Trump claimed in his order that DEI policies can violate federal civil rights laws and shut out Americans \"who deserve a shot at the American dream\" because of their race or sex.",
      "Project 2025 likewise calls for the \"DEI apparatus\" at a variety of agencies to be dismantled.",
      "Project 2025's policy book also calls for deleting a variety of terms, including DEI, abortion and gender equality \"from every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists.\"",
      "Some of the Trump administration's early efforts to purge mentions of gender or race resulted in missteps that prompted a public outcry and were later reversed.",
      "Shifting FEMA costs to the states",
      "Shortly after the start of his second term, Mr. Trump established a review council to advise him on the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, \"to capably and impartially address disasters occurring within the United States.\" The council will also advise the president on recommended changes related to FEMA, his order states.",
      "Mr. Trump's directive came after he suggested that he could \"get rid\" of FEMA and leave disaster response management to the states.",
      "\"That's what states are for, to take care of problems,\" he said in late January.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in March that declares it is the policy of the U.S. that \"state and local governments and individuals play a more active and significant role in national resilience and preparedness,\" and says that his administration will \"enable state and local governments to better understand, plan for and ultimately address the needs of their citizens.\"",
      "The overhaul at FEMA has sparked concerns about the agency's capabilities to deliver disaster assistance ahead of hurricane season. FEMA has already denied requests for federal aid in response to severe storms and tornadoes\u00a0in Arkansas, flooding in parts of\u00a0West Virginia and storms\u00a0in Washington.",
      "Project 2025's sweeping book of policy proposals calls for \"reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government.\"",
      "It also urges Congress to change the cost-sharing arrangement so the federal government covers 25% of the costs for small disasters and up to 75% for \"truly catastrophic disasters.\" Currently, for Public Assistance, which provides financial and direct assistance to state and local governments for disaster response and recovery work, FEMA covers a minimum of 75% of costs, and the president can increase the federal cost-share at his discretion, according to a 2023 report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The recommendation follows a warning from Project 2025's authors that FEMA is \"overtasked, overcompensates for the lack of state and local preparedness and response, and is regularly in deep debt.\" Project 2025's book also calls on Congress to end preparedness grants for states and localities.",
      "\"DHS should not be in the business of handing out federal tax dollars: These grants should be terminated,\" it states.",
      "Targeting PBS and National Public Radio",
      "Brendan Carr, head of the Federal Communications Commission, informed the heads of National Public Radio and PBS in a letter earlier this year that the agency had opened an investigation into the airing of their programming across their roughly 1,500 broadcast member stations, according to The New York Times.",
      "Those stations are licensed by the FCC to operate, but are limited to operating as noncommercial educational broadcast stations. These stations, or NCEs, are exempt from licensing fees and operate on a specific \"reserved\" frequency band. Federal law prohibits these noncommercial educational broadcast stations from airing commercial advertisements.",
      "In his letter, Carr wrote that he is \"concerned that NPR and PBS broadcasts could be violating federal law by airing commercials. In particular, it is possible that NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting underwriting announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements.\"",
      "Carr also said that he also does not see a reason for Congress to continue approving federal dollars for NPR and PBS \"given the changes in the media marketplace.\" PBS CEO Paula Kerger said the cuts \"would devastate PBS member stations and the essential role they play in communities, particularly smaller and rural stations.\"",
      "Carr authored the section of Project 2025's policy book that deals with the FCC, but another portion of the blueprint urges Congress to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides grants to NPR and PBS.",
      "According to Project 2025, \"stripping public funding would, of course, mean that NPR, PBS, Pacifica Radio, and the other leftist broadcasters would be shorn of the presumption that they act in the public interest and receive the privileges that often accompany so acting.\" The outlets should therefore no longer be qualified as noncommercial educational broadcast stations, according to the book.",
      "Freezing federal assistance",
      "One of Mr. Trump's first actions as president was to establish the White House's Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 DOGE \u2014 run by Elon Musk, to slash regulations and spending, and restructure federal agencies.",
      "On the heels of that move, the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, issued a two-page memo in January that ordered a freeze on grant, loan or federal assistance programs covered by Mr. Trump's executive orders, which would allow his administration \"time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of the funding for those programs consistent with the law and the president's priorities.\"",
      "The memo sparked widespread confusion and prompted concerns about whether programs providing meals for the elderly, pre-school funding for low-income children, medical research and other priorities approved by Congress would be impacted by the order.",
      "The White House then rescinded the memo but maintained the funding pause \"to end any confusion\" created by a federal court order temporarily pausing implementation of the freeze. Federal courts have since ordered the administration to reinstate any money that was frozen subject to the memo.",
      "Vought, the head of OMB, authored the section of Project 2025's policy book covering the Executive Office of the President, which includes the agency he has been tapped to lead.",
      "In it, he likens the budget office to an air-traffic control system for the president \"with the ability and charge to ensure that all policy initiatives are flying in sync and with the authority to let planes take off and, at times, ground planes that are flying off course.\"",
      "The memo may have been aimed at sparking a legal challenge to the Impoundment Control Act, a 1974 law that limits the president's ability to unilaterally freeze certain funds appropriated by Congress, and in most cases requires the president instead to ask Congress to rescind spending legislation.",
      "In Project 2025's policy blueprint, Vought also wrote the director of OMB must have \"sufficient visibility into the deep caverns of agency decision-making,\" and can achieve this by ensuring political appointees on his staff sign off on apportionments of funding authorized by Congress.",
      "Vought cited a 1870 law known as the Anti-Deficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending federal dollars in advance and requires funding be doled out in installments.",
      "\"This process, whereby agencies come to OMB for allotments of appropriated funding, is essential to the effective financial stewardship of taxpayer dollars,\" he wrote. \"OMB can then direct on behalf of a president the amount, duration, and purpose of any apportioned funding to ensure against waste, fraud, and abuse and ensure consistency with the president's agenda and applicable laws.\"",
      "Restricting gender-affirming care for minors",
      "Mr. Trump issued an executive order in January that seeks to bar the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care \u2014 puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures \u2014 for people under the age of 19.",
      "Called \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\" the order directs certain executive agencies to take steps to ensure medical institutions that receive federal grants \"end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\"",
      "It also instructs the secretary of defense to take regulatory action to exclude gender-affirming care for minors from insurance coverage provided by TRICARE, the Defense Department's health care program, and federal employee health benefit programs.",
      "Mr. Trump's order directs the head of the Department of Health and Human Services to withdraw March 2022 guidance on gender-affirming care.",
      "Project 2025's chapter on the Department of Health and Human Services calls for its Office of Civil Rights to \"remove all guidance issued under the Biden administration concerning sexual orientation and gender identity,\" including the March 2022 document.",
      "The book generally criticizes gender-affirming care as causing \"irreversible physical and mental harm to those who receive them\" and argues there is a lack of evidence surrounding it.",
      "Many families and doctors who care for transgender youth dispute that assessment, and a group of families filed a lawsuit claiming the order is discriminatory. Two different federal district courts have blocked the president's directive, and those injunctions are being appealed.",
      "Revoking security clearances",
      "Mr. Trump took executive action to start the process of revoking the security clearances of dozens of former intelligence officials who signed a letter in 2020 claiming emails found on a laptop owned by Hunter Biden bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign. He also announced he would revoke the security clearances of a number of prominent Democrats including former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton.",
      "Project 2025 also proposed stripping former intelligence officials of security clearances, under a more narrow set of circumstances, in a section on the intelligence community authored by Dustin Carmack, who worked at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "\"The president should immediately revoke the security clearances of any former directors, deputy directors, or other senior intelligence officials who discuss their work in the press or on social media without prior clearance from the current director,\" he wrote.",
      "Stripping civil servants of employment protections",
      "Among the slew of actions Mr. Trump took on his first day back in the White House was to reinstate an executive order issued during his first term that created \"Schedule F in the Excepted Service.\" The order creates a new employment category for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of employment protections.",
      "The order states that in recent years, \"there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership.\"",
      "\"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character,\" Mr. Trump's order reads.",
      "The order makes some minor changes to the president's prior measure from October 2020. But it notably adds a section that states that while employees in these new \"Schedule Policy/Career Positions,\" are not required to personally or politically support the current president or his policies, they are \"required to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability, consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive authority solely in the president.\"",
      "Failure to do so is grounds for termination of employment, Mr. Trump's executive order states. Critics say the change would enable the administration to fire government employees for no cause and replace them with Trump loyalists.",
      "Project 2025 repeatedly calls for Mr. Trump's Schedule F proposal to be reinstated.",
      "Reinstating service members who refused COVID-19 vaccines",
      "The president directed the secretaries of Defense or Homeland Security to reinstate service members, both active-duty and reserve, who were discharged after refusing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. (The vaccine requirement was lifted in 2023.) His order also states they should be reverted to their former rank and receive full back pay, benefits, bonus payments or compensation.",
      "The Project 2025 blueprint's section on the Defense Department, authored by Chris Miller, calls for the next administration to \"reinstate servicemembers to active duty who were discharged for not receiving the COVID vaccine, restore their appropriate rank, and provide back pay.\"",
      "Miller served as acting defense secretary in the final weeks of Mr. Trump's first term. His chief of staff, Kash Patel, is now serving as director of the FBI.",
      "Banning transgender people from the military",
      "During his first four years in the White House, Mr. Trump prohibited transgender people from serving in the military. President Biden repealed that ban, but Mr. Trump has issued an order that effectively bars transgender people from serving in the armed forces and withdraws his predecessor's order.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order states that \"expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\" Identifying as transgender, it continues, \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.\"",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States Government to establish high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity. This policy is inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria,\" the president's order states. \"This policy is also inconsistent with shifting pronoun usage or use of pronouns that inaccurately reflect an individual's sex.\"",
      "Project 2025 calls for a reversal of policies \"that allow transgender individuals to serve in the military. Gender dysphoria is incompatible with the demands of military service.\"",
      "SPARTA Pride, a nonprofit group comprising thousands of transgender service members, veterans and their supporters, disputed such claims, saying: \"Transgender Americans have served openly and honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces for nearly a decade. Thousands of transgender troops are currently serving, and are fully qualified for the positions in which they serve.\"",
      "The transgender military ban has since been blocked by two different federal courts, though the decisions have been appealed. The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene in one of those cases and is seeking to begin enforcing the ban.",
      "There are more than 1.2 million active-duty members of the military, according to the Defense Department. A January report from the Congressional Research Service found that roughly 1,892 active-duty service members received gender-affirming care from the Pentagon between January 2016 and May 2021. A Feb. 26 memo from the Pentagon found that between 2015 and 2024, it spent $52 million on care for active-duty members of the military to treat gender dysphoria.",
      "A hiring freeze",
      "On his first day in the White House, Mr. Trump issued a memorandum freezing hiring of federal civilian employees, which he extended to July 15. Positions that were vacant as of his inauguration at noon on Jan. 20 should also not be filled, he said.",
      "The order was part of his plans to reduce the size of the federal workforce, also a recommendation made in the Project 2025 policy roadmap.",
      "The book, though, warns that while \"reducing the number of federal employees seems an obvious way to reduce the overall expense of the civil service,\" prior attempts to do so by presidents of both parties \"did not lead to permanent and substantive reductions in the number of nondefense federal employees.\"",
      "Instead, Project 2025 suggests a \"freeze on all top career-position hiring to prevent 'burrowing-in' by outgoing political appointees.\"",
      "Withdrawing from World Health Organization",
      "Mr. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization in 2020 due to what his first administration said was a mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden reversed that decision when he took office, and Mr. Trump rolled back that move on his first day back in the White House.",
      "His latest order directed the secretary of state to inform the secretary-general of the United States and World Health Organization leadership of the U.S. decision to withdraw from the group. Health officials in the U.S. and around the world have warned the move will leave people at greater risk of dangerous outbreaks and give China a more dominant role at the World Health Organization.",
      "Project 2025, too, criticized the World Health Organization for its handling of the pandemic.",
      "\"The manifest failure and corruption of the World Health Organization (WHO) during the COVID-19 pandemic is an example of the danger that international organizations pose to U.S. citizens and interests,\" its book states.",
      "It said that when institutions act contrary to U.S. interests, the government \"must be prepared to take appropriate steps in response, up to and including withdrawal.\"",
      "Sending active-duty troops to the southern border",
      "Immigration was the topic of several executive actions taken by Mr. Trump on the first day of his presidency, including one order that assigns troops \"the mission to seal the borders and maintain the sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of the United States.\"",
      "The chapter of Project 2025's blueprint that covers the Department of Homeland Security was authored by Ken Cuccinelli, who served in the first Trump administration, and it, too, sees a role for the Defense Department in securing the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The Pentagon, Cucinelli writes, should \"explicitly acknowledge and adjust personnel and priorities to participate actively in the defense, including using military personnel and hardware to prevent illegal crossings between ports of entry and channel all cross-border traffic to legal ports of entry.\"",
      "A section on the Justice Department urges the next administration to \"take a creative and aggressive approach\" to tackling criminal organizations at the southern border.",
      "\"This could include use of active-duty military personnel and National Guardsmen to assist in arrest operations along the border \u2014 something that has not yet been done,\" Project 2025's chapter on the Justice Department states.",
      "Limiting refugee admissions",
      "Entry into the U.S. by refugees under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program was suspended earlier this year in accordance with an order by Mr. Trump on Jan. 20. His directive also orders the secretary of Homeland Security to suspend decisions on applications for refugee status.",
      "Mr. Trump has claimed that during the Biden administration, the U.S. has been \"inundated\" with high levels of migration, including through the Refugee Admissions Program.",
      "Project 2025, too, blames the Biden administration for overseeing what it says was a \"collapse\" of U.S. border security and immigration enforcement. To address this \"crisis,\" Project 2025 calls for \"rightsizing refugee admissions.\"",
      "\"The federal government's obligation to shift national security\u2013essential screening and vetting resources to the forged border crisis will necessitate an indefinite curtailment of the number of USRAP refugee admissions,\" its chapter on the State Department reads.",
      "The policy book calls for the State Department bureau that administers the Refugee Admissions Program to shift resources to challenges \"until the crisis can be contained and refugee-focused screening and vetting capacity can reasonably be restored.\"",
      "Rescinding temporary protected status designations",
      "As part of Mr. Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown, his administration has moved to end the Temporary Protected Status program for Haitians and Venezuelans.",
      "The TPS designation was created by Congress in 1990, and it allows the federal government to grant temporary immigration protections to migrants from countries facing war, environmental disasters or other crises that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The program allows beneficiaries to apply for renewable work permits and deportation deferrals.",
      "A federal judge in late March agreed to delay the Trump administration's attempt to end the TPS program that shields roughly 350,000 Venezuelan migrants, and a federal appeals court declined to pause that order while proceedings continue.",
      "Project 2025 calls on Congress to \"repeal temporary protected status designations.\"",
      "Capping indirect costs for university-based research",
      "The National Institutes of Health announced in a February memo that it would be capping the amount of funding for \"indirect costs\" at 15%, a cut from an average of between 27% and 28%. Indirect costs cover general expenses like facilities and administration.",
      "NIH said in its memo that it has spent billions on indirect costs for more than 2,500 universities, medical schools and other research institutions across the country, and noted that \"most private foundations that fund research provide substantially lower indirect costs than the federal government, and universities readily accept grants from these foundations.\"",
      "Project 2025 also focused on indirect costs and called on Congress to \"cap the indirect cost rate paid to universities so that it does not exceed the lowest rate a university accepts from a private organization to fund search efforts.\"",
      "\"This market-based reform would help reduce federal taxpayer subsidization of leftist agendas,\" the policy book read.",
      "While Project 2025 said it is up to Congress to cap the indirect cost rate, the Trump administration took this step unilaterally, prompting legal challenges from universities, states and organizations that represent medical colleges and schools.",
      "Universities and the NIH said the cuts will have a \"dire impact\" on lifesaving research, including clinical trials for cancer and Alzheimer's patients.",
      "Requiring disclosures of foreign gifts to universities",
      "As part of a series of executive orders addressing the education system, Mr. Trump issued a directive on April 23 that directs the education secretary to enforce a provision of the Higher Education Act that requires higher education institutions that receive federal dollars to disclose any gifts of contracts from a foreign source valued at $250,000 or more in a calendar year.",
      "The move is also part of Project 2025, which calls on the next administration to enforce that statute, investigate higher education institutions that do not honor the obligations laid out in the law and make \"appropriate referrals\" to the Justice Department.",
      "Asserting the president's power to remove federal officials",
      "Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has sought to fire the members of independent agencies and inspectors general, despite federal laws that lay out the grounds for their removals.",
      "The terminations have sparked multiple court fights that appear aimed at asserting what the Trump administration believes is the president's unrestricted power to remove executive branch officials. But a 90-year-old Supreme Court decision, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "In a February letter to Congress, then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said the Justice Department \"intends to urge the Supreme Court to overrule that decision, which prevents the president from adequately supervising principal officers in the executive branch who execute the laws on the president's behalf, and which has already been severely eroded by recent Supreme Court decisions.\"",
      "Project 2025, too, suggested the next Republican presidential administration should seek the reversal of Humphrey's Executor.",
      "\"The next conservative administration should formally take the position that Humphrey's Executor violates the Constitution's separation of powers,\" it states.",
      "Targeting NOAA",
      "Project 2025's policy book calls for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, known as NOAA, to be \"dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories.\"",
      "The guide says NOAA's six main components should either be downsized or broken up, including Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, or OAR, which Project 2025 claims is the \"source of much of NOAA's climate alarmism.\"",
      "The Trump administration has proposed sweeping changes and job cuts for NOAA, including a 25% cut to its 2026 budget, according to an internal memo obtained by CBS News in April. The proposal calls for OAR to be eliminated as an office, as well as funding for climate, weather and ocean laboratories, cooperative institutes and other programs.",
      "Current and former officials with NOAA have said the memo's objectives are \"devastating,\" and have argued that research is crucial to improving services such as severe weather forecasts\u00a0for the public.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump is marking the first 100 days in office of his second term on Tuesday evening with a\u00a0speech in Macomb County, Michigan, outside Detroit.",
      "He's expected to hit the highlights of his second term so far, including mass deportation operations, efforts to shrink the size and scope of government and the changes he's making to the global trade landscape. Those endeavors have not gone unopposed, prompting scores of lawsuits filed by ousted government employees, migrants fighting their deportation and business owners who argue the president's tariffs are unlawful.",
      "Macomb Community College in Warren, Michigan, is hosting the president for his remarks.",
      "\"[I]nflation has cooled, consumer prices dropped month-over-month for the first time in three years, and gas prices are lower across the country,\" the White House said in announcing the speech, and it went on to praise the Department of Government Efficiency for rooting out \"waste, fraud, and abuse across the executive branch\" and canceling \"numerous discriminatory DEI contracts.\"",
      "DOGE's work continues apace, with billionaire Elon Musk unofficially guiding efforts to downsize government. So far, however, DOGE's cuts aren't anywhere close to approaching the $2 trillion Musk initially said he'd slash from annual spending. Those efforts have also landed the federal government in multiple courtrooms over the firings, downsizing and elimination of government-funded programs.",
      "The Trump administration claims it has done more to secure the border in the president's first 100 days in office than any other president in history. Illegal border crossings\u00a0have reached\u00a0lows not seen in decades, and the administration has been working to deport migrants accused or convicted of violent crimes and drug-related offenses. But Mr. Trump's decision to invoke wartime authorities to send migrants to an El Salvador prison without due process has resulted in lawsuits, as has the president's efforts to end\u00a0birthright citizenship.",
      "The 100-day mark comes as the Trump administration is hashing out trade negotiations with countries across the world after Mr. Trump levied nearly worldwide tariffs on foreign imports, tariffs that most economists say will make goods more expensive and worsen economic prospects. Mr. Trump claimed in an interview with TIME that he's reached 200 trade deals with other countries since April 2, but declined to name any of the countries. Americans are skeptical of the president's tariff approach, CBS News polling shows, and most worry they'll contribute to higher prices at a time when high prices are a top concern for voters.",
      "It's unclear how much the president will focus on foreign policy matters, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt argued the administration has made significant progress on the foreign policy front. After repeatedly saying he would end the war in Ukraine before even taking office, Mr. Trump is now saying those comments were made in \"jest.\"",
      "\"We are closer today to a peace deal in Russia and Ukraine, certainly, than we were when we took office on Jan. 20,\" Leavitt told reporters Monday. \"If you look at the situation in the Middle East, Israel has never had a stronger friend than they do right now in the Oval Office with President Trump. We've had more than 75 hostages who have returned home from around the world who were wrongfully detained individuals.\"",

      "The 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, but automakers won't be subject to the additional 25% import duty on imported steel and aluminum. Reimbursements will also be given to automakers who have already paid the double tariffs, the administration said.",

      "Shipments of goods from China to the U.S. are dropping sharply with the Trump administration's steep tariffs in place, leading major U.S. retailers to warn about impending supply shortages.",
      "The trade war between China and the U.S. has escalated over the past few weeks, with each nation hiking its import duties multiple times in a tit-for-tat. While Trump has given other countries a 90-day pause on the tariffs, as their leaders pledged to negotiate with the U.S., China has remained the exception.",
      "U.S. import duties on Chinese products now stand as high as 145%. China, meanwhile, has hit back with 125% tariffs on U.S. products.",
      "At the Port of Los Angeles, which, along with the Port of Long Beach, receives roughly 40% of all imports from Asia, shipments last week were down 10% compared with the same period one year earlier. That number is expected to keep falling.",
      "\"We are now beginning to see the flow of cargo to the Port of Los Angeles slow,\" Port of Los Angeles executive director Eugene Seroka said at a Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners meeting on April 24. \"It's my prediction that in two weeks time, arrivals will drop by 35%,\" he added.",
      "U.S. retailers had rushed to import goods into the country ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariffs going into effect, leading to a spike in imports since last summer. Now, with the 145% tariffs making goods from China roughly two-and-a-half times more expensive than they were last year, \"essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers have ceased,\" Seroka said.",
      "By another estimate, container bookings from China to the U.S. are down by as much as 60%, according to Flexport, a supply chain management company.",
      "The dip comes during what is usually a busy period for imports to the U.S. \"We would normally see an increase in bookings across the board, because this is the beginning of the shipping year,\" said Nathan Strang, director of ocean freight at Flexport. \"It's when back-to-school items and Halloween items start to come in.\"",
      "What's more, retailers have likely stockpiled sufficient inventory to last a couple of months, Seroka said, adding that come summer, consumers could find that many products are out of stock. All manner of goods flow through the Port of Los Angeles to end up in households across the U.S.",

      "\"We never want to raise prices,\" but \"there probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers,\" Walmart CFO John David Rainey\u00a0told CNBC.",

      "For the week of April 14, booking volumes from China to the U.S. dropped 45% compared with the same period one year earlier, according to Vizion, a container tracking service.",
      "\"This dramatic drop aligned with two key developments: the April 4th U.S. tariff announcement, followed by China's retaliatory measures announced on April 5th. The result? A widespread booking freeze, as shippers paused mid-shipment cycle to reassess costs, timelines and broader trade strategy,\" Vizion said in a report.",
      "Freightos, a freight booking platform, notes that carriers are canceling sailings from China at a fast clip, because they can't fill their ships with goods. Ocean container prices have dropped from $8,100 in July 2024 for a standard 40-foot container, to roughly, $2,327, the group noted.",

      "During his campaign last year, President Trump repeatedly attacked former President Joe Biden for his handling of the economy, vowing to boost economic growth and\u00a0lower inflation. But 100 days into his second term in the White House, the president is struggling to deliver on those promises.",
      "Mr. Trump's signature policies on trade, immigration and government spending have not only failed to spark economic growth \u2014 they're contributing to a sharp contraction in activity and threaten to re-ignite inflation, data shows. Economists also\u00a0warn that the chances of a U.S. recession\u00a0are rising.",
      "For millions of employers around the country, the Trump administration's helter-skelter approach to imposing tariffs on key trading partners, along with just about every other country on the planet,\u00a0has been challenging, corporate executives and small business owners have told CBS News.",
      "\"I can't think of a precedent for anything like this,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at investment advisory firm Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch of the impact of Mr. Trump's first 100 days on the economy.",
      "\"President Reagan, for instance, implemented a lot of changes in terms of tax policy and defense spending and cuts, and those things had big impacts,\" she added, \"but the element here that's quite different is the approach, which has been quite inconsistent and chaotic.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump's loyal base of supporters continues to voice support, among other voters there's also a widespread and growing belief that the administration is too focused on\u00a0tariffs\u00a0and not focused enough on lowering prices, according to CBS News polling about the president's first 100 days in office.",
      "Such concerns come as the White House makes a sharp break with the country's traditional playbook on global trade. The result, say critics, includes the highest tariffs in more than a century; sudden, confusing\u00a0shifts in tariff policy\u00a0and major damage to the U.S.' geopolitical relationships.",
      "\"Tariffs have been an unmitigated disaster, economically,\" former Senator Phil Gramm, a Republican and erstwhile economics professor at Texas A&M University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There's no doubt about it that the tariff policy in and of itself will drive up prices because tariffs are a tax. And remember, 61% of imports are component parts to be used in the production of goods and services in America.\"",
      "Gramm added, \"I want to emphasize that the harm of tariffs isn't just inflation \u2014 it's what they do for efficiency and economic growth.\"",
      "The Trump administration stands by its economic record to date, with White House spokesman Kush Deai saying in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch that \"President Trump's America First policies are delivering much-needed economic relief for everyday Americans while laying the groundwork for a long-term restoration of American Greatness.\"",
      "\"Within 100 days of President Trump's second term in office, Americans saw the first monthly price drop in years in the March inflation report, while industry leaders ranging from Apple to Hyundai to Nvidia have made trillions in historic investment commitments to reshore manufacturing back to the United States,\" Desai added. \"President Trump delivered a historic economy in his first term, and he's running back the success in his second term.\"",
      "Economic slowdown",
      "Already, the U.S. economy is showing signs of slowing. Business surveys in April suggest the U.S. is headed for \"a sluggish pace of growth,\" according to Pantheon Macroeconomics, which pointed to what it calls an \"an existential crisis\" for businesses, created by Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The country's gross domestic product \u2014 the total annual value of all the goods and services produced in the U.S. \u2014 is forecast to slow to 0.8% in the first three months of 2025, a sharp decline from 2.4% in the fourth quarter of last year, according to economists polled by financial services firm FactSet. For the year, economic growth is predicted to slow to 1.9%, versus 2.8% in 2024, FactSet data shows.",
      "Economists warn that the U.S. could slip into a recession due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Prior to Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, economists largely gave the U.S. economy a good rating, pointing to its strong growth, low unemployment and progress in bringing inflation under control.",
      "Businesses large and small say the tariffs will cause disruptions, with almost 900 companies in the last 30 days alone citing the barrage of new U.S. levies in their earnings calls. That compares with 100 mentions in December 2024, according to transcripts posted by FactSet. Earlier this month, the CEOs of Walmart and Target\u00a0privately warned Mr. Trump that the tariffs could disrupt supply chains and lead to empty shelves within weeks.",
      "\"Most businesses plan to pass these costs on to their consumers, which will make things more expensive, and we're going to see cuts in consumer spending as a result,\" Vanden Houten of Oxford Economics said, adding that her firm isn't forecasting a recession although it has pared its GDP outlook. \"That's less revenue for businesses.\"",
      "Inflation fears flare",
      "Mr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to end the \"inflation nightmare,\" vowing that if he would bring down prices \"very quickly\" in a second term.",
      "But 100 days into his new administration, consumers are skeptical about Mr. Trump's vow to tackle inflation, with 63% telling CBS News in new polling that they believed his policies would cause grocery prices to go up. Only 15% said they believe his administration will help lower their grocery bills.",
      "Consumers are clearly worried about tariffs, with the same CBS News poll finding that 55% of respondents said Mr. Trump doesn't have a clear plan for tariffs and trade. Americans now expect inflation to rise to 6.5% a year,\u00a0according\u00a0to the University of Michigan's closely watched consumer sentiment index \u2014 a potentially self-fulling outlook that could cause consumers to pull back on spending.",
      "So far, however, inflation data shows that price increases eased to 2.4% in March, down from 2.8% in February. Falling gas prices have come as a relief for motorists, with the national average for a gallon of regular gas now at $3.17, compared with $3.66 a year ago, according to AAA.",
      "Still, many economists forecasts that inflation will pick up later this year as the impact of tariffs works its way through the economy.",
      "The case for tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump maintains that his tariff policies will benefit the U.S. economy over the long term. In his view, the cost of the tariffs will spur both U.S. and foreign businesses to expand in the U.S., spawning jobs for American workers and reinvigorating the U.S. manufacturing sector.",
      "Since Mr. Trump's inauguration, some businesses have said they are investing in domestic manufacturing, with Apple planning a $500 billion expansion of its U.S. facilities over four years and IBM on Monday announcing a $150 billion investment to \"fuel the economy.\"",
      "The president also maintains that tariffs will bring in trillions in new federal revenue , helping to offset an extension of his 2017 tax cuts currently being hammered out by Republican lawmakers. But many economists are skeptical that his tariffs could bring in as much as Mr. Trump claims, as consumers will likely reduce their spending on foreign goods\u00a0when their prices rise.",
      "\"Consumers have to be confident to affect their spending,\" noted Donald Boudreaux, an economist at George Mason University (whose book with Sen. Gramm, \"The Triumph of Economic Freedom: Debunking the Seven Great Myths of American Capitalism,\" will be published next month). \"The current policy is reducing their confidence.\"",
      "For his part, Mr. Trump has acknowledged that the impact of U.S. tariffs will cause \"some pain\" for Americans, while adding in a February social media post that \"IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.\"",
      "Market turmoil",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the Trump administration's economic policies has been clear: The S&P 500 index has lost 10% of its value since reaching a post-inauguration high on February 19, putting the broad-based market into correction territory.",
      "The dollar has lost about 9% of its value since Mr. Trump's inauguration, according to the U.S. dollar index, which compares the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies. Typically, investors rush to the bond market in times of economic uncertainty, but in recent weeks\u00a0bond prices have slid and yields have risen \u2014\u00a0 signs investors are rattled by the impact of Trump administration policies.",
      "\"I would emphasize that this movement in the asset markets is indeed unusual, and it happened particularly after April 2, 'Liberation Day',\" or the day when Mr. Trump announced tariffs on almost every nation on Earth, Boudreaux said. \"It can only be explained by global investor fears of what might happen in the U.S. economy.\"",
      "He added, \"It's too soon to tell how far those fears will go, but the early signs aren't cheery.\"",
      "A boost from tax cuts and deregulation?",
      "To be sure, mounting anxieties among consumers, businesses and investors don't by themselves herald an inevitable economic downturn. And so far, the economy remains resilient, with unemployment near a 50-year low and inflation edging down to 2.4% in March.",
      "Some economists also point to what they view as positives in Mr. Trump's agenda, such as prospects for tax cuts and deregulation, which could spur economic growth. And Mr. Trump has touted his administration's efforts to slash federal spending, overseen by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, as a win for taxpayers.",
      "\"We found hundreds of billions of dollars of waste, fraud and abuse,\" Mr. Trump told Time Magazine in an interview this month.",
      "DOGE, by its account, has cut about $160 billion in costs, or about 2.4% of the federal government's roughly $6.8 trillion in annual spending. But some critics have pointed out that the cuts will ultimately cost taxpayers\u00a0due to rehiring federal workers who were mistakenly fired, lower productivity of remaining workers and through lower tax collections from the IRS, which is reducing its staffing under DOGE's direction.",
      "In the meantime, some observers say the biggest hurdle to Mr. Trump's economic goals is of his own creation.",
      "\"We want Trump to succeed \u2014 in criticizing this trading policy, it's the policy we're criticizing,\" Sen. Gramm said. \"I don't believe the president can achieve what he wants to achieve for America unless his trade policy changes.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 21:15:41 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers say drought, sea level rise, severe storms and dredging are partly to blame for the increased in frequency and swatch of saltwater intrusion.",
    "story": [
      "Communities along the freshwater\u00a0Mississippi River\u00a0are facing a growing threat from an intrusion of saltwater moving the wrong way up the river from the\u00a0Gulf of Mexico. It has wreaked havoc on public drinking water infrastructure for thousands of people, decimated a once-thriving local seafood industry, and has raised concerns about the future safety of New Orleans' drinking water.",
      "\"This is our main water source,\" said Mitch Jurisich, a third-generation oysterman and a local councilman in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana's southernmost parish located an hour's drive outside New Orleans, where he says damage from saltwater is a daily problem.",
      "\"It's wiped out our public oyster grounds east of the river and put a lot of people in poverty,\" Jurisich said.",
      "Jurisich says saltwater intrusion issues used to only happen once a decade, but he says it's occurred the last three summers in a row, and now the parish is gearing up for it to potentially happen again.",
      "As a result of the last three salty summers, Plaquemines Parish's fresh water supply for approximately 23,000 of its residents has been compromised, and even though saltwater levels have been low for in the parish the last few months, Jurisich says the salt has left behind lasting and frustrating damage.",
      "The salt is corroding the parish's water supply pipes, causing them to rust and burst underground \u2014 creating frequent muddy messes for parish workers to fix and reducing water pressure for residents in various neighborhoods across the parish. Jurisich says sometimes it's difficult to even shower, because there's only a slow drip out of the tap.",
      "Another concern is the potential for lead pipes to corrode and leach dangerous lead levels into the water supplies of homes in the parish that have lead pipe connections. It's something Jurisich says the parish continues to monitor.",
      "Fixing broken pipes and building stronger infrastructure to make this tiny parish more resilient to the problem would cost an estimated $200 million dollars, Jurisich says.",
      "The parish has become an unfortunate case study of just how serious the issue of saltwater intrusion can be. Other coastal cities around the world and the U.S. are currently facing the threat of what Plaquemines Parish has been subject to over the last few summers, including most recently in Philadelphia.",
      "Asked what his advice would be to other cities, Jurisich said, \"You're not ready till you get hit, you know, it's just like some people don't worry about a snake until it bites them ... don't wait to get prepared if you're starting to see this trend. They need to start preparing for this.\"",
      "He says Plaquemines Parish has drafted a 10-year upgrade plan to address the saltwater problem, but acquiring grant money to pay for all of the projects has been difficult, especially at a time when the federal government has made significant spending cuts, including a freeze on promised grant money across the country.",
      "\"Power is a luxury. Water is a need,\" Jurisch said.",
      "Various studies from researchers around the world, including experts at the University of Arizona and Tulane University say drought, sea level rise, severe storms and dredging are partly to blame for the increase in frequency and swatch of saltwater intrusion.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers says saltwater intrusion began happening regularly in the 1980s in southern Louisiana about once every decade following a dredging project of the Mississippi River to make the port of New Orleans more accessible to trade ships.",
      "In 2023,\u00a0saltwater in the Mississippi River\u00a0advanced dangerously close to New Orleans, threatening the city's water supply and sending the city into a state of emergency.\u00a0The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u00a0said the saltwater intrusion along with severe drought was \"an unprecedented double water crisis.\"",
      "The Corps of Engineers, which is responsible for managing the river, built an underwater barrier called a \"sill\" that year to stop the saltwater from flowing further north.",
      "\"And that prevents the water from getting up to the water intakes for the major metropolitan areas New Orleans, Saint Bernard,\" Corps of Engineers spokesperson Ricky Boyett said.",
      "However, Boyett says the sill wears down over time, leading the Corps to rebuild the sill in the fall of 2024 to prevent another water scare in New Orleans.",
      "For New Orleans, the threat is serious. In public comments to the federal agency, city leaders stressed how the Big Easy's already fragile, aging drinking water infrastructure would have trouble withstanding the impacts if the 2024 sill were to breach.",
      "Just a week before tens of thousands of Super Bowl visitors flocked to the city for football's biggest night, neighborhoods across downtown New Orleans\u00a0experienced yet another boil water notice\u00a0due to frequent water treatment energy surges and outages.",
      "A spokesperson for the city of New Orleans wrote the following comment in part to the Corps:\u00a0\"There is an urgent need for data collection and model development to develop a risk assessment for drinking water resilience \u2026 we know that this threat will continue in the future and it would be extremely disruptive. We request that you study solutions to protect our municipal water supply including a desalination facility that could serve the greater New Orleans region.\"",
      "With an estimated $9 billion in annual tourist spending that pours into the Big Easy, Louisiana Lt. Governor Billy Nungesser says the city's water and infrastructure must be protected with a more permanent solution.",
      "\"It washes away in six months. We need to build land ridges and islands out there and give the coast a chance to survive, because we know these hurricanes are getting worse every year,\" Nungesser said.",
      "Nungesser added that if saltwater levels were to hit New Orleans as high as they have hit Plaquemines Parish, \"it would be a catastrophe, it would shut down the city.\"",
      "Another issue with the sill, Nungesser said, is that it's located higher up the river, where the river is narrower, thus leaving Plaquemines Parish vulnerable and exposed to saltwater whenever the intrusion occurs.",
      "That's why Boyett says the Corps helped provide special reverse osmosis water filtration systems for Plaquemines Parish's water supply.",
      "Jurisich says because the filtration systems are remarkably expensive, his community desperately needs money to pay for long-term infrastructure upgrades.",
      "\"It's very costly, very expensive, and also high maintenance. You have to have specialized people ready to clean the filters and be on hand when something may not be working properly,\" Jurisich said.",
      "But Nungesser argues a better option is to strengthen the Mississippi River's flow by filling crevasses along the river's edge that have widened over the years. He says state and local officials have been pushing the Corps to do that for more than decade.",
      "Just this month, the Corps announced it plans to fill one of the crevasses, because they have found that it has grown so large that it started pulling trade ships as they head towards the port of New Orleans.",
      "When asked what was the turning point for the Corps to take action, Boyett said: \"We looked at it as soon as it started impacting navigation, that's where our authority comes in.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Boyett explained more about the proposal, which is set to start construction this summer: \"in short, we will return (Neptune Pass) to the flow of 2018, before it began rapidly expanding in 2019.",
      "A satellite image\u00a0comparison of Neptune Pass by NASA showed how the it had widened overtime between 2019 and 2023.",
      "With 40 million metric tons of exports from New Orleans traveling down the Mississippi River each year, Boyett says the region is the largest shipping channel in the U.S., which requires a careful balance of addressing the saltwater threat and drinking water needs, while also ensuring the river is accessible to ships.",
      "That's why Boyett says the Corps is investing $20 million on a five-year study that has three years to go to analyze the entire Mississippi River from top to bottom. One significant section of the Lower Mississippi River Comprehensive Management Study will examine the best long-term solutions to the saltwater intrusion phenomenon.",
      "\"Today, we are evaluating the large suite of alternatives to determine which to carry forward in the study or which may need their own study to determine feasibility,\" Boyett said.",
      "But Lt. Governor Nungesser says southern Louisiana doesn't have time to wait for researchers to finish the study.",
      "\"People ought to be outraged,\" Nungesser said of the corps' response thus far.",
      "Byron Marinovich, the owner of Black Velvet Oyster Bar & Grill, a local restaurant in Plaquemines Parish, said he won't be waiting around. He says the salt has corroded his restaurant appliances, killed his plants, and led to rips his clothing, among other issues.",
      "\"We're looking to move,\" Marinovich said. \"Not having clean water is really like at the top of the list.\"",
      "Marinovich said he recently had to buy a new ice machine for a third time in 15 years, with the latest one costing him about $5,600.",
      "But unlike the restaurateur, Jurisch said he's staying put.",

    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 17:26:58 -0400",
    "summary": "Although attending college still offers a payoff, a recent study by New York Fed economists suggests it might not make financial sense for some people.",
    "story": [
      "Getting a college education has traditionally been seen as a way to move up the economic ladder. But an analysis by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that the cost of a degree may not always be worth it.",
      "The value of a college education has increasingly come into question in recent years, especially as tuition costs steadily climb and millions of Americans grapple with student loans. As a result, only one in four U.S. adults say it's extremely or very important to have a four-year college degree to get a well-paying job, according to a 2024\u00a0Pew Research poll.",
      "To be sure, the case for attending college remains strong. Another study by the New York Fed\u00a0found\u00a0that in recent years the typical college graduate with a bachelor's degree had annual income of roughly $80,000, versus $47,000 for people with only a high school diploma \u2014a 68% premium.",
      "Yet a recent study by the Fed bank suggests a college degree hasn't paid off for at least 25% of college graduates in recent decades.",
      "Of course, not everyone goes to college chiefly to earn a high income \u2014 education can be its own reward, after all. But how you\u00a0 navigate your college career \u2014 or whether you choose to attend at all \u2014 is among the most important financial decisions a person will make.",
      "Here's when a diploma may not deliver much of a bang for the buck.",
      "When might a college degree not be worth it?",
      "Not surprisingly, the more a student must spend on out-of-pocket expenses, the lower their typical return on investment. The average college student pays about $30,000 out of pocket for four years of college, according to the New York Fed study. However, students could face significantly higher costs if they choose to live on campus, or if they miss out on financial aid and are forced to pay a school's full price.",
      "The typical college graduate sees a return on investment (ROI) of roughly 12.5% according to the New York Fed. That rate has remained mostly unchanged over the past three decades, and still exceeds the returns on most other investments, including the stock market, which over time offers long-term return of about 8%.",
      "Despite that payoff, certain factors can lower a college grad's ROI. For example, the researchers found that living on campus increased the price tag for college by nearly $30,000 \u2013 from $180,000 to $207,000 \u2013 reducing the return on investment to about 11%. The 1.5% drop in ROI may seem nominal, but it can translate to hundreds of thousands in lost dollars.",
      "\"This extra cost and the associated return are comparable to attending a more expensive school that is roughly twice the average price,\" the researchers, economists\u00a0Jaison Abel and\u00a0Richard Deitz, said in the study.",
      "Among college graduates, 25% actually see little return on investment. This group was making less than $10,000 more in income than the median high school graduate in 2024. Their rate of return was only 2.6% compared to the average of 12.5% \u2014 meaning they see much less of a payoff.",
      "Another factor that can reduce the value of a college degree is how long it takes to obtain. The typical bachelor's program runs for four years, but in some cases students might extend the timeline if they haven't completed their course load. That can have major financial implications.",
      "Taking an extra one to two years to get your degree adds \"considerably to the cost,\" the New York Fed\u00a0found. There's the direct cost students have to pay for the additional tuition, but also higher \"opportunity costs\" \u2014 for example, a student who starts their career later misses out on years of working experience and can end up earning less over their lifetime.",
      "\"All in all, we estimate that taking five years to complete college pushes the median rate of return down to about 9% and taking six years pushes it down to 7%,\" the researchers found.",
      "Graduating in five years, rather than four, pushes up the total cost of college from $180,000 to $272,000, while taking six years would cost $364,000.",
      "How much does a student's major matter?",
      "Another important consideration in deciding if going to college is a sound investment is a student's major. After all, certain fields tend to lead to higher incomes.",
      "So-called STEM majors tend to earn the most, both in the early and mid-stages off their career, according to New York Fed\u00a0data. For instance, a computer engineering major stands to make a median wage of $122,000 mid-career, versus $55,000 for an education major, according to the bank's data.",
      "Among the fields of study with the highest returns are engineering, business and health sciences. The return is lowest for those majoring in fine arts, liberal arts, leisure, and hospitality and education, which ranked last.",
      "\"While some of it may come down to choices people make for the jobs they wish to have, one significant consideration is college major, something over which students have direct control,\" Abel and Dietz wrote.",

    "summary": "Fifty years ago, as the North Vietnamese army closed in on Saigon, U.S. forces, personnel and South Vietnamese civilians struggled to evacuate to American ships offshore. \"Sunday Morning\" talks with military personnel who were there.",
    "story": [
      "At the end of the Vietnam War, South Vietnamese soldiers swarmed a Pan Am airliner to save themselves from the rapidly-advancing North Vietnamese army. CBS News correspondent Bruce Dunning, who was on board, reported: \"They left their wives, their children, their aged parents on the runway, while they forced their own way on board, a rabble of young enlisted men. \u2026 The plane raced down the taxiway, swerving to avoid abandoned vehicles, perhaps even running over people.\"",
      "This every-man-for-himself rout played out across South Vietnam as communist forces from the north launched their final offensive.",
      "\"The question was not, 'Will they attack at some point,' but 'When will they do it'?\" said Stuart Herrington, now 83, who was one of only a handful of American military personnel still left in Vietnam. \"The map in my office began to show more and more red arrows, all pointing south.\"",
      "President Gerald R. Ford called South Vietnam's collapse \"a great human tragedy,\" and ordered the immediate airlift of Vietnamese orphans \u2013 some mere babies who'd been born only weeks earlier.",
      "CBS News correspondent Murray Fromson witnessed what happened next, when the plane carrying the children crashed into a field about five miles from the end of the runway, killing 78 orphans and 35 Americans were killed. \"What can one say except, 'When will the misery in this country ever stop?'\" Fromson said.",
      "With Vietnam rapidly approaching what Secretary of State Henry Kissinger called \"the worst case,\" he cabled American Ambassador Graham Martin: \"We must evacuate our people and do so as soon as possible.\"",
      "Americans and Vietnamese flooded Tan Son Nhut   Airport outside Saigon. But enemy shelling killed two Marines standing guard there \u2013 Darwin Judge and Charles MacMahon, the last Americans to die in Vietnam.",
      "Retired Marine Gerry Berry was a helicopter pilot aboard the armada of American ships off the coast. \"The North Vietnamese bombed and rocketed the runway at Tan Son Nhut, so the runway became unusable,\" he said. \"Helicopters were the last resort, and at 10:45 on the morning of 29 April 1975, Ambassador Graham Martin gave the order to commence Operation Frequent Wind, which became the largest helicopter evacuation in history.\"",
      "Frantic to find a way out, civilians mobbed the U.S. Embassy. \"The last place, the last hope, the last refuge where you could go and maybe still get a helicopter,\" said Herrington.",
      "Jerome Thomas was a Marine guard at the embassy: \"There were women at the gate just saying, 'Please, just take my baby, take my baby.' And we had to tell them, 'We cannot take your baby.' There were people that were getting crushed because of the crowd in the back were pushing.\"",
      "Berry said, \"The crowd inside the embassy grounds is just huge, and it's never getting any smaller. You don't know how this thing is working, how it's going to end.\"",
      "Berry landed his helicopter in the Embassy's parking lot: \"I actually landed at the embassy about one o'clock and said, 'My orders are to pick up the ambassador.' The Marine security guard runs into the embassy, comes back and says, 'Well, the ambassador's not ready to go.'\"",
      "Instead, Berry and 70 other helicopter crews began lifting out Americans and Vietnamese.",
      "As darkness fell, Thomas, a 19-year-old Marine, was ordered to lower the American flag: \"This was the last time the American flag was going to fly over Vietnam,\" he said. \"Heartbreaking.\"",
      "America's war in Vietnam was now in its final hours.",
      "About four o'clock in the morning, Berry says, he could see North Vietnamese tanks coming down the road, \"because their lights are on. They're driving down the highway.\"",
      "Herrington said, \"Everybody was afraid. The North Vietnamese Army was advancing on Saigon.\"",
      "With the last helicopters going out, Airborne Commander radioed for crews to \"max it out.\"",
      "Herrington told the crowd in the embassy parking lot, \"'Get into a double line. Everybody's going to go. Nobody will be left behind.' I repeated that over and over and over, that everyone was going to go, and I really believed it.\"",
      "There were 420 Vietnamese still in the parking lot when new orders came in: \"All U.S. must come out now.\"",
      "Herrington had promised \"Nobody left behind,\" but orders were orders. \"I said to the Vietnamese, 'I gotta take a leak,' and I walked into the door of the embassy, and scooted up the stairs,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"What did it feel like, telling that lie?\"",
      "\"I felt horrible,\" Herrington replied. \"I felt like I had given them my word, that our country had given them our country's word, and it all went to crap.\"",
      "Berry recalled, \"I land on the embassy roof at 4:56 in the morning on 30 April 1975. And I called the Marine security guard over and I said, 'You go tell the ambassador this helicopter's not leaving the roof until he's on board.' And then in my best aviator voice I said: 'The president sends.'\"",
      "\"Order from the President? Did you have authority?\" I asked.",
      "\"I have no authority to do that at all,\" Berry replied. \"But I mean, there's got to be an end here. Two minutes later, his whole entourage are up, ready to go.\"",
      "Ambassador Martin brought the American flag with him. Flying out, Berry radioed the call sign: \"'Tiger, Tiger, Tiger,' which means the ambassador's out, so everybody knows.\"",
      "It was late afternoon in Washington when Henry Kissinger announced the news: \"Our ambassador has left, and the evacuation can be said to be completed.\"",
      "Except it wasn't. In 1996, Kissinger recalled during an off-the-record talk to the Army War College, \"I come back from the press conference, and I find out that they had left the Marines behind that were guarding the embassy.\"",
      "The last American fighting men in Vietnam were barricaded on the roof as Saigon was about to fall.",
      "Their sergeant, Juan Valdez, is 87 now, and living in a memory care unit \u2013 but some things you don't forget. \"It's been so many years now,\" he said. \"We thought for sure that we were going to be left there. You kind of swallow hard, you know, because by that time the tanks were passing by from the Vietnamese.\"",
      "Doug Potratz, who was on the roof with Valdez, said, \"It felt like the Alamo for a while. We didn't know if we were going to be the last people and be overrun.\"",
      "Thomas said, \"The question that was going through everybody's mind was, should we fight or should we surrender? And everybody there, to a man, was like, we're fighting, you know, because Marines never surrender.\"",
      "Portratz said, \"It was the lowest point, I think, in my life. We're thinking about all the people that have died, literally thousands and thousands of Americans, and it was all gone.\"",
      "\"We were there for two, two-and-a-half, maybe three hours waiting,\" said Valdez, \"and then all of a sudden at a distance we saw two choppers coming back.\"",
      "Two helicopters went back for the Marines. The first one picked up 22, and the second the final 11. The radio communication from the Airborne Commander said: \"11 pax on board including the commander. All the Americans are out. That is it.\"",
      "A blurry picture captured the moment.",
      "\"I was the last one to go aboard,\" said Valdez. \"Because I was in charge of them, and whether I stayed behind, so be it, you know, but you always take care of your men first.\"",

      "George Santos gets maximum sentence in federal fraud trial",
      "Federal prosecutors say the former congressman exaggerated or fabricated large parts of his backstory to defraud voters and donors in New York's 3rd Congressional District. He faced nearly a dozen criminal charges before\u00a0pleading guilty to two counts last August.",
      "U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York John Durham spoke to reporters after the sentencing and called Santos' crimes an \"affront to our electoral process, our representative government and the people of New York's 3rd Congressional District.\"",
      "\"But today, finally, Santos has been held accountable for his years of fraud, deceit and theft. He's going to federal prison and he's going to be punished for his staggering fraud, for the abuses he put on our electoral process, for mocking our democratic institutions and, most importantly, for betraying and defrauding his supporters, his voters, his donors, federal agencies, state agencies,\" Durham said outside the courthouse. \"Today's sentence demonstrates that this egregious conduct will not, and never will be, tolerated.\"",
      "\"Come July 25th, George Santos will finally be where he belongs \u2013 behind bars, answering for these crimes,\" Nassau District Attorney Anne Donnelly said.",
      "Santos later posted a lengthy statement on X, which read in part, \"I believe that 7 years is an over the top politically influenced sentence and I implore that President Trump gives me a chance to prove I'm more than the mistakes I've made. Respectfully, George Santos.\"",
      "CBS News reached Santos by phone as he was driving to court Friday morning, and he said he was resigned to the fact the judge could impose a stiff sentence. He said he had no expectations about the judge's decision or when he would have to report to prison.",
      "Santos previously said he would not beg for a pardon.",
      "Judge asks Santos, \"Where is your remorse?\"",
      "The 36-year-old walked into the courthouse through a crush of reporters and photographers. He was seen hugging supporters and looking very somber, with bloodshot eyes, as he went inside.",
      "At sentencing, the federal judge said, \"Where is your remorse? It's always someone else's fault.\"",
      "Santos read a statement to the judge, saying through tears he was humbled and that he shattered the faith of many people. He offered his deepest apologies and admitted that he betrayed his supporters and the institutions he was sworn to serve. He went on to say he cannot rewrite the past but he asked for a balanced sentence, adding he can contribute to the community he wronged.",
      "Outside the courthourse, a crowd of his former constituents gathered with signs that read \"Truth Matters\" and \"We Refuse to Be Deceived Again.\"",
      "\"My reaction in sitting in the courtroom was 'cry me a river,'\" said Jody Kass Finkel, with Concerned Citizens of NY-03.",
      "A few fans were in the courtroom, as well.",
      "\"Donald Trump will commute his sentence, and he should. And he should,\" Santos supporter David Rem said.",
      "Santos asked for leniency ahead of sentencing",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice wanted Santos to serve 87 months in prison, while his lawyers sought just 24 months.",
      "In a recent filing, the DOJ said he remains \"unrepentant for his crimes\" and pointed to various social media posts it said are \"hardly an expression of 'genuine remorse.'\"",
      "Santos wrote to the judge earlier this week asking for leniency and saying he accepts responsibility.",
      "\"This case has cost me my congressional seat, my reputation, my livelihood, and, most painful of all, the confidence of people who believed in me. Every sunrise since that plea has carried the same realization: I did this, me. I am responsible,\" Santos wrote. \"But saying I'm sorry doesn't require me to sit quietly while these prosecutors try to drop an anvil on my head.\"",
      "He previously told his followers he plans to request solitary confinement in prison.",

      "Santos helped Republicans secure the House of Representatives in the 2022 midterm elections, representing New York's 3rd Congressional District\u00a0which covers parts of Queens and Nassau County.",
      "Before he was even sworn into office, his lies started to untangle.",
      "Federal investigators filed\u00a0the first charges against Santos in May 2023, followed by\u00a0additional charges that October. The House Ethics Committee released a scathing 56-page report the next month, detailing the scope of his misconduct.",
      "Santos was\u00a0ousted from Congress weeks later, becoming just\u00a0the sixth House member to be expelled\u00a0in U.S. history.",
      "What did George Santos do?",
      "In a\u00a0sentencing memo filed earlier this month, prosecutors said he \"made a mockery of our election system,\" adding he didn't just pad his resume, he used \"a wholly fictitious biography to enrich himself and capture one of the highest offices.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Santos presented false financial disclosures to congress claiming he was a multi-millionaire and solicited a vendor to forge a Baruch College diploma.",
      "In the sentencing memo, they wrote these were \"intentional and bald-faced lies\" of a \"professional fraudster\" -- \"a fictitious public image of a highly educated, independently wealthy businessman.\"",
      "\"He admitted to engaging in a brazen crime spree that took place over a period of years. He stole personal identities and financial information from campaign contributors, made unauthorized transfers of money to his campaign and to himself personally,\" Durham said Friday. \"He defrauded prospective political supporters by convincing them to make campaign contributions based on false statements, and then took the money for himself.",
      "\"He lied to receive unemployment benefits when he was not entitled to them because he had a job. He lied to the Federal Election Commission about the amount of money his campaign had brought in, and he used that to trick the National Republican Congressional Committee into giving his campaign money it was not entitled to,\" Durham continued. \"And he lied to congress on his financial disclosure forms.\"",
      "The sentencing memo outlined fake donations in the names of relatives, a credit card fraud scheme that stole from elderly and cognitively impaired donors to buy designer goods, and another that created a fake nonprofit to solicit donations.",
      "It also said Santos claimed he loaned his campaign $500,000 when he had less than $10,000 to his name, and that he collected unemployment benefits while working for a firm that was later exposed as a Ponzi scheme.",
      "\"From the moment he declared his candidacy for congress, Santos leveraged his campaign for his own enrichment and financial benefit,\" said Durham. \"He did this by targeting specific supporters and constituents. He saw them as easy marks and he made them victims of his fraud.\"",
      "\"It wasn't a mistake. It wasn't an oops. It wasn't 'I don't know what I'm doing.' It's very clear when you steal money from UI,\" said Roberta Reardon, commissioner of the New York State Department of Labor.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:05:28 -0400",
    "summary": "Spain's prime minister said a special commission will track down the cause of a massive power outage and all \"necessary measures will be taken\" to stop it from recurring.",
    "story": [
      "Spain's government has set up a special commission to figure out what caused the massive power outage that hit virtually the entire country, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announced Tuesday, stressing that no potential causes had been ruled out. He also joined the wider European Union in vowing that everything necessary would be done to prevent a recurrence of the electricity grid failure, which ground most of the Iberian Peninsula \u2014 composed of Spain and neighboring Portugal \u2014   to a halt and left people in the dark until Tuesday morning.",
      "\"All the necessary measures will be taken to ensure that this does not happen again,\" S\u00e1nchez said during a news conference in Madrid, just hours after the lights came back on.",
      "Monday's still-unexplained power outage was the most severe ever to hit Spain and Portugal, which have a combined population of around 60 million people. According to The Associated Press, Spain's roughly 49 million inhabitants saw their country's power generation drop by around 15 gigawatts \u2014   roughly 60% of the typical real-time demand in the nation \u2014 in the space of just five seconds, starting just after noon local time on Monday.",
      "Spanish power distributor Red El\u00e9ctrica said early Tuesday that about 99% of its power capacity had been restored, after many residents of both Spain's capital Madrid and Lisbon in neighboring Portugal went to sleep in total darkness.",
      "Offices across the Iberian Peninsula were closed and traffic was left in chaos on Monday. Airports, along with trains and subway systems, ground to a halt, ATMs ceased to function, and many mobile phone networks went down. Gas-powered generators and battery-powered radios flew off shelves.",
      "What caused the power outage in Spain and Portugal?",
      "S\u00e1nchez had said Monday that a problem in the wider European grid, which he called a \"strong oscillation,\" had been behind the outage, but that was never confirmed or expounded upon by the Spanish leader or the country's electricity providers, and officials subsequently asked people to refrain from speculation, stressing that nothing had been ruled out. On Tuesday, S\u00e1nchez did rule out one possible issue, saying there had been no lack of nuclear power generation capacity on Monday. About 20% of Spain's power comes from its nuclear plants.",
      "REN, Portugal's national electricity grid operator, said Monday there had been a rare atmospheric phenomenon in Spain, which it pinned on extreme temperature variations, but that explanation was also never confirmed, and on Tuesday, Spain's meteorological agency said it had not detected any \"unusual meteorological or atmospheric phenomena\" or unexpectedly dramatic temperature fluctuations the previous day.",
      "Eduardo Prieto, who's in charge of operations for Spain's Red El\u00e9ctrica, said Monday that while the cause remained unclear, the power outage was unprecedented, \"exceptional and extraordinary.\"",
      "The company had said Monday that there was no indication of a cyberattack causing the outage, but S\u00e1nchez said the following day that a separate investigation would continue looking at the possibility.",
      "Antonio Costa, president of the EU's European Council, said Tuesday that there were \"no indications of any cyberattack.\" His colleague Teresa Ribera, one of the executive vice presidents of the European Commission, also seemed to rule out sabotage, but she called the blackout \"one of the most serious episodes recorded in Europe in recent times.\"",
      "The power outage was the second to hit Europe in just over a month. London's Heathrow Airport, one of Europe's busiest hubs, was shut down for most of March 20 after a local electricity substation went up in flames. The cause of that fire remains under investigation, but London's Metropolitan Police said it did not appear suspicious.",
      "While no officials have suggested that either the fire in London or the blackout on the Iberian Peninsula were the result of nefarious activity, they both came amid heightened concern over Russian sabotage operations targeting Western European nations that support Ukraine.",
      "A source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News in early November that U.S. and European law enforcement agencies were working together to investigate whether incendiary devices that detonated in July 2024 at DHL logistics hubs in Germany and Britain were part of a larger\u00a0operation directed by Russian military intelligence\u00a0agencies, senior officials in Russia's government, or by outside individuals acting in Russia's perceived interest.",
      "There have also been numerous incidents of undersea cables, mostly carrying power or telecommunications data, being severed or disrupted in recent years, often after Russian or Chinese-linked vessels were in the area.",
      "European officials have said such alleged sabotage actions are part of a Russian \"hybrid war\" against Ukraine's backers and its democratic adversaries in the West.",
      "Jovita Neliup\u0161ien\u0117, the European Union's ambassador to the United States, told CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" in November that Russian sabotage, along with the assassination of political foes not only in Russia, but on European soil, was part of President Vladimir Putin's bid to challenge \"the order, the stability of Europe, and actually testing\" the continent's will and capacity to respond to such operations.",
      "\"All those sabotage, cyber, or attacks on critical infrastructure is actually happening on EU and NATO territory. They are testing how much they ... can move.\"",

    "summary": "Canadian Prime Minster Mark Carney's Liberal Party will retain its hold on power, in a reversal of fortunes seen largely as a reaction to Mr. Trump's actions and rhetoric.",
    "story": [
      "Canada's Liberal Party won Monday's federal election, marking a sharp political turnaround seemingly powered largely by the territorial threats and tariff tactics of President Trump.",
      "Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberals were projected to win more of the Canadian Parliament's 343 seats than the rival Conservatives. It wasn't immediately clear if the Liberals would claim an outright majority of at least 172 seats, or if they'd be forced to rely on lawmakers from a smaller party or parties to get new legislation passed.",
      "Canadians decided with Monday's vote to grant the Liberal Party a fourth term in power, now with Carney at the helm, rather than to transfer control to the Conservatives and their populist leader Pierre Poilievre, who only months earlier had been projected to win the election decisively.",
      "The Liberal Party's popularity had been declining for years, eventually leading to former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation in March, and the Conservatives appeared poised to take control of the federal government \u2014 until Mr. Trump stepped in.",
      "The American president's repeated\u00a0threats to annex Canada and his sweeping tariffs, which have undermined Canada's economy, dominated the campaign and influenced voters' choices. Domestic issues including affordability, immigration, jobs and crime remained significant factors.",
      "\"As I have been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country. Never,\" declared Carney in a victory speech on Monday evening. \"These are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.\"",
      "Calling it a \"hinge moment\" in history, Carney said Canada's \"old relationship with the United States \u2014 a relationship based on steadily increasing integration \u2014 is over. The system of open global trade, anchored by the United States, a system that Canada has relied on since the Second World War, a system that, while not perfect, has helped deliver prosperity for our country for decades, is over. These are tragedies, but it's also our new reality... We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons. We have to look out for ourselves and, above all, we have to take care of each other.\"",
      "Poilievre, a seasoned politician for the Conservatives, lost his parliamentary seat in Ottawa, casting doubt on his continued leadership of the party. Monday's election marked a significant turn of events for the leader, who was first elected to the parliament in 2004.",
      "Despite the blow, Poilievre vowed to remain in his position as party leader, and he pledged in a speech Monday night to keep fighting for change.",
      "\"Every single day, our conservative caucus and I will be holding the government to account on behalf of millions of Canadians who believed in the message of change,\" Poilievre told his party's supporters.",
      "According to Elections Canada, a record number of Canadians \u2014 an estimated 7.3 million \u2014  cast their votes in advance, a 25% increase compared to the 2021 elections.",
      "A diverse group of voters gathered Monday inside a school gym in Milton City, Ontario, to cast their ballots. While they were divided on who would be best to deal with Mr. Trump, they all agreed that Canada's sovereignty, tariffs and the affordability of everyday goods were the main issues on their minds as they cast their votes.",
      "\"Trump's decisions are affecting not just Canada but the rest of the world,\" a couple who voted for the Liberals told CBS News outside a polling station. \"The tariffs affected the market; it affected prices of all goods, food, anything.\"",
      "Opponents cast the Conservatives' leader Poilievre as having similarities with Mr. Trump, which may have ended up costing him on election day.",
      "\"A couple of things that, unfortunately, Pierre has come out with which we didn't agree with,\" the couple in Milton City, who wished to remain anonymous, told CBS News. \"Might sound silly, but the fact he wants to bring back plastic bags and straws \u2014 I didn't like that idea.\"",
      "One voter named Peter said he considered the issue of Canadian sovereignty while casting his vote. Although he did not specify which party he believed could best address concerns over Mr. Trump's threats to make Canada a \"51st state,\" he stressed the need for Canadian unity.",
      "John Ivsky, a self-employed businessman from Milton, said he considered the election crucial, emphasizing the issue of tariffs. He said Canada should seek more and different global partners.",
      "\"Canada needs to build its own economy and broader partnerships,\" Ivsky told CBS News. \"America shouldn't be the only economic, military, or political partner. We need partners all over the world, so we don't suffer from one political change in one country.\"",
      "\"I respect and vote for every party that can support family values, conservative values, freedom of speech, and I vote for the one that can reflect my beliefs, whether that's Liberal or Conservative,\" said Ivsky. \"At this point, Conservatives are the ones that can do that.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump once again injected himself into the election campaign. In a post on Truth Social, he repeated his idea of making Canada the 51st U.S. state and called on Canadian voters to vote for the person who could make that possible \u2014 without naming either political party.",
      "\"Good luck to the Great people of Canada. Elect the man who has the strength and wisdom to cut your taxes in half, increase your military power, for free, to the highest level in the World, have your Car, Steel, Aluminum, Lumber, Energy, and all other businesses, QUADRUPLE in size,\u00a0 WITH ZERO TARIFFS OR TAXES, if Canada becomes the cherished 51st State of the United States of America,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "In response to his remarks, Poilievre said Canada would never become the 51st state, and he urged the American president to stay out of Canadian elections.",
      "\"President Trump, stay out of our election. The only people who will decide the future of Canada are Canadians at the ballot box,\" Poilievre said in French in a social media\u00a0post. \"Canada will always be proud, sovereign and independent and we will NEVER be the 51st State. Today Canadians can vote for change so we can strengthen our country, stand on our own two feet and stand up to America from a position of strength.\"",
      "In his campaign, Carney pleaded with voters to deliver him a strong mandate to deal with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"President Trump has some obsessive ideas, and that is one,\" Carney said of the annexation threats. \"It's not a joke. It's his very strong desire to make this happen. It's one of the reasons why this crisis is so serious.\"",

      "Ahead of the conclave, on May 5, Vatican officials and employees who will help support the process, including other clergy, security personnel, drivers, cleaning crews, doctors and nurses, must take an oath of secrecy.",
      "How does the papal conclave work?",
      "How this assembly proceeds to choose the next pope is a process that dates back hundreds of years \u2014 an intricate, choreographed procession of rituals and ballots.",
      "On the first day of the papal conclave, the cardinal electors will shut themselves off from the outside world and begin the momentous task of choosing \u2014 likely from among their own ranks \u2014 the man who will become the 267th Bishop of Rome, better known as the pope.",
      "On Day One, the cardinals celebrate a morning Mass in St. Peter's Basilica. In the afternoon, they walk in a solemn procession into the Sistine Chapel, which will have undergone a security sweep to check for any illicit recording devices before their arrival.",
      "For centuries, the cardinal electors were physically locked inside the Sistine Chapel until they elected a new pontiff, left to eat and sleep beneath Michelangelo's vivid Renaissance masterpiece. These days, they do leave to rest and share meals at Santa Marta House \u2014 a hotel-like residence inside Vatican City where Francis had his own personal apartment during his pontificate \u2014 for however many days it takes them to come to a decision.",
      "Once the cardinals have all filed into the chapel, its great bronze doors are dramatically closed and sealed, and the first day's voting begins.",
      "How does the voting for a new pope work?",
      "The cardinals will have already discussed the merits of each papal prospect during days of \"general congregations\" at the Vatican before the conclave, but now the voting begins. Choosing the new pope requires not just a majority, but a two-thirds plus-one vote among the cardinal electors for a candidate to win. Pope Benedict XVI, who led the church prior to Francis, raised the threshold and enshrined the two-thirds requirement into church law two days before he stepped down.",
      "Each cardinal must swear an oath of absolute secrecy before they vote. If they disclose any information from within the conclave they will be excommunicated by the church.",
      "To vote, each cardinal writes their chosen candidate's name on a ballot, disguising his handwriting, then walks to an altar at the front of the chapel and deposits the paper onto a ceremonial plate. He then tips the ballot from the plate into a chalice-urn.",
      "As they are counted and the handwritten entries recorded by three cardinals at the altar, known as scrutineers, the ballots are deposited into another urn.",
      "A third urn, made of gilded bronze and silver and adorned with Christian imagery, is used to ferry ballots from any cardinals too ill to leave their sleeping quarters to the chapel for counting.",
      "After the first vote is held on the first afternoon, the cardinals' ballots are placed into one of two small ovens inside the Sistine Chapel and burned. A plume of smoke flows up a chimney and into the air over St. Peter's Square, watched for eagerly by the faithful, and the world's media.",
      "If that round of voting yields no winner, the smoke will be black \u2014 a sign to the world that the Holy See remains vacant.",
      "How long can a conclave last?",
      "The voting process will repeat itself the following day, with the cardinals holding two ballots in the morning and two in the afternoon. If the morning sessions are inconclusive, black smoke will be seen again around lunchtime \u2014 early morning on the U.S. East Coast.",
      "If there's still no winner following the afternoon votes, more black smoke will stream into the early evening Roman sky.",
      "If there's no two-thirds majority after three days, voting is paused for a day to allow time for prayer, discussion and a \"brief spiritual exhortation\" by the senior cardinal in the Order of Deacons.",
      "Then the voting process resumes. A conclave will last until enough of the cardinal electors agree on a choice for the next pope.",
      "How long has it taken to choose a new pope in the past?",
      "The longest conclave in history was the one that brought Pope Gregory X to the papacy in 1281. It lasted almost three years from the time the cardinals first began their voting.",
      "Recent conclaves, however, have lasted just days. Pope John Paul II needed eight ballots, over two days, to become the pontiff in 1978. His successor, Benedict XVI, was chosen on the fourth ballot, after two days, in 2005.",
      "Francis, in 2013, needed a mere five ballots, with the voting taking just 24 hours.",
      "What will happen once the conclave chooses the next pope?",
      "When enough cardinals agree on a candidate and the vote reaches the two-thirds-plus-one threshold, the chosen man is asked if he accepts the role. He will acknowledge by simply saying the word for \"I accept\" in Latin: \"Accepto.\"",
      "At that point, he becomes the new pope and will state his chosen pontifical name before the assembled cardinals. The most common papal name has been John, used 21 times. Others, including Simplicius, Hilarius and Zosimus, have only ever been used once. Pope Francis was also the first to choose his papal name.",
      "The ballots are then burned in the stove, but this time, a chemical additive is left out to create the much-anticipated plume of \"fumata bianca,\" white smoke.",
      "There has been confusion during some past conclaves over the color of the smoke rising over the chapel, so two conclaves ago, in 2005, a new tradition began. In addition to the white smoke, bells now chime, heralding the news that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.",
      "The new pope then immediately goes into a chamber adjoining the Sistine Chapel to be clad in the papal robes.",
      "As the faithful and the curious crowd into St. Peter's Square below, the cardinal deacon steps out onto the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica to introduce the new pontiff with the famous phrase, \"Habemus papa\" \u2014 We have a pope.",
      "Finally, the new leader of the Catholic Church emerges into the spotlight to deliver his first blessing.",

    "summary": "A Jewish prisoner at the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau secretly penned a short note and hid it inside a violin he had crafted under harrowing circumstances.",
    "story": [
      "During World War II, within the walls of the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau, a Jewish prisoner secretly penned a short note and hid it inside a violin he had crafted under harrowing circumstances \u2014 a message to the future that would remain undiscovered for more than 80 years.",
      "\"Trial instrument, made under difficult conditions with no tools and materials,\" the worn note read. \"Dachau. Anno 1941, Franciszek Kempa.\"",
      "The origins of the violin, built in 1941 by Franciszek \"Franz\" Kempa while imprisoned by the Nazis at Dachau in southern Germany, remained unnoticed for decades. It wasn't until art dealers in Hungary sent the instrument out for repairs \u2014 after having stored it for years among a set of purchased furniture \u2014 that its history came to light.",
      "Although the instrument's craftsmanship pointed clearly to a skilled maker, the professional repairing it was puzzled by the poor quality of the wood and the crude tools used to create it, which didn't match the evident skill involved.",
      "\"If you look at its proportions and structure, you can see that it's a master violin, made by a man who was proficient in his craft,\" said Szandra Katona, one of the Hungarian art dealers who discovered the origins of the violin. \"But the choice of wood was completely incomprehensible.\"",
      "Motivated by the contradiction, the professional disassembled the violin, revealing Kempa's hidden note - an apparent explanation, even an apology, from a master violin maker forced by the brutal limitations of his captivity to build an instrument that fell short of his own standards.",
      "Dachau, located near Munich, was the first concentration camp established by the Nazis in March 1933. It initially housed political prisoners but later became a model for other camps, imprisoning Jews, Roma, clergy, homosexuals, and others targeted by the Nazi regime.",
      "Over time, it became a site of forced labor, medical experiments, and brutal punishment, and remained in operation until it was liberated by American forces on April 29, 1945. At least 40,000 people are believed to have died there due to starvation, disease, execution, or mistreatment.",
      "There is ample evidence that musical instruments were present in concentration camps across Central and Eastern Europe during World War II. For propaganda purposes, the Nazis often permitted or even encouraged the formation of musical groups to give a false impression to the outside world about life in the camps.",
      "However, all known instruments that survived Dachau are believed to have been brought in by prisoners. Kempa's \"violin of hope,\" as it has come to be called, is the only known instrument actually built inside the camp.",
      "It is unknown how the violin left Dachau and ultimately made its way to Hungary. But Kempa, according to documents provided to the Hungarian art dealers by the museum at the Dachau memorial site, survived the war and returned to his native Poland to continue making instruments before dying in 1953.",
      "The documents also suggest that Kempa was known to the Nazis as an instrument maker - something Tam\u00e1s T\u00e1losi, one of the art dealers, believes may have spared him the fate of millions of others that perished in the camps.",
      "\"We named it the 'violin of hope' because if someone ends up in a difficult situation, having a task or a challenge helps them get through a lot of things,\" T\u00e1losi said. \"You focus not on the problem, but on the task itself, and I think this helped the maker of this instrument to survive the concentration camp.\"",

    "story": [
      "A massive, unprecedented power outage\u00a0hit large parts of Spain as well as Portugal\u00a0on Monday. The blackout halted subway and railway trains, cut phone service and shut down traffic lights and ATMs for the millions of people who live across Europe's Iberian Peninsula.",
      "Spanish power distributor Red El\u00e9ctrica finally said early Tuesday morning that about 99% of the power capacity had been restored across the country. Monday night, many city residents, including in Spain's capital of Madrid, went to sleep in total darkness.",
      "The lights also flickered back on Tuesday morning in Portugal's capital, Lisbon. Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro had earlier said he expected power to be restored by the end of the day on Monday.",
      "Power outage hits Spain's and Portugal's capitals",
      "Offices closed and traffic was snarled as traffic lights stopped working across Madrid on Monday. It was not possible to make calls on many mobile phone networks, though some apps were working. In Barcelona, residents walked into stores searching for battery-powered radios and civilians directed traffic at junctions along the Gran Via avenue that cuts through the city.",
      "Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said that a problem in the European grid that he described as a \"strong oscillation\" was behind the outage, but that the cause was still being determined. The Spanish leader asked the public to refrain from speculation and said no theory about the cause of the outage had been discarded.",
      "REN, the Portuguese grid operator, said a rare atmospheric phenomenon in Spain from extreme temperature variations was behind the massive outage, according to the Reuters news agency. The Portuguese National Cybersecurity Center issued a statement saying there was no sign the outage was due to a cyberattack.",
      "Red El\u00e9ctrica declined to speculate on the causes of the blackout. Eduardo Prieto, head of operations at Red Electrica, told journalists it was unprecedented, calling the event \"exceptional and extraordinary.\"",
      "Electricity was being pulled from Morocco and France to restore power to southern and northern Spain, Sanchez said, thanking their governments. Spain was also increasing the production from hydroelectric and combined cycle thermal power plants.",
      "S\u00e1nchez convened an extraordinary meeting of Spain's National Security Council and visited Red El\u00e9ctrica to follow efforts at restoring grid operations. Montenegro said he has spoken several times to S\u00e1nchez. The Portuguese Cabinet convened an emergency meeting at the prime minister's residence.",
      "The two countries have a combined population of about 60 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected. It is rare to have such a widespread outage across the Iberian Peninsula.",
      "Spain's Canary Islands, Balearic Islands and the territories of Ceuta and Melilla, located across the Mediterranean in Africa, were not impacted by the outage.",
      "The blackout is the second serious European power outage in less than six weeks after a March 20 fire shut down Heathrow Airport in the U.K., and it comes as authorities across Europe gird against sabotage backed by Russia.",
      "A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop from around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500 megawatts to nearly 15,000 megawatts. By 7 a.m. local time on Tuesday, Red El\u00e9ctrica said the national grid was producing 21.265 megawatts, adding that 99.5% of capacity had been restored.",
      "When the blackout hit on Monday, some people were trapped in elevators, garages and subway tunnels. Almost 300 rescue operations were carried out to free those trapped inside elevators in the Madrid region alone, authorities said.",
      "Spanish airports were forced to operate on backup electrical systems and some flights were delayed, according to Aena, which runs 56 airports in Spain, including Madrid and Barcelona.",
      "In Lisbon, terminals closed and throngs of tourists sat outside in the sun and the shade, waiting for news about their flights.",
      "\"We haven't seen any plane arriving or departing in the 50 minutes we've been waiting here,\" Dutch tourist Marc Brandsma told The Associated Press.",
      "Train services in both countries ground to a halt. Video aired on Spanish television showed people evacuating metro stations in Madrid and empty stations with trains stopped in Barcelona. Spain's Transportation Minister Oscar Puente posted on the social platform X that it wouldn't be possible to restart trains later Monday, even if the power returned.",
      "Play at the Madrid Open tennis tournament was suspended. Three matches were underway when power went down.",
      "Spain's traffic department asked citizens to avoid using their cars as much as possible due to the power outage, which has affected traffic lights and electrical road signage.",
      "Barcelona's streets filled with throngs of people on sidewalks, milling about in front of darkened stores and offices and exchanging information on what had happened.",
      "\"We are lucky. Some people got trapped in the metro. And there is a positive side: We are talking more with each other,\" Monste Cort\u00e9s said. She said dinner would be sliced bread and cold cuts.",
      "Immediate concerns were which phone companies still had at least some spotty coverage, or where internet access might be found. Another concern was how to get home with the subway shut and public buses packed. Some took advantage of the lack of connectivity and transport to enjoy the sunshine on restaurant terraces.",
      "In Terrassa, an industrial town 30 miles from Barcelona, stores selling generators were out of stock after people lined up to buy them.",
      "Parts of France were also briefly affected, according to Reuters. French grid operator RTE said it was working to provide power to some parts of northern Spain.",
      "In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit Lisbon and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country. Portuguese police placed more officers on duty to direct traffic and cope with increased requests for help, including from people trapped in elevators.",
      "Hospitals and other emergency services in both Spain and Portugal switched to generators. Gas stations stopped working.",

      "The Houthis have for more than a year launched strikes targeting Israel and Western vessels in the Red Sea, including U.S. warships, in what they describe as solidarity with the Palestinians, since Hamas sparked the war in Gaza by launching its unprecedented terrorist attack on Israel in October 2023.",

      "Ten people \u2014 nine men and a woman \u2014 are on trial on charges of robbery and kidnapping of the media personality and the concierge of the residence where she was staying on the night of Oct. 2, 2016. Two of them acknowledged their participation and the others denied it.",
      "Kardashian was in France for Fashion Week when men dressed as police officers allegedly tied her up with zip ties and duct tape, held her at gunpoint and stole $10 million worth of jewelry, including a $4 million diamond ring given to her by her then-husband Kanye West.",
      "In interviews and on her family's reality TV show, Kardashian described being terrified, thinking she was going to be raped and killed when the criminals broke into her bedroom and pointed a gun at her.",
      "\"They dragged me out to the hallway on top of the stairs, that's when I saw the gun like clear as day,\" she said on her show, \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\" \"It makes me so upset thinking about it.\"",
      "Her lawyers said she will testify in person at the trial, with a provisional schedule showing that is expected to happen on May 13. The trial is scheduled to run through May 23.",
      "\"Ms. Kardashian is reserving her testimony for the court and jury and does not wish to elaborate further at this time,\" they said. \"She has great respect and admiration for the French justice system and has been treated with great respect by the French authorities. She wishes the trial to proceed in an orderly fashion, in accordance with French law and with respect for all parties to the case.\"",
      "Twelve people were originally expected in the defendants' box. One of them died and another is seriously ill and can't be tried. According to the investigation, five of the 10 defendants were present at the scene of the robbery.",
      "The \"Granddad Robbers\"",
      "The French press has dubbed them The Granddad Robbers because the main defendants are older \u2014 most in their 60s and 70s \u2014 and have been bank robbers with long criminal records.",
      "The DNA of two of the accused was found at the scene, and they have admitted taking part in the robbery.",
      "Aomar Ait Khedache, now aged 69, was allegedly the mastermind behind the heist.",
      "Known as \"Old Omar\", he reportedly told investigators he had no idea who Kardashian was but had heard from a waiter friend about the amazing jewelry she wore when she was out dining in Paris.",
      "When the robbers arrived at the luxury suites hotel known only as \"The No Address\" where the celebrity was staying during Paris Fashion Week, they allegedly demanded the guard, at gunpoint, direct them to \"the rapper's wife\" \u2013 a reference to her then-husband, West.",
      "\"Old Omar\" reportedly wrote to Kardashian in 2017, when he was in custody, to say sorry. Her lawyers said he wrote to apologize after he heard her speak of how traumatic the experience had been.",
      "He left the hotel on a bicycle, as did two others, then met his son, who was waiting for him in a parked car at a nearby train station.",
      "The other man \u2014 77-year-old Yunice Abbas \u2014 has publicly admitted to being a lookout during the robbery.",
      "He said he was unarmed and did not personally threaten Kardashian, but admitted he shared responsibility for the crime.",
      "In 2021, he co-authored a French-language book titled \"I Sequestered Kim Kardashian.\"",
      "Abbas told reporters that he will apologize during the trial and will give details of his role in the heist but won't denounce anyone else.",
      "The other defendants are suspected of providing information about Kardashian's presence in the apartment. Others are accused of playing a role in the resale of the jewelry in Antwerp, Belgium.",
      "The gangsters stole many pieces of jewelry. Only one piece of jewelry \u2014 a diamond cross on platinum that was lost during the suspects' escape \u2014 has been recovered.",
      "Celebrity status could distract from trial",
      "As the trial opened Monday, lawyers for the accused told reporters outside the court that they were concerned that Kardashian's fame would distract from the essentials of the case.",
      "\"It's a simple case with people who will accept responsibility, who regret what they've done,\" said Frank Berton, lawyer for Khedache.",
      "Another of his lawyers, Chloe Arnoux, told reporters: \"He is, in fact, rather worried about seeing all you journalists, because he is afraid that his case will not be treated the same way it would be if there were not such a famous person involved in it.\"",

      "A climber airlifted with altitude sickness from near the peak of Japan's Mount Fuji last week returned to the slope and was rescued for a second time just four days later, authorities said Monday.",
      "The climber was identified only as a 27-year-old Chinese student living in Japan. He made an emergency call on April 22 and was airlifted after developing symptoms of altitude sickness, police said, adding that his climbing irons also were damaged.",
      "On Saturday, he returned to the mountain's Fujinomiya trail nearly 10,000 feet above sea level to look for his cell phone and other belongings left behind, Shizuoka prefectural police said. Another climber found him there unable to move after he apparently got sick for a second time, police said.",

      "The mountain's hiking trails are officially open only from July to early September, but there is no penalty for hiking off-season. There also is no charge or penalty when a climber needs to be rescued, but the Chinese student's case prompted an uproar on social media and generated calls for him to be charged, at least for his second rescue.",
      "Following the man's rescue, police in Shizuoka prefecture reiterated its advice against climbing the mountain during the off-season as the weather could suddenly change, making it hard for rescuers to respond, the BBC reported. Medical facilities along the trails are also closed.",
      "Police urged all climbers to use caution, noting that the mountain has low temperatures and is covered in snow even in spring.",

    "summary": "After being accused of violating the last short-term truce, President Vladimir Putin says Russia will halt its war in Ukraine for three days to mark 80 years since the defeat of Nazi Germany.",
    "story": [
      "Russia's President Vladimir Putin has ordered a three-day ceasefire in his country's war on Ukraine, from May 8-10, coinciding with Moscow's World War II Victory Day commemorations, the Kremlin said Monday. Ukraine quickly accused Putin's forces, who are more than three years into their full-scale invasion, of violating the last ceasefire Putin declared, on Easter Sunday.",
      "The three-day truce declared by Putin on Monday covers the national holiday in Russia that coincides with Victory in Europe, or VE Day, which is marked across Europe on May 8, the date on which Nazi Germany conceded defeat to the Allied Forces in 1945. The then-Soviet Union was one of those allies, along with the United States, that defeated Adolf Hitler's fascist regime.",
      "\"Russia believes that the Ukrainian side should follow this example,\" the Kremlin said Monday in announcing Putin's order. \"In the event of violations of the truce by the Ukrainian side, the Russian armed forces will give an adequate and effective response.\"",
      "On Easter Sunday, just hours into the last temporary ceasefire that Putin declared, Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u00a0accused Moscow of attempting to create a false appearance of honoring the truce. He said while air and missile strikes had at least slowed, his forces recorded 59 separate instances of Russian shelling and five attacks along the 600-mile front line, which stretches from the northern to southern borders of eastern Ukraine.",
      "\"In practice, either Putin does not have full control over his army, or the situation proves that in Russia, they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war, and are only interested in favorable PR coverage,\" he wrote.",
      "Putin's unilateral declaration of another ceasefire comes amid intense pressure from the Trump administration on both Kyiv and Moscow to strike an agreement to end the fighting in the three-year war sparked by Putin's Feb. 24, 2022, full-scale invasion.",
      "On Saturday, Zelenskyy and President Trump met for about 15 minutes in St. Peter's Basilica ahead of Pope Francis' funeral.",
      "After the meeting, Mr. Trump seemed to have changed his tune on Ukraine and the war, saying Zelenskyy is ready to make a peace deal to end the war. He also criticized Russia for its recent attacks in Ukraine, even threatening banking or secondary sanctions on Moscow in a Truth Social post.",
      "\"We had a nice meeting, it was a beautiful meeting,\" Mr. Trump told reporters outside the White House on Sunday, acknowledging that Zelenskyy has a \"tough road ahead.\"",
      "Asked if he trusts Putin, Mr. Trump answered, \"You'll know in about two weeks,\" without elaborating further.",
      "Last week, Vice President JD Vance also warned that Putin and Zelenskyy must strike a deal or the Trump administration would end its efforts to forge a lasting ceasefire. It was the\u00a0second warning from the Trump administration\u00a0in less than a week, despite Mr. Trump's frequent pledges before his second term began that he would end the war immediately.",
      "\"We've issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and the Ukrainians, and it's time for them to either say yes, or for the United States to walk away from this process,\" Vance told reporters.",
      "A couple days after Vance's warning, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told CBS News' Margaret Brennan that the Kremlin was \"ready to reach a deal\" with the U.S. on Ukraine but that some elements still needed to be \"fine tuned.\"",
      "\"The president of the United States believes \u2014 and I think rightly so \u2014 that we are moving in the right direction,\" Lavrov said.",
      "Lavrov declined to say what details were being discussed in the U.S.-Russia negotiations, or whether he believed any deal was imminent.",
      "Russia has long said it is open to a negotiated end to the war, but it has refused to offer any concessions publicly, and the Kremlin routinely insists that any ceasefire must deal with what Putin considers the \"root causes\" of the war, which he has always blamed on Ukraine and the West despite his own ordering of the invasion of a neighboring nation.",
      "Mr. Trump has at times echoed Kremlin rhetoric about the causes of the war, and senior administration officials have made it clear they believe Ukraine will have to yield some of the territory Russia has seized control of over the last decade to end the fighting. While some White House officials have said Russia will also have to make concessions, it remains unclear what the Trump administration will demand from Putin to reach a lasting truce.",

      "A runaway dog named Valerie has been captured after a 529-day adventure, transfixing Australia as she roamed an island teeming with kangaroos, possums, koala bears and penguins.",
      "The miniature dachshund had eluded searchers on Kangaroo Island since November 2023, only rarely appearing in fuzzy glimpses caught by night-time cameras that showed her pink collar.",
      "\"Valerie has been safely rescued and is alive and well,\" the wildlife group that spent months tracking the wily canine on the southern Australian island said late Friday.",
      "A lost miniature dachshund named Valerie has finally been found and captured after 529 days. pic.twitter.com/oxPkPYVGux",
      "\"We are absolutely thrilled and deeply relieved that Valerie is finally safe and able to begin her transition back to her loving parents,\" Kangala Wildlife Rescue posted on social media, along with a brief video clip of the pooch.",
      "Valerie made her escape during a camping trip with owners Georgia Gardner and her partner Josh Fishlock, dashing out of a pen and into the bush.",
      "Her owners gave up after days of searching on the island, which spans more than 4,400 square kilometres (1,700 square miles) of farms, nature reserves and craggy cliffs.",
      "The missing mutt was not seen for more than a year, with many holding out little hope for her survival.",
      "Then, video surveillance and locals began spotting her, and volunteers launched a patient hunt for the hound, which seemed to flee from people and cars.",
      "\"Valerie seems impossible to trap,\" wildlife rescuers posted on social media last month.",
      "Investing more than 1,000 hours, volunteer searchers drove more than 3,100 miles and deployed cameras, traps and lures.",
      "\"This rescue was a true testament to the dedication and perseverance of our team, the unwavering support of the community, and the power of collaboration,\" Kangala Wildlife Rescue wrote. \"There were many challenging moments over the past month, and we are incredibly grateful to everyone who played a part in bringing Valerie home.\"",
      "Regular online updates gave hope they were gradually closing in.",
      "Snatches of black-and-white video showed Valerie regularly visiting a trap site, set up with a dog crate, blankets and toys \u2014 though the facilities also attracted possums.",
      "\"Incredibly grateful\"",
      "Finally, she was lured into the crate by the scent from torn-up strips of a shirt worn by her owner Georgia, Kangala directors Jared and Lisa Karran said in a video update.",
      "\"She was rummaging around, finding little food stashes all over the place. Then she went right to the back corner, which is where we wanted her,\" said Jared Karran.",
      "\"I pressed the button and, thankfully, it all worked perfectly: the remote dropped the door and that was all secured.\"",
      "As the four-legged escape artist became used to her new surroundings, Lisa Karran got in the crate to be with her.",
      "But she entered from the top to avoid opening a side door.",
      "\"No way we were letting that sausage dog run away on us again,\" Jared said.",
      "On her return to civilization, Valerie was treated to dog food and her favorite, roast chicken.",
      "Sizing up the adventurer, Jared said she was surprisingly small.",
      "\"I think that she looks quite big on the camera. When I saw her in real life, she is tiny. She's got, like, an inch clearance under her belly, tiny little legs.\"",
      "Despite their modest dimensions, dachshunds are \"game for anything,\" according to the American Kennel Club.",
      "\"Bred to be an independent hunter of dangerous prey, they can be brave to the point of rashness, and a bit stubborn,\" it says.",
      "Valerie's owner Gardner said in a social media post that she was \"incredibly grateful\" to the volunteers who helped find her dog.",
      "\"For anyone who's ever lost a pet, your feelings are valid and never give up hope.\"",

    "summary": "German police fatally shooting a man identified as Lorenz A. outside a nightclub in the city of Oldenburg has fueled calls for an independent investigation.",
    "story": [
      "Berlin\u00a0\u2014 Civil rights activists are demanding an independent investigation after a Black man was fatally shot by police last week outside a nightclub in northwest Germany. The killing sparked nationwide protests and raised concerns about what some believe is systemic racism within Germany's law enforcement agencies.",
      "The victim, identified as 21-year-old Lorenz A., was shot multiple times from behind by a 27-year-old police officer in the city of Oldenburg. According to prosecutors, an autopsy found that Lorenz A. was struck in the back of the head, torso and hip. A fourth bullet reportedly grazed his thigh. He died in a local hospital of the gunshot wounds.",
      "Authorities said Lorenz A. had threatened nightclub bouncers with pepper spray and a knife after being denied entry. When confronted by police, they said he again used pepper spray in a \"threatening manner.\"",
      "By Monday, however, prosecutors said preliminary evidence including security camera video and witness reports provided no indication that Lorenz A. had threatened officers with a knife at the time he was shot.",
      "The involved officers' body cameras were turned off, the police have said. There is no legal obligation for police in Germany to have their body cameras turned on during operations; it is at their discretion.",
      "The shooting has sparked anger across Germany, with more than 10,000 demonstrators gathering at a \"Justice for Lorenz\" rally in Oldenburg on Friday. Vigils were also planned in Berlin, Munich, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and in Vienna in neighboring Austria.",
      "Rights groups including Amnesty International and the Black People in Germany Initiative (ISD), have demanded an independent inquiry, arguing that internal police investigations are inherently biased.",
      "\"This killing impacts not just Lorenz's family, but all people affected by racism in Germany,\" Amnesty International\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "The campaign groups are also pushing for police officers to be compelled to turn their body cameras on during operations involving weapons.",
      "The incident echoes cases of police violence in the United States, where the 2020 murder of George Floyd by an officer in Minnesota sparked a surge in protests against what many see as systemic racism in law enforcement and police brutality.",
      "Just as American activists have pushed for independent oversight and systemic reform, German groups are now calling for the establishment of a national office to investigate allegations of police misconduct.",
      "The case has also drawn comparisons to the death of Oury Jalloh, an asylum seeker from Sierra Leone who died under suspicious circumstances in a German police holding cell in 2005, after being set on fire while handcuffed. That case has remained a symbol of alleged institutional racism and impunity within German police forces for two decades.",
      "Despite Germany's relatively low rates of officer-involved shootings (which was long around 10 per year) the number has risen sharply, with 22 deaths\u00a0recorded last year alone.",
      "A 2024\u00a0study found that nearly a third of German police officers reported having overheard racist comments from colleagues, highlighting what many consider a broader cultural problem.",

      "A lettercard penned by one of the Titanic's most well-known survivors from onboard the ship, days before it sank, has sold for $399,000 at auction.",
      "In the note, written to the seller's great-uncle on April 10, 1912, first-class passenger Archibald Gracie wrote of the ill-fated steamship: \"It is a fine ship but I shall await my journeys end before I pass judgment on her.\"",
      "The letter was sold to a private collector from the United States on Saturday, according to auction house Henry Aldridge & Son in Wiltshire, England. The hammer price far exceeded the initial estimate price of 60,000 pounds.",
      "The letter is believed to be the sole example in existence from Gracie from onboard the Titanic, which sank off Newfoundland after hitting an iceberg, killing about 1,500 people on its maiden voyage.",
      "Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge described it as an \"exceptional museum grade piece.\"",
      "\"Not only is it written by one of the most important first-class passengers on Titanic, Colonel Archibald Gracie, [but] the letter itself contains the most prophetic line: 'It is a fine ship but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her,'\" Aldridge said in a statement.",
      "Gracie, who jumped from the ship and managed to scramble onto an overturned collapsible boat, was rescued by other passengers onboard a lifeboat and was taken to the R.M.S. Carpathia. He went on to write \"The Truth about the Titanic,\" an account of his experiences, when he returned to New York City.",
      "Gracie boarded the Titanic in Southampton on April 10, 1912, and was assigned first-class cabin C51. His book is seen as one of the most detailed accounts of the events of the night the ship sank, Aldridge said. Gracie did not fully recover from the hypothermia he suffered, and died of complications from diabetes in late 1912.",
      "The letter was postmarked Queenstown, Ireland, one of two stops the Titanic made before sinking.",
      "Henry Aldridge & Son put up dozens of Titanic items up for auction this month, including a pocket watch and a third-class ticket belonging to two passengers who both died in the disaster.",
      "Pocket watches previously owned by Titanic passengers have sold for huge amounts at Henry Aldridge & Son's auctions before, with a bidder in November claiming one of them\u00a0for $2 million. The price of that item had broken a record set earlier in the year, when the same auction house sold a different gold watch for about $1.46 million. In that case, the 14-carat object belonged to the wealthiest passenger on the Titanic,\u00a0John Jacob Astor, whose net worth was around $87 million when the disaster happened in 1912.",

    "story": [
      "Pope Francis died Monday, April 21, after 12 years as the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, triggering an outpouring of mourning across the globe. The pope's death initiates a centuries-old process of rituals and traditions that culminates with a conclave, a gathering of the Church's current 135 cardinal electors who are sealed inside the Sistine Chapel to elect the next pontiff.",
      "Here's what's to come in the days following the pope's death.",
      "Day One",
      "The pope was formally pronounced dead by the cardinal camerlengo \u2014 currently Irish-born American Kevin Farrell \u2014 who is one of the most important Vatican officials during the interregnum period.",
      "Traditionally, the camerlengo (chamberlain) would tap a silver hammer on the pope's head while calling out his baptismal name three times. The hammer is no longer used. Far more conventionally, an electrocardiogram was used to confirm John Paul II's death in 2005.",
      "Farrell then made a\u00a0statement announcing\u00a0the news: \"At 7:35 this morning, The Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the Father's house. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and His church.\"",
      "Once the camerlengo pronounces the pope dead, and before sealing the papal apartment, he breaks the pope's Fisherman's ring and destroys the dies used to make the papal seal for apostolic letters, to symbolize the end of the pontificate.",
      "These items will be buried with the pope. But first, the pontiff is transported to lie in state in St. Peter's Basilica. Hundreds of thousands of mourners descended on Vatican City after the death of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI in 2022\u00a0 to pay their respects.",
      "Novemdiales",
      "Pope Francis's death will be followed by a nine-day mourning period called Novemdiales, a tradition that dates back to Roman times.",
      "Vatican flags will fly at half-staff, and the bronze doors of St Peter's Basilica are closed.",
      "The funeral must take place four to six days after the pope's death. For Pope Francis, it took place Saturday, April 26, in St. Peter's Square.",
      "Most recent popes have asked to be buried beneath the Basilica there, but Francis said he would be laid to rest in Rome's Basilica of St. Mary Major (Santa Maria Maggiore). He also asked to be buried in a simple wooden casket.",
      "The papal funeral is broken down into three separate phases, or \"stations.\" They are the preparation of the body, the viewing of the body, and then the burial.",
      "At the funeral, attended by kings, queens, heads of state and religious leaders, the coffin is carried through the so-called \"door of death\" to the left of the main altar, as a single bell tolls. Pope Francis was then taken in procession from St. Peter's to the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome for entombment.",
      "During the nine-day mourning period, cardinals from around the world gather in Rome and begin meeting in \"General Congregations,\" a sort of campaigning period where various papal candidates give speeches about their visions for the church, mapping out the direction they think it should take.",
      "The conclave",
      "The Vatican says the\u00a0conclave to choose Pope Francis' successor will begin May 7. Rules say it must begin 15 to 20 days after the pope's death. This is when the cardinal electors\u00a0\u2014 cardinals under the age of 80, currently a group of about 135 \u2014 isolate themselves from the world and begin the centuries-old process of choosing the next leader of the Catholic Church.",
      "Behind closed doors in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, the cardinals will cast ballots for their choice, repeating the process until a candidate emerges with a two-thirds-plus-one majority. The paper ballots are burned after each round of voting, sending up black smoke to signal no choice has been reached yet, and finally white smoke to reveal that a new pope has been selected.",

      "Cardinal Mario Grech, secretary general for the Synod of Bishops",
      "Cardinal Mario Grech, 68, is a canon lawyer who has major influence on how synods in the church are run. Supporters have praised him for leading the charge in implementing a more consultative and inclusive approach to church governance.",

      "Cardinal Luis Tagle, 67, and pro-prefect for the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, is known as the \"Asian Francis\" for his missionary spirit as well as his emphasis on caring for the poor and welcoming of LGBTQ and divorced and remarried Catholics.",
      "He is the former archbishop of Manila, in the Philippines, which is one of the most Catholic countries on the continent of Asia, and studied in the U.S. for seven years. His election would signal a continuation of Francis' pontificate.",

      "Francis sharply disagreed with Mr. Trump's approach on issues including immigration, the treatment of migrants and climate change. The Argentine pontiff and the American president sparred early in their relationship over immigration. In 2016, Francis, alluding to then-candidate Trump and his campaign slogan of \"Build the wall,\" called anyone who builds a wall to keep out migrants \"not Christian.\" Mr. Trump said the comment was \"disgraceful.\"",

      "Two 18th-century shipwrecks off the coast of Costa Rica, previously thought to have been pirate ships, have been confirmed to be two Danish slave ships, a museum said Sunday.",
      "\"Investigations of ship timbers, bricks from the cargo and clay pipes found during underwater excavations\" had determined the identity of two vessels shipwrecked in 1710, Denmark's National Museum said in a statement.",
      "Marine archaeologists identified the slave ships Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, which, according to historical sources, were wrecked off the coast of Central America in 1710, said the museum. The museum also released images of Andreas Kallmeyer Bloch and David Gregory digging underwater and excavating bricks and wood from the wreckage.",
      "Fridericus Quartus was set on fire, while Christianus Quintus was wrecked in the surf after its anchor line was cut. Until now, it has not been clear exactly where the ships were lost.",
      "The museum added that in Costa Rica, it had long been known that two wrecks were located in the waters of the Cahuita National Park.",
      "\"For many years, however, they were thought to be pirate ships. But when American marine archaeologists in 2015 found yellow bricks in one of the wrecks, new questions emerged about the history of the ships,\" the museum said.",
      "An underwater excavation was carried out in 2023. It was part of the National Museum's new research center, Njord, which the museum said is planning to excavate several Danish shipwrecks abroad.",
      "\"The analyses are very convincing and we no longer have any doubts that these are the wrecks of the two Danish slave ships,\" Gregory, a research professor at Denmark's National Museum, said in the statement.",
      "\"The bricks are Danish and the same goes for the timbers, which are additionally charred and sooty from a fire. This fits perfectly with the historical accounts stating that one of the ships burned,\" Gregory added.",
      "Fellow marine archaeologist Bloch, who's also a museum curator,\u00a0called it \"undoubtedly the craziest archaeological excavation I've yet been part of.\"",
      "\"Not only because it matters greatly to the local population, but also because it's one of the most dramatic shipwrecks in the history of Denmark, and now we know exactly where it happened,\" the marine archaeologist said.",
      "The Danish government banned the transatlantic slave trade in 1792, but the country didn't abolish slavery until half a century later, in 1847, according to the museum.",

    "published": "Sun, 27 Apr 2025 16:33:38 -0400",
    "summary": "The blast happened at the Rajaei port just outside of Bandar Abbas, a major shipping site in Iran.",
    "story": [
      "A massive explosion and fire that rocked a port Saturday in\u00a0southern Iran, purportedly linked to a shipment of a chemical ingredient used to make missile propellant, has killed at least 40 people and injured around 1,000 others, officials said.",
      "Helicopters and aircraft dumped water on the raging fire through the night into Sunday morning at the Shaid Rajaei port. The explosion happened just as\u00a0Iran and the United States met Saturday in Oman\u00a0for the third round of negotiations over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program.",
      "While no one in Iran outright suggested that the explosion came from an attack, even Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who led the talks, on Wednesday acknowledged that \"our security services are on high alert given past instances of attempted sabotage and assassination operations designed to provoke a legitimate response.\"",
      "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian visited the site as containers appeared smashed or thrown as if discarded toys.",
      "\"We have to find out why it happened,\" Pezeshkian said during a meeting with officials aired by Iranian state television.",
      "Provincial Gov. Mohammad Ashouri gave the latest death toll on Sunday and declared three days of mourning, Iranian state TV reported.",
      "Pir Hossein Kolivand, head of Iran's Red Crescent society, said that only 190 of about 1,000 injured remained hospitalized on Sunday, according to a statement carried by an Iranian government website. State TV also reported the fire was under control and will be fully extinguished later Sunday. It also said activities have resumed at the port, showing footage of containers of a commercial ship being unloaded.",
      "CBS News partner network BBC News\u00a0reported\u00a0that verified videos appeared to show a growing fire prior to the explosion. Social media videos showed black billowing smoke after the blast. Others showed glass blown out of buildings miles away from the epicenter of the explosion.",
      "There were few details on what sparked the blaze just outside of Bandar Abbas, causing other containers to explode, BBC News reported.",
      "Private security firm Ambrey says the port received missile fuel chemical in March. It is part of a shipment of ammonium perchlorate from China by two vessels to Iran, first reported in January by the Financial Times. The fuel was going to be used to replenish Iran's missile stocks, which had been depleted by its direct attacks on Israel during\u00a0the war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"The fire was reportedly the result of improper handling of a shipment of solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles,\" Ambrey said.",
      "In a first reaction Sunday, the spokesman of Iran's defense ministry Gen. Reza Talaeinik, denied reports that missile fuel had been imported through the port.",
      "\"No sort of imported and exporting consignment for fuel or military application was (or) is in the site of the port,\" he told state TV by phone. He called foreign reports on the missile fuel baseless.",
      "Ship-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press put one of the vessels believed to be carrying the chemical in the vicinity in March, as Ambrey said. Iran hasn't acknowledged taking the shipment.",
      "It's unclear why Iran wouldn't have moved the chemicals from the port, particularly after\u00a0the Beirut port blast in 2020. That explosion, caused by the ignition of hundreds of tons of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, killed more than 200 people and injured more than 6,000 others. However, Israel did target Iranian missile sites where Tehran uses\u00a0industrial mixers to create solid fuel.",
      "Social media footage of the explosion on Saturday at Shahid Rajaei saw reddish-hued smoke rising from the fire just before the detonation. That suggests a chemical compound as being involved in the blast.",
      "\"Get back get back! Tell the gas (truck) to go!\" a man in one video shouted just before the blast. \"Tell him to go, it's going to blow up! Oh God, this is blowing up! Everybody evacuate! Get back! Get back!\"",
      "On Saturday night, the state-run IRNA news agency said that the Customs Administration of Iran blamed a \"stockpile of hazardous goods and chemical materials stored in the port area\" for the blast, without elaborating.",
      "Shahid Rajaei has been a target before. A 2020 cyberattack attributed to Israel targeted the port. It came after Israel said that it thwarted a cyberattack targeting its water infrastructure, which it attributed to Iran.",
      "Social media videos showed black billowing smoke after the blast. Others showed glass blown out of buildings kilometers, or miles, away from the epicenter of the explosion. State media footage showed the injured crowding into at least one hospital, with ambulances arriving as medics rushed one person by on a stretcher.",
      "Hasanzadeh, the provincial disaster management official, earlier told state television that the blast came from containers at Shahid Rajaei port in the city, without elaborating. State television also reported that there had been a building collapse caused by the explosion, though no further details were offered.",
      "The Interior Ministry said that it launched an investigation into the blast. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also offered his condolences for those affected by the blast.",
      "Shahid Rajaei port in Hormozgan province is about 650 miles southeast of Iran's capital, Tehran, on the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all oil traded passes.",

      "Kara Schmiemann of Red Banyan PR told Fox News Digital, \"This type of strategy, flooding the market with appearances as an attempt to show normalcy and appear[ing] unbothered or unaffected by the drama, is typically not well-advised in crisis response planning.\"",

The public can be forgiving, but they need time and a reason to forgive and forget. Blake and Ryan seem to be continuing to fan the flames, and it is not landing particularly well for all circles.\"",
      "\"If the PDA-filled images were all that the public saw, their PDA would have definitely helped their image amid the ongoing Baldoni lawsuit drama, because they have always been celebrated as a Hollywood \u2018it couple\u2019 with an amazing relationship,\" relationship expert Nicole Moore said. \"The issue for Blake and Ryan's image is that a large portion of the public no longer gets their information solely from media outlets but from social media and online commentators.\"",

      "\"When the public sees Blake and Ryan looking lovey-dovey at an event, but then goes on TikTok and sees a video about a lip-reader sharing that Blake ordered Ryan to kiss her, for instance, it creates mistrust in the couple and plants seeds of doubt that their relationship is staged,\" she explained. \"So much of the public opinion regarding the Baldoni lawsuit drama has been shaped by voices outside of traditional media, and that's been to Blake and Ryan's detriment.\"",

      "He continued, \"Given all the scrutiny surrounding her demeanor during the press tour for 'It Ends With Us,' why not bring this incredibly personal experience up then?

      "Schmiemann agreed, saying, \"If this was a ploy to gain sympathy, that can be easily sussed out by the public and could be even more damaging.

      "Moore says, \"Hollywood actors are often obsessed with protecting their image and profitability, so the fact that Hugh is supporting Blake and Ryan publicly likely means that he doesn't\u00a0anticipate doing so will hurt his own brand.\u00a0There has been extensive media coverage on the close friendly relationship between Hugh and Ryan, so it would\u00a0likely\u00a0appear weird to the public if Hugh didn't support his friend.\"",
      "\"If the lawsuit ends up going in Baldoni's favor and the public starts to see\u00a0Blake and Ryan as perpetrators of harm due to the verdict, that's likely when Hugh will need to distance himself from the couple in order to\u00a0protect his image,\" she added.",
      "Just as Lively and Reynolds have continued to step out in public, Justin Baldoni has remained largely hidden from view.",
      "\"Baldoni is making the right move by avoiding the public eye because he's mitigating any\u00a0damage that\u00a0might occur from a misstep at a\u00a0public\u00a0appearance,\" Moore said. \"Right now,\u00a0Baldoni appears to have the favor of the\u00a0public, and he's wise to ride the wave of that\u00a0favor without adding any potentially negative press or attention to the mix.\"",

      "In Eldridge\u2019s opinion: \"Baldoni's moves have been flawless up to this point. From an optics standpoint, he had an accuser make the first move with a splashy, long-form piece in the New York Times. His response was measured and meaningful; ironically, it centered mostly on a series of indelible 'receipts' as well as allowing fans to find the cracks in Lively's sidewalk, knowing she'd eventually trip up.\"",
      "Schmiemann said, \"Time and silence cannot be underestimated when dealing with as much nuance and public criticism as Blake and Ryan seem to be facing. Of course, they must still live their lives and work and care for their family, but being strategic about the when and where is incredibly important. If they continue to step out too frequently, you create additional opportunities for the story to remain in the public eye and for a repeated resurgence of criticism and hate.\"",

You can't have 10 movies nominated for best movie. It\u2019s too much. And so it can't also become a second career for members of the Academy to vote with knowledge on your nominees. And so they may have to readjust the sheer volume [of] the awards.\"",
      "According to AMPAS, most categories are voted on by eligible members of their respective branch (costuming votes for costuming, editors for editors, etc.) while certain categories \"may be open to members across all voting branches.\"",
      "For the final round, all eligible members may vote in all categories.",

      "AMPAS has not yet laid out any methodology on how to enforce this new system, leaving a gray area for how well it will work.",
      "\"I don't know how professionals are going to have that much time,\" Arroyo said. \"If they're directors and producers and, actors, designers, and they're working constantly, that's a big time suck. So how the Academy patrols it, I don't know.\"",
      "He suggested sending screener links that can indicate whether someone has watched it, or possibly a questionnaire about what happens in the film, but, \"there's so much busy work that I think it defeats its own purpose, so they may have to walk that back.\"",
      "\"It's a good idea, but the answer is: Nominate less, curtail your categories so you have 10 rather than 30,\" Arroyo added.",

Before 9/11, standards for issuing driver's licenses and other IDs varied widely among states, with little coordination or verification of critical documents like birth certificates and Social Security numbers. Several of the 9/11 hijackers were able to obtain legitimate state IDs using fraudulent documents, enabling them to move freely and board planes without detection.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Cybercriminals always find new ways to scam you, whether it\u2019s mimicking a government agency, creating a fake website or delivering malware disguised as a software update. Just when you think you\u2019ve seen it all, they come up with a new trick.",
      "This time, the FBI has issued an alert: Hackers are using a \"time-traveling\" technique to bypass your device\u2019s security measures. No, we\u2019re not talking about actual time travel (though wouldn\u2019t that be something?). This is a sophisticated cyberattack where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to sneak past security defenses.",

      "A man working on his laptops (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "The concept of \"time-traveling hackers\" refers not to literal time travel but to a sophisticated cyberattack technique where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to bypass security measures. This attack is reportedly tied to the Medusa ransomware gang.",
      "In this type of attack, hackers exploit expired security certificates by altering the system date on a targeted device to a time when those certificates were still valid. For example, a security certificate that expired in, say, 2020 could be made usable again if the system's clock is set back to 2019. This allows malicious software signed with these outdated certificates to be recognized as legitimate by the system, effectively \"traveling back in time\" from a security perspective.",
      "This technique was notably used in the Medusa ransomware attacks, which targeted critical infrastructure and prompted an\u00a0FBI cybersecurity advisory (AA25-071A) earlier in 2025. The campaign has affected over 300 critical infrastructure targets. The attackers combined this method with social engineering and exploited unpatched vulnerabilities, amplifying the threat.",
      "The FBI has warned that such attacks pose a significant risk, as they can disable modern security protections like Windows Defender by tricking the system into accepting outdated drivers or software.",
      "A woman working on her laptop and scrolling on her phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVERS",
      "What does the FBI recommend?",
      "The FBI is urging organizations to take action quickly, warning that this technique can slip past traditional defenses by taking advantage of how systems trust old certificate data.",
      "To stay protected, they recommend turning on two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere, especially for important stuff like webmail and VPNs. It also helps to have strong endpoint protection and clear security policies and to keep an eye out for any weird changes to system settings, like the device clock suddenly jumping back in time.",
      "A man working on his laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "RELENTLESS HACKERS ABANDON WINDOWS TO TARGET YOUR APPLE ID",
      "5 ways to stay safe from Medusa malware",
      "1) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0A strong antivirus isn\u2019t just for catching old-school viruses anymore. It can detect phishing links, block malicious downloads and stop ransomware before it gets a foothold. Since the Medusa gang uses fake updates and social engineering to trick users, having strong antivirus software adds a critical layer of protection against threats you might not see coming. Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2)\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0The FBI specifically recommends\u00a0enabling 2FA across all services, especially for high-value targets like webmail accounts, VPNs and remote access tools. 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to break in, even if they\u2019ve managed to steal your username and password through phishing or other tactics.",
      "3)\u00a0Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Many ransomware groups, including Medusa, rely on reused or weak passwords to gain access. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don\u2019t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4) Monitor for suspicious system time changes:\u00a0The core of this \"time-traveling\" attack is clock manipulation: Hackers roll back a device\u2019s clock to a time when expired security certificates were still valid. This allows outdated and potentially malicious software to appear trustworthy. Be alert to unexpected system time changes, and if you're managing an organization, use tools that flag and log these types of configuration shifts.",
      "5) Keep systems updated and patch known vulnerabilities:\u00a0The Medusa ransomware campaign has a track record of exploiting unpatched systems. That means old software, outdated drivers and ignored security updates can all become entry points. Regularly\u00a0installing updates for your OS, applications and drivers is one of the most effective ways to stay protected. Don't put off those system notifications; they exist for a reason.",
      "CLICKFIX MALWARE TRICKS YOU INTO INFECTING YOUR OWN WINDOWS PC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Medusa attack is a good example of how cybercriminals are shifting tactics. Instead of relying on traditional methods like brute force or obvious exploits, they are targeting the basic logic that systems depend on to function. In this case, it is something as simple as the system clock. This kind of strategy challenges the way we think about security. It is not just about building stronger defenses but also about questioning the default assumptions built into the technology we use every day.",

    "story": [
      "These scams can catch Facebook veterans and novices off guard.",
      "Healthcare institutions and insurers arguably collect the most sensitive information about you, including IDs, contact details, addresses and medical records. But they often don\u2019t put in the same level of effort to protect that data.",
      "That\u2019s clear from the growing number of healthcare data breaches we\u2019ve seen recently. In most of those cases, a bad actor was involved.",
      "But in the latest news, health insurance giant Blue Shield of California confirmed that it had been sharing private health data of 4.7 million users with Google for three years without even realizing it.",

      "A person doing a Google search\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson))",
      "What you need to know",
      "Blue Shield of California just admitted to a major data privacy slip that went on for almost three years, from April 2021 to January 2024. It was using Google Analytics to track how people used its member websites. This is totally normal since every business does it. But the tool was accidentally sharing sensitive info with Google Ads because it wasn\u2019t set up properly.",
      "What I find extremely shocking is that it took the company three years to realize it was sharing its user data with Google to run ads. This says a lot about how much these healthcare giants care about protecting your data.",
      "The shared data included a broad array of protected health information (PHI), including names, zip codes, gender, medical claim dates, online account numbers, insurance plan names, group numbers, family data and even search criteria used in its \"Find a Doctor\" feature.",
      "\"Google may have used this data to conduct focused ad campaigns back to those individual members. We want to reassure our members that no bad actor was involved, and, to our knowledge, Google has not used the information for any purpose other than these ads or shared the protected information with anyone,\"\u00a0the company\u00a0said in a notice on its website.",
      "This incident is not isolated. Over the past few years, healthcare and tech companies have come under scrutiny for similar missteps. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have already issued warnings about the use of tracking technologies in healthcare, especially those that might expose patient data to third parties without adequate transparency or safeguards.",
      "A Google spokesperson provided the following comment to CyberGuy when asked about the Blue Shield data breach:",
      "\"Businesses, not Google, manage the data they collect and must inform users about its collection and use. By default, any data sent to Google Analytics for measurement does not identify individuals, and we have strict policies against collecting private health information (PHI) or advertising based on sensitive information.\"",

      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "Impact on patients and the industry",
      "Since the data was only shared with Google and not any other party, the overall risk is relatively low, apart from the clear privacy violation. It\u2019s highly unlikely that anyone else will gain access to it, so the chances of the data being misused are slim. Google says it doesn\u2019t allow ads to be served based on sensitive information like health, so there\u2019s a good chance your data wasn\u2019t even used for advertising.",
      "Blue Shield's case follows a string of similar breaches. Companies like GoodRx, BetterHelp and Kaiser have all faced regulatory and legal consequences for sharing sensitive user data with advertising vendors. Some even settled for millions of dollars. Despite the risks, many healthcare organizations have continued using these tools due to the lack of clear regulatory guardrails, a situation complicated further by a federal court ruling that blocked the Biden administration\u2019s attempts to curb the use of online trackers in healthcare settings.",

      "The Blue Shield of California incident is a reminder that even well-known healthcare providers can mishandle sensitive data. While you can\u2019t always control what happens behind the scenes, there\u00a0are steps you can take to reduce your exposure and safeguard your privacy:",
      "1. Limit what you share on health portals:\u00a0Avoid entering more personal details than absolutely necessary on insurance or provider websites. Tools like \"Find a Doctor\" might log your search terms, so keep inputs vague when possible.",
      "2. Use privacy-focused browsers:\u00a0Browsers like Brave or Firefox offer built-in privacy protections, such as blocking third-party trackers that could expose health-related browsing activity.",
      "3. Turn off ad personalization:\u00a0Visit\u00a0Google\u2019s Ad Settings and disable ad personalization. This won\u2019t stop tracking, but it can reduce how your data is used for targeting.",
      "4. Opt out of tracking where possible:\u00a0Many healthcare sites use cookies and tracking tools. Choose \"reject all\" or the strictest privacy settings in cookie banners. If a tracking opt-out tool is available, use it.",
      "5. Read privacy policies (yes, really):\u00a0Look for language like \"third-party sharing,\" \"advertising,\" or \"analytics.\" If a healthcare provider mentions tools like Google Analytics or Meta Pixel, that\u2019s a cue to proceed cautiously.",
      "6. Monitor your accounts and credit:\u00a0Keep an eye out for unusual insurance claims or medical charges. Set up credit alerts or monitoring services if your provider offers them, especially after a breach.",
      "7. Ask questions:\u00a0Call or email your healthcare provider or insurer. Ask what tracking tools they use and how they protect your data. The more consumers push for transparency, the more pressure there is to improve standards.",

      "Bonus privacy steps (For extra peace of mind)",
      "If you want to go beyond the basics, here are some additional steps that can help reduce your digital footprint and catch misuse early:",
      "Use a personal data removal service:\u00a0While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Consider identity theft protection services:\u00a0If you\u2019re concerned about fraud or medical identity theft, you'll want to consider using identity theft protection services. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0To guard against malware or phishing attacks that could compromise access to your online health accounts, be sure to use strong antivirus software. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It baffles me how careless most companies are when it comes to protecting user data. Blue Shield \"mistakenly\" shared your data with Google, which then used it to show personalized ads. It took the company three years to realize this. While most cyber incidents involve an attacker, this breach didn\u2019t need one. We need accountability in data practices, especially when human error or tech oversight can cause damage at scale.",

      "Adding numbers makes your password harder to crack. Instead of sticking to just letters \u2014 like \"Trkplmsh\" \u2014 try something like \"Tr8k5Plm2sh.\" Randomly placed numbers increase complexity and make your password much more secure.",

      "Symbols like !, @, #, and $ add another layer of security. For example, a password like \"T8g5K9w2\" becomes even stronger as \"T8g5#K9w2!.\" Special characters increase complexity and help defend against attacks.",
      "Reusing passwords is like handing hackers a master key. If one account gets breached, and you\u2019ve reused that password elsewhere, you\u2019re toast. One password, one purpose. No exceptions.",
      "Your name, birthday or \"Fluffy1990\" (your dog\u2019s name and birth year) might feel clever, but they\u2019re goldmines for attackers who can scrape social media or breached data. Keep it impersonal and unpredictable.",

In a world full of data leaks, a strong, unique password is one of the easiest ways to protect yourself. So, what\u2019s your score? Think it\u2019s time to level up?",
      "What should I do if my password strength is low?",
      "If your score didn\u2019t quite hit that seven out of seven mark, no worries. The good news? You\u2019ve already taken the first step by identifying the weak spots. Now, you\u2019ve got two options:",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "To keep your passwords secure, use ones that are at least 12 characters long with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Avoid using personal information or common patterns. Always use a different password for each account, and enable\u00a0two-factor authentication whenever it's available.",
      "While you can build a strong password on your own, let\u2019s be real, it\u2019s not always easy. Coming up with something that\u2019s at least 12 characters long, includes uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special symbols and isn\u2019t based on anything personal? That\u2019s a tall order. And even if you do manage to craft the perfect one, you\u2019ve still got to remember it, especially if you\u2019re using a different strong password for every account (which you absolutely should be).",
      "This is the easier, faster and frankly smarter route. A password generator creates long, complex, completely random passwords for you \u2014 no guesswork or mental gymnastics required. These tools are designed to pump out passwords that check all the boxes, making them far harder to crack. If you want an easy and secure option, many password managers include built-in password generators that follow best practices for maximum strength.",
      "Either way, the key takeaway is this: Don\u2019t settle for weak or recycled passwords. Whether you go DIY or use a tool, upgrading your password strength is one of the simplest ways to protect yourself online.",
      "Illustration of online banking login on laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is the best password manager?",
      "Password security can seem like a tough thing to maintain manually. The good news is that password managers take the hassle out of it by generating, storing and autofilling strong, unique passwords for you.",
      "We recommend a password manager that is secure, user-friendly and includes features like a password health tool, data breach monitoring and a built-in password generator to help you create strong, unique passwords. Essentially, they are a digital safe designed to encrypt and store your login credentials, passkeys, credit card details, personal information and even sensitive files. It remembers everything for you, organizes your credentials neatly and fills in login forms with a single click. When you sign up for a new site, it autosaves the password with no effort required.",
      "The best part? A password manager puts an end to password reuse. Instead of leaning on that tired old \"Fluffy1990\" for every account, it generates strong, unique passwords tailored to each site, boosting security for both your personal and professional life. So, with a password manager, you\u2019ll no longer have to ask yourself, how secure is my password?",

      "With data breaches becoming increasingly common, it's clear that password security isn't a \"set it and forget it\" task. It's an ongoing process.

    "story": [
      "Kurt Knutsson: Data breaches in 2024 exposed info of millions, stressing the need for better cybersecurity.",
      "Most companies use different vendors to run different parts of their business, such as customer management, finances, payroll and social media. To do this, they share access to customer data with these platforms. The issue is that not all vendors take cybersecurity seriously, and hackers are well aware of that.",
      "More and more, attackers are going after these weaker links in the digital supply chain. These kinds of breaches often happen quietly, exposing large amounts of customer information without touching a company\u2019s main systems. It\u2019s becoming a serious concern for both businesses and their customers.",
      "One of the latest cases involves Hertz, the car rental giant, which recently confirmed that customer data was exposed because of a cyberattack on one of its software vendors.",

      "What happened at Hertz?",
      "Hertz, the global car rental company that also operates Dollar and Thrifty, has\u00a0disclosed a data breach affecting thousands of its customers. The incident stems from a cyberattack on one of its third-party vendors, software provider Cleo, in October 2024 and December 2024. The breach did not compromise Hertz\u2019s internal systems directly but involved data that had been shared with the vendor as part of its operational workflow.",
      "The compromised data varies by region but includes sensitive personal information such as names, dates of birth, contact details, driver\u2019s license numbers and, in some cases, Social Security numbers and other government-issued IDs. Certain financial information, including payment card details and workers\u2019 compensation claims, was also among the stolen records.",
      "In the U.S., disclosures were filed with regulatory bodies in California, Texas and Maine. Specifically, 3,457 individuals were affected in Maine and 96,665 in Texas. The total global impact, however, is believed to be far greater. Customers in Australia, Canada, the EU, New Zealand and the U.K. were also notified via breach notices on Hertz\u2019s regional websites.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The breach is believed to be the work of the Clop ransomware gang, a well-known Russia-linked hacking group. Clop exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Cleo\u2019s enterprise file transfer software, technology used by many large organizations to securely transmit sensitive business data. In 2024, the gang launched a mass-hacking campaign targeting Cleo users, ultimately stealing data from more than 60 companies, including Hertz.",
      "Interestingly, while Hertz was named on Clop\u2019s dark web leak site in 2024, the company initially stated it had \"no evidence\" its systems or data had been compromised.",
      "When contacted by CyberGuy, a Hertz spokesperson said, \"At Hertz, we take the privacy and security of personal information seriously. This vendor event involves Cleo, a file transfer platform used by Hertz for limited purposes. Importantly, to date, our forensic investigation has found no evidence that Hertz's own network was affected by this event. However, among many other companies affected by this event, we have confirmed that Hertz data was acquired by an unauthorized third party that we understand exploited zero-day vulnerabilities within Cleo's platform in October 2024 and December 2024.\"",

      "While Hertz\u2019s internal systems were not breached, the exposure of personal data, including driver\u2019s license numbers, contact details and government-issued IDs, poses serious risks. Affected individuals may be vulnerable to identity theft, fraudulent account openings and targeted\u00a0phishing attempts.

Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or identification documents, attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks.

To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Hertz breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Hertz breach, including Social Security numbers, driver's license and bank information. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.

      "4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year or more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "6. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "7. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birth dates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Cyber risk doesn\u2019t always come from a company\u2019s own network. It often originates in unseen corners of the digital supply chain. Even as companies double down on internal cybersecurity, they must be equally rigorous in how they vet and monitor third-party vendors. For consumers, it\u2019s no longer enough to trust the big brand on the label. The data trail is wider, the attack surface larger and the consequences far more opaque.",

      "Many of these sketchy extensions presented themselves as tools for search assistance, ad-blocking, security monitoring or extension scanning but shared a connection to a single, unused domain, suggesting coordinated behavior. They all use the same code patterns, connect to some of the same servers and require the same list of sensitive systems permissions, including the ability to interact with web traffic on all URLs visited, access cookies, manage browser tabs and execute scripts.",
      "What\u2019s more concerning is that at least 10 of these extensions carried Google\u2019s \"Featured\" badge, implying vetting for trustworthiness. This raises questions about Google\u2019s review process, as the badge suggests compliance with high standards for user experience, privacy and security.",

With permissions to read tabs, access cookies, intercept web requests and inject scripts into pages, they can monitor nearly everything you do in your browser. This includes tracking your browsing activity, observing login sessions and altering the content of websites you visit, all without your knowledge.",
      "These extensions are not simply misconfigured tools. They appear to be intentionally designed with surveillance in mind. Many store their configuration data locally, which allows remote servers to update their behavior at any time. This setup is commonly seen in spyware, where changes can be made after installation without alerting the user. The code is heavily obfuscated, making it difficult for researchers to understand what the extensions are actually doing.",
      "In some cases, the extensions appear to do nothing at all when clicked. However, they continue to send data in the background. For instance, the Fire Shield Extension Protection remained inactive until the researcher manually triggered it with a specific extension ID. Only then did it begin to transmit browsing activity and other data, revealing behavior that would be hard for an average user to detect.",

      "5 ways to stay safe from sketchy extensions",
      "If you\u2019re worried about the above extensions, here are five ways to safeguard your sensitive information and maintain your online privacy.",
      "1)\u00a0Keep your browser up to date: Chrome gets regular updates that get rid of most security issues. Make sure you turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2) Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store have rules and scans to catch bad actors. They\u2019re not perfect, but they are still a better option when compared to a random website on the internet. Extensions from unknown websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware.",
      "3) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0A good antivirus can warn you before you install malicious software, such as sketchy browser extensions. It can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping keep your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Be skeptical of extensions requesting unnecessary access: Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag.",
      "Before installing, ask, \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer\u2019s no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension has been sold or hacked.",
      "5) Change your passwords and do it safely: If you\u2019ve ever saved passwords in your browser (e.g., via Chrome\u2019s built-in password manager or the \"Save Password\" prompt), those credentials could be at risk if a malicious extension was installed. These built-in managers store passwords locally or in your Google, Microsoft or Firefox account, and a compromised browser can give bad actors a way in.",
      "This doesn\u2019t typically apply to dedicated password manager extensions, which encrypt your data independently and don\u2019t rely on browser storage. However, if you're unsure whether an extension has been compromised, it's always smart to update your master password and enable two-factor authentication.",
      "For maximum safety, change your most important passwords (email, bank, shopping, cloud services) from a different, secure device, such as your phone or another computer, where the questionable extension was never installed. Avoid using the same browser that may have been exposed. Then consider switching to a\u00a0password manager to create and store strong, unique logins going forward. I\u2019ve reviewed the top options in my\u00a0best password managers of 2025 guide. See which one fits your needs best.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The fact that several of these extensions carried Google\u2019s own \"Featured\" badge should serve as a wake-up call. It points to a serious lapse in oversight and raises concerns about how thorough Chrome\u2019s extension review process actually is. When millions of users unknowingly install spyware under the impression that it has been vetted and approved, the issue is no longer just about bad actors. It reflects a deeper failure within the platform itself. Google needs to take stronger responsibility by improving transparency and tightening its review standards.",

    "story": [
      "\"The Big Weekend Show\" analyzes the possibilities of artificial intelligence when it comes to influencing voters.",
      "If you haven\u2019t heard the buzz about Manus yet, it's the new AI model unveiled by a Singapore-based company called Butterfly Effect. This isn\u2019t just another chatbot. It\u2019s one of the first truly autonomous AI agents, able to do its own research, make decisions and even carry out plans, all with barely any human oversight.",
      "Sounds impressive, right? But here\u2019s the thing: While all this innovation opens up exciting possibilities, it also brings some serious privacy and security questions. Whether you\u2019re eager to try out the latest AI or you\u2019d rather steer clear, it\u2019s worth understanding what Manus could mean for your personal data and digital safety.",

      "First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Your data could be used to train AI, even if you go nowhere near it",
      "This has already been happening for a while with other AI models. There have been\u00a0several class-action lawsuits against tech companies for scraping personal data for\u00a0use in AI training, with one lawsuit claiming that OpenAI uses \"stolen private information, including personally identifiable information, from hundreds of millions of internet users, including children of all ages, without their informed knowledge or consent.\"",
      "Many companies also sell or share data with third parties, including for the purposes of AI training. For example, X has been using personal data to train its AI, Grok, and is also sharing user data with third parties to train AI models. So whether you use AI (including\u00a0Manus AI when it\u2019s released to the public) or not, there\u2019s still a good chance that they have your personal information.",
      "First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "GOOGLE'S NEW AI TECH MAY KNOW WHEN YOUR HOUSE WILL BURN DOWN",
      "Why should you care if AI has your data?",
      "It boils down to data privacy and security. When AI companies collect personal information \u2013 things like your name, email address, home location, social media posts and even photos \u2013 they often store it in large databases to train their models. If those databases aren\u2019t properly secured, they can become gold mines for hackers. Think of them as digital \"honey pots\": sweet and tempting to cybercriminals because of all the personal data inside.",
      "This isn\u2019t just a theoretical risk. Just this year, another AI company,\u00a0DeepSeek, experienced a major leak that exposed more than a million sensitive records. When this kind of information gets out, it can end up on the dark web where scammers and identity thieves are more than happy to scoop it up. That\u2019s how people end up dealing with everything from identity theft and impersonation to tons of spam calls, phishing emails and targeted scams.",
      "But data leaks aren\u2019t the only danger. Even when the information is secure, it can be misused or manipulated in ways that are hard to detect. One of the biggest new threats is something called a prompt injection attack.",
      "In simple terms, prompt injection is a way for attackers to trick an AI into doing something it wasn\u2019t supposed to. Researchers recently found that attackers can embed hidden commands in seemingly harmless text, like a website bio, email signature or even a social media post. When the AI reads that text during training or browsing, it can accidentally follow the hidden instructions, which might tell it to leak information, change how it behaves or give unauthorized access to private data.",
      "First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DANGERS OF OVER-SHARING WITH AI TOOLS",
      "Manus AI poses even bigger risks",
      "Unlike most AI tools that respond to commands you give them directly, Manus is autonomous, meaning it can act on its own, follow links, read content and make decisions without human approval. While that sounds pretty cool, it\u2019s also what makes it a lot harder to spot when something goes wrong.",
      "If Manus encounters malicious content, it could unknowingly follow a hidden prompt, compromise your data or alter its behavior, and there may be no obvious sign that anything has happened until it\u2019s too late. There are also some concerns about where Manus sends and stores data. Security researchers have traced data back to servers in Shenzhen, China, raising red flags about surveillance, jurisdiction and who might ultimately have access to your information.",
      "So even if Manus isn\u2019t scraping anything too sensitive today, the combination of weak oversight, powerful automation and questionable data practices makes it far riskier than your average AI assistant.",
      "We reached out to Manus AI for a comment on this article but did not hear back before our deadline.",

      "GENAI, THE FUTURE OF FRAUD AND WHY YOU MAY BE AN EASY TARGET",
      "So, how can you protect yourself?",
      "As I\u2019ve mentioned, whether you use Manus AI or not, your personal information will still likely end up in its datasets, so the best way to protect yourself is to make your information difficult to find. Here are some things you can do.",
      "1) Be cautious about using Manus: With that level of autonomy, especially since it\u2019s a very new AI (not to mention the inconsistency in its privacy policy regarding governance), I wouldn\u2019t recommend using it quite yet. There\u2019s just too much damage it can do if it malfunctions or is subject to a prompt injection attack.",
      "2) Keep your personal information under wraps: With so many companies selling and trading personal information, many of them to tech companies to train AI, it\u2019s a good idea to withhold your data unless you absolutely can\u2019t avoid sharing it.",
      "3) Actively remove your personal information from the internet so your data can\u2019t be scraped by AI models like Manus: Set your social media to private, limit data collection through privacy settings and remove your information from data brokers and people-search sites. Autonomous cloud-based agents such as Manus are designed to extract and analyze vast amounts of online data, and your publicly available information can be swept into their training datasets without your knowledge or consent.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "4) Use strong antivirus software to help defend against the broader attack surface created by autonomous AI systems: Manus\u2019 ability to act independently and interact with external systems increases the risk of adversarial attacks and malware transmission, so robust endpoint security is essential to protect your devices and data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Use privacy-focused products and services: Whenever you cannot avoid sharing personal information, opt for companies that prioritize your privacy. For example, use the DuckDuckGo browser instead of Chrome and Brave or Proton Mail instead of Gmail.\u00a0Check out the best private and safe browser alternatives to Google.",
      "6) Keep all software updated, including your operating system, browsers and security tools, to patch vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit: As AI agents like Manus operate in the cloud and may interact with your systems, unpatched software can become an easy target for exploitation or unauthorized access. Therefore, it's always a good idea to keep software, operating systems, browsers and security tools\u00a0updated at all times.",
      "7) Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) on all your accounts: As AI-driven attacks and automated data extraction become more common,\u00a0MFA adds a crucial layer of defense, making it much harder for attackers to compromise your accounts, even if an AI system leaks or scrapes your credentials.",
      "8) Use strong, unique passwords for every account: As cloud-based AI agents like Manus can interact with external systems and potentially access sensitive data, unique passwords help prevent a breach of one account from leading to a broader compromise. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "As we move forward with AI like Manus, it\u2019s exciting to think about the possibilities, but it's also important to keep our eyes open about what it means for our personal data. Even if you never use Manus yourself, your info could still end up in its training data.",
      "So what can you do? Stay informed, take charge of your digital footprint and choose tools that prioritize your privacy. As AI keeps evolving, being proactive about your data is the best way to enjoy the benefits of innovation while keeping your personal info safe.",
      "Do you think companies behind powerful AI agents like Manus should be required to follow stricter privacy rules and independent oversight before they\u2019re allowed to collect and use people\u2019s data? Let us know by writing us at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Contact.",

      "One issue is the timing of a search found on McCabe's phone, where she looked up the phase, \"hos (sic) long to die in cold.\"",

      "Where Russia's war in Ukraine stands",
      "Trump last week conceded that his pledge to end the three-year-old war in Ukraine within 24 hours of taking office was \"figurative,\" acknowledging it was never a realistic goal. The conflict has claimed a reported 1 million casualties.",
      "\"I said that as an exaggeration,\"\u00a0he told reporters.",

      "But Putin has so far refused to enter any other brokered agreements, despite Kyiv\u2019s willingness to play ball even after the historic Oval Office blow-up between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February.",
      "Though Trump appeared to hold a grudge against Zelenskyy after Ukraine rejected a proposed mineral deal \u2014 even blaming him in part for Russia\u2019s illegal invasion \u2014 relations between the two leaders appeared to improve over the weekend. Trump also set a new ultimatum for Putin, issuing a deadline to reach a ceasefire deal.",
      "\"Two weeks or less,\"\u00a0Trump told reporters Sunday, though he later added a bit more time would be acceptable. \"We'll see what happens over the next few days. We'll probably learn a lot.\"",

      "Trump has not hit Hamas, nor have his negotiations to release hostages looked all that different from his predecessor's.",
      "The first phase of what was intended to be a three-phase ceasefire saw the return of 33 hostages taken by Hamas, the majority of whom were abducted in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, as well as the release of 1,800 Palestinian prisoners held by Jerusalem.",
      "But 59 hostages remain in Gaza, including American-Israeli Edan Alexander, and hopes of a second phase collapsed after negotiations stalled on terms surrounding future hostage releases, and in March Israel reignited military operations in the Gaza Strip.",

      "The idea floated was that Biden would give a speech directly to the Israeli public, presenting two options, according to his Middle East advisor Ilan Goldenberg. \"A lot of people were talking about, including in the Oval Office at times, the idea of, like, the President going out and giving a speech.

Your sons and daughters are going to keep fighting. Most of the hostages are going to come home dead.

That's what people were saying, like, \u2018let's just break this up because it's not going anywhere good.\u2019\"",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump called the U.S.-Canada border an \"artificial line\" while also declining to say whether Canada would lean right or left if it became a state.",
      "OTTAWA- In a dramatic reversal, the governing Liberals, who were trailing the official opposition Conservatives in the polls earlier this year, appear poised to win their fourth consecutive term in office thanks to President Donald Trump\u2019s threats against Canada\u2019s economy and sovereignty, according to election watchers.",
      "\"It looks like there will be a Liberal government, which seems to be what the polls point to, and it would be a very big surprise if the Conservatives won,\" Angus Reid, founder and chair of the Angus Reid Institute, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Trump posted advice to Canadian voters on Monday morning on Truth Social, saying in part, \"Good luck to the Great people of Canada. Elect the man who has the strength and wisdom to cut your taxes in half, increase your military power, for free, to the highest level in the World, have your Car, Steel, Aluminum, Lumber, Energy, and all other businesses, QUADRUPLE in size, WITH ZERO TARIFFS OR TAXES, if Canada becomes the cherished 51st.

      "\"This really has been an extraordinary election in that, by all rights, Canadians had it with the Liberals\u2019 woke policies and with their misspending and didn\u2019t like Trudeau,\" Reid said.",
      "He explained that the political dynamic changed when Justin Trudeau announced his resignation as Canada\u2019s 23rd prime minister and Trump was inaugurated as the 47th president in January, and former central bank governor Mark Carney succeeded Trudeau as prime minister and Liberal leader in March.",

      "\"Between tariffs and threats of annexation, Trump became the single most important issue in the country overnight,\" said Reid. \"That gave Mark Carney an opportunity to be the first out of the gate to say that we\u2019re not going to put up with this \u2013 we\u2019re a sovereign nation and we\u2019re going to fight.\"",

      "His detractors, however, have accused him of being out of touch and \"not connected to the common man\" and has spent a fair amount of time outside Canada, as a former deputy national Conservative Party campaign manager told Fox News Digital\u00a0last month.",
      "Meanwhile, Poilievre\u2019s message to voters is that he is the agent for \"change.\" However, his opponents claim the 45-year-old Conservative leader is part of the political establishment, having spent almost half of his life as a member of Parliament since he was first elected in 2004 \u2013 and the change he touts came with a shift in Liberal leadership from Trudeau to Carney.",

      "The results of an Ipsos poll conducted for Global News in Canada, released on April 21, showed a narrow three-point lead for the Liberals at 41% over the Conservatives at 38%.",
      "Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Global Public Affairs, told Fox News Digital that the Liberals were ahead of the Conservatives by 12 points in mid-April and have lost ground since \"because of the effect of Donald Trump, both positive and negative.\"",

      "\"When Donald Trump is in the news saying 51st-state stuff, that brings the focus back to the major issue that the Liberals lead on, which is dealing with him,\" said Bricker.",
      "\"But over the past two weeks, Donald Trump has kind of gone dark on Canada. He\u2019s been focused on China, U.S. government funding of Harvard University, and to the extent he\u2019s talking about trade, it\u2019s about global trade deals.\"",
      "That, said Bricker, has resulted in many Canadians returning to their pre-Trump main issue of affordability, through the lens of the Liberals running the government over the past decade.",
      "Ultimately, the outcome of Monday\u2019s general election will be decided by geography, according to Bricker, who said that the national vote \"will be won or lost\" in Ontario, particularly in Toronto and the surrounding so-called 905 region, which refers to the telephone area code, where there are 55 ridings (electoral districts) and about 4.5 million eligible voters.",
      "\"The 905 voted overwhelmingly for Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals three times,\" said Bricker. \"If they do it again, the Liberals will win a fourth consecutive term in office.\"",

      "Reid said that the Liberals\u2019 improved showing was not just about Canadians warming to Carney, but also about Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre\u2019s failure to turn the dial from focusing on a consumer carbon tax, which the Liberal leader canceled on April 1 in his first act as prime minister, and \"still reflecting on Trudeau long after he had gone, instead of jumping right away onto the Trump threat and becoming something that he would lead the charge on.\"",
      "The irony, in Reid\u2019s view, is that \"Trump imperiled the campaign of an individual who could be in many ways his stepbrother in Canada,\" he said about Poilievre, who he called \"mini-Trump,\" and his \"anti-woke,\" smaller-government stance \u2013 \"Trump-esque policies that the American right might want to see in Canada and certainly a lot of Canadians on the right want to see.\"",

      "Each month, international organizations send significant sums into Gaza's economy. The U.N.'s World Food Programme (WFP) transfers approximately $18.43 million, reaching 82,636 families, with each family receiving an average of $209, according to open-source data. UNICEF\u2019s monthly assistance averages $5 million, helping to reach at least 20,000 families every month.",
      "\"I go to the market and meet people whose job is to provide cash in exchange for a fee,\" Gaza resident Shahab Yousef told Israel's news agency TPS-IL. \"The fee is 20\u201330%. If I transfer 1,000 shekels [$271] I get back 700 [$190],\" he said. \"For big purchases, I pay digitally. But at the market, I need cash, and I lose 30 percent every time.\"",

      "The specific amount received per family every month is around $270 (or 1,000 New Israeli Shekels), which was calculated as 80% of the Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket, UNICEF told Fox News Digital. Smaller organizations like UNFPA and others also contribute, bringing the total to about $39.66 million per month, reaching 60% of Gaza\u2019s households, according to open-source data.",

However, the way this money circulates within Gaza is far more complex. \"Hamas controls\u00a0much of the cash that enters Gaza through various channels,\" Ofer told Fox News Digital, \"People who receive money via mobile apps must convert it into cash to use in local markets, but this involves hefty fees, with many money changers tied to Hamas or its allies.\"",
      "TPS-IL reported that Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa\u2019ar recently warned that Hamas\u2019s economic strength in Gaza relies on billions of shekels in cash, paid as salaries and quickly reclaimed through taxes on merchants. In a letter to Bank of Israel Governor Prof. Amir Yaron, Sa\u2019ar urged the cancelation of the circulation of 200-shekel bills previously introduced into Gaza, saying that experts believe the move would severely damage Hamas\u2019s financial network. The Bank of Israel rejected the proposal, citing technical reasons and claiming that implementation was not feasible.",

      "\"The shepherd whom the Lord gave to his people, Pope Francis, has ended his earthly life and has left us,\" Parolin said in his homily. \"The grief at his departure, the sense of sadness that assails us, the turmoil we feel in our hearts, the sense of bewilderment: we are experiencing all of this,\u00a0like the apostles grieving over the death of Jesus. Yet, the Gospel tells us that it is precisely in these moments of darkness that the Lord comes to us with the light of the resurrection, to illuminate our hearts.\"",

      "\"He reminded us that \u2018mercy\u2019 is the very name of God, and, therefore, no one can put a limit on his merciful love with which he wants to raise us up and make us new people. It is important to welcome as a precious treasure this principle on which Pope Francis insisted so much. And \u2013 allow me to say \u2013 our affection for him, which is being manifested in this time, must not remain a mere emotion of the moment; we must welcome his legacy and make it part of our lives, opening ourselves to God\u2019s mercy and also being merciful to one another,\" Parolin said. \"Mercy takes us back to the heart of faith.\"",

      "U.S. automakers are set to get a break on some of the sweeping tariffs President Donald Trump is imposing.",
      "Yet even with the new waivers, the outlook for America's longest-lived carmakers remains cloudy, with General Motors saying Tuesday it was \"reassessing\" its earnings guidance in light of the uncertainty over the tariffs impact.",
      "A White House spokesperson confirmed that automakers paying Trump\u2019s tariffs on imported cars, which went into effect this month, will not be forced to pay other duties Trump has implemented, like those on steel and aluminum.",
      "However, the exemptions are retroactive, meaning the firms must first pay the duties, then apply for reimbursement.",
      "In addition, U.S.-based automakers will also be eligible for reimbursement for tariffs on foreign-made auto parts, which are set to go into effect on Saturday, May 3. Those reimbursements would be equal to 3.75% of the value of a U.S.-made car for one year, then fall to 2.5% of the car\u2019s value in a second year, and then phased out altogether.",
      "The new breaks were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.",
      "The White House said the change was a reflection of cooperation between the administration and the auto industry.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is building an important partnership with both the domestic automakers and our great American workers,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement. \"This deal is a major victory for the President\u2019s trade policy by rewarding companies who manufacture domestically, while providing runway to manufacturers who have expressed their commitment to invest in America and expand their domestic manufacturing.\u201d",
      "Automakers applauded the new stance. Ford said it \"welcomes and appreciates these decisions by President Trump, which will help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers.\"",
      "GM CEO Mary Barra said the company was \"grateful to President Trump for his support of the U.S. automotive industry and the millions of Americans who depend on us.",
      "\"We believe the President\u2019s leadership is helping level the playing field for companies like GM and allowing us to invest even more in the U.S. economy,\" Barra said in a statement. \"We appreciate the productive conversations with the President and his Administration and look forward to continuing to work together.\u201d",
      "Stellantis, the company that owns Dodge, Ram and Jeep, said it appreciated Trump's \"tariff relief measures.\"",
      "\"While we further assess the impact of the tariff policies on our North American operations, we look forward to our continued collaboration with the U.S. Administration to strengthen a competitive American auto industry and stimulate exports,\" it said.",
      "Yet GM warned Tuesday that the impact to its financial position from the auto tariffs could still be \u201csignificant\" and as a result was \u201creassessing\u201d its guidance as it awaited \u201cgreater clarity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe prior guidance can\u2019t be relied upon, and we\u2019ll come back to the market with clarity as soon as we have it,\u201d the company said.",
      "GM shares were down about 2% when markets opened Tuesday.",
      "GM CFO Paul Jacobson declined to disclose how much the tariffs, including 25% levies on imported vehicles effective April 3, have cost the Detroit automaker thus far, CNBC reported. The company also moved its earnings call with investors to Thursday.",
      "Given that the automakers will have to apply for reimbursements, the new arrangement still poses potential cashflow concerns for the firms. U.S. customers could also still face higher costs depending on how the reimbursement policy ends up being implemented.",
      "While prices on new cars have held steady in recent quarters, they could increase this summer as the tariffs begin taking effect and \"pre-tariff\" inventory is sold, according to Cox Automotive Executive Analyst Erin Keating.",
      "\u201cHow high prices rise for consumers is still very much to be determined, as each automaker will handle the price puzzle differently,\" Keating told Kelley Blue Book, with prices up 10% to 15%."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has leaned heavily on executive power to remake the federal government at the outset of his new administration, largely leaving Congress on the sidelines.",
      "Instead of relying on members of the Republican-controlled House and Senate to pass laws to give him new authorities, Trump has sought to bypass Congress by invoking or repurposing existing laws to carry out his agenda since taking office in January. And he\u2019s received widespread support from his party on Capitol Hill, with Democrats mostly powerless to rein him in.",
      "Trump has so far signed just five bills into law \u2014 fewer than any president in the first 100 days of an administration since at least Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1950s, according to an NBC News analysis of data in the congressional record. By this time during his first term, Trump had signed 30 bills into law. In their first 100 days, Barack Obama had enacted 14 bills and Joe Biden had signed 11.",
      "\u201cHe hasn\u2019t signed many bills into law because the agenda of the first 100 days has not been a legislative agenda at all,\u201d said William Galston, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington. \u201cClearly the administration, before it took office, planned a whirlwind of activity for the first 100 days at a pace that was compatible only with executive action. And this is part of an effort not only to overwhelm doubters and opponents through shock and awe tactics, but also to permanently expand executive power.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would say that that is the most fundamental institutional objective of Donald Trump and his administration,\u201d he said.",
      "Three of the bills Trump signed this year were measures to terminate regulations established by Biden, which the GOP fast-tracked under the Congressional Review Act. Another was a stopgap bill to keep the government funded for six months. And one was a strict immigration detention measure\u00a0called the Laken Riley Act.",
      "While the government funding and immigration measures ultimately received some Democratic support, none of these measures were crafted on a bipartisan basis \u2014 a contrast to the way Congress operated at times during Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Trump is expected to soon sign a sixth bill into law, the \"Take It Down Act,\" which criminalizes the publication of nonconsensual, sexually explicit images and videos, including those generated by artificial intelligence. The House overwhelmingly passed it Monday night, sending it to Trump's desk.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s administration has sought out existing laws to reinterpret to advance his goals, drawing a wide array of legal challenges. He has reached as far back as the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to execute on mass deportations. And he has declared a national emergency to pursue sweeping tariffs on American allies and foes alike.",
      "Trump came into office with a limited legislative agenda of additional funding for immigration enforcement, new policies to expand domestic energy production, an expansion of the military and cutting taxes. He is calling on Republican lawmakers to pass all of that in one big bill and use an arcane budget procedure to cut Democrats out of the process.",
      "\u201cIn 100 days, President Trump has already made historic progress toward Making America Great Again by securing the border, restoring energy dominance, and tackling the Biden inflation crisis,\u201d White House spokesman Harrison Fields said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump looks forward to signing his one big beautiful bill very soon to codify the rest of his critical and commonsense agenda \u2014 once Congress sends it to his desk.\u201d",
      "Trump's big bet",
      "Trump has made a bet that Republicans will protect him from Democratic attempts to assert congressional power and limit his actions. So far, it\u2019s paying off.",
      "\u201cTrump, like America, is tired of waiting on Congress,\u201d said conservative Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn. \u201cAmerica wants action. If we don\u2019t have the guts to pass laws, then yes, I support him doing that,\u201d he said of Trump relying on executive action. \u201cStrong letters and hearings aren\u2019t enough.\u201d",
      "House Republicans have gone to great lengths to protect Trump\u2019s power to impose tariffs despite widespread skepticism of his actions, effectively prohibiting the chamber from voting on measures to revoke the tariffs.",
      "It isn\u2019t entirely unusual for presidents to reinterpret old laws for new goals. Biden tried to do it to forgive student loan debt, only to be blocked in court. Obama created the \u201cDACA\u201d program for undocumented youth and relied on years-old authorizations to carry out military strikes.",
      "What\u2019s unusual is the extent to which Trump is doing it, and the level of acquiescence he has received from his party in Congress.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has taken it to a wholly different level,\u201d Galston said. \u201cWhen the president says, as he frequently does, \u2018You\u2019ve never seen anything like it\u2019 \u2014 in this case, that\u2019s the literal truth. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen such an exact expansion or attempted expansion of executive power.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s exercise of power has been helped by the fact that his administration is \u201cstocked with loyalists,\u201d Galston added, unlike in his first term. Trump gained Senate approval for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., winning votes from senators who were openly uncomfortable with them.",
      "\u201cTrump was an outlier within his own party in 2017. Now, he\u2019s the dominant force in the party,\u201d he said.",

      "There are other reasons Congress hasn\u2019t sent many bills to Trump\u2019s desk. Republicans have little margin for error in the House, where they have a narrow 220-213 majority. And House-passed legislation has a higher threshold to clear in the Senate, where 60 votes are required to advance most bills.

      "And working with celebrity Kim Kardashian that year, Trump ushered a criminal justice reform package through Congress and signed it into law. The First Step Act was backed by a number of top Democrats, including Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who is now the House Democratic leader.",
      "In 2020, Trump helped negotiate and signed into law the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, replacing the long-standing free-trade deal known as NAFTA.",
      "A Republican aide attributed the scant legislative achievements so far this year to the fact that the Senate has been busy confirming Trump\u2019s nominees for his Cabinet and other key administrative posts. The aide also said the Biden administration timed some of its regulations to prevent the new Congress from quickly rolling them back under the Congressional Review Act.",
      "For their part, Democrats say Trump has shown no desire to work with them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s extremely disappointing that Trump 2.0 has shown zero interest in bipartisan governing,\u201d said Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., who voted for the opioid, criminal justice and USMCA bills, and is now running for governor. \u201cThis administration is shutting everyone out \u2014 choosing chaos and partisan retribution over action that would actually make life more affordable.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn 2017, we worked together on issues like criminal justice reform. This time, it\u2019s crickets,\u201d he added."

      "\"We take our responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to ensure that children are safe and protected,\" she said.",
      "In an interview, Mich P. Gonz\u00e1lez, the attorney for the mother deported with her 2-year-old child, said the woman was told to take her children to an immigration check-in, which was moved up from the original date.",
      "Gracie Willis, an attorney with the National Immigration Project, who represents the 2-year-old,\u00a0said in an interview on MSNBC that \u201cat every single point ICE denied anybody the ability to know where this family was, denied everybody the ability to contact with them and communicate with them.\u201d She said the child\u2019s father \u201cbarely had any opportunity to speak with the mother about what was best for the child before an ICE officer hung up the phone as he tried to give her the number for an attorney.\u201d",
      "ICE has provided a one-page note that it says was written by the mother, who is pregnant, and shows she gave her consent for the 2-year-old to be deported. The note is written in Spanish, with redactions in the top and bottom right corners. The note says, \u201cI will take my daughter [her name] with me to Honduras,\u201d with the date and time and the mother\u2019s name.",
      "But Gonz\u00e1lez, a co-founder of Sanctuary of the South, an immigration and LGBTQ civil rights cooperative, said ICE is \u201cmischaracterizing that this was her wish, that she willfully consented to this.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe statement does not show that this was her desire. It doesn\u2019t show that she\u2019s consenting to this. She was just writing down a fact. And after having spoken with her, it\u2019s clear that she was felt forced to do this. She felt absolutely forced to write this,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said.",
      "\u2018She did not sign anything\u2019",
      "Attorneys for the mother of the child with cancer said she, the boy and his sister, 7, who's also a U.S. citizen, were flown to Honduras on Friday morning. Attorneys say that the mother wasn\u2019t able to speak to family members or her lawyers before they were sent out of the country and that she didn\u2019t willingly take her children with her.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union said ICE was told in advance about the child\u2019s medical needs.",
      "\u201cShe did not sign anything, did not write anything and did not consent to anything expressly. The entire time she was trying very aggressively to speak to her lawyer,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cAs a matter of fact, she was trying to get ahold of a phone to try to call her family and her attorney. But she wasn\u2019t being allowed.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe did not sign anything. She did not consent to any of this. She very much wanted to make other plans for her two U.S. citizen children, especially because her 4-year-old was actively getting cancer treatment here in the United States,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cNot only did they deport this family against the mother\u2019s wishes; they were deported without the child\u2019s medication.\u201d",
      "Some legal advocates warn there are other cases in which mothers\u2019 deportations could put U.S. citizen children at risk.",
      "In Florida, an attorney for America Perez Ramirez, 52, said the Department of Homeland Security sent a notice telling her client to check in at an ICE field office and bring tickets for a direct flight to Mexico for her and her U.S. citizen 11-year-old daughter.",
      "Her daughter, Yoselin, has a life-threatening rare genetic disorder known as Maple Syrup Urine Disease, in which the body can\u2019t break down certain amino acids.\u00a0Perez Ramirez lost two other children to the disease. The girl\u2019s University of Florida doctor wrote a letter on her behalf, saying: \u201cYoselin needs to be in United States with her mother to manage her MSUD. ... She would not survive without the care she is currently receiving.\u201d",
      "Perez Ramirez is in the middle of a labor trafficking case. She came to the United States on an H2-B visa, recruited by an employer who ended up exploiting her and confiscating her visa, her attorney said. She has been able to get four previous stays of deportation under previous administrations that acknowledged the girl\u2019s serious medical condition, but this time, \u201cwe couldn\u2019t even file a stay because they said, \u2018We\u2019ve given you four of them already, and we\u2019re not giving any more.\u2019\u201d",
      "The deportation would have forced her to take her daughter with her because there is no one else to make sure she gets medical care.",
      "Bridgette M. Bennett, who represents Perez Ramirez, said: \u201cShe was supposed to leave on Saturday, but the only thing that kept her here was the fact that her daughter\u2019s passport is expired.\u201d Bennett is trying to keep her from being deported, arguing there\u2019s no one else to care for the girl with her condition."

    "summary": "As Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter tour kicks off, thousands of cheap tickets are still for sale",
    "story": [
      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Just months ago, a fan could expect to spend up to $800 for a presale ticket to the opening night of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Cowboy Carter Tour in Los Angeles.",
      "But hours before the doors to SoFi Stadium were set to open Monday, tickets for night one of the tour had dipped to as low as $57.50 \u2014 and thousands of seats appeared to remain available in resale markets, including on Ticketmaster.",
      "Some of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s upcoming shows haven\u2019t had such dramatic price drops. But prices have fallen to varying degrees across all of her tour dates, with several stadiums still offering up significant chunks of their seats for the nights of her tour.",
      "The lower prices have generated a mix of surprise and resentment, with some concertgoers saying online that it\u2019s the latest instance in which they felt frustration over the ticket-buying process. As concert ticket prices have continued to increase in recent years, so, too, has consumer backlash at ticketing companies for what fans have described as high fees and unchecked scalping.",
      "Some hoped to take advantage of the lower prices, only to find efforts to trade up for better tickets thwarted by the companies from which they bought them.",
      "Several members of the Beyhive, the nickname for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s fervent fan base, shared tips on TikTok with fellow fans about how to successfully navigate the upgrade process. But many others said they had no luck. Ticketmaster\u2019s exchange policy stipulates that buyers can change or upgrade their tickets only for ones that are of \u201cequal or greater price than your current tickets.\u201d",
      "Ticketmaster didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.",
      "Jada Rivera and Kira Chase, who drove to Los Angeles from Arizona, said they were upset about having paid over $1,200 for their presale tickets, only to later fork over an extra $300 to upgrade their seats, even though other tickets were available in the same section for half the price.",
      "\u201cThat first sale is normally the cheapest, so that\u2019s why we kind of jumped on it, because we thought it was only going to get more expensive from there,\u201d Chase said. \u201cAnd then we just kind of watched those tickets drop. We tried to talk to Ticketmaster about it. They weren\u2019t much help.\u201d",
      "And it\u2019s not just Los Angeles concertgoers. Nationwide, many fans online shared similar feelings of regret at having opted to buy tickets early.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s extremely frustrating, because Ticketmaster gave the illusion that the concert was selling out or sold out when I was in the presale,\u201d said Paul Poulos Jr., who said he has stuck with his original $281 nosebleed seat for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s May 28 show at New Jersey\u2019s MetLife Stadium. \u201cThey had little to no tickets available, so it made it seem like it was this seat or not be in attendance at all.\u201d",
      "When he contacted Ticketmaster to upgrade to a better section, he said, he was refused because the tickets he wanted were $20 cheaper than what he had already paid. The only way to upgrade now, he said, is if he chooses more expensive tickets available in that section for $100 more.",
      "He said he was surprised by the development, as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s last tour quickly sold out, with resale prices reaching up to double or triple those of the original tickets.",
      "Demand for her 2023 Renaissance Tour was so high that some American fans flew to Europe to secure cheaper tickets. Fans also flocked to theaters for her subsequent concert film of the tour, which sold so successfully that it significantly helped boost AMC\u2019s revenue.",
      "The momentum appeared to continue when Beyonc\u00e9 released \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d last year. The album quickly surpassed 1 billion streams on Spotify, becoming its most-streamed album in a single day in 2024. In February, \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d won album of the year at the Grammys.",
      "But stalling ticket sales for her latest concert tour have stoked some questions about whether it indicates consumer exhaustion or whether the appeal of one of the biggest global superstars has somehow waned.",
      "A spokesperson for Beyonc\u00e9 didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "For megatours like Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s, the tour promoter and artist the management team typically settle on an aggressive pricing strategy, then \u201csupercharge\u201d it by rolling out limited batches of tickets via presales, said Dave Clark, editor of\u00a0TicketNews.com, a live events industry publication.",
      "Clark, who did not have firsthand knowledge of how the Beyonc\u00e9\u2019 tour was planned, said that can pressure consumers to buy at whatever the asking price may be during the initial hours when tickets are available.",
      "\u201cIt seems like this is just the latest example of a tour being way too aggressive with its pricing strategy,\u201d Clark said. \u201cFrom the jump, there were a ton of complaints coming from fans about what the asking price was \u2014 not only the raw numbers being high, but also it being a wildly unpredictable experience in terms of different presales featuring different prices, which featured different prices from the general public sale.\u201d",
      "Some fans remained excited just to see Queen Bey perform live \u2014 even if it meant shelling out more than they necessarily needed to.",
      "Kristy Larson, who was at SoFi Stadium on Monday, said she has come to terms with the price change, even though she paid $250 for her seats. She said that while some fans might benefit from buying last-minute cheap tickets, she prefers the comfort of knowing she has her seats secured.",
      "\u201cIf you want to make sure you have a row for you and your friends and you have the experience you want, then I think you have to throw down some money, make some choices,\u201d Larson said. \u201cShe [Beyonc\u00e9] is going to take all my money tonight, and it\u2019s totally OK with me.\u201d",
      "By Monday evening, Parkwood Entertainment, the entertainment and management company\u00a0founded by Beyonc\u00e9, posted on X that night one was sold out."

      "Health and Human Services\u00a0Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is planning to launch a\u00a0sweeping, four-year public relations campaign called \u201cTake Back Your Health\u201d\u00a0that could cost tens of millions of dollars, according to a document obtained by NBC News.",
      "The\u00a0initiative comes as Kennedy is\u00a0conducting\u00a0sweeping budget cuts\u00a0that could eliminate 10,000 jobs and several HHS divisions, including global health and domestic HIV prevention.",
      "The document, a request for proposals,\u00a0calls for public relations firms to bid to run the campaign. The winning firm would employ up to 30\u00a0people\u00a0to manage the campaign and oversee the purchase of up to three ads a day\u00a0on\u00a0five major television networks.",
      "The\u00a0total\u00a0dollar amount for the campaign is not listed in the document. But a\u00a0person familiar\u00a0with the campaign\u00a0said that\u00a0labor costs are expected to be at least $20 million and estimated that television and digital ad purchases could cost tens of millions over the next four years.",
      "An HHS official praised the initiative.",
      "\u201cEmpowering Americans with the knowledge to make healthy decisions is central to HHS\u2019s mission. Our upcoming ad campaign is both an investment in our nation\u2019s wellbeing and a commitment to Make America Healthy Again,\" the official said in a statement. \"While HHS has not disclosed specific costs for the initiative, the competitive RFP process is designed to ensure funds are used wisely and deliver the greatest return on investment for the American people.\u201d",
      "The campaign will seek to address Americans' chronic health problems by inspiring them to \"take control of their health\u201d and pledge to adopt healthier habits like eating well and exercising,\u00a0according to the document.\u00a0The campaign will also create a fitness challenge expanding the Presidents\u2019 Youth Fitness program to adults.",
      "Richard Frank, director of the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center on Health Policy, said the campaign's messages sounded positive and reminiscent of previous federal public health campaigns.",
      "Frank,\u00a0who learned of the plan from NBC News,\u00a0also cautioned that some people's income and socio-economic status limit their ability to eat healthier organic food and exercise more often.",
      "Frank\u00a0cited people who live in \u201cfood deserts\u201d where\u00a0healthy\u00a0and affordable food is not easily available. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a lot of fresh foods and vegetables,\u201d\u00a0he said.\u00a0\u201cAnd no amount of ads will fix that problem.\u201d",
      "The \u201cTake the Pledge\u201d feature of the campaign will include \u201cshareable badges\u201d as well as partnerships with gyms, health stores and wellness centers, according to the document.",
      "The document does not mention accompanying funding for recreational activities or physical education, but it does seek to promote \u201cclean eating\u201d and \u201cspiritual growth.\u201d",
      "One example of how the campaign could encourage healthier and different food choices was described as creating a partnership \u201cwith a grocery chain to promote healthy eating by providing discounts on nutritious foods alongside campaign messaging.\u201d",
      "The success of the campaign will be measured by audience reach, engagement, shift in perception and behavior change,\u00a0according to the document.",
      "Surveys and polls will be conducted to measure behavior change. Participants will be asked to self-report if they took\u00a0actions such as \u201cexercising more, eating more whole food, incorporating meditation into daily routine.\u201d",
      "HHS is also exploring ways to promote healthy messages\u00a0across its\u00a0headquarters,\u00a0which\u00a0sits\u00a0at the foot of Capitol Hill.\u00a0A recent \u201crequest for information\u201d posted by the department online\u00a0calls\u00a0for bids to produce a graphic vinyl wrap that could encase the building and display a message to \"promote a healthy America.\u201d",
      "The Take Back Your Health campaign is reminiscent of former-first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s 2010 \u201cLet\u2019s Move\u201d campaign. That effort aimed at combating childhood obesity by promoting healthy eating and physical activity.\u00a0It also included a website and a reboot of the presidential physical fitness program.",
      "In 2020, then-President Donald Trump reversed changes to the school nutrition programs that Michelle Obama had championed as part of the \u201cLet\u2019s Move\u201d campaign. Obama\u2019s campaign also resulted in additional funding for school nutrition and farmers' markets. It\u2019s not clear if Kennedy\u2019s campaign will include increased spending on nutrition or health care."

      "Thousands of people who fled Haiti could be forced back to a country dealing with vast gang violence and political turmoil if a judge clears the runway for the Trump administration to end a Biden-era immigration program.",
      "Kevinson Jean, 28, said receiving a letter from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services informing him that he needed to self-deport was terrifying. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do. It felt like a nightmare,\u201d he said.",
      "In 2023, the Jeans were granted entry under Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela (CHNV) Humanitarian Sponsorship Program, which provided temporary legal status for more than 500,000 people to stay in the U.S. An executive order from President Donald Trump revoking the program was to go into effect April 24, with the administration describing the program as a \u201cbroad abuse\u201d of the immigration parole system. A judge temporarily blocked Trump\u2019s order earlier this month. The Trump administration appealed the ruling, and the First Circuit court could rule on the program\u2019s status imminently.",
      "The Jeans\u2019 home country, however, is in the middle of a security and humanitarian crisis. Gangs now control most of Port-au-Prince and violence displaced more than 60,000 people in February alone, according to the United Nations.",
      "Trump told NBC News on April 21, that if the Jeans came to the U.S. \u201clegally, then they\u2019re going to be in good shape\u201d to remain. A statement to NBC News from the Department of Homeland Security described the CHNV program as \u201can unlawful scheme.\u201d",
      "The couple\u2019s journey to the U.S. began in 2019 when Jean befriended Kimberly Snelgrooes, the founder of the nonprofit Christian ministry Hills of His Grace, during a short-term mission trip to Haiti. He began working for the organization, overseeing ministry activities, handling funds and supporting community outreach and humanitarian aid efforts.",
      "The job, though, put a target on his back. Jean said he was held at gunpoint in Port-au-Prince by people demanding cash he had collected for Hills of His Grace\u2019s operations in 2021.",
      "Overall, Jean described the security situation in Haiti as chaotic, citing incidents of gang violence and armed robberies, leaving bodies in the streets. Drone strikes intended to target gangs sometimes hit civilians.",
      "Pierre Esperance, a human rights activist in Haiti, said the country has always had problems, but the current levels of violence are unprecedented.",
      "\u201cGangs are occupying 95% of the capital,\u201d Esperance said. \u201cThey have guns; they have a large presence. They attack whenever they want. They set fire to whatever they want. The police have been weakened, and the government has collapsed.\u201d",
      "The violence led Snelgrooes to help Jean and his wife, Sherlie, apply for the CHNV Humanitarian Sponsorship Program to enter the U.S. The couple made their way to Panhandle, Texas, where the community has rallied around them.",
      "Joshua Light, the pastor of First Baptist Church Panhandle, met Jean in 2020 during a mission trip to Haiti, where Jean worked as a translator. The couple\u2019s kindness left a lasting impression on the pastor.",
      "His church also helped bring the Jeans to the U.S. under humanitarian parole. Now, Light and the congregation are concerned about the possibility of their deportation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking. They\u2019ve contributed positively to society, and they want to do everything right,\u201d Light said. \u201cTo target people who have broken no laws for political points is unfair.\u201d",
      "Panhandle is in Carson County, where 90% of voters chose Trump in the 2024 election. Despite the town\u2019s conservative leanings, Light has been vocal in his support for the couple.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a Republican, but I understand that Kevinson and Sherlie are good people who deserve to stay,\u201d he said, emphasizing that compassion should transcend political boundaries.",
      "Without work authorization or a green card, the couple lives in constant fear of deportation. \u201cGoing back to Haiti is like a death sentence,\u201d Jean said, citing the threats he faced due to his former job. \u201cI\u2019ll be a target the moment I land.\u201d",
      "The ongoing instability has made flying to Port-au-Prince, the capital, nearly impossible. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous and very expensive to return,\u201d Jean said. \u201cHow can we self-deport when we don\u2019t even have the means to get back?\u201d",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration suspended U.S. airline flights to Haiti in late 2024 after gangs shot at multiple planes near the airport, including a Spirit Airlines flight. JetBlue and American Airlines also reported their planes were hit by gunfire. Humanitarian flights are limited, and the United Nations has redirected some aid flights to other airports, making it nearly impossible for most people to return to Haiti.",
      "The couple has also expressed concerns about being sent to a third country like El Salvador. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the language or culture. It would be worse than going back to Haiti,\u201d Jean added.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, the Department of Homeland Security said that Haitians in the U.S. who have been ordered to return can go to the northern part of the country, instead of Port-au-Prince, as well as other countries that have agreed to take Haitian migrants.",

      "Mahdawi explained he has faith because of the people using their voices to condemn his arrest. But also because he believes \"in the system of democracy\" in the U.S., and he's inspired by the resilience of Gazans, who, he says, despite experiencing genocide, have kept their faith.",
      "Growing up in the al-Fara\u2019a refugee camp, Mahdawi witnessed Israeli military violence and was shot in the leg at 15 by an Israeli soldier, according to court documents. He immigrated to the U.S. over a decade ago and began attending Columbia University in 2021, where he became a key organizer of pro-Palestinian protests on campus last year.",
      "He told NPR that \"freedom was just a concept\" to him before he moved to the U.S. from the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He added that his freedom is now in jeopardy following his arrest.",
      "\"I think this is a red flag, not only to me, but to the American people who care about freedom, the right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness,\" Mahdawi said, quoting the Declaration of Independence. \"I have the hope that this country will fulfill its promise.\"",
      "On April 14, Mahdawi walked into what he thought was the final step to becoming a U.S. citizen. He told NPR that he believed it could be \"a trap\" \u2014\u00a0especially after another passport holder, Mahmoud Khalil, had been detained a month earlier. Mahdawi, however, still showed up at an empty embassy and was told he wasn't scheduled for a naturalization interview. He was shortly arrested by ICE agents who were masked and visibly armed, per court filings.",
      "Mahdawi told NPR\u00a0that he was worried the agents were taking him to Louisiana, as they had done with Khalil, isolating him from his community and legal support in Vermont, where he is a resident. They missed the flight by a few minutes, and Mahdawi's attorneys were able to persuade a judge to detain him in Vermont, a decision the Trump administration has not been successful in reversing.",
      "Mahdawi\u2019s attorneys have since argued that the Trump administration has violated his First Amendment right to free speech. They did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Now sitting in a Vermont correctional facility, Mahdawi invoked a Martin Luther King Jr. quote in his interview with NPR: \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\"",
      "\"The injustice that I am facing here, and the injustice that the anti-war movement is facing, is also connected to the injustice that the Palestinian people are going through,\" he said. \"We're talking about 55,000 people who have been killed. We see children being killed, amputated, losing their parents, no homes. This is what's moving us.\"",
      "And to U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who claim that Mahdawi's \"presence and activities in the United States would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences,\" he says it's a form of gaslighting.",
      "\"The government is gaslighting the American people and especially the American Jewish communities,\" he said. \"In fact, we had so many Jews and Israelis who actually joined us in saying 'Ceasefire now.' So, they are actually weaponizing antisemitism in order to destroy the hope that America has, which is universities and liberal institutions.\"",
      "Representatives for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Mahdawi added that, despite all of this, he still wants to be an American \u2014 and that he has demonstrated his will and desire to become one.",
      "\"I want to also remind everybody, the definition of the government in the constitution,\" he said. \"'We The People,' and I am counting on the people who I've got the chance to know as kind hearted, good people, to stand up for what is right.\"",
      "A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, at which a judge will decide whether Mahdawi will be released or deported."

    "story": [
      "A man who worked for a prominent German far-right lawmaker in the European Parliament has been charged with spying for China for more than four years, authorities said Tuesday.",
      "The office of the federal prosecutor accused Jian Guo of working for a Chinese intelligence service and of repeatedly passing on information on negotiations and decisions in the European Parliament between September 2019 and April 2024, when he was arrested.",
      "He also allegedly snooped on Chinese dissidents in Germany.",
      "Guo, a German citizen, remains in custody. The federal prosecutor has named him as Jian G., in line with the country\u2019s privacy rules. His former boss, far-right lawmaker Maximilian Krah, previously identified him. Krah did not immediately return a request for comment Tuesday.",
      "The federal prosecutor alleges that Guo obtained more than 500 documents, including some that the EU Parliament had classified as particularly sensitive, for the Chinese intelligence service, his employer since 2002.",
      "Guo also allegedly gathered information on prominent politicians with the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD.",
      "A Chinese citizen who worked for a company that provides logistics services, identified as Yaqi X., was also charged. She allegedly helped Guo by providing him with information regarding flights, cargo and passengers at Leipzig Airport. She passed along information about military equipment transport as well as details about people with connections to a German arms company, the federal prosecutor said.",
      "China\u2019s foreign ministry last year said reports in Europe about Chinese spying are all \u201chyping up with an aim to smear and suppress China.\u201d",
      "Guo\u2019s arrest cast an unflattering light on the AfD, which already faced criticism for having Russia-friendly positions.",
      "Krah at the time had been AfD\u2019s top candidate in the European Parliament elections, which occurred last June. Krah said there was no wrongdoing on his part and vowed to investigate.",
      "The party banned him from the E.U. elections weeks later after he told an Italian newspaper that not all members of the Nazis\u2019 elite SS unit, which was involved in major war crimes during World War II, were war criminals.",
      "Still, he won a seat in the German parliament earlier this year as part of the party\u2019s historic gains in the Bundestag during the national election.",
      "AfD\u2019s second-place finish cemented the party\u2019s status as a factor that other politicians can\u2019t ignore, but mainstream German parties have upheld the so-called \u201cfirewall\u201d by refusing to work with it."

      "The removals come after the Trump administration issued\u00a0an executive order to remove pieces of history from Smithsonian museums\u00a0in D.C.",
      "In March, Trump ordered Vice President JD Vance to oversee the elimination of \u201cimproper, divisive, or anti-American\u201d ideology throughout the Smithsonian Institution museums.",
      "The Smithsonian Institution receives federal funding and was created by Congress in 1846 and is governed by a Board of Regents, which includes the vice president.",
      "\u201cOnce widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement, the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,\u201d Trump\u2019s order reads. \u201cThis shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\u201d",
      "A month after the order was issued, owners of some historical objects loaned to the NHAAMC said their items are being wiped from the displays.",
      "Some visitors were shocked to see some gone, saying they strategically planned their visits to be able to see the most artifacts in case some were removed.",
      "Civil rights activist Rev. Amos Brown says he was recently notified that two of the artifacts he loaned to the museum would be returned to him.",
      "He described one of the books written by Rev. George Washington Williams in 1880 as a \u201cprecious and most historic book\u201d and the \u201cfirst history of the Negro race.\u201d",
      "The other book was a Bible he took to demonstrations with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Jesse Jackson.",
      "Brown said he lent the artifacts to the Smithsonian in 2016. He said the museum always gave him the option of donating the books permanently or renewing the loan, but this time he wasn\u2019t asked.",
      "\u201cIt is downright dishonest and it is demeaning,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI hope people of good will, of conscience and common sense will rise up and say \u2018we need to stop this.\u2019\u201d",
      "Jeff Anderson, a tourist from Louisiana, hoped to see the museum before any changes were made.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that fear of Black people finding out their history has caused that kind of thing, you know,\u201d Anderson said.",
      "Others who have visited the museum before the removals started can point out the recent changes. Aaron Weaver, a Virginia resident, said the Smithsonian board needs to \u201cstep up, plain and simple.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know certain exhibits that were there that were missing, like Nat Turner\u2019s Bible was one,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cWoolworth, the Greensboro massacre table that was missing as well, but the digital display was still there.\u201d",
      "Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institute\u2019s chief spokesperson, released a statement in response to visitors seeing artifacts being removed from exhibits.",
      "\u201cThe Greensboro, NC, lunch counter is not leaving the Smithsonian. It is on display at the National Museum of American History where it has been for many years,\" Thomas said. \"The National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) also has two stools from the original counter; one is on exhibit at all times, the other rotates in so that they can be properly preserved.",
      "\"The Bible and book belong to Rev. Brown of San Francisco who generously loaned them to the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture for an exhibition.

      "With regard to the loan, NMAAHC added, \"As part of our commitment to responsible stewardship, we will continue to honor all loan agreements, including the timely return of objects. These will be going back to the owner.\"",

      "Dr. Marc Gourevitch, a professor in the department of population health at New York University\u2019s Grossman School of Medicine, said research shows that states with policies that support a more livable minimum wage and paid sick leave, as well as access to affordable medical care, are more likely to show significant life expectancy gains over time.",
      "\u201cFocusing on policies that help people better meet their everyday needs promises to go a long way in improving life expectancy and, with it, giving more people a chance at getting to watch their grandchildren grow,\u201d said Gourevitch, who wasn\u2019t involved in the Yale study.",

    "story": [
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. \u2014 The Trump administration said Monday that the University of Pennsylvania violated laws guaranteeing women equal opportunities in athletics by letting a transgender swimmer compete on the school\u2019s women\u2019s team and into team facilities.",
      "The administration\u2019s statement does not name Lia Thomas, the transgender swimmer who last competed for the Ivy League school in Philadelphia in 2022 and was the first openly transgender athlete to win a Division I title that year \u2014 an award Thomas now faces losing.",
      "But the investigation opened in February by the U.S. Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights focused on Thomas, who became a leading symbol of transgender athletes and a prominent political target of Republicans and President Donald Trump.",
      "The department said Penn violated a law barring sex discrimination in schools and colleges, called Title IX, by \u201cdenying women equal opportunities by permitting males to compete in women\u2019s intercollegiate athletics and to occupy women-only intimate facilities.\u201d",
      "Penn had no immediate comment Monday, but Penn has said in the past that it always followed NCAA and Ivy League policies regarding student participation on athletic teams, both when Thomas swam and currently.",
      "The department said Penn has 10 days to voluntarily resolve the violations or risk prosecution.",
      "The department wants Penn to issue a statement saying that it will comply with Title IX; effectively strip Thomas of any awards or records in Division I swimming competitions; and apologize to each female swimmer \u201cwhose individual recognition is restored expressing an apology on behalf of the university for allowing her educational experience in athletics to be marred by sex discrimination.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration in March suspended approximately $175 million in federal funding for Penn over its decision to let Thomas compete, the White House has said. The Ivy League school\u2019s federal money came from the Defense Department and the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "In 2022, the NCAA used a sport-by-sport approach to allowing transgender athletes to participate, deferring to an individual sport\u2019s national governing organization, international federation or prior established International Olympic Committee criteria.",
      "Thomas competed under those guidelines, which allowed female transgender swimmers who had completed one year of hormone replacement therapy to compete.",
      "The NCAA changed its policy the day after Trump signed an executive order on Feb. 5 that was intended to ban transgender athletes from competing in girls and women\u2019s sports. That ended its sport-by-sport practice in favor of a blanket policy that only allows athletes assigned female at birth to participate in women\u2019s sports.",
      "The Education Department also opened reviews of San Jose State University volleyball, Denver Public Schools, Portland Public Schools, Oregon School Activities Association and the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association.",
      "It also sued the state of Maine to force it to ban transgender athletes from girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports or face prosecution."

      "U.S. automakers are set to get a break on some of the sweeping tariffs President Donald Trump is imposing.",
      "Yet even with the new waivers, the outlook for America's longest-lived carmakers remains cloudy, with General Motors saying Tuesday it was \"reassessing\" its earnings guidance in light of the uncertainty over the tariffs impact.",
      "A White House spokesperson confirmed that automakers paying Trump\u2019s tariffs on imported cars, which went into effect this month, will not be forced to pay other duties Trump has implemented, like those on steel and aluminum.",
      "However, the exemptions are retroactive, meaning the firms must first pay the duties, then apply for reimbursement.",
      "In addition, U.S.-based automakers will also be eligible for reimbursement for tariffs on foreign-made auto parts, which are set to go into effect on Saturday, May 3. Those reimbursements would be equal to 3.75% of the value of a U.S.-made car for one year, then fall to 2.5% of the car\u2019s value in a second year, and then phased out altogether.",
      "The new breaks were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.",
      "The White House said the change was a reflection of cooperation between the administration and the auto industry.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is building an important partnership with both the domestic automakers and our great American workers,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement. \"This deal is a major victory for the President\u2019s trade policy by rewarding companies who manufacture domestically, while providing runway to manufacturers who have expressed their commitment to invest in America and expand their domestic manufacturing.\u201d",
      "Automakers applauded the new stance. Ford said it \"welcomes and appreciates these decisions by President Trump, which will help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers.\"",
      "GM CEO Mary Barra said the company was \"grateful to President Trump for his support of the U.S. automotive industry and the millions of Americans who depend on us.",
      "\"We believe the President\u2019s leadership is helping level the playing field for companies like GM and allowing us to invest even more in the U.S. economy,\" Barra said in a statement. \"We appreciate the productive conversations with the President and his Administration and look forward to continuing to work together.\u201d",
      "Stellantis, the company that owns Dodge, Ram and Jeep, said it appreciated Trump's \"tariff relief measures.\"",
      "\"While we further assess the impact of the tariff policies on our North American operations, we look forward to our continued collaboration with the U.S. Administration to strengthen a competitive American auto industry and stimulate exports,\" it said.",
      "Yet GM warned Tuesday that the impact to its financial position from the auto tariffs could still be \u201csignificant\" and as a result was \u201creassessing\u201d its guidance as it awaited \u201cgreater clarity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe prior guidance can\u2019t be relied upon, and we\u2019ll come back to the market with clarity as soon as we have it,\u201d the company said.",
      "GM shares were down about 2% when markets opened Tuesday.",
      "GM CFO Paul Jacobson declined to disclose how much the tariffs, including 25% levies on imported vehicles effective April 3, have cost the Detroit automaker thus far, CNBC reported. The company also moved its earnings call with investors to Thursday.",
      "Given that the automakers will have to apply for reimbursements, the new arrangement still poses potential cashflow concerns for the firms. U.S. customers could also still face higher costs depending on how the reimbursement policy ends up being implemented.",
      "While prices on new cars have held steady in recent quarters, they could increase this summer as the tariffs begin taking effect and \"pre-tariff\" inventory is sold, according to Cox Automotive Executive Analyst Erin Keating.",
      "\u201cHow high prices rise for consumers is still very much to be determined, as each automaker will handle the price puzzle differently,\" Keating told Kelley Blue Book, with prices up 10% to 15%."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 A man arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following the death of ice hockey player Adam Johnson has been told he will not face any charges, British prosecutors said Tuesday.",
      "Johnson played for the Nottingham Panthers and died shortly after his neck had been sliced in a collision with Sheffield Steelers defenseman Matt Petgrave during a game on Oct. 28, 2023.",
      "A man was arrested two weeks later and though South Yorkshire Police has not publicly identified him, Petgrave said in a crowdfunding appeal for legal fees that he\u2019s the subject of a police investigation.",
      "On Tuesday, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided it would not bring criminal charges against the man arrested following what it described as \u201ca shocking and deeply upsetting incident.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe CPS and South Yorkshire Police have worked closely together to determine whether any criminal charges should be brought against the other ice hockey player involved,\u201d Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor Michael Quinn said.",
      "\u201cFollowing a thorough police investigation and a comprehensive review of all the evidence by the CPS, we have concluded that there is not a realistic prospect of conviction for any criminal offence and so there will not be a prosecution. Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Adam Johnson.\u201d",
      "After his arrest, Petgrave had been re-bailed several times while the investigation took place.",
      "Johnson had skated with the puck into Sheffield\u2019s defensive zone when Petgrave collided with another Panthers player nearby. Petgrave\u2019s left skate elevated as he began to fall and the blade hit Johnson in the neck.",
      "The native of Hibbing, Minnesota, was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. The death of the 29-year-old former Pittsburgh Penguins player sparked debate across the sport about improving safety for players.",
      "Petgrave, a 32-year-old Canadian, had support from some of Johnson\u2019s teammates. Victor Bj\u00f6rkung had told a Swedish newspaper there \u201cisn\u2019t a chance that it\u2019s deliberate.\u201d Bj\u00f6rkung had played the pass to Johnson and said he was traumatized by what he saw. He left the team as a result.",
      "Johnson was in his first season at Nottingham \u2014 one of the \u201cimport\u201d players in the Elite Ice Hockey League \u2014 after stints in Germany and a handful of games for the Penguins in the 2018-19 and 2019-20 seasons.",
      "Johnson was living with fianc\u00e9e Ryan Wolfe and studying at Loughborough Business School.",
      "The English Ice Hockey Association, which governs the sport below the Elite League, reacted to Johnson\u2019s death by requiring all players in England to wear neck guards from the start of 2024."

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 13:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Women who survive cancer are more likely to experience cancer-related fatigue and depression than men, according to new research presented Tuesday at the American Association for Cancer Research\u2019s annual meeting in Chicago.",
    "story": [
      "Women who survive cancer are more likely to experience cancer-related fatigue and depression than men, according to new research presented Tuesday at the American Association for Cancer Research\u2019s annual meeting in Chicago.",
      "As a result, women are less likely to engage in recreational physical activity, which over time exacerbates their symptoms and lowers their quality of life, the research suggests.",
      "The new findings build on previous research that found women develop more severe side effects during cancer treatment than men. They also underscore the \u201cvery real consequences\u201d that cancer treatment can have for women after they\u2019ve entered remission, said Joseph Unger, a biostatician and cancer researcher with the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle who was not involved in the study.",
      "\u201cCancer treatments are becoming more effective at keeping patients alive and turning cancer into more of a chronic disease,\u201d said Unger, who studies cancer patients\u2019 quality of life. \u201cUnderstandably, patients don\u2019t want to just live, they want to live well. So, that\u2019s really where this research helps to point us in the next direction.\u201d",
      "Dr. Simo Du, lead author of the study and internal medicine resident physician at NYC Health + Hospitals/Jacobi, had noticed that many more female than male cancer survivors in her clinic were complaining of fatigue that made it hard to shop for groceries, get dressed, shower and do other social or hygiene-related activities.",
      "To better understand how this disparity affected patients\u2019 quality of life, Du and her colleagues analyzed responses from 1,555 adult cancer survivors that were included in the 2015-2016 and 2017-2020 cohorts of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.",
      "Participants answered questions about whether they feel hopeless, deal with poor appetite, experience trouble sleeping and have thoughts of self-harm. They also completed questionnaires about the type of physical activities they participate in.",
      "Overall, the researchers said, the responses could be extrapolated to 25 million survivors with over 20 different types of cancer across the U.S., including those of the prostate, breast, skin, colon and cervix.",
      "The findings have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal.",
      "Why women have worse quality of life after cancer",
      "The study found that, compared with male survivors, female cancer survivors were 69% more likely to report cancer-related fatigue and 58% more likely to report depression.",
      "While fatigue is already known to affect more than 80% of people with cancer, the study found that women were 1.5 times more likely than men to experience it.",
      "Cancer treatments affect the entire body, as they can kill both cancerous and healthy cells, said Carolyn Gotay, cancer researcher and professor emeritus of population and public health at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who was not involved in the study. These effects can persist for months to years after treatment is done, she said, leaving survivors with a host of health issues from deafness to infertility.",
      "Cancer-related fatigue and depression can be caused by cancer itself or the other medical conditions it causes, according to the National Cancer Institute. The emotional impact of dealing with the disease can also cause these symptoms.",
      "Why women bear the brunt of these effects remains unclear, although experts have some theories.",
      "Research shows that women have stronger immune responses to treatments, which causes greater inflammation. Women also tend to clear drugs from their bodies more slowly than men, Du said, leading to higher concentrations of medications in their system and thus worse symptoms. It\u2019s possible, too, that differences in body size affect how drugs and radiation are distributed and absorbed in women\u2019s bodies.",
      "Women are also more likely to develop cancers that are treated with hormone therapies that can contribute greatly to fatigue and depression, Du said. Some of these therapies, like tamoxifen that\u2019s used to treat some breast cancers, are taken for five to 10 years after remission to lower the chances the cancer returns, according to the American Cancer Society.",
      "That said, women are more likely to report fatigue and depression even without a cancer diagnosis, Gotay said, so it\u2019s possible that sex-related hormone differences might better explain why women experience more of these symptoms from the start.",
      "Du said that it\u2019s also possible social gender norms play a role. Women typically have more caretaker responsibilities like tending to children and chores that can increase stress and contribute to fatigue and depression, she said.",
      "Notably, the study found that men were more likely to have thoughts \u201cthat they would be better off dead,\u201d Du said. This finding mirrors other data that shows suicide rates are generally higher in men than in women. Du speculated that social norms, namely expectations that men should be able to provide for their families, could be to blame.",
      "How exercise can help",
      "The study also found that, among all cancer survivors, those who did moderate physical activity such as walking or cycling had a 50% lower risk of cancer-related fatigue. Those who participated in more vigorous activity didn\u2019t see any improvements in their energy, Du said.",
      "Meanwhile, both moderate and vigorous activity was associated with a two- to five-fold decrease in depression risk, according to the research.",
      "Overall, the results suggest that post-cancer therapy programs should prioritize exercise. A 2024 review of 113 randomized controlled trials came to similar conclusions, and found that exercise, along with cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based programs, improved cancer-related fatigue both during and after cancer treatment.",
      "\u201cWe always prescribe medications\u201d to help cancer survivors cope with lingering symptoms, Du said. \u201cBut for cancer-related fatigue, exercise may actually work better than pharmaceutical interventions.\u201d",
      "Even still, exercise may be a bandage solution, Unger said, treating just the symptom and not the root cause. Future research needs to investigate why women experience worse side effects after cancer so they can benefit from more effective treatment options.",
      "In the meantime, Gotay said she hopes the study helps normalize the idea that it\u2019s OK to not feel OK after surviving cancer, which can be tough for many survivors to understand and accept.",
      "\u201cWhen people survive cancer and have fatigue or depression, they think that something is wrong with them because they\u2019re not grateful,\u201d Gotay said. \u201cBut they shouldn\u2019t feel alone \u2026 or as though they\u2019re deficient. It\u2019s a part of the whole experience \u2026 and we need to start giving them the tools they need to make their lives as rich as possible.\u201d"

      "It\u2019s all in the title: This new show will take a completely different approach to wardrobe transformation. This time around, there\u2019s no secret filming of unwitting style offenders, no ambush makeovers and zero outfit shaming.",
      "Instead, the new show is about empowering people to discover and embrace their unique style, even if their dream looks don\u2019t follow any conventional fashion guidelines.",
      "\u201cWe are no longer applying rules that come from our perspective,\u201d London tells TODAY.com. \u201cWe are asking our clients what their dream style is, why they haven\u2019t been able to achieve it and really help them along the way and guide them, rather than make it about geometry or looking thinner.\u201d",
      "A new premise...",

      "... And a long-awaited reunion",
      "With their bubbly on-screen chemistry, the co-hosts seem to be picking up right where they left off from their \u201cWhat Not to Wear\u201d days.",

      "The same year, London blocked Kelly on Twitter, which Kelly said at the time felt like \u201cgetting a little slap in the face.\u201d",
      "But all that is clearly behind them now. The pair announced their reconciliation in 2023 and said they had worked through any sticking points in their relationship.",
      "\u201cSo I reached out to Stacy and I was like, \u2018Can we put this behind us? Let\u2019s talk it out.\u2019 And we had a really emotional conversation. It was during the pandemic, sort of as the pandemic was ending. And we just talked through it all,\u201d Kelly said during a joint visit to TODAY with London in September 2023.",
      "\u201cOh, I sobbed my eyes out,\u201d London recalled, saying she \u201clet it all hang out\u201d as she and Kelly made up.",
      "\u201cI told Clinton everything that made me sad, everything that hurt me, every way I thought I hurt him. All the petty grudges, all the stupid crap,\" she said.",
      "The pair kicked off their renewed collaboration with The Stacy & Clinton show, a multi-city live tour that ran from October to November 2023, in which they shared behind-the-scenes stories from \u201cWhat Not to Wear\u201d and offered updated style advice to audience members.",
      "And with \u201cWear Whatever the F You Want,\u201d it\u2019s clear they are back to finishing each other\u2019s sentences.",
      "Teaming up again for the new show \u201cwas like riding an old bicycle,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cStacy, I\u2019m the old bicycle. You jumped on \u2014\u201d",
      "\u201cI jumped on your back,\u201d London chimes in with a laugh. \u201cWe really, really enjoyed our time together \u2026 For what everybody has said, and all the clickbait and all the press and all of that silly stuff, we work really well together, and we just know how to do it.\u201d",
      "She adds that this time around, she and Kelly were \u201cjust happier on the set.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re both older, we\u2019re in a different place,\u201d she says. \u201cI just feel like this was a real, true collaboration.\u201d",
      "All eight episodes of \u201cWear Whatever the F You Want\u201d are available to stream on Prime Video."

      "When reminiscing on previous times getting together with the same casual appearance, Kern Lima commented that Meghan looks \u201cthe exact same with no makeup as (with) makeup.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Following Pope Francis' death on April 21, all eyes are on the College of Cardinals who are set to start a conclave soon to elect a new pope.",
      "The process has remained largely secretive over the eight centuries that conclaves have been used to elect new popes as cardinals sequester themselves during the voting process.",
      "The conclave following the death of Pope Francis will begin May 7, Vatican officials announced. In the meantime, people have turned to the 2024 Oscar-winning film \"Conclave\" to get an inside look at the process. In fact, \"Conclave\" viewing rose 283% in the week following Pope Francis' death, \"coming in at nearly 7 million minutes watched across streaming platforms,\" Carson Daly said on TODAY.",
      "But how accurate is \"Conclave\" to the actual papal conclave? Let's get into it.",
      "What parts of 'Conclave' were spot-on?",
      "While the process of selecting a new pope is extremely secretive, certain things are known, which the film shows.",
      "Much of the film unfolds in a re-creation of the Vatican's famous Sistine Chapel, where the conclave takes place in real life.",
      "The Sistine Chapel is sealed off until voting has closed \u201cso that total secrecy may be ensured with regard to everything said or done there in any way pertaining, directly or indirectly, to the election of the Supreme Pontiff,\u201d the\u00a0Apostolic Constitution states.",
      "The film accurately depicts the behind-the-scenes political conversations that occur between cardinals during a papal conclave, according to a Vatican expert.",
      "\u201cKeep in mind that cardinals are human beings. They\u2019re political animals as well. They will be meeting in various places,\u201d Philip Pullella, a Vatican expert and author, said in a segment that aired on TODAY April 21. \u201cYou know, Cardinal X will say to Cardinal Y, I\u2019ve been talking about this to Cardinal Z.\u201d",
      "Despite the drama and revelations, the voting in \"Conclave\" is fairly efficient. The cardinals take three days to elect a new pope in the film.",
      "Pope Francis and Pope Benedict XVI were both elected slightly faster \u2014 in two days. The longest conclave in the 20th century was in 1903, when the election of Pope Pius X took five days.",
      "The new pope accepts the position using Latin phrase laid out by the Apostolic Constitutions.",
      "Once a new pope has been selected, the dean of the College of Cardinals will ask the candidate-elect in Latin, \"Do you accept your canonical election as Supreme Pontiff?\"",
      "The candidate-elect needs to respond with \"Accepto,\" which is Latin for \"I accept.\"",
      "\"Conclave\" displays this exact conversation.",
      "What parts of 'Conclave' were semi-accurate?",
      "Other scenes in \"Conclave\" are partially correct.",
      "After the late pope dies, the cardinals gather around his body. Cardinal Tremblay (John Lithgow) removes his ring. Then Tremblay immediately breaks it, delivering the line, \u201cThe throne of the Holy See is vacant.\u201d",
      "As \"Conclave\" shows, the pope's signet ring, called Ring of the Fisherman, is destroyed after his death to signify the papal vacancy and to ensure that no forgeries can be made in the pope's name as the ring serves as a seal for letters, too.",
      "Traditionally the ring is removed from the pope's body, then it is held by the camerlengo (a Vatican official) until it is ceremoniously destroyed, according to the Vatican News.",
      "So, while the film got across the point that the ring needs to be removed and destroyed, it modified the process, depicting a private, quick ceremony.",
      "In the movie, cardinals burn their votes and send a signal to the outside world through the Sistine Chapel chimney. Black smoke signifies no choice has been made. White smoke signifies a new pope has been chosen.",
      "The colors are right but the number of burning sessions is not. In the film, the ballots are burned after each vote, whereas during a real conclave the ballots are burned after each voting session.",
      "According to the Vatican News, there are two voting sessions per day, and each session has two ballots.",
      "What parts of 'Conclave' were inaccurate?",
      "Here's what an expert said was the \"biggest mistake\" in the movie.",
      "Perhaps the biggest plot hole in the film was the movie's addition of Cardinal Benitez (Carlos Diehz), the archbishop of Kabul.",
      "As the papal conclave is preparing to sequester themselves, Cardinal Benitez arrives with paperwork explaining that the previous pope had appointed him a cardinal \"in pectore,\" which means in secret.",
      "Cardinal Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes) tells Cardinal Bellini (Stanley Tucci), \"I don't think we have any choice but to admit him,\" allowing him into the conclave.",
      "\"The biggest mistake in the movie was the admission of a cardinal in pectore into the conclave,\u201d Rev. Thomas Reese, a senior analyst with the Religion News Service and a Vatican expert told the AP. \u201cIf the name is not announced publicly by the pope in the presence of the College of Cardinals, he has no right to attend a conclave.\u201d",
      "Cardinal Benitez's age would probably prevent some from voting for him. While his age is not specified in the film, Diehz is 54 years old.",
      "\u201cThe Vatican is a very strange place because someone who is 65 or 70 is considered too young,\u201d Pullella said on TODAY. \u201cVery few cardinals want another papacy to last another 30 years.\u201d",
      "Cardinal Lawrence also breaks multiple rules himself, including busting into the sealed off quarters of the deceased pope to investigate other cardinals and telling another cardinal something that was told to him in confessional.",
      "According to the Code of Canon Law, the penalty for breaking the seal of confession is ex-communication.",
      "And while there's no specific punishment stated for breaking into the deceased pope's personal chambers, it is also unlikely that Cardinal Lawrence would be able to get away with that and even still be a favorable contender for the papacy himself."

      "While \u201ciHostage\u201d is closely inspired by the real events of that February night, Boermans says he took a few liberties.",
      "\u201cWe changed the dialogue and gave all characters fictional names so they couldn\u2019t be traced back to the individuals involved,\u201d he told Time. \u201cIn reality, hundreds of people were involved in the stand-off, but we focused on five main characters \u2014 each from a different background, each offering a unique perspective.\u201d",
      "Keep reading to learn more about the real-life hostage crisis that inspired the Netflix thriller.",
      "What happened in the real-life hostage situation?",
      "In the late afternoon of Feb. 22, 2022, police received reports of a possible robbery at an Apple Store in the Leidseplein area of central Amsterdam, according to a statement from Amsterdam police obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "When officers arrived on the scene, they were \u201cimmediately fired upon,\u201d Amsterdam police said.",
      "Police sealed off the area and discovered that the suspect was a 27-year-old man from Amsterdam with an automatic weapon and a handgun. Authorities also said they believed at the time the suspect might be wearing a bomb vest.",
      "Many people in the Apple Store were allowed to leave the area, with police rescuing about 70 people who had been in the building. Four other people hid in a closet in the store throughout the ordeal, police said.",
      "The suspect took one man hostage inside the Apple store, holding him at gunpoint.",
      "The suspect then contacted police himself and demanded a ransom of 200 million Euros, or more than $220 million dollars, in cryptocurrency, as well as a \u201csafe passage from the property,\u201d according to the police statement.",
      "At 10:30 p.m., about five hours after the crisis began, the suspect asked for water. A police robot delivered water to the door of the store, Amsterdam police chief Frank Pauw said in a statement seen by TODAY.com.",
      "The hostage stepped outside as if to fetch the water, but then made a run for it, police said in a statement to reporters.",
      "The suspect gave chase, but was quickly stopped when a member of the Dutch Special Intervention Service, which is similar to a SWAT unit in the U.S., hit him with a car.",
      "\u201cWe managed to stop the hostage-taker by hitting him as he ran out. Violent images of that collision can be seen,\u201d Amsterdam police wrote in a social media post in Dutch, which was translated by NBC News.",
      "The police also said on social media that the suspect had no explosives on his body, and said he was being cared for by medical professionals.",
      "What happened to the hostages?",
      "No one apart from the hostage taker was hurt in the incident.",
      "The main hostage, as well as the four people who were trapped in a closet throughout the crisis and the 70 people initially rescued by police, were all removed from the building unharmed, authorities said.",
      "\u201cThis does not change the fact that the incident had a major impact,\u201d police said in a statement obtained by TODAY.com. \u201cEveryone was taken to a sanctuary/victim care center, where witness statements were recorded and Victim Care took care of those involved.\u201d",
      "The real-life hostage was a Bulgarian man whose name has not been shared by authorities. In \u201ciHostage,\u201d his name is Ilian Petrov, and he is played by Bosnian actor Admir \u0160ehovi\u0107.",
      "Apple later issued a statement about the incident.",
      "\u201cWe are so incredibly grateful and relieved that our employees and customers in Amsterdam are safe after this terrifying experience,\u201d the company said in a statement to NBC News at the time.",
      "The company also praised the \u201cswift action\u201d of its employees and customers and thanked those involved for \u201cthe support and care they\u2019ve shown each other under such challenging circumstances.\u201d",
      "What happened to the gunman?",
      "After being struck by the police vehicle, the hostage taker subsequently died of his injuries, authorities confirmed.",
      "Police identified the hostage taker as Dutch national Abdel Rahman Akkad, according to Dutch newspaper Het Parool.",
      "In the Netflix movie, the gunman's name is Ammar Ajar, and he is portrayed by Dutch actor Soufiane Moussouli.",
      "Akkad had been known to authorities, and had already faced multiple convictions, including for possession of weapons, Het Parool reported. He had also recently been acquitted of threatening his girlfriend with death or serious assault, the newspaper reported.",
      "Akkad wore a bodycam throughout the hostage taking incident, and some of that footage was included in a 2024 Dutch documentary about the hostage crisis, \u201cDe Gijzeling In De Apple Store.\u201d",
      "Following the hostage crisis, Dutch authorities launched an investigation into the handling of the incident, namely the Special Intervention Service officer\u2019s decision to hit Akkar with a car to stop his escape.",
      "The Netherlands\u2019 Public Prosecution Service later determined that the driver of the car would not be prosecuted and said his actions had been appropriate given the situation, Het Parool reported in June 2022."

      "On Oct. 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of hotel onto a crowd watching Jason Aldean perform at the\u00a0Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas. Police reported at least 58 people were killed in the shooting and more than 500 people were injured.",

      "\"And after that, right after that, I had a health scare. I had a blood clot and thought I was going to die,\" Church continued. \"And then, my brother died, you know? So all this happened, within a matter of months.\"",
      "In 2018, Church revealed to Rolling Stone that he underwent an emergency surgery for a blood clot in his chest that was due to a birth defect. That was also the same year that his brother, Brandon, died.  The country star explained that those events humbled him in more ways than one.",
      "\"I think, up until that point, you can listen to the music, maybe, and you can see that I was brash, arrogant, in a lot of ways,\" he told Geist. \"But it changes, when you have those things happen to you. And I think it made the music more humble and, maybe, more observant.\"",

      "\"I had a lot of fans die,\" Church said. \"And I played the (Grand Ole) Opry right after that, and didn\u2019t want to be there. But I remember, there were a number of fans that had went to the Vegas show that were then going to fly across the country to come to the Opry show, to see me play the Opry.\"",
      "\"That was a part of their travel and some of \u2018em got shot,\" he said. \"They died. And I remember being at the Opry, that night and... it\u2019s still raw in a lot of ways, but just not something that affects you. And it broke me, in a way.\"",
      "Church performed at the Grand Ole Opry just days after his performance in Vegas. While onstage, he paid tribute to the victims with a new heartfelt song called \u201cWhy Not Me.\"",
      "In the song, he says, \"And when the morning sun hits the mountain / And a glorious still calms the breeze / I\u2019ll ask the God of infinite wisdom / Why you and why not me?\""

      "During the reunion, Dorit Kemsley discussed the toll that their separation had on her, sharing, \u201cI\u2019m hurt. I\u2019m sad. I think I\u2019m realizing more and more each day that what I really believed was going to be my future may not be.\u201d",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump injected himself into the race with his tariffs on Canadian imports and repeatedly saying Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.",
    "story": [
      "Canadian voters backed Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s Liberal Party on Monday, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. projects, in a national election strongly influenced by President Donald Trump.",
      "The CBC said it was too early to know whether the Liberals would win enough seats to form a majority government, but it projected another term for the party, which has governed Canada for almost a decade.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s ready to stand up for Canada with me?\u201d Carney told cheering supporters early Tuesday. He said that Trump\u2019s repeated comments about making Canada the 51st U.S. state were \u201cnot idle threats.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is trying to break us, so that America can own us. That will never, that will never, ever happen,\u201d he said.",
      "Carney said it was important to recognize that \u201cour world has fundamentally changed,\u201d and that Canada\u2019s old relationship with the United States, its longtime ally and trading partner, is \u201cover.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to look out for ourselves.\u201d",
      "Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the opposition Conservatives, conceded defeat earlier Tuesday and congratulated Carney, describing the Liberals\u2019 projected victory as a \u201crazor-thin minority government\u201d and saying his party would hold them accountable.",
      "Only a few months ago, Poilievre \u2014 who is in danger of losing his seat in Parliament as votes continue to be counted \u2014 seemed poised to be the next leader of Canada amid public frustration with soaring inflation, rising immigration and what was criticized as then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s overly conciliatory approach to Trump, then the president-elect.",
      "Trudeau announced his resignation Jan. 6, two weeks before Trump was inaugurated, after polls showed him struggling with voters.",
      "Since he returned to office, however, Trump has enraged Canadians with his behavior toward one of his country\u2019s closest allies. His policies and rhetoric \u2014 including imposing steep tariffs on Canadian imports and the \u201c51st state\u201d comments \u2014 became the central issue in the Canadian election and helped the Liberals make a remarkable turnaround, closing an almost 20-point gap with the Conservatives in a matter of weeks. The Liberals were also boosted by a candidate, Carney, who may be uniquely positioned to respond to Trump and the global economic uncertainty his tariffs have created.",
      "Like Trump, Carney had never held elected office before becoming his country\u2019s leader and spent much of his life in the private sector. He became prime minister last month after he was elected leader of the Liberal Party, then quickly called a snap election in the hope of securing a full term.",
      "Carney, 60, is also a former central banker used to dealing with economic crises, having run the Bank of Canada after the 2008 global financial crisis and the Bank of England during the Brexit process.",
      "He touted that experience during the campaign, which lasted 37 days.",
      "\u201cMark offers the proven leadership and real plan we need to deliver change for our party and our country, and to build the strongest economy in the G7,\u201d his campaign said, referring to the Group of Seven industrialized nations.",
      "Poilievre had been on a rising trajectory until earlier this year, with his \u201cTrump light\u201d style embraced by the populist wing of his party. As anger in Canada grew, however, his similarities with Trump began to work against him.",
      "Poilievre ran on job opportunities and on promises that Gen Z voters would be able to afford housing, leveraging public fatigue with the Liberal government. At a rally Sunday, the CBC quoted him as calling the Trudeau government \u201cthe lost Liberal decade of rising crime, chaos, drugs and disorder.\u201d",
      "Trump continued goading Canada on Monday as voters went to the polls, saying again that it should become the \u201ccherished\u201d 51st U.S. state.",
      "\u201cALL POSITIVES WITH NO NEGATIVES. IT WAS MEANT TO BE!\u201d he said on his Truth Social platform.\u00a0Both Carney and Poilievre rebuked Trump over such comments and others he has made about the Canadian election.",
      "\u201cThey can become divided and weak,\u201d Carney said in a video on social media Monday, speaking of the U.S. \u201cBut this is Canada. And we decide what happens here.\u201d",
      "Poilievre wrote Monday on X: \u201cPresident Trump, stay out of our election.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe only people who will decide the future of Canada are Canadians at the ballot box,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCanada will always be proud, sovereign and independent and we will NEVER be the 51st state.\u201d",
      "One voter said he voted Liberal because Poilievre \u201csounds like mini-Trump to me.\u201d Reid Warren, of Toronto, told The Associated Press that tariffs were also a concern.",
      "\u201cCanadians coming together from, you know, all the shade being thrown from the States is great, but it\u2019s definitely created some turmoil, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Warren said.",
      "Trump did not appear to have publicly commented on the election result as of late Monday, but his predecessor congratulated Carney and the Liberals.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m confident Mark will be a strong leader for the fundamental values and interests Canadians and Americans share,\u201d former President Joe Biden said in a post on X."

    "story": [
      "It's morning in Khan Younis, and the Al-Zurai family wakes up in a tent pitched on the rubble of the cement house they once shared. The tiles that used to be the floor of their home are loosely laid across the sandy ground, marking the space of what is now a makeshift outdoor kitchen.",
      "\u201cToday, God sends us cans, so we\u2019re cooking them for the children,\u201d Suad Al-Zurai, 57, said of the canned beans that she stirs in a simmering pot. It's the 558th day of the war, and the children, along with the adults, are hungry, covered in dust, haunted by death and facing another day of scraping together a life from the ruins of the Gaza Strip.",
      "NBC News' crew on the ground spent a day with the Al-Zurai family, from early morning to sunset, to see how they, and thousands of families across the enclave, are living after the ceasefire broke, and Israel began a blockade in early March, barring the entry of food, water, medicine and other supplies into the enclave.",
      "There are 16 members of the Al-Zurai family to share the single pot of beans, eight of them children. At least five more should be there with them, Suad says. One of her sons was killed along with two of her grandchildren, while another, Khaled Al-Zurai,\u00a0has been missing for days after an explosion that killed one of his sons. Suad is now taking care of his wife, who has cancer, and their four surviving children. Her third son, Hamed Al-Zurai, and his four children also live with her. Other relatives are displaced to other parts of Gaza.",
      "Suad's exhaustion is palpable as she stirs the pot under a blazing sun.",
      "For her, enduring survival has begun to feel like death. \u201cWe all die 100 times, every day,\u201d she said, \u201cwe die 100 times daily from fear and horror.\u201d",
      "Her slain loved ones are among more than 51,000 people who have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the local health ministry, since Israel launched its offensive in the enclave following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks. Some 1,200 people were killed during the attacks in southern Israel and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Throughout the course of the day, worries over food, water and other necessities dominate the family's discussions, and finding those supplies takes up much of the rest of their time as humanitarian groups warn that aid is running out.",
      "At one point, Hamed Al-Zurai's 3-year-old daughter, Anwar, throws herself to the floor, crying out for rice, but there isn\u2019t any more to give her.",
      "\u201cMy children are constantly crying,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to eat. And I answer them, \u2018How? There are no open crossings, so how can I get you food, my love?\u2019\u201d",
      "Before the war, most of the children spent their mornings at school. Now, they dedicate hours each day to trying to find food and water.",
      "Pushing their fears for their missing father aside, Khaled Al-Zurai's children, Mohammed, 13, and Suad, 12, dutifully pick up their pots and pans and head to the soup kitchen with their cousin, Shadi, 7, taking NBC News' crew with them on the roughly 30-minute walk. At the soup kitchen, there's already a crowd of other children, along with some women and men, waiting for food under the hot sun. The younger Suad stands with her empty pot in her hands, gazing into the distance, bored and exhausted, as she waits, later joining her brother and sister and sitting in a ditch in the shade before they try again.",
      "On offer is rice \u2014 and after waiting for an hour, they fill their pots, carrying it back to their tent.",
      "While they're getting food, Hamed and young Anwar are out to get water for the family. Anwar walks swiftly as she carries two water jugs, each nearly half the size of her small body.",
      "Before the war, Hamed Al-Zurai had a cart and a donkey that he would use to rent out transportation services, but after the donkey died in the war and he lost his cart, he no longer has a way to make money. Unable to buy food or water, the family is left dependent on swiftly dwindling aid.\u201cThe situation is dire,\u201d he said.",
      "But even at a time of incredible darkness, there are moments of light for the Al-Zurais: smiles as they gather together in their tent, finally sharing their hard-won lunch.",
      "After eating, Mohammed gives his younger siblings and cousins old rubber tires to play with. Anwar grins as she wheels one across the sandy ground.",
      "As the sun goes down, the children huddle in a circle outside, laughing as they play hand-clapping games. And for a moment, they look just like any other children anywhere else in the world.Then, they return to their makeshift tent to eat a meager dinner of more rice and beans, before eventually settling down for bed, huddling together on the ground, wrapped in blankets.",
      "\u201cWe hate the nighttime,\u201d Suad Al-Zurai said. And, she added, \u201cthe daytime.\u201d"

    "summary": "A militant attack that killed 26 people in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir has brought ties between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan to their lowest point in years.",
    "story": [
      "SRINAGAR, India \u2014 After trekking through streams and forests in Indian-administered Kashmir, Sheetal Kalthia and her vacationing family had just arrived in a remote, picturesque meadow when they heard gunshots.",
      "Kalthia, who was with her husband and their two children, said they \u201csensed that something was wrong and ran to hide behind the tent, but they suddenly were standing in front of us.\u201d",
      "Militants armed with rifles had descended on tourists in the meadow from the surrounding woods, identifying non-Muslims and then separating the men from the women and children.",
      "One of the militants \u201cshot six to seven men in front of me,\u201d Kalthia said, before shooting her husband, Shailesh.",
      "\u201cMy husband died in my lap, and I couldn\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d she told reporters Thursday at his funeral in their hometown of Surat in the Indian state of Gujarat.",
      "Twenty-six people were killed in the Tuesday attack, which took place in one of Kashmir\u2019s top tourist destinations, the Baisaran Valley, whose lush green meadows, dense pine forests and snowcapped mountains have led it to be called India\u2019s \u201cmini Switzerland.\u201d",
      "It was the deadliest attack on Indian civilians in almost two decades, and took place while Vice President JD Vance and his family were visiting another part of India. All but one of those killed were Indian nationals; the other was from Nepal.",
      "The attack near the town of Pahalgam in Kashmir, a disputed Himalayan region that is the only Muslim-majority part of India, has devastated the local tourism industry on which many rely for their livelihood. It also undermined Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s insistence that the security situation had stabilized after a decadeslong separatist insurgency.",
      "New Delhi has responded with fury, immediately downgrading ties with neighboring Pakistan, which it has long accused of supporting cross-border terrorism. Indian officials say the gunmen had ties to militant groups based in Pakistan, which denies any involvement.",
      "Relations between the two nuclear powers, which both rule parts of Kashmir and have fought two wars over the region, are now at their lowest point in years after tit-for-tat treaty suspensions and the expulsion of diplomats and civilians. On Saturday, Indian and Pakistani troops exchanged gunfire for the second day in a row along the Line of Control that divides the two parts of Kashmir.",
      "Modi, a Hindu nationalist who has overseen a crackdown on dissent in Kashmir, vowed retribution for the attack. The family homes of several suspects have been demolished.",
      "\u201cI say to the whole world, India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backers,\u201d he said Thursday.",
      "President Donald Trump, who is close with Modi, said the Indian leader has his \u201cfull support.\u201d",
      "For Indians watching Modi\u2019s speech, it was an echo of 2019 when a convoy of Indian security forces was blown up in Kashmir and he responded by launching aerial strikes on Pakistan.",
      "Six years later, Indian nationalism is higher than ever, the Pakistan military\u2019s grip on power has weakened, and the U.S. is no longer in Afghanistan, which analysts say historically deterred violence between India and Pakistan.",
      "\u201cThat perhaps gives India a bit of a blank check to do whatever it pleases,\u201d said Chietigj Bajpaee, a senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "A region simmering with rage",
      "Resentment between India and Pakistan dates to 1947, when Hindu-majority India gained independence from British colonial rule and Muslim-majority Pakistan was established as a separate state in a deadly partition in which at least an estimated million people were killed while migrating across the newly formed border.",
      "The border lines were clearly defined and accepted except for the mountainous state of Jammu and Kashmir, which is among the most militarized places in the world. Both Pakistan and India lay full claim to it, but most of it is Indian-administered, while Pakistan controls a small chunk to the west.",
      "Tensions have escalated since Modi revoked Kashmir\u2019s semiautonomous status in 2019, effectively putting the region under direct control of the federal government in a move that was criticized by rights groups and raised fears that Kashmir\u2019s ethnic and religious identity would be diluted by Hindu settlers.",
      "Modi\u2019s government said the move ended decades of armed rebellion in the region. Elections were held last year and hailed as a sign of normalcy.",
      "\u201cOne indicator of normalcy that the government was always giving out was, look, there are so many tourists visiting,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Deependra Singh Hooda, former head of the Indian Army\u2019s Northern Command, who was stationed in Jammu and Kashmir from 2012 to 2016.",
      "Praveen Donthi, a New Delhi-based senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, said the attack was a \u201ccolossal intelligence failure.\u201d",
      "Modi\u2019s narrative of peace and stability \u201cled to complacency, which is why they did not see this coming,\u201d he said.",
      "'Bodies lying on the ground'",
      "Pallavi Rao and her husband, Manjunath, had taken their son to Kashmir to celebrate his near-perfect score on his high school diploma exams. They had enjoyed a boat ride on the popular Dal lake in Kashmir\u2019s main city of Srinagar before heading to Pahalgam about 30 miles away.",
      "The militants found them in the meadow.",
      "After her husband was shot in the head, Rao told reporters, she and her son asked the militants to kill them too. They refused, saying, \u201cWe won\u2019t kill you. Go tell Prime Minister Modi.\u201d",
      "A local pony handler, Syed Adil Hussain Shah, was also killed while trying to save the tourists.",
      "\u201cHe used to earn 300 rupees [$3.50] in a day, our only source of income in the family,\u201d Ravisa Hussain Shah, his younger sister, told NBC News in an interview at their home in the village of Hapatnur.",
      "Among the first to reach the scene was Sajad Ahmad Bhat, 31, a shawl seller and tour guide.",
      "\u201cI saw bodies lying on the ground,\u201d he said.",
      "Bhat carried one of the victims almost 2.5 miles to safety, video of which went viral online.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know who the boy was. But he was crying and seeking help. His hands and sweater were soaked in blood,\u201d he said.",
      "Since the attack, India has suspended a 1960 water treaty with Pakistan and closed the only functional land border crossing. Pakistan, which said any disruption to its water supply would be considered an \u201cact of war,\u201d has closed its airspace to Indian airlines and halted all trade with its neighbor.",
      "Analysts inside Pakistan say the government may use the situation to bring the Kashmir issue back into global discussions.",
      "\u201cPakistan can say, look, this happens because of India\u2019s human rights violations in Kashmir,\u201d said Farhan Siddiqi, a professor of international relations at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad.",
      "On Wednesday, Kashmir observed a complete shutdown as locals and politicians marched through the streets denouncing the killings. Roads throughout Kashmir were deserted, with shops closed and no transport on the roads.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to exhibit that Kashmiris are nonviolent and peaceful people, and any innocent killings shouldn\u2019t take place on our soil,\u201d said Javed Ahmad Tenga, president of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry.",
      "The United Nations has urged India and Pakistan to \u201cexercise maximum restraint\u201d and called for \u201cmeaningful, mutual engagement.\u201d But Donthi and others say strong Indian military action against Pakistan is likely.",
      "\u201cAnything less than the airstrikes in 2019 will not do. The public is seeking something much bigger,\u201d Donthi said. \u201cAfter riding the tiger of hypernationalism, the government has backed itself into a corner. This is their litmus test and they have to come out with flying colors.\u201d",

      "Even in death, Pope Francis\u2019 moral voice rang out across the world.",
      "With 40,000 packed into Vatican City\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Square, another 250,000 in the surrounding streets and millions more watching on TV and online, world leaders, including President Donald Trump, were reminded of Francis\u2019 central messages during his funeral Saturday.",
      "\u201c\u2018Build bridges, not walls\u2019 was an exhortation he repeated many times,\u201d Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re said during the homily for the late pope. \u201cHis gestures and exhortations in favor of refugees and displaced persons are countless. His insistence on working on behalf of the poor was constant.\u201d",
      "And war \u201calways leaves the world worse than it was before: It is always a painful and tragic defeat for everyone,\u201d Re said.",
      "Francis often railed against the geopolitical tides. He urged more compassion for immigrants and refugees at a time when the White House and other governments are cracking down. He called for an end to the war in Gaza and denounced climate change and exploitative capitalism \u2014 when those crises have only intensified.",
      "Under warm, blue skies with the world watching, the homily was a reminder of Francis\u2019 often lonely voice in a world characterized by economic and military hard power. It also brought to mind the unspoken questions, on this day at least, about whether the late pontiff\u2019s replacement will continue these progressive notes or revert to a more conservative bent.",
      "The relatively simple funeral for Francis, who died at age 88 on Monday, was attended by some 170 heads of state and other dignitaries. Trump sat among Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and Britain\u2019s Prince William.",
      "Francis\u2019 casket was taken on a final journey in the so-called popemobile through the streets of Rome, past landmarks such as the Colosseum, to St. Mary Major Basilica, where he had chosen to be buried.",
      "The people lining the streets had come from all over the world.",
      "\u201cI could not have been anywhere else today. For me, Pope Francis was a wonderful pope, a gift that the lord gave us,\u201d said Katherine Gilligan, 59, who was visiting Rome last week from Jacksonville, Florida, and decided to postpone her return journey when Francis died. \u201cHe has loved us and taught us piety. It will be difficult for there to be another pope like him.\u201d",
      "At St. Mary Major Basilica, his casket was met, according to his wishes, by dozens of Rome\u2019s impoverished and needy, including prisoners, migrants, homeless and transgender people.",
      "It was just one reflection of a pope who did things a bit differently. He had even adjusted his own funeral plans: Whereas previous popes have been entombed in three nested coffins, made of cypress, lead and oak, Francis requested he be buried in a single, simple wooden casket lined with zinc.",
      "Even so, this was an event of epic majesty. From the arcing dome of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, one of the largest churches in the world, to the striking image of a square divided between a mass of red on one side \u2014 the cardinals and bishops \u2014 and black on the other \u2014 attending dignitaries.",
      "In life, Francis had declined to live in the Vatican\u2019s gilded Apostolic Palace, choosing instead its far more plebeian guesthouse, Casa Santa Marta, where he died after a period of well-publicized illness.",
      "Francis had plenty of critics, both conservatives who believed he focused too much on progressive causes, and more liberal audiences who felt he did not go far enough with his reforms.",
      "Either way, the absence of his frequent and outspoken interjections on world affairs will leave a void to be filled. And though he spoke with a freedom unafforded to more prominent global figures, his funeral was still a deeply political event.",
      "Re\u2019s reminder that Francis preferred bridges over walls conjured the late pope\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s first-term promise to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall.",
      "\u201cA person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges is not Christian,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "One day before his death, Francis met with Vice President JD Vance after sharply rebuking the Trump administration for cracking down on immigration and slashing international aid. In February, he said a \u201cmajor crisis\u201d was taking place in the United States, referring to \u201ca program of mass deportations.\u201d",
      "Perhaps inevitably with so many powerful figures in attendance, the funeral served as a forum for real-world geopolitics. Trump was seen locked in a sit-down discussion with Zelenskyy, two of the parties who say they are trying to negotiate a peace deal alongside Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",
      "The Ukrainian leader said on X afterward that it was a \u201cgood meeting.\u201d But there was little immediate sign that Francis\u2019 death would solve a crisis he was unable to affect in life.",
      "Nevertheless, despite scandal within the church and uncertainty without, there was plenty of Francis\u2019 platform that few would disagree with.",
      "Re reflected this while closing the homily: \u201cEmbrace humanity that seeks the truth with a sincere heart and holds high the torch of hope.\u201d"

    "summary": "A key defendant in the trial of a group accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at gunpoint in Paris back in 2016 has said he regrets the trauma he caused her.",
    "story": [
      "PARIS \u2014 A key defendant in the trial of a group accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at gunpoint in Paris in 2016 and stealing $9 million worth of jewelry, has said he has come to regret the trauma he caused the reality star-turned-business mogul in the years since.",
      "Yunice Abbas, perhaps the best-known defendant in the trial, said that despite a yearslong criminal history, this was the first time he had truly come to recognize the \u201ctrauma\u201d he had caused his victim.",
      "\u201cI regret it, not because I got caught, but because ... there was a trauma,\u201d Abbas, 72, said before a jury Tuesday as proceedings against the 10 people charged in connection with the 2016 robbery resumed after launching Monday afternoon.",
      "The first of several defendants set to testify in the trial, Abbas had previously confessed to his role in the heist, detailing the robbery in his 2021 book, \u201cI Kidnapped Kim Kardashian.\u201d",
      "The matter of the book came up during the testimony, with Abbas saying that he was not responsible for the title and that he disputes his alleged role in the heist. He added that he was not involved in tying up Kardashian, who was staying in Paris for the city's Fashion Week, instead staying downstairs to keep watch.",
      "Abbas and nine others, dubbed the \u201cgrandpa robbers\u201d in local media due to their ages \u2014 some of the accused are in their 70s and 80s \u2014 are alleged to have played a range of roles in the heist including holding Kardashian, 44, at gunpoint and being complicit in that crime.",
      "During questioning, Abbas described his criminal past \u2014 he has spent a total of almost 20 years in jail for various crimes \u2014 including the armed robbery of a bank in Belgium. He said that as a young man, he was fiercely opposed to theft, but had turned to a life of crime due to the bad influence of friends and money difficulties, in the hope it would prove an easier path.",
      "Abbas said his family had suffered because of his crimes, adding that he had \u201cnever had a role model\u201d himself and he had done what he thought was needed to try to provide for his children.",
      "The accused spoke rapidly during his testimony, his arm shaking throughout, possibly due to the fact he is now suffering from Parkinson's disease. At one point, the shaking was violent enough for him to hold one hand in the other.",
      "In the years since the 2016 robbery targeting Kardashian, Abbas said he now felt \u201cvery uneasy\u201d with what happened that day. But, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t do anything besides apologize.\u201d",
      "Kardashian had been staying at a private apartment complex in the French capital when five of the accused are alleged to have gained entry into the building and robbed her at gunpoint, taking items including her engagement ring from her then-husband Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West. The five other defendants are accused of related offenses, including planning and giving tipoffs on Kardashian's whereabouts.",
      "In the years since, one defendant has died, while the case of another, age 80, has been separated from that of the other defendants due to medical issues.",
      "In addition to Abbas, those standing trial will include Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, known as \u201cOld Omar,\u201d who is alleged to have masterminded the robbery; his son, Harminy, 37, accused of being the getaway driver; Didier \u201cBlue Eyes\u201d Dubreucq, 69; and the brother of Kardashian\u2019s driver in Paris, Gary Madar, 35,\u00a0who is accused of tipping the others off on Kardashian's whereabouts. Christiane Glotin, 78, is also among the accused, with authorities alleging she was an accomplice in the heist.",
      "At least four defendants were expected to be questioned in court Tuesday.",
      "Kardashian herself is expected to appear in court May 13.",
      "The reality star and businesswoman has previously detailed her experience during the robbery, at one point tearing up in an interview with David Letterman as she described how she feared she would be sexually assaulted and\u00a0possibly killed during the attack.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018OK, this is the time I\u2019m going to get raped ... just prepare yourself,\u201d she said in the interview, wiping away tears, later describing how she feared her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, would find her dead.",
      "\u201cI just kept on thinking about Kourtney,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be traumatized for the rest of her life if she sees me.\u201d",
      "Gabrielle Nolin reported from Paris and Chantal Da Silva reported from London."

    "story": [
      "SANTA ANA, El Salvador \u2014 The sprawling penitentiary where Kilmar Abrego Garcia was last known to be held offers a sharp contrast to the supermax mega-prison to which he was first deported.",
      "As opposed to tattooed gang members in brightly lit, crowded cells, the inmates at the Centro Industrial prison in Santa Ana wear yellow T-shirts and move more or less freely. Some spend much of their time outdoors raising dairy cows and growing vegetables. Others work in factories making uniforms for the armed forces or desks for public schools.",
      "The government calls them \u201ctrusted inmates\u201d: They have exhibited good behavior and are in the final years of their sentences. And the prison categorically excludes anyone accused of belonging to a gang.",
      "\u201cWe only house the common population,\u201d said Samuel Diaz, the prison\u2019s director and warden. \u201cNo gang members work here.\u201d",
      "NBC News obtained access Monday to the Centro Industrial in Santa Ana in a carefully choreographed tour. Officials did not provide access to Abrego Garcia, and they would not answer questions about his location, the conditions of his detention or any other aspects of his case. But they facilitated interviews with other inmates, who described the conditions in the prison as \u201cexcellent.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who the Justice Department has acknowledged should not have been sent to a prison in his native El Salvador because of an immigration judge\u2019s 2019 order barring such action.",
      "For human rights advocates in El Salvador and the United States, the details of Abrego Garcia\u2019s transfer \u2014 from the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, a supermax prison specifically designed for gang members, to a low-security prison from which gang members are excluded \u2014 contradicts a central claim made by both governments: that Abrego Garcia is a dangerous member of MS-13 and a terrorist. (His wife and his attorney deny those allegations.)",
      "Abrego Garcia\u2019s precise whereabouts and condition remain unknown. Since he was deported, Abrego Garcia has been allowed no contact with his family or his lawyers. In a meeting with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., on April 17 (the only time he has been seen since he was deported), Abrego Garcia said he had been transferred out of CECOT to a different facility. Documents the Justice Department filed in federal court on April 20 subsequently confirmed that facility to be the Centro Industrial in Santa Ana. There have been no updates since then.",
      "From that perspective, Abrego Garcia\u2019s transfer out of CECOT is worrisome, said Gabriela Santos, director of the Human Rights Institute at the Central American University in San Salvador.",
      "\u201cWhy was he moved?\u201d Santos said. \u201cAnd where are all the other migrants that were brought here \u2014 are they in CECOT, or are they being put in different prisons in El Salvador?\u201d",
      "Santos said there is no evident legal basis for Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele\u2019s agreement with Trump to receive and imprison deportees from the United States.",
      "\u201cFrom a legal point of view, there is no reason for [Abrego Garcia] to be here,\u201d Santos said. And because Bukele has consolidated power over all branches of government, she said, there is no viable avenue to challenge the policy.",
      "\u201cThere is no rule of law here in El Salvador. There is no respect for the principle of legality,\u201d she said.",
      "Like Abrego Garcia and others the Trump administration deported directly to CECOT, all inmates in the Salvadoran prison system are cut off from contact with lawyers, loved ones and\u00a0others on the outside. The policy is the result of a \u201cstate of exception\u201d that Bukele declared in 2022 after a particularly brutal wave of gang violence, in which he suspended many constitutional protections to quickly imprison tens of thousands without due process.",
      "About 85,000 people were imprisoned under the state of exception, according to Salvadoran human rights groups. Many were subjected to mass trials of a hundred or more defendants with no access to counsel. Advocates have documented numerous stories of people with no proven affiliation with gangs who were incarcerated indefinitely with virtually no recourse to appeal.",
      "Moreover, rights groups in El Salvador and abroad have harshly criticized prison conditions in the country, alleging systematic torture, malnutrition and other abuses. The nongovernmental legal organization Socorro Jur\u00eddico Humanitario has documented 370 deaths in Salvadoran prisons since the state of exception was declared, a number the group says is most a likely undercount.",
      "\u201cFor three years, we have lost all human rights and constitutional guarantees in El Salvador,\u201d said Ingrid Escobar, a lawyer for the organization.",
      "Bukele has acknowledged that some innocent people have been arrested under the state of exception.",
      "\u201cObviously, our operations are not perfect, and without the intention of hurting anyone innocent, some innocents have been arrested, in the same way they have been in France, Germany, Japan and every country in the world,\u201d Bukele said in November. \u201cAnd we are freeing them \u2014 we have freed 8,000 people, and we will free 100% of innocents.\u201d",
      "The Bukele administration says holding prisoners incommunicado was a necessary measure to break the control that gangs had over El Salvador\u2019s prisons, which involved regularly organizing murders, extortion and other criminal activity from inside penitentiaries.",
      "Since the state of exception was declared, public safety has improved dramatically in El Salvador. Numerous people interviewed on the streets of San Salvador said they feel free to move around the city and go about their business without fear of harassment, extortion or violence from gangs. Those improvements have made Bukele one of the most popular heads of state in the world.",
      "But human rights advocates say that the improvements have come at a heavy cost to Salvadoran democracy \u2014 and that Bukele\u2019s popularity is no justification for authoritarianism.",
      "\u201cPopularity cannot be a blank check for him to do anything he wants,\u201d Santos said. \u201cHistory has taught us that just because someone is popular, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s doing the right thing.\u201d"

      "Industrial accidents occur frequently in China, usually due to staff ignoring safety features due to a lack of training or pressure from their superiors.",
      "Poorly maintained infrastructure, illegally stored chemicals and a lack of fire exits and fire retardant, often abetted by corruption, are often factors in such disasters.",
      "If the fire began in the kitchen, it may be related to the traditional use of large open fires over which iron woks are used to braise dishes. Diners across China also enjoy a dish known simply as \u201chot pot\u201d in which meat and vegetables are stewed over open flames.",
      "Liaoyang, in Liaoning province, is part of China\u2019s rust belt, a former industrial powerhouse that has fallen on hard times with considerable population outflow."

The man appeared to suffer from altitude sickness but was not in life-threatening condition.",
      "Five days earlier, on April 22, the same climber called the\u00a0police and was airlifted from the peak of Mount Fuji after he lost his crampons \u2014 spiky metal frames that are attached to shoes to make it easier to walk on ice and snow \u2014 and fell sick with nausea.",
      "He then returned to the peak Saturday in a bid to retrieve his cellphone, among other personal belongings he left behind during the first hike, according to the police.",
      "The man, who has not been publicly identified, is a 27-year-old university student and Chinese national who lives in Tokyo, police said.",

      "Claudia Mo, Jeremy Tam, Kwok Ka-ki and Gary Fan were among 47 activists arrested in 2021 for their roles in an unofficial primary election. They were the first of the convicted activists to reunite with their families and friends following years of separation.",
      "Only vehicles involved in the release were seen leaving the three prisons in remote areas of Hong Kong. Security was tight and curtains on the vehicles were closed.",
      "Mo\u2019s husband, Philip Bowring, told reporters he was pleased Mo had returned home, saying she was \u201cwell and in good spirits.\u201d But he said she would not give interviews for the time being. \u201cShe has to get used to life again in the outside world,\u201d he said at their door, adding that they probably would go to England to see their grandchildren later.",
      "In a video posted by local online media HK01, Fan thanked Hong Kongers and the media for their concern. He added he was going to reunite with his family.",
      "The 2020 unofficial primary drew 610,000 voters, and its winners had been expected to advance to the official legislative election. Authorities postponed that, however, citing public health risks during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "During the trial, prosecutors said the activists aimed to paralyze Hong Kong\u2019s government and force the city\u2019s leader to resign by aiming to win a legislative majority and using it to block government budgets indiscriminately. The judges said in their verdict last year that the activists\u2019 plans to effect change through the unofficial primary would have undermined the government\u2019s authority and created a constitutional crisis.",
      "Only two of the 47 original defendants were acquitted. The remaining activists received prison terms ranging from four years and two months to 10 years on a charge of conspiracy to commit subversion. Mo, Tam, Kwok and Fan pleaded guilty and received reduced sentences.",
      "Their years of separation have pained the activists and their families. The case involved democracy advocates across the spectrum. They include legal scholar Benny Tai, who got a 10-year prison term, and former student leader Joshua Wong, who has to serve four years and eight months.",
      "Fourteen of the convicted activists have appealed, and prosecutors appealed the acquittal of one activist. All of the appeals are pending.",
      "Critics of the court actions brought against the activists said their convictions illustrated how authorities crushed dissent following the massive anti-government protests in 2019, while also cracking down on media freedoms and reducing public choice in elections. They said the drastic political changes reflect the shrinking of the Western-style civil liberties in Hong Kong that Beijing promised to retain in the former British colony for 50 years after the 1997 handover to China.",
      "The Beijing and Hong Kong governments insisted the national security law was necessary for the city\u2019s stability. China defended the judicial decisions, despite criticism from foreign governments."

      "PARIS \u2014 Prosecutors and defendants selected jurors Monday as French courts made the necessary preparations to hear witness testimony in the trial of those accused of stealing jewelry worth $9 million at gunpoint from Kim Kardashian.",
      "It was the opening day of proceedings against 10 people charged in connection with the 2016 robbery, in which they are alleged to have held Kardashian, 44, at gunpoint and stolen her jewelry while she was in Paris for the city's fashion week.",
      "Kardashian, the reality TV star turned business mogul, was staying at a private apartment complex favored by visiting VIPs when five of the accused arrived on bicycles and on foot, gained entry to the building and robbed her. The other defendants are accused of related offenses, including planning and giving tipoffs about Kardashian\u2019s whereabouts.",
      "The group has been nicknamed \u201cthe grandpa robbers\u201d in local media, because some of them are in their 60s and 70s. The case has taken so long to come to trial that one defendant died and the case of another, age 80, has been separated from that of the other defendants because of medical issues.",
      "Those standing trial include Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, known as \u201cOld Omar,\u201d accused of being the plot\u2019s mastermind; his son, Harminy, 37, who is accused of being the getaway driver; Didier \u201cBlue Eyes\u201d Dubreucq, 69; and the brother of Kardashian\u2019s driver in Paris, Gary Madar, 35,\u00a0 who is accused of providing the others with information about Kardashian\u2019s whereabouts. One of the accused is a woman, Christiane Glotin, 78, who authorities allege was an accomplice in planning the heist.",
      "At least one defendant has admitted his part in the robbery. Yunice Abbas, now 72, wrote the 2021 book \u201cI Kidnapped Kim Kardashian,\u201d in which he details his life story and provided an account of the robbery itself. In the text, he describes being recruited months beforehand for a team to rob an unnamed \u201cwife of an American rapper\u201d \u2014 whose identity he learned only after the crime was committed.",
      "Abbas\u2019 lawyer, Gabriel Dumenil, told NBC News on his way into court that Abbas wants \u201cto explain himself, to express himself, to speak his truth and express his regrets about this case. This is very important for him.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe knows what is at stake in this trial,\u201d Dumenil added.",
      "Under France\u2019s judicial system, defendants in criminal cases do not enter formal pleas. They can admit or deny guilt, but trials proceed regardless. Most cases in France are decided by judges, but, as the maximum sentence of this trial is more than 20 years, it will be heard by a jury. No television cameras are allowed in French courts, so the proceedings will be documented by journalists and sketch artists recounting what happens in the room.",
      "Kardashian is set to appear in court May 13. She has previously her experience as a terrifying ordeal in which she was sure she was going to die.",
      "She recalled trying to dial 911 when the men entered her room, \u201cand I\u2019m like I don\u2019t know how to call 911 in a different country,\u201d she said in an episode of E!\u2019s \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians\u201d that aired in 2017. \u201cAnd then the guy came and grabbed the phone from me, threw me on the bed, and I was like, this is it.\u201d",
      "Gabrielle Nolin reported from Paris and Alexander Smith from London."
