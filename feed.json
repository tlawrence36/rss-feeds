      "Jurors in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sex crimes retrial appear to be moving past some interpersonal tensions and focusing on one of his three accusers",
      "NEW YORK -- Jurors in Harvey Weinsteinn'ssex crimes retrial appear to be moving past some interpersonal tensions and focusing on one of his three accusers as deliberations stretch into a fourth day Tuesday.",
      "At the end of Monday's session, jurors requested to start off Tuesday with electronic copies of emails and other evidence pertaining to Jessica Mann \u2014 the accuser with arguably the most complex history with Weinstein.",
      "During days of testimony, Mann said the Oscar-winning movie producer raped her in 2013 amid a consensual relationship that continued for years afterward. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers emphasized that she kept seeing him, accepting invitations and sending warm messages to him. Mann said she \u201ccompartmentalized\u201d the pain he caused her.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges in the case. In addition to the rape charge, he's accused of sexually assaulting two other women, Mimi Haley and Kaja Sokola.",
      "Weinstein didn't testify during the current trial, but maintained through his attorneys that he had completely consensual encounters with his accusers, who wanted his help building show business careers.",
      "Weinstein was one of the movie industry's most powerful figures until a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him became public in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement and eventually leading to criminal charges.",
      "The jury is made up of seven women and five men. Their closed-door discussions began Thursday and apparently have been fractious at times.",
      "One juror asked Friday to be excused because he felt one member of the group was being treated unfairly. Monday began with two jurors giving contrasting takes on the atmosphere in the deliberation room.",
      "First, the foreperson complained to the judge, prosecutors and defense lawyers that some jurors were \u201cpushing\" others to change their minds, talking about Weinstein's past and going beyond the charges.",
      "The foreperson didn't specify what was said. Trial evidence has included some testimony about allegations outside the scope of the current charges, such as mentions of the groundswell of claims against the ex-studio boss in 2017.",
      "Another juror soon asked to speak to the court. In her estimation, things were \u201cgoing well\u201d and jurors were \u201dmaking headway.\u201d By the end of Monday, the jury as a whole said in a note that it was \u201cmaking good progress.\u201d",
      "Weinstein originally was convicted in New York in 2020 of raping Mann and forcing oral sex on Haley. Sokola's allegation was added last year, after New York state's highest court overturned the 2020 conviction and sent the case back for retrial.",
      "Meanwhile, Weinstein is appealing a 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not identify people without their permission if they say they have been sexually assaulted. Sokola, Mann and Haley have agreed to be named.",

      "RM and V began their service in December 2023, while three other BTS members \u2014 Jin, J-Hope and Suga \u2014 were already months into their conscription.",
      "Jin, the oldest member of the K-pop supergroup, was discharged from the army in June 2024. J-Hope was discharged in October. Jimin and JungKook are scheduled to be discharged Wednesday.",
      "The seventh member, Suga, is fulfilling his duty as a social service agent, an alternative to military service. He is to be released later this month.",
      "The seven BTS members plan to reunite as a group sometime in 2025.",
      "In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18 to 28 are required by law to perform 18-21 months of military service under a conscription system meant to deter aggression from rival North Korea.",
      "The law gives special exemptions to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers if they have obtained top prizes in certain competitions and are assessed to have enhanced national prestige. K-pop stars and other entertainers aren\u2019t subject to such privileges.",
      "The BTS members were able to postpone their service, however, after the National Assembly revised the Military Service Act, allowing K-pop stars to delay their enlistment until age 30.",
      "There was heated public debate over whether to offer special exemptions for BTS members, until the group\u2019s management agency announced in 2022 that all seven members would fulfill their duties.",

      "A Connecticut judge has settled a bitter feud over the estate of the late legendary blues guitarist Johnny Winter",
      "A Connecticut judge has settled a bitter feud over the estate of the late legendary blues guitarist Johnny Winter, ordering his managers to pay $226,000 in damages for improper payments they received after his 2014 death and rejecting their claim to the rights to his music.",
      "Relatives of Winter's late wife, Susan, sued Winter's manager, Paul Nelson, and his wife, Marion, in 2020, claiming the Nelsons swindled more than $1 million from Winter's music business. The Nelsons denied the allegations and countersued. They accused the relatives of improperly having Paul Nelson ousted as the beneficiary of Winter's estate, and they claimed ownership of his music rights.",
      "After a seven-day trial before a judge in January 2024, Judge Trial Referee Charles Lee ruled Friday that the Nelsons received improper payments and made improper withdrawals from Winter's accounts, but rejected claims they committed fraud, mismanagement and breach of contract.",
      "\u201cThe court finds that the conduct for which it has awarded the damages set forth above was negligent or at least arguably legitimate,\u201d Lee wrote in a 54-page decision that also rejected the claims in the Nelsons' countersuit.",
      "The judge said the Nelsons' most serious impropriety was withdrawing $112,000 from Winter's business account and depositing it into one of their own accounts in 2019, without listing Susan Winter as a signatory on their account. Susan Winter owned all of her husband's assets \u2014 valued at about $3 million at the time of his death. The judge said punitive damages may be imposed on the Nelsons because of that transfer.",
      "Paul Nelson, who managed Johnny Winter's business from 2005 to 2019 and played guitar in his band, died in March 2024 from a heart attack during a music tour. Marion Nelson, who did bookkeeping for the Winters and the music business, did not immediately return an email message Monday. The Nelsons' lawyers did not immediately return phone and email messages. It wasn't clear if they planned to appeal.",
      "Susan Winter died from lung cancer in October 2019. Months before her death, she removed Paul Nelson as her successor trustee to her family trust, which included all of her late husband's assets. She named her sister and brother, Bonnie and Christopher Warford, from Charlotte, North Carolina, as her new successor trustees, and they sued the Nelsons.",
      "The Warfords' lawyers did not immediately return phone and email messages Monday. Phone numbers for the Warfords listed in public records were no longer in service.",
      "The Nelsons claimed the Warfords took advantage of Susan Winter and had her sign legal documents while she was medicated near the end of her life. They also alleged the Warfords soured their relationship with Susan Winter with false embezzlement claims. The Warfords denied those allegations.",
      "The judge ruled that the Warfords were entitled to damages because of improper payments the Nelsons received, including $68,000 in royalty payments from a 2016 auction of Winter's assets, $69,000 in cash withdrawals, $18,000 in expense reimbursements and $15,000 in other royalty payments.",
      "The Warfords also were awarded $56,000 that remains in one of the Nelsons' accounts, the same account used in the $112,000 transfer criticized by the judge. In 2020, the Nelsons transferred about $151,000 out of that account to the Warfords\u2019 lawyers.",
      "Lee also rejected claims by the Warfords that Paul Nelson should not have received $300,000 in auction proceeds from the sale of three of Johnny Winter's guitars, because Winter promised those guitars to Paul Nelson.",
      "John Dawson Winter III was born and raised in Beaumont, Texas. He burst onto the world blues scene in the 1960s, dazzling crowds with his fast licks while his trademark long, white hair flew about from under his cowboy hat. He and his brother Edgar \u2014 both born with albinism \u2014 were both renowned musicians. Johnny Winter, who played at Woodstock in 1969, was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1988.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine listed him as the No. 63 best guitar player of all time in 2015. He released more than two dozen albums and was nominated for several Grammy Awards, winning his first one posthumously in 2015 for Best Blues Album for \u201cStep Back.\u201d Nelson produced the album and also took home a Grammy for it.",
      "Johnny Winter, who spent two decades living in Easton, Connecticut, before his death, battled heroin addiction for years and credited Nelson, whom he met in 1999, with helping him get off the opioid methadone and revive his career, according to the 2014 documentary, \u201cJohnny Winter: Down & Dirty.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe Day of the Jackal,\u201d published in 1971, propelled him into global fame. The political thriller about a professional assassin was made into a film in 1973 and more recently a television series starring Eddie Redmayne and Lashana Lynch.",

    "story": [
      "Trailblazing ballerina Misty Copeland has decided to move on to what she calls \u201cthe next stage\u201d in her career",
      "NEW YORK -- Ten years ago this month, Misty Copeland sat in front of a hastily arranged news conference at American Ballet Theatre, fighting back tears of pride over her new role: principal dancer.",
      "\u201cThis is it,\u201d she said, with emotion. \u201cThis has been my dream since I was 13.\u201d",
      "The occasion was highly unusual \u2014 normally, when a dancer is promoted, a brief press release is issued. But this was Copeland, a crossover star with fame far beyond the insular world of ballet. And now she was becoming the first Black female principal in the company\u2019s 75-year history \u2014 just days after her New York debut as the lead in \u201cSwan Lake\u201d brought a refreshingly diverse, packed audience to the Metropolitan Opera House.",
      "Now, a decade and many accomplishments later, Copeland is retiring from the company she joined as a teenager.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years at ABT, and I think it\u2019s time,\u201d Copeland, 42, told the Associated Press last week ahead of Monday\u2019s official announcement of her move. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to move to the next stage.\u201d",
      "The company is planning a splashy farewell on Oct. 22, featuring performances by Copeland \u2014 for the first time in five years \u2014 and other dancers. There will be speeches and film clips. And Copeland, who's been heavily involved in the planning, will get a chance to venture one more time onto that balcony in Verona; she\u2019ll dance again in the beautiful \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d pas de deux. Honorary chairs for the evening will be Caroline Kennedy and Oprah Winfrey.",
      "A lot has happened in a quarter-century. Copeland, whose success brought new energy to an art form that has always been overwhelmingly white, has authored a number of books, including a memoir and and several works for young people. The second installment of \u201cBunheads\u201d arrives in September, and more are already planned in a series she calls \u201ca reflection of my journey, showing the range of cultures and types of people that can be a part of the ballet world.\u201d",
      "Copeland has also made a short film with her production company. And her philanthropic organization, The Misty Copeland Foundation, works on increasing diversity in the dance world and giving more kids who grew up economically disadvantaged, like she did, the chance to dance.",
      "\u201cIt was so important for children growing up and seeing somebody like Misty and saying, \u2018Oh my gosh, she looks like I do,\u2019\u201d says Susan Jaffe, ABT\u2019s artistic director, who is overseeing the farewell performance. \u201cThrough her books, through her lectures, even her endorsements, she has really been a trailblazer.\"",
      "Still, progress moves slowly. When Copeland exits ABT, there will no longer be a Black female principal dancer at the company \u2014 nor at many ballet companies around the globe. Copeland discussed that continued challenge in the dance world, among other topics, in the AP interview last week. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "COPELAND: You know, I\u2019ve become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying thank you to the company. So it\u2019s a farewell. (But) it won\u2019t be the end of me dancing. \u2026 Never say never.",
      "COPELAND: I\u2019ve noticed that the conversation is not something we shy away from anymore in terms of the lack of equity, the lack of diversity in this (dance) world. That\u2019s one of the biggest shifts I\u2019ve seen \u2026 a lot of young people that just can imagine being part of it in some way. They can imagine stepping into Lincoln Center and being at the Metropolitan Opera House.",
      "COPELAND: It's definitely concerning, and I think I\u2019ve just gotten to a place in my career where there\u2019s only so much I can do on a stage. There\u2019s only so much that visual representation like that can do. I feel like it\u2019s the perfect timing for me to be stepping into a new role, and hopefully still shaping and shifting the ballet world and culture.",
      "COPELAND: I think about my partnership with (former ABT principal) Roberto Bolle and him giving me so many opportunities to travel the world with him \u2026 (Former ABT principal) Marcelo Gomes, he\u2019s been such a such a big part of my journey, and of course Herman Cornejo. We\u2019ve had a beautiful partnership throughout my career and I\u2019m excited to dance with him again (at the October farewell,)",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s made me even more patient. I just have a lighter and brighter outlook on life because it\u2019s just such an incredible thing to experience and witness... I think ballet has prepared me for being a mother in so many ways. I think it\u2019s ... prepared me for life and being resilient and patient and sensitive and empathetic and strong, and all of these things.",
      "COPELAND: He doesn\u2019t understand at all! (laughs) He\u2019s seen very little of me dancing. \u2026 But he\u2019s very drawn to it. He is a mover. He\u2019s very athletic. He is so drawn to music. He started violin on Monday. We live in the museums. He really is drawn to art. I think he\u2019s definitely on the artist\u2019s track.",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s been pretty evenly split between all of then. I think it just depends on what\u2019s at the forefront and what needs my focus. ... But it\u2019s exciting to be able to utilize dance in so many different mediums, and to me, that\u2019s how you get true diversity \u2014 by giving people different entry points into learning about dance and feeling like they can be a part of it, which has been my goal. How do I bring dance to as many people as possible in a way that really works for them?",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s a difficult time. And I think all we can really do is keep our heads down and keep doing the work. \u2026 we\u2019re fortunate in that way that we\u2019ve built great relationships and can continue to do the work right now through my foundation. There\u2019s no way to stop the people that feel passionate about this work. We will continue doing it. It is so necessary for the well-being of our societies and communities. I think there are times to speak out and yell from the rooftops. And for me, I feel like this is a time to keep my head down and really stay focused and do the work.",

The occasion was the 10th Broadway anniversary of Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s juggernaut that spawned multiple touring companies, a West End production and a live-capture film \u2014 and is still going strong.",

      "Escola is star and writer of the riotous \u201cOh, Mary!\u201d \u2014 a reimagining of the life of Mary Todd Lincoln (and her beleaguered husband, Abe) that addresses the question: What if the Lincoln assassination wasn\u2019t such a bad thing for Mary? (Mary wants to be a cabaret star, you see.) The show is seeing audiences collapse in laughter for 80 minutes every night on Broadway.",

      "When \u201cMaybe Happy Ending\u201d writers Hue Park and Will Aronson accepted the award for best book of a musical, the first handed out, Park felt it necessary to point out that they weren\u2019t an actual couple. \u201cI am very much single,\u201d he clarified, for anyone wondering.",
      "Then later, when the duo won for best score, Park deemed a reminder necessary: \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m still single.\u201d",
      "And then at the end of the night, \u201cMaybe Happy Ending,\u201d the charming and quirky romance between decommissioned robots in a futuristic Korea, won the big prize: best musical. Park did not get the mic. But producer Jeffrey Richards did, and he reminded the crowd: \u201cHue is still single.\u201d",
      "Cynthia Erivo, the \u201cWicked\u201d star and powerhouse vocalist hosting the evening, said it first: \u201cAs they apparently say in a very fertile piece of intellectual property,\" she said with a wink, \u201cthere\u2019s no place like home. And Broadway has always been mine.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a familiar theme on Tony night: the theater community as a welcoming haven for those who may feel different or unseen. It was echoed by Harvey Fierstein, winner of a lifetime achievement award, describing how he joined the theater after being welcomed by a company in Brooklyn. And it was expressed very emotionally by Nicole Scherzinger, winning best actress in a musical for \u201cSunset Blvd.\u201d",
      "\u201cGrowing up, I always felt like I didn\u2019t belong,\u201d said Scherzinger, former lead singer of the pop group Pussycat Dolls who plays Norma Desmond in the minimalist version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber show. \u201cBut you all have made me feel like I belong, and I have come home at last.\u201d Those last words echo the lyrics of one of Desmond\u2019s big numbers, \u201cAs If We Never Said Goodbye.\u201d",

But the way the crowd quieted down during Audra McDonald\u2019s powerful, agonized performance of \u201cRose\u2019s Turn\u201d from \u201cGypsy\u201d was striking. In the song's quiet moments, you heard utter silence in the vast room.",
      "McDonald, the Tonys' most awarded actor, is clearly revered by the theater community, who cheered her with standing ovations. But the award she was up for went to Scherzinger.",

Jeremy Strong won a Tony last year and was nominated for an Oscar this year. Kieran Culkin won an Oscar this year and is appearing on Broadway this season, though he wasn\u2019t nominated. And now it was the turn of Sarah Snook \u2014 Emmy and Golden Globe winner \u2014 to win a Tony.",
      "Snook, who played mercurial sibling Shiv Roy in the series, took the Tony for best actress in a play for \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray,\u201d in which she plays all 26 roles.",
      "Tony winner and musical theater regular Gavin Creel, who died last year of cancer, was a friend to many in the theater community, and was remembered more than once on Tony evening.",
      "During the early pre-show, actor Celia Keenan-Bolger was honored with the Isabelle Stevenson award, for her advocacy work in the arts. She spoke movingly of her deep friendship with Creel and their advocacy work together.",
      "Later, singer and actor Sara Bareilles performed a soulful duet of \u201cTomorrow\u201d from \u201cAnnie,\u201d harmonizing with Erivo, during the memorial segment. That segment ended with a photo of Creel, also a dear friend to Bareilles, who teared up.",

      "It was a yet another powerhouse performance from someone who has one of the best voices on the planet. The audience stopped dispersing \u2014 and started cheering.",

      "The night delivered a stirring mix of purpose and entertainment from Doechii 's powerful speech, Jamie Foxx 's emotional reflection and Kevin Hart 's sharp comedic opener.",
      "Doechii made her presence felt early during the five-hour ceremony, using her acceptance speech for best female hip-hop artist to draw attention to the immigration raids and protest crackdowns taking place just miles from the venue. Her message added urgency and depth to a ceremony meant to honor both Black excellence and social impact.",
      "After being named best female hip-hop artist \u2014 her first-ever BET Award \u2014 Doechii acknowledged her fellow nominees, then shifted the spotlight to the issues unfolding outside the venue.",
      "\u201cThere are ruthless attacks that are creating fear and chaos in our communities in the name of law and order,\u201d said Doechii, who won a Grammy for best rap album, only the third woman to win in that category.",
      "\u201cTrump is using military forces to stop a protest,\u201d she said. \u201cI want you all to consider what kind of government it appears to be when every time we exercise our democratic right to protest, the military is deployed against us. What type of government is that?\u201d",
      "Doechii\u2019s words drew applause from the audience at the Peacock Theater, where the awards aired live.",
      "\u201cPeople are being swept up and torn from their families,\u201d she continued. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s my responsibility as an artist to use this moment to speak up for all oppressed people. \u2026 We all deserve to live in hope and not fear. I hope we stand together.\u201d",
      "Foxx, Mariah Carey, Snoop Dogg and Kirk Franklin received the Ultimate Icon Award. They were selected due to their impact on entertainment as well as their community impact and advocacy.",

In an interview with The Associated Press, he recalled the severity of the moment: \u201cThe thing was almost a wrap. Every prayer counted.\u201d",
      "Foxx was presented the award by music legend Stevie Wonder, adding even more weight to the emotional moment. As he stood on stage, his voice cracked with gratitude.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know why I went through what I went through. But I know my second chance \u2014 I won\u2019t turn it down,\u201d Foxx said, as his two daughters and sister wiped away tears from the audience. \u201cI have so much love to give. Just give me one more crack at this. Whatever reason you put this on me, I promise I\u2019ll do right. \u2026 You can\u2019t go through something like that and not testify.\u201d",
      "Carey said this was her first time collecting a trophy at the BET Awards. The singer said she became emotional after Busta Rhymes introduced her.",
      "\u201cIt took me a while, but I finally realized that life is far too short to live for anyone else's approval, which is something I always did,\u201d said Carey, a five-time Grammy winner. \u201cI decided to own who I am.\u201d",
      "Dr. Dre presented the award to Snoop, who walked onstage with his wife Shante Taylor. In his speech, he paid homage to Carey, Franklin and Foxx before thanking the many others who helped him throughout his life.",
      "\u201cHip-hop gave me a voice. It gave me a purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gave me a way out and a way into homes, hearts, cultures and countries I'd never thought I would even touch. Being an icon isn't about fame. It's about legacy. It's about what you build, what you leave behind and who you lift up along the way.\u201d",
      "Franklin expressed gratitude for the honor, admitting he\u2019s far from the perfect Christian, husband, father or artist. He joked, \u201cI can\u2019t even sing.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhich makes this award so amazing, because what I do really don\u2019t make sense,\" he said. \"If you\u2019re listening to this, that\u2019s when you know it\u2019s God.\u201d",

      "\u201cDon\u2019t come up here poppin\u2019,\u201d Hart added, as cameras caught Franklin bowing his head and chuckling. \u201cDon\u2019t try to blame it on the Lord. The Lord didn\u2019t ask for that. Put it away, Kirk.\u201d",

      "Most big collections have only a fraction of their items on display, with the rest locked away in storage",
      "LONDON -- A museum is like an iceberg. Most of it is out of sight.",
      "Most big collections have only a fraction of their items on display, with the rest locked away in storage. But not at the new V&A East Storehouse, where London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum has opened up its storerooms for visitors to view \u2014 and in many cases touch \u2014 the items within.",
      "The 16,000-square-meter (170,000-square-foot) building, bigger than 30 basketball courts, holds more than 250,000 objects, 350,000 books and 1,000 archives. Wandering its huge, three-story collections hall feels like a trip to IKEA, but with treasures at every turn.",
      "The V&A is Britain\u2019s national museum of design, performance and applied arts, and the storehouse holds aisle after aisle of open shelves lined with everything from ancient Egyptian shoes to Roman pottery, ancient Indian sculptures, Japanese armor, Modernist furniture, a Piaggio scooter and a brightly painted garbage can from the Glastonbury Festival.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 5,000 years of creativity,\u201d said Kate Parsons, the museum\u2019s director of collection care and access. It took more than a year, and 379 truckloads, to move the objects from the museum\u2019s former storage facility in west London to the new site.",
      "In the museum\u2019s biggest innovation, anyone can book a one-on-one appointment with any object, from a Vivienne Westwood mohair sweater to a tiny Japanese netsuke figurine. Most of the items can even be handled, with exceptions for hazardous materials, such as Victorian wallpaper that contains arsenic.",
      "The Order an Object service offers \u201ca behind-the-scenes, very personal, close interaction\u201d with the collection, Parsons said as she showed off one of the most requested items so far: a 1954 pink silk taffeta Balenciaga evening gown. Nearby in one of the study rooms were a Bob Mackie-designed military tunic worn by Elton John on his 1981 world tour and two silk kimonos laid out ready for a visit.",
      "Parsons said there has been \u201ca phenomenal response\u201d from the public since the building opened at the end of May. Visitors have ranged from people seeking inspiration for their weddings to art students and \u201csomeone last week who was using equipment to measure the thread count of an 1850 dress.\u201d She says strangers who have come to view different objects often strike up conversations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just wonderful,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cYou never quite know. \u2026 We have this entirely new concept and of course we hope and we believe and we do audience research and we think that people are going to come. But until they actually did, and came through the doors, we didn\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "The V&A\u2019s flagship museum in London\u2019s affluent South Kensington district, founded in the 1850s, is one of Britain\u2019s biggest tourist attractions. The Storehouse is across town in the Olympic Park, a post-industrial swath of east London that hosted the 2012 summer games.",
      "As part of post-Olympic regeneration, the area is now home to a new cultural quarter that includes arts and fashion colleges, a dance theater and another V&A branch, due to open next year. The Storehouse has hired dozens of young people recruited from the surrounding area, which includes some of London\u2019s most deprived districts.",
      "Designed by Diller, Scofidio and Renfro, the firm behind New York\u2019s High Line park, the building has space to show off objects too big to have been displayed very often before, including a 17th-century Mughal colonnade from India, a 1930s modernist office designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and a Pablo Picasso-designed stage curtain for a 1924 ballet, some 10 meters (more than 30 feet) high.",
      "Also on a monumental scale are large chunks of vanished buildings, including a gilded 15th-century ceiling from the Torrijos Palace in Spain and a slab of the concrete fa\u00e7ade of Robin Hood Gardens, a demolished London housing estate.",
      "Not a hushed temple of art, this is a working facility. Conversation is encouraged and forklifts beep in the background. Workers are finishing the David Bowie Center, a home for the late London-born musician\u2019s archive of costumes, musical instruments, letters, lyrics and photos that is due to open at the Storehouse in September.",
      "One aim of the Storehouse is to expose the museum\u2019s inner workings, through displays delving into all aspects of the conservators\u2019 job \u2013 from the eternal battle against insects to the numbering system for museum contents \u2014 and a viewing gallery to watch staff at work.",
      "The increased openness comes as museums in the U.K. are under increasing scrutiny over the origins of their collections. They face pressure to return objects acquired in sometimes contested circumstances during the days of the British Empire",
      "Senior curator Georgia Haseldine said the V&A is adopting a policy of transparency, \u201cso that we can talk very openly about where things have come from, how they ended up in the V&A\u2019s collection, and also make sure that researchers, as well as local people and people visiting from all around the world, have free and equitable access to these objects.",
      "\u201cOn average, museums have one to five percent of their collections on show,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is saying, \u2018No, this whole collection belongs to all of us. This is a national collection and you should have access to it.\u2019 That is our fundamental principle.\u201d",

      "The panel of seven women and five men on Thursday began weighing two counts of criminal sex act and one count of rape against the former movie mogul. Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "On Friday, one juror asked to be removed from the case, saying he felt other jurors were treating one member of the panel in an \u201cunfair and unjust\u201d way. The judge told him he had to keep deliberating and also denied a defense request for a mistrial over the issue.",
      "Weinstein was originally found guilty in New York in 2020 of rape and sexual assault against two women in a verdict considered a landmark in the #MeToo movement.",
      "But the conviction was subsequently overturned, leading to his retrial \u2014 with an additional accuser added last year \u2014 before a new jury and a different judge.",

      "Filmmaker Dean DeBlois returns to the world of \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d for a new live-action adaptation, in theaters Friday",
      "Ever wanted to soar through the skies on the back of a friendly dragon? The new \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d may be the ticket, from a decidedly safer, though possibly still vertigo-inducing, distance.",
      "This live-action adaption of the underdog adventure story sends the audience cascading through the clouds with the teenage Viking boy Hiccup and his dragon friend Toothless. It\u2019s the kind of immersive sensation and giddy wish fulfillment that might just have you forgetting momentarily to breathe and, maybe more importantly, that you\u2019re still in a movie theater. Credit to veteran cinematographer Bill Pope, no stranger to fantasy worlds, whether it\u2019s \u201cThe Matrix\u201d or \u201cScott Pilgrim vs. The World.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d doesn\u2019t stray far from the original, from shots to story beats. Gerard Butler once again plays Berk\u2019s Chief Stoick the Vast. The new Hiccup, actor Mason Thames, even sounds a bit like Jay Baruchel. But unlike so many live-action remakes of animated films, it also doesn\u2019t feel superfluous, or, worse, like a poor imitation of its predecessor that trades the magic of animation for photorealism.",
      "Perhaps that\u2019s because filmmaker Dean DeBlois, who made the three animated films, stayed in the director\u2019s chair. Who better to kill their darlings than the one who brought them to the screen in the first place? And, crucially, to know where live-action might actually enhance the fabric of the world created by author Cressida Cowell.",
      "It helps that dragon technology has come a long way since, say, \u201cDragonHeart.\u201d These fire-breathing CG creatures feel disarmingly real. And though it might look like \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d or \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the tone stays light enough for younger filmgoers. There are a few intense sequences, but none that takes it any further than the animated film did 15 years ago.",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d does start a little slow, however, which is odd because it also begins with a fiery battle between the Vikings and the dragons on the Isle of Berk. There\u2019s a lot of exposition and introduction that needs to happen before you can just give yourself over to the story. In this more multicultural version, the warriors on Berk have been recruited from tribes around the globe to try to defeat the dragons.",
      "Hiccup is a Viking nepo baby. As the chief's son, he sits in a place of privilege, but he\u2019s also a general outcast in this world of ruthless warriors \u2014 skinny and weak, he just longs to be part of the action, not sharpening the weapons. Killing dragons is currency in this society, and his crush Astrid (Nico Parker) happens to be one of the most promising up-and-comers. His sole champion is Gobber (a delightful Nick Frost), the blacksmith and dragon slayer teacher, who convinces the chief to give the clever Hiccup a shot.",
      "The film finds its internal engine when Hiccup finds Toothless, the wide-eyed \u201cNight Fury\u201d dragon whom he can\u2019t bring himself to kill. Instead, he decides to study this discovery, who he finds is not as nearly fearsome as everyone assumes. \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d teaches empathy and ingenuity without a sermon.",
      "Thames, a teenager himself, is the perfect embodiment of adolescent awkwardness and boldness. You can have all the cute dragons you want, but the audience would be lost if the human conduit to the relationship isn\u2019t up to the task. Butler seems to be having a good time, resplendent in fur and chest-thumping ideas about ancient duties. And Parker gives Astrid a relatable depth \u2014 the best in the bunch who is outshone in an unequal fight.",
      "Kids deserve movies that are made on the biggest possible canvas. \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d is one that's worth the trip to the theater. It might just spark some young imaginations, whether it\u2019s to go back and read the books or dream up their own worlds. And, chances are, no one is going to be yelling \u201cchicken jockey.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csequences of intense action and peril.\u201d Running time: 125 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

      "According to studio estimates Sunday, \u201cFrom the World of John Wick: Ballerina\u201d earned $25 million from 3,409 theaters in the U.S. and Canada. Several weeks ago it was tracking to open in the $35 to $40 million range, but that was adjusted down several times. Ultimately, it still came in lower than forecasts. The movie, directed by Len Wiseman, makes a sideline character out of Keanu Reeves\u2019 John Wick and focuses on Ana de Armas. It takes place during the events of \u201cJohn Wick 3.\u201d",
      "The box office performance is a bit perplexing result considering that \u201cBallerina\u201d got good critic reviews and audience exit polls. Conventional wisdom would say that word of mouth might have given it a boost over the weekend. But, recently, opening weekend isn\u2019t the end all that it used to be. \u201cBallerina\u201d could be in the game for the long haul.",
      "The Lionsgate release, a Thunder Road Films and 87Eleven Entertainment production, had a hefty production price tag reported to be in the $90 million range. But much of that cost has already been offset by foreign pre-sales. Internationally, it earned $26 million from 82 countries, bringing its global opening to $51 million.",
      "As the first spinoff, it\u2019s the second lowest opening of the five-film franchise \u2013 above only the first film which opened just over $14 million in 2014, which does not account for inflation. The franchise overall has grossed more than $1 billion worldwide.",
      "First place once again went to \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d which added another $32.5 million in North America, bringing its domestic total to $335.8 and global tally to $772.6 million. In just 17 days, it's already made more domestically than the live-action \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d did in its entire run ($298 million).",
      "\u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 The Final Reckoning\u201d slid to third place with $15 million, bringing its worldwide total to $450.4 million. \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d earned $8.7 million to take fourth place. And \u201cFinal Destination: Bloodlines\" rounded out the top five with $6.5 million.",
      "The new Wes Anderson movie \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d expanded beyond New York and Los Angeles to 1,678 theaters nationwide. The Focus Features release starring Benicio del Toro made an estimated $6.3 million and landed in sixth place.",

      "A pair of singing androids",
      "NEW YORK -- A pair of singing androids. Two Pulitzer Prize-winning plays. A drunken Mary Todd Lincoln. A musical with a corpse as its hero. Romeo, Juliet and teddy bears with rave music. Not to mention George Clooney.",
      "Broadway has had a stuffed season with seemingly something for everyone and now it's time to recognize the best with the Tony Awards, hosted by Cynthia Erivo, set for Sunday night on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Broadway buzz is usually reserved for musicals but this year the plays \u2014 powered by A-list talent \u2014 have driven the conversation. There's Clooney in \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck,\u201d Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal in \u201cOthello,\u201d Sarah Snook in a one-woman version of \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray\u201d and her \u201cSuccession\u201d co-star Kieran Culkin and Bob Odenkirk in \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross.\u201d (Clooney, Snook and Odenkirk are nominated for Tonys.)",
      "There were two Pulitzer winners \u2014 2024 awardee \u201cEnglish\u201d and \u201cPurpose\u201d from 2025 \u2014 but perhaps one of the season's biggest surprises was \u201cOh, Mary!,\u201d Cole Escola\u2019s irreverent, raunchy, gleefully deranged revisionist history centered on Mary Todd Lincoln. All three are nominated for best play, along with \u201cJohn Proctor is the Villain\u201d and \u201cThe Hills of California.\u201d",
      "On the musical side, three options seem to be in the mix for the top prize: \u201cMaybe Happy Ending,\u201d a rom-com about a pair of androids; \u201cDead Outlaw,\u201d about an alcoholic drifter whose embalmed body becomes a prized possession for half a century; and \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d the musical satire about longtime frenemies who drink a magic potion for eternal youth and beauty. \u201cMaybe Happy Ending,\u201d \u201cDeath Becomes Her\u201d and another musical nominee, \u201cBuena Vista Social Club,\u201d lead nominations with 10 apiece.",
      "The 2024-2025 season took in $1.9 billion, making it the highest-grossing season ever and signaling that Broadway has finally emerged from the COVID-19 blues, having overtaken the previous high of $1.8 billion during the 2018-2019 season.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going through this strange period, which I would think someday we can draw the line from COVID to this, as you can draw the line from the early 1980s with AIDS to the explosion of big musicals again,\u201d says Harvey Fierstein, who will get a special Tony for lifetime achievement.",
      "Audra McDonald, the most recognized performer in the theater awards\u2019 history, could possibly extend her Tony lead. Already the record holder for most acting wins with six Tonys, McDonald could add to that thanks to her leading turn in an acclaimed revival of \u201cGypsy.\u201d She has to get past Nicole Scherzinger, who has been wowing audiences in \u201cSunset Blvd.\u201d",
      "And Kara Young \u2014 the first Black female actor to be nominated for a Tony Award in four consecutive years \u2014 could become the first Black person to win two Tonys consecutively, should she win for her role in the play \u201cPurpose.\u201d",
      "Other possible back-to-back winners include director Danya Taymor, hoping to follow up her 2024 win with \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d with another for \u201cJohn Proctor Is the Villain,\u201d and \u201cPurpose\u201d playwright Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, who won last year with \u201cAppropriate.\u201d",
      "Other possible firsts include Daniel Dae Kim, who could become the first Asian winner in the category of best leading actor in a play for his work in a revival of \u201cYellow Face.\u201d And Marjan Neshat and her \u201cEnglish\u201d co-star Tala Ashe could become the first female actors of Iranian descent to win a Tony.",
      "Broadway this season saw a burst in alt-rock and the emergence of stories of young people for young people, including \u201cJohn Proctor is the Villain\u201d and a \u201cRomeo + Juliet\u201d pitched to Generation Z and millennials.",
      "Sunday's telecast, as usual, will have a musical number for each of the shows vying for the best new musical crown, as well as some that didn't make the cut, like \u201cJust in Time,\u201d a musical about Bobby Darin, and \u201cReal Women Have Curves.\u201d This year, there's also room for \u201cHamilton,\u201d celebrating its 10th year on Broadway. But the musicals \u201cBOOP! The Betty Boop Musical\u201d and \u201cSMASH\u201d didn't get slots.",

    "story": [
      "Edmund White, a pioneer of contemporary gay literature, died this week at age 85",
      "NEW YORK -- Andrew Sean Greer, a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist, remembers the first time he read Edmund White. It was the summer of 1989, he was beginning his second year at Brown University and he had just come out.",
      "Having learned that White would be teaching at Brown, he found a copy of White's celebrated coming-of-age novel, \u201cA Boy's Own Story.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d never read anything like it \u2014 nobody had \u2014 and what strikes me looking back is the lack of shame or self-hatred or misery that imbued so many other gay male works of fiction of that time,\u201d says Greer, whose \u201cLess\u201d won the Pulitzer for fiction in 2018. \"I, of course, did not know then I was reading a truly important literary work. All I knew is I wanted to read more.",
      "\u201cReading was all we had in those days \u2014 the private, unshared experience that could help you explore your private life,\" he said. \"Ed invented so many of us.\"",
      "White, a pioneer of contemporary gay literature, died this week at age 85. He left behind such widely read works as \u201cA Boy\u2019s Own Story\u201d and \u201cThe Beautiful Room Is Empty\u201d and a gift to countless younger writers: Validation of their lives, the discovery of themselves through the stories of others.",
      "Greer and other authors speak of White's work as more than just an influence, but as a rite of passage: \"How a queer man might begin to question all of the deeply held, deeply religious, deeply American assumptions about desire, love, and sex \u2014 who is entitled to have it, how it must be had, what it looks like,\u201d says Robert Jones Jr., whose novel above love between two enslaved men, \u201c The Prophets,\u201d was a National Book Award finalist in 2021.",
      "Jones remembers being a teenager in the 1980s when he read \u201dA Boy's Own Story.\" He found the book at a store in a gay neighborhood in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, \u201cthe safest place for a person to be openly queer in New York City,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt was a scary time for me because all the news stories about queer men revolved around AIDS and dying, and how the disease was the Christian god\u2019s vengeance against the 'sin of homosexuality,'\u201d Jones added.",
      "\u201cIt was the first time that I had come across any literature that confirmed that queer men have a childhood; that my own desires were not, in fact, some aberration, but were natural; and that any suffering and loneliness I was experiencing wasn\u2019t divine retribution, but was the intention of a human-made bigotry that could be, if I had the courage and the community, confronted and perhaps defeated,\" he said.",
      "Starting in the 1970s, White published more than 25 books, including novels, memoirs, plays, biographies and \u201cThe Joy of Gay Sex,\u201d a response to the 1970s bestseller \u201cThe Joy of Sex.\" He held the rare stature for a living author of having a prize named for him, the Edmund White Award for Debut Fiction, as presented by the Publishing Triangle.",
      "\u201cWhite was very supportive of young writers, encouraging them to explore and expand new and individual visions,\u201d said Carol Rosenfeld, chair of the Triangle. The award was \u201cone way of honoring that support.\u201d",
      "Winners such the prize was founded, in 2006, have included \u201cThe Prophets,\u201d Myriam Gurba 's \u201cDahlia Season\u201d and Joe Okonkwo's \u201cJazz Moon.\u201d Earlier this year, the award was given to Jiaming Tang's \u201c Cinema Love,\u201d a story of gay men in rural China.",
      "Tang remembered reading \u201cA Boy's Own Story\u201d in his early 20s, and said that both the book and White were \u201cessential touchpoints in my gay coming-of-age.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe writes with intimate specificity and humor, and no other writer has captured the electric excitement and crushing loneliness that gay men experience as they come of age,\u201d Tang said. \"He\u2019s a towering figure. There\u2019d be no gay literature in America without Edmund White.\u201d",

      "The eight-episode miniseries, which debuted Thursday, dramatizes the professional and personal journey of G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os, who transformed comedy in Latin America and whose characters defined a generation for millions of children. Known as \u201cChespirito,\" he took his inspiration from Laurel and Hardy as well as another transcendent Mexican comedian who eventually made it to Hollywood, Cantinflas. Chespirito died in 2014 at age 85.",
      "Pablo Cruz, who plays Chespirito in the series, told The Associated Press in an interview translated from Spanish that the show is a tribute that tells \u201ca story that we know will connect with a very broad audience and give them an opportunity to further appreciate what they already admire and love.\u201d",
      "Chespirito's two most famous characters were \u201cEl Chavo del Ocho\u201d (\"The Boy from Number Eight\u201d) and \u201cEl Chapulin Colorado\u201d (\u201cThe Crimson Grasshopper\u201d). \u201cEl Chavo del Ocho\" was an 8-year-old boy orphan living alone in a Mexican neighborhood with his barrel, freckles, striped shirt and grayed cap. \u201cEl Chapulin Colorado\u201d was a naive superhero dressed in a red bodysuit and hood with antennae that helped him detect danger miles away (despite the name, his yellow shorts and boots gave him more the look of a red bumblebee).",
      "Through his characters, Chespirito favored a clean comedy style far removed from the sexual innuendo and obscenity-laced jokes popular today. His morning shows were a staple for preschoolers, much like \u201cCaptain Kangaroo\u201d was in the United States.",
      "The HBO series \u201cis a tribute to Chespirito\u2019s importance as one of the key figures in Mexican television and highlights the enormous impact his television programs had throughout Latin America,\u201d Fernando C\u00e1rdenas, digital manager for the Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors, said in a statement to the AP.",
      "The miniseries is a powerful act of cultural preservation, one that documents the impact Latinos have had on the global entertainment industry, said Sehila Mota Casper, director of Latinos in Heritage Conservation.",
      "\u201cFor so many of us, his characters weren\u2019t just entertainment,\u201d Mota Casper said. \u201cThey shaped how we understand humor, how we face challenges and how we see ourselves as Latinxs. This series honors that impact. By telling his story in this way, we help make sure the cultural histories that shaped us are seen, respected and carried forwards to future generations.\u201d",
      "\u201cEl Chavo\u201d proved so popular that reruns are still shown in multiple countries in Latin America and on Spanish-language television in the United States. Many Latin Americans, living under dictatorships during the height of the show, found his underdog triumphs heroic in the face of authority. In a 2005 interview with the Mexican newspaper La Jornada, G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os said he always wrote with working-class people in mind.",
      "\u201cDuring the 1970s, the program was produced to reflect the reality of working-class families in Mexico and enjoyed enormous impact in other Spanish-speaking countries because the situations portrayed in the stories were similar to those of all audiences, regardless of geographical boundaries,\u201d C\u00e1rdenas said.",
      "Alberto Lammers, who grew up watching \u201cEl Chavo\u201d in Peru during the 1970s and \u201880s, was excited for the series and the childhood nostalgia it evokes. He was also excited to learn more about what was happening behind the scenes in G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os\u2019 life.",
      "\u201cIt really struck a chord with my childhood,\u201d Lammers, who now lives in California, said after finishing the first episode. \u201cIt gives heart and context to his complexity and the characters he built. It\u2019s also a very interesting look at how he became a TV personality. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing where it goes! It\u2019s a real-life telenovela!\u201d",
      "Fans also took to social media to praise the episode and their awe at the uncanny similarities between the actors and the people they are playing.",
      "For Lammers, after migrating to the U.S., \u201cEl Chavo del Ocho\u201d served as a connection to his roots even if the show wasn't based in Peru.",
      "\u201cGoing to that show to me was actually very comforting,\u201d Lammers said. \u201cIt built a sense of community across most of Latin America.\u201d",

      "The second day of deliberations ended Friday without a verdict. Jurors are expected back in court Monday.",
      "Jurors reheard testimony from Weinstein\u2019s three accusers. They also reviewed other evidence, including medical records and emails.",
      "Twice on Friday, though, a juror requested to address the court without the other jurors present.",

      "The juror insisted, calling the treatment \u201cunfair and unjust\u201d even as he described the tension as \u201cplayground stuff\u201d with jurors shunning another juror and talking behind their back.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyer Arthur Aidala argued that the jury should be told to stop deliberating while the court found out more about the concerns.",

      "CHOCTAW, Miss. -- It\u2019s a small part in a big movie, but for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, their scene in \"Sinners\" is a huge deal.",
      "The horror movie blockbuster, starring Michael B. Jordan as a gangster turned vampire slayer, paints a brief but impactful portrait of the tribe using Choctaw actors and cultural experts. For some, it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve seen the Choctaw way of life accurately portrayed on the big screen.",
      "In the scene, a posse of Choctaw, riding on horseback and in an old truck, arrives at a small farmhouse to warn the couple that lives there of coming danger. When the couple refuses their help, a Choctaw man wishes them luck in his native language before riding off.",

      "Massey runs the tribe\u2019s Chahta Immi Cultural Center alongside Sherrill Nickey and department director Jay Wesley. All three were hired as cultural consultants to ensure a genuine depiction of the tribe in the film. Together, they sifted through archives, researching how their ancestors would have dressed, spoken and acted in the 1930s, when \u201cSinners\u201d takes place.",

While recording, Jaeden Wesley said the filmmakers told her they wanted the Choctaw people to hear their music in the movie.",
      "\u201cWe were catering to our own people, even in that short little second,\u201d Jaeden Wesley said.",
      "Shining a spotlight on often overlooked cultures and topics, like the Choctaw people, is part of the mission at Proximity Media, which produced \u201cSinners.\u201d The company was founded by \u201cSinners\u201d director Ryan Coogler, his wife and film producer, Zinzi Coogler, and producer Sev Ohanian.",
      "\u201cIt was never a question for us that if we were going to portray the Mississippi Choctaw, we got to have the right people who can tell us, who can tell Ryan, what we\u2019re not knowing, what we\u2019re not thinking,\u201d Ohanian said. \u201cIt was all because we\u2019re trying to serve Ryan\u2019s story of like putting truth on screen.\"",
      "Ohanian and his co-founders didn\u2019t stop with Choctaw consultants; they enlisted a small army of experts who advised on the confluence of cultures mingling in the Mississippi Delta, where the film is set. The resulting cinematic world was so well received, community organizers penned an open letter, inviting Coogler and his fellow filmmakers to visit the Delta. Last week, the Cooglers, Ohanian and others took up the offer, attending a \u201cSinners\u201d screening in Clarksdale, Mississippi. Clarksdale is where the film's events unfold.",
      "\u201cI hope this encourages other filmmakers to find opportunities to be authentic in their storytelling and to look at this rich tapestry of culture that\u2019s right here in America,\u201d Ohanian said, noting the film industry has historically misrepresented nonwhite groups.",
      "For Wesley and his fellow consultants, the hope is the film will cultivate curiosity in audiences, encourage them to learn more about Choctaw culture and visit the Chahta Immi Cultural Center.",
      "\u201cIt's important to be connected to this culture because this was here before the public was here,\u201d Massey said. \u201cProbably three-quarters of Mississippi was Choctaw land, and now we only have 350,000 acres.\u201d",
      "They say Choctaw participation in the film has cultivated a sense of pride among tribe members. Nickey hopes it will encourage a sort of cultural renaissance at a time when she says fewer and fewer Choctaw speak their native language.",
      "\u201cI know for a fact that there are a lot of kids out there that don't even know how to speak our language. They only speak English,\u201d Nickey said. \u201cI hope they know it's okay to speak our language.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Years before Ana de Armas was using an ice skate to slice a neck in \u201cFrom the World of John Wick: Ballerina,\u201d she co-starred with Keanu Reeves in a much different film.",
      "The erotic thriller \u201cKnock Knock,\u201d released in 2015, was de Armas\u2019 first Hollywood film. De Armas, born and raised in Cuba, had just come to Los Angeles after acting in Spain. English was new to her, so she had to learn her lines phonetically.",
      "\u201cIt was tough and I felt miserable at times and very lonely,\u201d she says in an interview. \u201cBut I wanted to prove myself. I remember being in meetings with producers and they would be like, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll see you in a year when you learn English.\u2019 Before I left the office, I would say, \u2018I\u2019ll see you in two months.\u2019\u201d",
      "Since \u201cKnock Knock,\u201d her rise to stardom has been one of the last decade's most meteoric. She was radiant even as a hologram in \u201cBlade Runner 2049.\u201d She stole the show in Rian Johnson\u2019s star-studded \u201cKnives Out.\u201d She breezed through the Bond movie \u201cNo Time to Die.\u201d She was Oscar nominated for her Marilyn Monroe in \u201cBlonde. \u201d",
      "And now, 10 years after those scenes with Reeves, de Armas is for the first time headlining a big summer action movie. In \u201cBallerina,\u201d in theaters Friday, de Armas\u2019 progressive development as an unlikely action star reaches a butt-kicking crescendo, inheriting the mantle of one of the most esteemed, high-body-count franchises.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big moment in my career, and I know that. I can see that,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes me look back in many ways, just being with Keanu in another film in such a different place in my career. It definitely gives me perspective of the journey and everything since we met. Things have come far since then.\u201d",
      "While de Armas, 37, isn\u2019t new to movie stardom, or the tabloid coverage that comes with it, many of her career highlights have been streaming releases. \u201cThe Gray Man\u201d and \u201cBlonde\u201d were Netflix. \u201cGhosted\u201d was Apple TV+. But \u201cBallerina\u201d will rely on de Armas (and abiding \u201cJohn Wick\u201d fandom) to put moviegoers in seats.",
      "Heading in, analysts expected an opening weekend of around $35-40 million, which would be a solid result for a spinoff that required extensive reshoots. Reviews, particularly for de Armas playing a ballerina-assassin, have been good.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure,\u201d says director Len Wiseman. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to carry all on her shoulders. But she\u2019ll be the first person to tell you: \u2018Put it on. Let me carry the weight. I\u2019m totally game.\u2019\u201d",
      "De Armas, whose talents include the ability to be present and personable on even the most frenzied red carpets, has done the globe-trotting work to make \u201cBallerina\u201d a big deal: appearing at CinemaCon, gamely eating hot wings and cheerfully deflecting questions about her next film, \u201cDeeper,\u201d with Tom Cruise.",
      "Yet for someone so comfortable in the spotlight, one of the more interesting facts about de Armas is that she lives part time in that bastion of young A-listers: Vermont.",
      "\u201cYeah, it surprised many people,\u201d she says, chuckling. \u201cAs soon as I went up there, I knew that was going to be a place that would bring me happiness and sanity and peace. But I know for a Cuban who doesn\u2019t like cold very much, it\u2019s very strange.\u201d",
      "Winding up in northern New England is just as unexpected as landing an action movie like \u201cBallerina.\u201d She grew up with the conviction, from age 12, that she would be an actor. But she studied theater.",
      "\u201cI never thought I was going to do action,\u201d de Armas says. \u201cWhat was relatable for me was watching Cuban actors on TV and in movies. That was my reality. That\u2019s all I knew, so the actors I looked up to were those.\u201d",
      "De Armas also had bad asthma, which makes some of the things she does in \u201cBallerina\u201d \u2014 a movie with a flamethrower duel \u2014 all the more remarkable to her.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI couldn\u2019t run. I sometimes couldn\u2019t play with my friends. I had to just be home and be still so I wouldn\u2019t get an asthma attack. So I never thought of myself as someone athletic or able to run just a block. So this has been a surprise.\u201d",
      "At 14, she auditioned and got into Havana\u2019s National Theatre of Cuba. Four years later, with Spanish citizenship through her grandparents, she moved to Madrid to pursue acting. When she arrive in LA in 2014, she had to start all over again.",
      "Now as one of the top Latina stars in Hollywood, she's watched as immigrant paths like hers have grow increasingly arduous if not impossible. The day after she spoke to The Associated Press, the Trump administration announced a travel ban on 12 countries and heavy restrictions on citizens of other countries, including Cuba.",
      "\u201cI got here at a time when things were definitely easier in that sense,\u201d says de Armas, who announced her then-imminent U.S. citizenship while hosting \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in 2023. \u201cSo I just feel very lucky for that. But it\u2019s difficult. Everything that\u2019s going on is very difficult and very sad and really challenging for many people. I definitely wish things were different.\u201d",
      "Chad Stahelski, director of the four \u201cJohn Wick\u201d films and producer of \u201cBallerina,\u201d was about to start production on \u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 4\u201d when producer Basil Iwanyk and Nathan Kahane, president of Lionsgate, called to set up a Zoom about casting de Armas. He quickly watched every scene she had been in.",
      "\u201cHow many people would have played the Bond girl kind of goofy like that?\u201d he says. \u201cI know that I can harden people up. I know I can make them the assassin, but getting the charm and the love and the humor out of someone is trickier. But she had it.\u201d",
      "In \u201cKnives Out,\u201d Stahelski saw someone who could go from scared and uncertain to a look of \u201cI'm going to stab you in the eye.\u201d",
      "\u201cI like that in my action heroes,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the stoic, superhero vibe where everything\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d",
      "But it wasn\u2019t just her acting or her charisma that convinced Stahelski. It was her life story.",
      "\u201c'John Wick' is all hard work \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean just in the training. You\u2019ve got to love it and put yourself out there,\u201d says Stahelski. \u201cWhen you get her story about how she came from the age of 12, got into acting, what she sacrificed, what she did, that\u2019s what got my attention. \u2018Oh, she\u2019s a perseverer. She doesn\u2019t just enjoy the view, she enjoys the climb.\u2019\u201d",
      "When that quote is read back to her, de Armas laughs, and agrees.",
      "\u201cBeing Cuban, and my upbringing and my family and everything I\u2019ve done, I\u2019ve never had a plan B,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve never had that thing of, \u2018Well, if it doesn\u2019t work, my family can help.\u2019 Or, \u2018I can do this other career.\u2019 This was it. And I also knew, besides being the thing I loved the most, this was my survival. This is how I live. This is how I feed myself and my family. So it\u2019s also a sense of, I don\u2019t know, responsibility.\u201d",
      "That makes her reflect back to when she was just trying to make it in Hollywood, sounding out words, trying not to disappoint directors whose instructions she could barely understand, trying not to be intimidated by the action star across from her who had just finished shooting the first \u201cJohn Wick.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was so committed to do it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was so invested in the trying of it, just giving it a shot. When I give something a shot, I try my best, whatever that is. Then I can actually say: I gave it a shot.\u201d",

He was later seen on video walking through various parts of the city, trying to sell the instruments, and he eventually sold one while the other remains unaccounted for, police said, declining further comment.

      "NEW YORK -- Jurors started deliberating Thursday in Harvey Weinstein \u2019s New York sex crimes retrial, tasked with deciding \u2014 again \u2014 a case that encapsulated the #MeToo movement.",
      "The seven-woman, five-man jury is considering two counts of criminal sex act and one count of rape, each relating to a different accuser and a different date. In this case, the criminal sex act charge is the higher-degree felony. The jury got the case after a juror was replaced by an alternate after she couldn\u2019t come to court due to illness.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Nearly eight years ago, a series of sexual misconduct allegations against the Oscar-winning movie producer propelled the #MeToo movement. Some of those accusations later generated criminal charges and convictions in New York and California.",
      "The New York conviction from 2020 was subsequently overturned, leading to the retrial before a new jury and a different judge.",
      "Jurors heard more than five weeks of testimony, including lengthy and sometimes fiery questioning of Weinstein's three accusers in the case.",
      "Jessica Mann said he raped her in 2013, when she was trying to build an acting career. Miriam Haley accused him of forcibly performing oral sex on her in 2006, when she was looking for work in entertainment production.",
      "Kaja Sokola, who wasn't involved in Weinstein's first trial, told jurors that he forced oral sex on her, too, during 2006. At the time, she was a teenage fashion model trying to break into acting.",
      "\u201cThey all had dreams of pursuing careers in the defendant's world, the entertainment industry,\u201d prosecutor Nicole Blumberg told jurors in her closing argument Tuesday. She contended that Weinstein let the women think he was interested in their careers when what actually interested him were their bodies, and \"he was going to have their bodies and touch their bodies whether they wanted him to or not.\u201d",

      "The long-running gang case involving Atlanta rapper Young Thug will end without a single murder conviction",
      "ATLANTA -- Three years after Atlanta rapper Young Thug and 27 others were indicted on gang and racketeering charges, followed by a long, problem-plagued trial, nobody will be convicted of murder.",
      "When Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis announced the indictment in May 2022, she said her office was cracking down on a violent street gang responsible for multiple killings run by Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffery Williams.",
      "But Willis dropped the only remaining murder charge Monday after defendant Demise McMullen pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of aggravated assault. Young Thug went home Oct. 31 after pleading guilty to gang, drug and gun charges and remains on probation.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Young Thug and two others founded the street gang Young Slime Life, which was associated with the Bloods street gang, in 2012. The 33-year-old artist has a record label called Young Stoner Life, which prosecutors alleged was tied to Young Slime Life.",
      "Prosecutors drew ire for using song lyrics and social media posts in their case. Attorney Doug Weinstein, who represented defendant Deamonte Kendrick, who raps under the name Yak Gotti, said prosecutors targeted men who pursued music as a way out of hardship in economically \u201cdeprived\u201d Atlanta areas and tried to \u201cclaw them back in, hold them back down.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhatever they may have done in their youth, and I would argue most of them didn't do anything, to be targeted in this way by the prosecutors is just wrong,\u201d said Weinstein. \u201cWhatever you think of their music \u2014 the violence, the misogynistic lyrics \u2014 that is not a reason to go after these guys.\u201d",
      "Weinstein continued, adding, \u201cPeople like my client, Mr. Kendrick, had to be incarcerated for 2 1/2 years or more, in the case of some of these defendants, for a crime that they didn\u2019t do.\"",
      "Kendrick was stabbed in jail. He was one of two defendants who didn\u2019t take plea deals, and the only one cleared of all charges, including a murder charge in the 2015 drive-by shooting death of rival gang member Donovan Thomas Jr., known as \u201cBig Nut.\u201d",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, Willis spokesperson Jeff DiSantis said \u201canti-gang efforts\u201d have yielded \u201cover 400 convictions of gang members\" since Willis became district attorney, including 19 people in this case. Those efforts were \u201ckey\u201d in making Fulton County \"safer, taking dangerous offenders off the streets and sending a message that gang activity will not be tolerated in our community,\u201d he said.",
      "Willis prosecuted the case using Georgia's broad anti-racketeering law. Critics say using that law caused a messy trial by roping in dozens of people with varying levels of alleged culpability. The anti-racketeering law allows prosecutors to present evidence that might otherwise not be allowed, which some defense attorneys say lets prosecutors present irrelevant material to the jury. It also often leads to people being held in jail longer for multiple reasons.",
      "\u201cIt made everything so much more complicated and cumbersome,\u201d said Max Schardt, defense attorney for defendant Shannon Stillwell.",
      "Stillwell was among five codefendants who stood trial alongside Young Thug beginning in November 2023.",
      "After Young Thug and the others entered guilty pleas, Stillwell and Kendrick were the only ones who took their chances with a jury. They were found not guilty of racketeering, murder and gang-related charges in December. Stillwell was found guilty only of gun possession. The verdict came nearly two years after jury selection began.",
      "Nine other defendants, including the rapper Gunna, accepted plea deals before the trial began. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case. Twelve defendants were split from the original trial, and charges against six of them were dismissed in early December. Another recently got a murder charge dismissed after entering an Alford plea, which allows him to maintain his innocence while acknowledging that it is in his best interest to plead guilty.",
      "McMullen, who was also charged with murder in Thomas' killing, entered an Alford plea to a lesser aggravated assault charge and another count of violating the anti-racketeering law. A judge in this case sentenced him to 40 years, with 20 to be served in confinement at the same time as the sentence he's already serving, and 20 suspended for time served. That leaves one remaining defendant who is accused of shooting and wounding an Atlanta police officer in February 2022 while on probation. His fate is expected to be determined soon.",
      "Atlanta defense attorney Andrew Fleischman, who was not involved in the case, said Willis could have secured guilty pleas years ago without a long, expensive trial if she hadn't used the anti-racketeering law.",
      "\u201cShe went for a home run, and she didn\u2019t get it,\u201d said Fleischman.",

      "As if a movie about sharks wasn't scary enough, the filmmakers behind \u201cDangerous Animals\u201d have upped the screams by adding what every thriller needs \u2014 a serial killer.",
      "While that may sound like very dangerous moviemaking, the result is actually taut and well crafted, a worthy birthday present to \u201cJaws,\u201d celebrating its 50th anniversary this summer.",
      "\u201cDangerous Animals\u201d stars Jai Courtney as an Australian boat captain who likes feeding his female customers to sharks and videotaping it, while also offering little brainy speeches about the nature of makos, mosquitos or sailfish while toying with his prey.",
      "He meets what seems like his match in Hassie Harrison's Zephyr, an American antisocial surf queen who lives in a van and refuses to be tied down. \u201cThere was nothing for me on land,\u201d she says. She's kind of a handful for any serial killer, For instance, she can pick locks with the underwire from a bikini top.",
      "Nick Lepard's screenplay is muscular and satisfying, with nods to \u201cJaws,\u201d of course, but also to \u201cPoint Break,\u201d \u201cHannibal\u201d and even the song \u201cBaby Shark.\u201d He says he was inspired to write \u201cDangerous Animals\u201d by seeing a surfboard bag and imagining it carrying a body, which says something about how Lepard's mind works, though we're not judging.",
      "Director Sean Byrnes has a super ability to build dread and his scenes are crisp without being exploitative. The movie was shot on Queensland\u2019s Gold Coast, but may take a bite out of the region's shark cage diving fleets. I'm looking twice even before taking showers now.",
      "Zephyr and the serial killer play an engaging game of chess for most of the movie, if by chess is meant she's fighting to stay alive by wriggling out of handcuffs and running or swimming away and he's determined for her to be shark food.",
      "\u201cOh, you're a fighter. I love fighters. It makes for a better show,\u201d he says, biting into the scenery almost as viciously as the sharks chomp on chum.",
      "He also does that thing that all serial killers do \u2014 saying he and his victim are similar. \u201cYou're hard as nails. Like me. You and me, we're sharks,\u201d he tells her. She tells him to stop talking so much and calls him ocean scum.",
      "The music department has a fun wink with the soundtrack. One scene uses Steve Wright's \u201cEvie (Part One)\u201d \u2014 in which the singer begs his love to let her hair hang down \u2014 as the serial killer makes mementos out of his victims' hair. Another moment, astonishingly, plays Etta James' \u201cAt Last,\u201d the ultimate wedding song, just as the bad guy finally captures his quarry inches from rescue.",
      "The setting of a boat in the middle of the Coral Sea unlocks a delicious new home for terror. Sealable hatches and no one for miles means screaming is no good. And the serial killer has weaponized Vegemite.",
      "One thing Zephyr has up her sleeve is a boy, smitten after a meet-cute in which she tries to shoplift ice cream. He's played by the hunky Josh Heuston and they're perfect for each other but she resists until she's snatched by our nasty boat captain. But even though she blew him off, her boy is suspicious about her disappearance and is on the hunt.",
      "\u201cDangerous Animals,\u201d thankfully, doesn't try to be more than it is, although the quite beautiful images of sharks sliding through the ocean show, naturally, that we are the species that inspired the title. After all, sharks don't see a surfboard bag and wonder if they can put a body in it.",
      "\u201cDangerous Animals,\u201d an IFC Films release in theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cstrong, bloody violent content, grisly images, sexuality, language and brief drug use.\u201d Running time: 98 minutes. Three stars out of four.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s National Institutes of Health director says some employees\u2019 critical letter to him has \u201cfundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- In his confirmation hearings to lead the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya pledged his openness to views that might conflict with his own. \u201cDissent,\" he said, \u201dis the very essence of science.\u201d",
      "That commitment is being put to the test.",
      "On Monday, scores of scientists at the agency sent their Trump-appointed leader a letter titled the Bethesda Declaration, challenging \u201cpolicies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.\u201d",
      "It says: \"We dissent.\"",
      "In a capital where insiders often insist on anonymity to say such things publicly, 92 NIH researchers, program directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on the letter \u2014 and their careers on the line. An additional 250 of their colleagues across the agency endorsed the declaration without using their names.",
      "The four-page letter, addressed to Bhattacharya, also was sent to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and members of Congress who oversee the NIH. White House spokesman Kush Desai defended the administration's approach to federal research and said President Donald Trump is focused on restoring a \u201cGold Standard\u201d of science, not \u201cideological activism.\u201d",
      "The signers went public in the face of a \u201cculture of fear and suppression\u201d they say Trump's administration has spread through the federal civil service. \u201cWe are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Bhattacharya responded to the declaration by saying it \u201chas some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months.\"",
      "\u201cNevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive,\u201d he said in a statement. \"We all want the NIH to succeed.\u201d",
      "Named for the agency's headquarters location in Maryland, the Bethesda Declaration details upheaval in the world\u2019s premier public health research institution over the course of mere months.",
      "It addresses the termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12 billion and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants.",
      "In one case, an NIH-supported study of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti had to be stopped, ceasing antibiotic treatment mid-course for patients.",
      "In a number of cases, trials that were mostly completed were rendered useless without the money to finish and analyze the work, the letter says. \u201cEnding a $5 million research study when it is 80% complete does not save $1 million,\u201d it says, \u201cit wastes $4 million.\u201d",
      "Jenna Norton, who oversees health disparity research at the agency's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, recently appeared at a forum by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., to talk about what's happening at the NIH.",
      "At the event, she masked to conceal her identity. Now the mask is off. She was a lead organizer of the declaration.",
      "\u201cI want people to know how bad things are at NIH,\" Norton told The Associated Press.",
      "The signers said they modeled their indictment after Bhattacharya\u2019s Great Barrington Declaration in 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.",
      "His declaration drew together likeminded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive COVID-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracized by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH.",
      "\u201cHe is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,\" said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration.",
      "As chief of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch, Kobrin provides scientific oversight of researchers across the country who've been funded by the cancer institute or want to be. Cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimizing its destruction. \"So much of it is gone \u2014 my work,\u201d she said.",
      "The 21-year NIH veteran said she signed because she didn't want to be \"a collaborator\u201d in the political manipulation of biomedical science.",
      "Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, also signed the declaration. \u201cWe have a saying in basic science,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go and become a physician if you want to treat thousands of patients. You go and become a researcher if you want to save billions of patients.",
      "\u201cWe are doing the research that is going to go and create the cures of the future,\u201d he added. But that won\u2019t happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing grant cuts.",
      "The NIH employees interviewed by the AP emphasized they were speaking for themselves and not for their institutes nor the NIH.",
      "Employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants.",
      "The letter asserts \u201cNIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety\u201d and the agency is shirking commitments to trial participants who \u201cbraved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has gone at public health research on several fronts, both directly, as part of its broad effort to root out diversity, equity and inclusion values throughout the bureaucracy, and as part of its drive to starve some universities of federal money.",
      "At the White House, Desai said Americans \u201chave lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",
      "This has forced \u201cindiscriminate grant terminations, payment freezes for ongoing research, and blanket holds on awards regardless of the quality, progress, or impact of the science,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Some NIH employees have previously come forward in televised protests to air grievances, and many walked out of Bhattacharya's town hall with staff. The declaration is the first cohesive effort to register agency-wide dismay with the NIH's direction.",
      "The dissenters remind Bhattacharya in their letter of his oft-stated ethic that academic freedom must be a lynchpin in science.",
      "With that in place, he said in a statement in April, \u201cNIH scientists can be certain they are afforded the ability to engage in open, academic discourse as part of their official duties and in their personal capacities without risk of official interference, professional disadvantage or workplace retaliation.\"",
      "Now it will be seen whether that's enough to protect those NIH employees challenging the Trump administration and him.",
      "\u201cThere's a book I read to my kids, and it talks about how you can't be brave if you're not scared,\u201d said Norton, who has three young children. \"I am so scared about doing this, but I am trying to be brave for my kids because it's only going to get harder to speak up.",
      "\u201cMaybe I'm putting my kids at risk by doing this,\" she added. \"And I'm doing it anyway because I couldn't live with myself otherwise.\u201d",
      "e and noy on",
      "\u201cIn recent years, Americans have lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago,\u201d spokesman Kush Desai said. \u201cThe Trump administration is focused on restoring the Gold Standard of Science \u2014 not ideological activism \u2014 as the guiding principle of HHS, the NIH, and the CDC to finally address our chronic disease epidemic.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency is taking aim at dozens of rules aimed at protecting the environment, including one that requires big polluters to report greenhouse gas emissions",
      "LEOPOLD, Ind. -- On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman\u2019s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.",
      "Outside, the real sky isn\u2019t always blue. Sometimes it\u2019s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that\u2019s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.",
      "\u201cIndustry and government is very, very, very powerful. It\u2019s more powerful than me. I\u2019m just an English teacher,\u201d Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.",
      "In a way, Brockman\u2019s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.",
      "That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump\u2019s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.",
      "But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data \u2014 at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere \u2014 would make it tougher to fight climate change.",
      "At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.",
      "And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.",
      "The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.",
      "\"We can\u2019t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that\u2019s changing over time,\" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.",
      "Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.",
      "But the registry \u201cdoes put pressure on companies to ... document what they\u2019ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.",
      "Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.",
      "\"It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.\u201d",
      "The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these \u201cmonitoring deserts,\u201d said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.",
      "\"The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can\u2019t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.",
      "The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.",
      "CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It\u2019s human rights,\u201d said Daisha Wall, the group's community science program manager. \u201cWe all deserve a right to clean air.\u201d",
      "Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what\u2019s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.",
      "Indiana says it \u201cmaintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,\u201d but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren't satisfied. She and other members of local advocacy groups Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life and Valley Watch install and maintain their own air and water quality monitors. It\u2019s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.",
      "Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven\u2019t eaten breakfast.",
      "\u201cBut you also don\u2019t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Canada\u2019s wildfire season is off to an intense start",
      "While images of wildfires capture their ferocity, data can provide insight into how bad a fire season is.",
      "Such is the case with two graphics, powered by satellite data, that showcase a Canadian wildfire season off to a wild \u2014 and scary \u2014 start.",
      "Twice a day a NASA satellite sends images to the ground, giving a real-time view of where fires are burning. This is especially useful for remote areas where no sensors are stationed.",
      "As of Tuesday that satellite had picked up four times as many fire hot spots across Canada than is typical for early June. That\u2019s more than any year since the satellite began transmitting in 2012, except 2023, according to data from Global Forest Watch.",
      "Though the satellite has recorded thousands of hot spots so far this year, that does not mean there are actually that many active fires. Each hot spot could be detected repeatedly over the course of days. And because each detection is about the size of 26 football fields, it can represent part of a much larger blaze, said James MacCarthy, wildfire research manager at Global Forest Watch.",
      "Based on data from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, about 200 fires are actively burning in Canada and have consumed about 7,700 square miles (19,900 square kilometers) of terrain, most of it in the last week.",
      "Only 2023 saw such high numbers so early in Canada's fire season, which runs from April through October. That year wildfires burned a record 67,000 square miles \u2014 more than twice the surface area of Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes.",
      "Taken together, the hot spots and acres burned mean 2025 is the second-worst start to the season in years.",
      "\u201cA warm and dry finish to May and early June has created a significant fire season,\u201d said Liam Buchart, a fire weather specialist with the Canadian Forest Service.",
      "The weather conditions are made more likely by climate change and encourage wildfires to start. That means even though 90% of wildfires in Manitoba this year have been human-caused, according to the provincial government, climate change helps enable their spread.",
      "\u201cClimate change is creating the conditions that make it more likely that human-caused fires are going to spread, or even start,\u201d MacCarthy said. \u201cIt might be a human starting it, but it\u2019s going to spread quickly because now there\u2019s hot and dry conditions that are occurring more frequently and more intensely than they have in the past.\u201d",
      "The hot and dry weather is likely to to continue for at least the next week across Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, according to Natural Resources Canada. The agency\u2019s forecasts also call for \u201ca warmer and drier than normal July and August for large portions of Canada,\u201d Buchart said.",
      "\u201cThe remainder of the fire season looks to remain above normal, especially over the northern prairie provinces and southern British Columbia,\u201d he said.",

      "Childhood vaccination rates against measles fell in the years after the COVID-19 pandemic in nearly 80% of the more than 2,000 U.S. counties with available data",
      "Childhood vaccination rates against measles fell in the years after the COVID-19 pandemic in nearly 80% of the more than 2,000 U.S. counties with available data \u2014 including in states that are battling outbreaks this year.",
      "A Johns Hopkins University study, published in JAMA this week, illustrates where more vulnerable communities are located. The results mirror trends established at state and national levels: Routine childhood vaccination rates are dropping.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at the state level or national level ... you really don\u2019t see those drastic drops. Those are there. They\u2019re real and they\u2019re really problematic,\u201d said Lauren Gardner, an expert in infectious disease modeling at Johns Hopkins University who is the paper\u2019s senior author. Gardner also built the university\u2019s COVID-19 database.",
      "Most of the measles cases in the U.S. this year \u2014 1,088 nationally as of Friday \u2014 are in unvaccinated people. It has been spreading among communities due to international and domestic travel. Three people have died from measles during this year's outbreaks, and 2025 is inching closer to becoming the worst for measles in more than three decades.",
      "Measles was eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, and the vaccine is safe and highly effective. Public schools nationwide require two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine before kindergarten, but the number of children with non-medical exemptions from those requirements hit an all-time high in the 2023-2024 school year. Health experts say community-level vaccination needs to be at 95% or higher to prevent outbreaks.",
      "The Johns Hopkins study looked at 2,066 counties across 33 states, comparing kindergarten vaccination rates averaged over school years from 2017-2020 to averages from 2022-2024. Where kindergarten data wasn\u2019t available, the researchers used a comparable rate.",
      "Here's what it looks like in counties where there have been outbreaks this year, including in Texas counties that are the epicenter of measles.",
      "Texas has logged 742 measles cases since late January, most in West Texas.",
      "Gaines County has 411 cases, the most in the state. Almost 2% of its population got measles. While the county saw a two percentage-point increase in vaccination rates after the pandemic, its 82.4% rate remains below herd immunity.",
      "Terry County (60 cases) and Yoakum County (20 cases) dropped below the 95% threshold for herd immunity after the pandemic, to 93.7% and 91.8% respectively.",
      "Lubbock County \u2014 which has seen 53 cases and is the closest metro area to Gaines County \u2014 was just below 95% before the pandemic, but dropped three percentage points after to 91.8%.",
      "El Paso County on the border of Mexico has had the third-most measles cases in Texas this year with 57. Its vaccination rate is higher than 95% but saw a 2.1 percentage-point decline to 96.5%.",
      "Counties with outbreaks in Kansas include Gray with 25 cases, Haskell with 11 and and Stevens with seven.",
      "Vaccination rates in Gray County dropped 23 percentage points after the pandemic, from 94% to 71%.",
      "Haskell County dropped 18 percentage points to 65%. And Stevens County dropped 0.5 percentage points to 90.5%.",
      "Colorado's outbreak, which is linked to an international flight that landed at the Denver airport in mid-May, involves six cases: five in state residents and one out-of-state traveler.",
      "Two people who got measles live in Arapahoe County in the Denver metro, where the vaccination rate dropped 3.5 percentage points to 88.4%. Three others live in El Paso County, home to Colorado Springs, where the vaccination rate dropped 3.8 percentage points to 80% post-pandemic.",
      "Pre-pandemic data in North Dakota wasn't available to Johns Hopkins researchers, but they looked at rates from school years ending in 2022, 2023 and 2024.",
      "North Dakota's first outbreak started in Williams County, which now has 16 measles cases. In the timeframe researchers looked at, vaccination rates in Williams rose from 84.6% in 2022 to 87.7% in 2023, only to drop back to 83.5% in 2024.",
      "Cass County has seven cases, and its rate has stayed steady at about 92.7%, while Grand Forks County, which has 10 measles cases, dropped from 95.4% to 93.4%.",

    "summary": "It might start when you realize you can&rsquo;t hear the doorbell, or certain ringtones",
    "story": [
      "It might start when you realize you can\u2019t hear the doorbell, or certain ringtones",
      "NEW YORK -- My first tip-off were the little things, the high-pitched little things: the doorbell and ringtones my kids could hear but I could not.",
      "Then it was the garbled-sounding conversations, and the accompanying annoyance of having to ask people to repeat themselves. Or worse, giving up and just playing along without being able to follow everything that was being said.",
      "Even then, I stalled for years before finally going through the process of getting a hearing aid. How do you even begin? Will it look clunky and make me feel like a dinosaur? And the cost!",
      "Getting a hearing test, and confirmation that I needed a hearing aid, was just the beginning.",
      "The doctor handed me a list of places I could go to get fitted. I made some calls and narrowed it down to the places that took my insurance and my zero-interest health care credit card.",
      "The first couple places were demoralizing: I walked in, was told it\u2019d be $7,000 for the \u201cbest\u201d option (they mysteriously didn\u2019t happen to have any other options handy), then marched right back out the door, utterly discouraged.",
      "I started asking friends and neighbors whether they wore a hearing aid, or knew anyone at all with a hearing aid, and could point me to a good audiologist.",
      "It took a lot of poking around, but I found one \u2014 and it made all the difference.",
      "I\u2019ve been wearing my hearing aids for several months now, and they are as easy as slipping on a pair of glasses, are almost invisible, have reconnected me with the world, and, as crazy as this may sound, they bring me joy.",
      "After talking with a few audiologists around the country, it turns out that my experience is pretty typical.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of people who stall before getting one,\u201d says Meagan P. Bachmann, director of audiology at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist, in North Carolina.",
      "\u201cHearing is important because it connects us with people,\u201d she says. \u201cMultiple studies show that not hearing can affect your ability to connect with others and participate in life, so you have to think of it in terms of overall health. Maybe you no longer go to family events, or you don\u2019t understand your doctor. People start to withdraw. A lot of people come in because it\u2019s gotten so bad that it is impacting their relationships.\u201d",
      "To speed up the process and make it less frustrating, here\u2019s what the pros recommend:",
      "1. Get tested, take the results seriously, and know that many if not most hearing aids these days are small, nearly invisible, rechargeable, and pretty easy to wear and maintain. And believe it or not, hearing aids can be fun \u2014 these days, there are colors to choose from and ways to bejewel them. One company, Deafmetal, makes jazzy-looking \u201csafety rings\u201d to help keep hearing aids in place.",
      "2. Shop for an expert audiologist. Look for someone who takes your insurance or any sort of medical credit card you might have, or has a payment plan of some kind, if needed. This is a world at the awkward juncture of consumerism and medical care, but a good audiologist should come across as a medical provider, not a salesperson. And a good audiologist should take the time to work with you to find a hearing aid that meets your individual needs, and also fits your budget.",
      "A good place to start is often with your doctor; with the American Academy of Audiologists, which lists providers on its website; or by word of mouth.",
      "\u201cAlthough all hearing aids are amplifiers, not everybody needs the same thing,\u201d says Bachmann. \u201cFitting a hearing aid is an art. It changes the acoustics, and everyone is different. You want someone who listens to your lifestyle needs. Do you have a lot of difficulty with noise? Are you mostly in quiet situations? How much technology do you need, and what kind?\u201d",
      "Greta Stamper, an audiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, agrees. \u201cHearing loss is not a one-time thing. It\u2019s a chronic health condition. It should be a partnership between you and your audiologist,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s someone asking you what you\u2019re looking for and how it\u2019s going. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressured or pushed.\u201d",
      "3. A note on cost. Although hearing aids can be pricey, there are affordable options, and a good audiologist should be able to let you try out options at several price points. Insurance often covers much of the cost, and there are ways to pay for the remaining cost in installments. Also, avoidance has pretty high costs as well, audiologists say, and the longer the wait, the harder it may be to solve the problem with a hearing aid. Although there are cheaper hearing aids at big box stores, Bachmann warns that it\u2019s good to check with your audiologist before taking that route. \u201cSome of those hearing aids are locked, so that you\u2019re not allowed to have them programmed by an outside audiologist,\u201d she says.",
      "Remember, says Stamper, that hearing aids are an investment, and usually last between five and six years.",
      "4. Know your rights. \u201cWe select what is the most likely to be successful, and if it doesn\u2019t work out you come back and do something else,\u201d says Stamper. She said most states mandate a trial period. In some cases, hearing-aid companies also cover the cost of multiple visits to your audiologist while you are getting used to your new hearing aid and get training in how to use and maintain it.",
      "5. Embrace the process, and expect it to take a little time and a few expert tweaks. Audiologists say your brain needs time to adjust to a hearing aid, and that hearing-aid settings should be adjusted little by little as your brain adapts to them.",
      "\u201cA big misconception is that you can just wear them a couple hours a day. Your brain does better with it if you use them most of the day. Your brain needs to adapt to hearing sounds it hasn't heard for a while, and it takes the brain awhile to relearn how to process all those sounds,\u201d says Stamper.",
      "6. Be realistic. \u201cAlthough hearing aids can be enormously beneficial, they may not give you back your normal hearing,\u201d says Stamper. Depending on the situation, there might be limitations to what a hearing aid can do.",
      "\u201cIt might just be lots of improvement in the key areas in which you\u2019re struggling,\u201d said Stamper.",
      "Using hearing aids is a process, the audiologists say, and although it requires some patience, it can be well worth the journey.",

    "story": [
      "A federal investigation has found that a Texas hospital that repeatedly sent a woman who was bleeding and in pain home without ending her nonviable, life-threatening pregnancy violated the law",
      "WASHINGTON -- A Texas hospital that repeatedly sent a woman who was bleeding and in pain home without ending her nonviable, life-threatening pregnancy violated the law, according to a newly released federal investigation.",
      "The government's findings, which have not been previously reported, were a small victory for 36-year-old Kyleigh Thurman, who ultimately lost part of her reproductive system after being discharged without any help from her hometown emergency room for her dangerous ectopic pregnancy.",
      "But a new policy the Trump administration announced on Tuesday has thrown into doubt the federal government's oversight of hospitals that deny women emergency abortions, even when they are at risk for serious infection, organ loss or severe hemorrhaging.",
      "Thurman had hoped the federal government's investigation, which issued a report in April after concluding its inquiry last year, would send a clear message that ectopic pregnancies must be treated by hospitals in Texas, which has one of the nation's strictest abortion bans.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone else to have to go through this,\u201d Thurman said in an interview with the Associated Press from her Texas home this week. \u201cI put a lot of the responsibility on the state of Texas and policy makers and the legislators that set this chain of events off.\u201d",
      "Women around the country have been denied emergency abortions for their life-threatening pregnancies after states swiftly enacted abortion restrictions in response to a 2022 ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, which includes three appointees of President Donald Trump.",
      "The guidance issued by the Biden administration in 2022 was an effort to preserve access to emergency abortions for extreme cases in which women were experiencing medical emergencies. It directed hospitals \u2014 even ones in states with severe restrictions \u2014 to provide abortions in those emergency cases. If hospitals did not comply, they would be in violation of a federal law and risk losing some federal funds.",
      "On Tuesday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for enforcing the law and inspecting hospitals, announced it would revoke the Biden-era guidance around emergency abortions.",
      "The law, which requires doctors to provide stabilizing treatment, was one of the few ways that Thurman was able to hold the emergency room accountable after she didn't receive any help from staff at Ascension Seton Williamson in Round Rock, Texas in February of 2023, a few months after Texas enacted its strict abortion ban.",
      "Emergency room staff observed that Thurman's hormone levels had dropped, a pregnancy was not visible in her uterus and a structure was blocking her fallopian tube \u2014 all telltale signs of an ectopic pregnancy, when a fetus implants outside of the uterus and has no room to grow. If left untreated, ectopic pregnancies can rupture, causing organ damage, hemorrhage or even death.",
      "Thurman, however, was sent home and given a pamphlet on miscarriage for her first pregnancy. She returned three days later, still bleeding, and was given an injected drug intended to end the pregnancy, but it was too late. Days later, she showed up again at the emergency room, bleeding out because the fertilized egg growing on Thurman\u2019s fallopian tube ruptured it. She underwent an emergency surgery that removed part of her reproductive system.",
      "CMS launched its investigation of how Ascension Seton Williamson handled Thurman\u2019s case late last year, shortly after she filed a complaint. Investigators concluded the hospital failed to give her a proper medical screening exam, including an evaluation with an OB-GYN. The hospital violated the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing treatment to all patients. Thurman was \u201cat risk for deterioration of her health and wellbeing as a result of an untreated medical condition,\u201d the investigation said in its report, which was publicly released last month.",
      "Ascension, a vast hospital system that has facilities across multiple states, did not respond to questions about Thurman\u2019s case, saying only that it is \u201cis committed to providing high-quality care to all who seek our services.\u201d",
      "Doctors and legal experts have warned abortion restrictions like the one Texas enacted have discouraged emergency room staff from aborting dangerous and nonviable pregnancies, even when a woman's life is imperiled. The stakes are especially high in Texas, where doctors face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an illegal abortion. Lawmakers in the state are weighing a law that would remove criminal penalties for doctors who provide abortions in certain medical emergencies.",
      "\u201cWe see patients with miscarriages being denied care, bleeding out in parking lots. We see patients with nonviable pregnancies being told to continue those to term,\u201d said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights that represented Thurman. \u201cThis is not, maybe, what some people thought abortion bans would look like, but this is the reality.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration routinely warned hospitals that they need to provide abortions when a woman\u2019s health was in jeopardy, even suing Idaho over its state law that initially prohibited nearly all abortions, unless a woman\u2019s life was on the line.",
      "But CMS\u2019 announcement on Tuesday raises questions about whether such investigations will continue if hospitals do not provide abortions for women in medical emergencies.",
      "The agency said it will still enforce the law, \u201cincluding for identified emergency medical conditions that place the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy.\u201d",
      "While states like Texas have clarified that ectopic pregnancies can legally be treated with abortions, the laws do not provide for every complication that might arise during a pregnancy. Several women in Texas have sued the state for its law, which has prevented women from terminating pregnancies in cases where their fetuses had deadly fetal anomalies or they went into labor too early for the fetus to survive.",
      "Thurman worries pregnant patients with serious complications still won't be able to get the help they may need in Texas emergency rooms.",
      "\u201cYou cannot predict the ways a pregnancy can go,\u201d Thurman said. \u201cIt can happen to anyone, still. There\u2019s still so many ways in which pregnancies that aren\u2019t ectopic can be deadly.\u201d",

      "A military fighter jet crashed and burned in an area that has seen intense fighting during Myanmar\u2019s civil war, with a rebel group claiming to have shot it down while state-run media reported it suffered a mechanical failure",
      "BANGKOK -- A military fighter jet crashed and burned Tuesday in an area that has seen intense fighting during Myanmar's civil war, with a rebel group claiming to have shot it down while state-run media reported it suffered a mechanical failure.",
      "The aircraft went down midday in the Sagaing region, about 140 kilometers (85 miles) west of Mandalay, Myanmar 's second largest city, according to state-run MRTV television.",
      "It did not identify the type of jet or mention casualties, and said a search and recovery effort was underway in Pale township where it went down.",
      "Local media reports identified the plane as the two-seater Chinese FTC-2000G, a fighter ground-attack jet, and broadcast images of a crashed plane with body parts nearby.",
      "Sagaing region is a stronghold of armed resistance to the military, which seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Opposition to the takeover began peacefully, but escalated into a civil war as the authorities resorted increasingly to lethal force to quell dissent.",
      "Ni Ni Kyaw, a spokesperson for a militia known as the People\u2019s Liberation Army, or PLA, told The Associated Press its fighters had been involved in an assault on a police station in Pale township when they shot down the jet at 12:30 p.m. Tuesday.",
      "She said the military's jets had dropped hundreds of bombs in the area over the past week in support of ground troops fighting against the PLA and other resistance forces.",
      "The PLA posted a video and pictures of the jet's smoking wreckage in a Pale township village.",
      "The military has increasingly used airstrikes to counter the widespread armed struggle against its rule, relying primarily on aircraft from Russia and China, which continue to supply government forces with high-tech weaponry.",
      "The FTC-2000G was first delivered by China in 2022, after the military's seizure of power.",
      "In May, a military airstrike in Sagaing hit a school, killing as many as 20 students and two teachers, according to witnesses and independent media reports. MRTV aired a report denying the attack.",
      "The military is believed to have lost at least five helicopters and four jet fighters, but claims from resistance groups to have shot them down have been impossible to definitively confirm due to the tight restrictions on the media and the remoteness of the areas where much of the combat takes place.",

      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Tuesday won a reprieve in a civil suit accusing him of sexual misconduct, after a court approved his bid to temporarily suspend the trial due to start next week.",
      "The suit was filed in 2021 by his former research assistant, Muhammed Yusoff Rawther. Yusoff, 32, alleged that Anwar sexually harassed him in 2018 \u2014 before Anwar became premier, in November 2022. Anwar, 77, denies any wrongdoing and accuses Yusoff of fabricating the charge to ruin his political career.",
      "The case gained attention after Anwar sought immunity from prosecution, sparking criticism from the opposition and others. The High Court dismissed his application last week, saying everyone is equal before the law. Anwar has turned to the nation\u2019s top court, which will hear his case on July 21.",
      "The Court of Appeal on Tuesday approved Anwar\u2019s bid for a temporary stay to the trial that was due to start June 16, pending next month's hearing in the Federal Court.",

      "Just a week into his term in office, South Korea's liberal President Lee Jae-myung has moved against his ousted conservative predecessor",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Just a week into his term in office, South Korea's new liberal President Lee Jae-myung moved against his ousted conservative predecessor, approving legislation to launch sweeping special investigations into Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s ill-fated imposition of martial law in December as well as criminal allegations surrounding his wife and administration.",
      "The monthslong probes, which will involve hundreds of investigators under special prosecutors appointed by Lee, could dominate his early agenda and inflame tensions with conservatives, as Yoon already faces an explosive rebellion trial carrying a possible death sentence.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the bills approved at Tuesday\u2019s Cabinet meeting, which Lee is expected to sign into law soon.",
      "The three bills, overwhelmingly passed last week by the liberal-led legislature, call for independent investigations into Yoon\u2019s hourslong martial law debacle; corruption and financial crime allegations against his wife; and the 2023 drowning death of a marine during a flood rescue operation, an incident Lee\u2019s Democratic Party says Yoon\u2019s government tried to cover up.",
      "Earlier versions of the bills were rejected nine different times both by Yoon and by the caretaker government that took over following his impeachment on Dec. 14.",
      "Lee, who won last week\u2019s snap election triggered by Yoon\u2019s formal removal from office in April, ran on a platform of unity, promising not to target conservatives out of spite and vowing to ease political polarization. However, Lee called for deeper investigations into Yoon\u2019s martial law enactment and allegations involving his wife, citing public demands for accountability.",
      "For each of the three investigations, Lee will appoint a special prosecutor from two candidates nominated by his Democratic Party and a smaller liberal ally. The main conservative People Power Party, whose members largely boycotted last week\u2019s National Assembly votes, denounced the laws for excluding them from the nomination process. Liberal lawmakers justified the move, citing the conservatives\u2019 alleged ties to matters that will be investigated.",
      "More than 570 investigators, including some 120 public prosecutors, can be assigned to assist with the inquiries. The special prosecutors are expected to be nominated and appointed in coming weeks, potentially allowing the investigations to begin as early as July.",
      "Kang Yu-jung, Lee\u2019s spokesperson, said the Cabinet\u2019s approval of the bills reflects public demands to \u201cseek accountability for the rebellion attempt and restore constitutional order.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt also carries the meaning of recovering the National Assembly\u2019s legislative authority, which had been repeatedly blocked by presidential vetoes,\u201d she said.",
      "Public prosecutors in Seoul already indicted Yoon in January on charges of masterminding a rebellion and enacting martial law as an illegal bid to seize the legislature and election offices and arrest political opponents. Liberals insisted independent investigations into Yoon are still essential, saying probes by prosecutors, police and an anti-corruption agency were inadequate and hampered by Yoon\u2019s refusal to cooperate.",
      "Yoon's case will now likely be transferred to the special prosecutor, who will be authorized to expand the existing investigation, including whether he and senior military leaders deliberately sought to provoke North Korea in order to create a crisis that could justify declaring martial law at home.",
      "Yoon\u2019s martial law decree on Dec. 3, which lasted only hours after a quorum of lawmakers pushed past a blockade of hundreds of heavily armed soldiers to revoke it, came amid heightened inter-Korean tensions, marked by monthslong North Korean flights of trash-laden balloons and South Korean loudspeaker broadcasts at the border.",
      "The special prosecutor could also expand the investigation to include PPP lawmakers over suspicions that party leaders tried to obstruct the vote to lift Yoon\u2019s martial law, by directing lawmakers to attend an emergency party meeting, instead of the main chamber session. This is almost certain to provoke a fierce reaction from conservatives, already in disarray after Yoon\u2019s self-inflicted political downfall.",
      "Yoon\u2019s wife, Kim Keon Hee, faces multiple corruption allegations, including claims that she received luxury items from a Unification Church official seeking business favors, as well as possible involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme. Kim is also suspected of interfering with PPP candidate nominations ahead of legislative elections in April last year, but has yet to be summoned by law enforcement authorities. While in office, Yoon repeatedly dismissed calls to investigate his wife, denouncing them as baseless political attacks.",
      "PPP leaders accuse Lee\u2019s government of using its legislative majority to target conservatives \u2013 and also shield the presidency from Lee\u2019s own legal troubles. Lee faced five separate trials on corruption and other charges, but in three cases where hearings had begun, the courts postponed proceedings until after the election.",
      "While South Korea\u2019s constitution prevents a sitting president from being prosecuted for most crimes aside from rebellion and treason, it does not clearly state whether that protection extends to criminal charges filed before taking office, leaving room for judicial interpretation.",
      "The Democrats, who hold 170 of the 300 National Assembly seats, are pushing to revise the criminal procedure law to suspend all ongoing criminal trials involving a sitting president until the end of their terms \u2013 a move PPP leader Kim Yong-tae called a \u201cdistorted\u201d attempt to \u201cbulletproof\u201d Lee\u2019s presidency.",
      "\u201cBecoming president does not erase (Lee\u2019s) crimes. Suspending trials do not make the crimes disappear,\u201d Kim said Tuesday, calling for the Democrats to scrap the bill. \u201cThis would be a declaration that power would stand above the law.\u201d",
      "Two different courts this week handling Lee\u2019s cases \u2014 on allegations of violating election laws and granting illicit favors to private investors during dubious development projects while he was mayor of Seongnam \u2014 decided to suspend the trials indefinitely, citing their interpretations of the constitution.",

      "The Iranian judiciary\u2019s Mizan news agency announced the executions Tuesday, saying that the death sentences had been upheld by the country\u2019s top court.",
      "It described the militants as being detained after they were in a clash in the country's western region with Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, in which three troops and several Islamic State group fighters were killed. Authorities said they had seized a cache of combat weapons, including a machine gun and 50 grenades, after surrounding the militants' hideout in the country\u2019s west.",
      "Iran carries out executions by hanging.",
      "The extremist group, which once held vast territory across Iraq and Syria in a self-described caliphate it declared in 2014, ultimately was beaten back by U.S.-led forces.",
      "It has since been in disarray, though it has mounted major assaults. In Iran's neighbor Afghanistan, for instance, IS is believed to have grown in strength since the fall of the Western-backed government there to the Taliban in 2021.",
      "The group previously claimed a June 2017 attack in Tehran on parliament and a mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini that killed at least 18 people and wounded more than 50. It has claimed other attacks in Iran, including two suicide bombings in 2024 targeting a commemoration for an Iranian general slain in a 2020 U.S. drone strike. That assault killed at least 94 people.",
      "The clash with Revolutionary Guardsmen in 2018 marked a point of heightened tensions between Iran and the militant group. Iran launched ballistic missiles at parts of eastern Syria, vowing revenge after militants disguised themselves as soldiers and opened fire at a military parade in the Islamic Republic\u2019s southwest.

      "Filipino forces and villagers have been struggling to live in Beijing's shadow in the disputed South China while fighting isolation on remote islands",
      "WEST YORK ISLAND, South China Sea -- Overwhelmed after setting foot for the first time on a far-flung but picturesque island in the disputed South China Sea, a Filipino army official knelt to kiss the shore. She held a small Philippine flag that fluttered in the breeze.",
      "\u201cThis is just so beautiful,\u201d Philippines military spokesperson Col. Francel Margareth Padilla said of West York Island, one of nine islands, reefs and atolls occupied by Filipino forces in the long-contested waters. \u201cThis solidifies our resolve to fight for this place whatever happens.\u201d",
      "The 18.6-hectare (46-acre) droplet-shaped island, called Likas by Filipinos, could easily become an eco-tourism draw in tropical Asia with its powdery white-sand beaches, turquoise waters and giant sea turtle sanctuaries. Padilla expressed hope it could someday be opened to Filipino travelers and tourists from across the world.",
      "But that longstanding aspiration by Philippine officials has been stymied by a tangle of territorial conflicts involving a militarily superior China.",
      "Beijing claims virtually the entire South China Sea, a vital global trade route with rich undersea deposits of gas and oil. It has increasingly flexed its military might, including its navy \u2014 the largest in the world \u2014 to strengthen its grip on a strategic waterway it says it has owned since ancient times.",
      "The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan contest China\u2019s expansive claims with their own, and the territorial stand-offs have increasingly flared into cat-and-mouse confrontations at sea in recent years.",
      "The long-simmering disputes are also a delicate fault line in the regional rivalry between Beijing and Washington.",
      "Both former President Joe Biden and his successor, Donald Trump, have condemned China\u2019s growing aggression in the contested waters, including its coast guard\u2019s use of powerful water cannons, blinding military-grade lasers and dangerous sea maneuvers against the coast guard and navy of the Philippines, Washington\u2019s oldest treaty ally in Asia.",
      "Under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who took office in mid-2022, the Philippines has intensified a campaign to expose China\u2019s increasingly assertive actions by capturing them in video and photographs. The images have then been made public in the hope that international pressure would prompt Beijing to back down to avoid damage to its reputation.",
      "The Philippine military invited a small group of journalists, including two from The Associated Press, in a dayslong naval patrol of the South China Sea territories claimed by Manila and on visits to navy and marine forces deployed to guard them.",
      "During the patrol, which ended over the weekend, the BRP Andres Bonifacio navy ship carrying the journalists warned a number of Chinese coast guard ships and suspected Chinese militia vessels by two-way radio to move away from Philippines-claimed waters. The Chinese ships responded by asserting their sovereignty in the offshore region without undertaking any provocative actions.",
      "On West York Island, two Filipino marines in camouflage uniforms stood guard with M4 assault rifles under a Philippine flag. One used binoculars to scan the surrounding waters for Chinese or Vietnamese ships passing by from a distance.",
      "One of the farthest islands in the disputed waters from the nearest Philippine province of Palawan, West York is a difficult and risky post, where Filipino forces see nothing beyond the small island but sea. Military personnel can occasionally call their loved ones during their two-month deployment, but the internet connection is spotty, especially during the typhoon season that starts in June, according to military personnel on the island.",
      "They grow eggplants, okra and chili peppers and raise goats and chickens to augment food provisions delivered by navy ships from Palawan. There is a makeshift basketball court to help while away off-duty time and ease the feeling of isolation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s being away from your family,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cAt the end of the day, you go home to an empty room.\u201d",
      "Marine Col. Joel Bonavente, who was among the visiting military officials, told AP that military personnel posted in the remote outpost get additional pay to compensate for the \"hazard and loneliness.\u201d",
      "On Thitu, the largest Philippines-claimed island, which lies west of West York, civilians have thrived for decades in a small fishing village alongside the military forces.",
      "An AP journalist who visited Thitu several years ago saw an island with only a few low-slung wooden and concrete buildings and a gravel airstrip that was being eroded by the constant pounding of waves. There were a few shanties mainlanders had moved to from Palawan in exchange for a monthly government provision of groceries, rice and cash in a bid to grow a civilian community.",
      "Dramatic infrastructure improvements have occurred through the years on the 37.2-hectare (92-acre) island, which now has a concrete runway, a huge aircraft hangar, a wharf, a storm shelter and concrete roads running through the fishing village, military encampments and a three-story coast guard surveillance center.",
      "A high school building is nearly finished near a seawater desalination facility.",
      "\u201cI want to stay on this island because my blood pressure remains stable without the wide selection of fatty food you find in the city like hamburgers,\u201d said Nenita Bania, a 59-year-old villager who has lived with her husband on Thitu for 12 years.",
      "\u201cLonely? Not really. It\u2019s not the case if you\u2019re with family,\u201d she told the AP aboard an air force C-130 aircraft, as she and other villagers hitched a ride back to Thitu from Palawan province.",
      "Living in China\u2019s shadow in the disputed waters, however, has been challenging, said Larry Hugo, 47, who leads a group of at least 114 fishermen.",
      "More than a decade ago, China transformed seven disputed South China Sea reefs into island bases, where Chinese coast guard and navy ships can now refuel and obtain supplies for longer periods far from the Chinese mainland.",
      "One of China\u2019s artificial islands, Subi, has a military-grade runway and lies just 26 kilometers (16 miles) from Thitu.",
      "\u201cThere were no Chinese ships before but now it\u2019s a big problem because they are all around our island,\u201d Hugo said. \u201cThey\u2019re guarding the reefs where we used to fish, and they block us so we can't venture far.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have small boats and we may be run over and that\u2019ll be a big problem because we\u2019re far from civilization.\u201d",

      "Even as it pursues its invasion of Ukraine, Russia is also expanding its military footprint in Africa",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- Even as it pounds Ukraine, Russia is expanding its military footprint in Africa, delivering sophisticated weaponry to sub-Saharan conflict zones where a Kremlin-controlled armed force is on the rise. Skirting sanctions imposed by Western nations, Moscow is using cargo ships to send tanks, armored vehicles, artillery and other high-value equipment to West Africa, The Associated Press has found.",
      "Relying on satellite imagery and radio signals, AP tracked a convoy of Russian-flagged cargo ships as they made a nearly one-month journey from the Baltic Sea. The ships carried howitzers, radio jamming equipment and other military hardware, according to military officials in Europe who closely monitored them. The deliveries could strengthen Russia\u2019s fledgling Africa Corps as Moscow competes with the United States, Europe and China for greater influence across the continent.",
      "The two-year-old Africa Corps, which has links to a covert branch of Russia\u2019s army, is ascendant at a time when U.S. and European troops have been withdrawing from the region, forced out by sub-Saharan nations turning to Russia for security.",
      "Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger have been battling fighters linked with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group for more than a decade.",
      "At first, mercenary groups with an arms-length relationship to the Kremlin entered the fray in Africa. But increasingly, Russia is deploying its military might, and intelligence services, more directly.",
      "\u201dWe intend to expand our cooperation with African countries in all spheres, with an emphasis on economic cooperation and investments,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. \u201cThis cooperation includes sensitive areas linked to defense and security.\u201d",
      "Russia's 8,800-ton Baltic Leader and 5,800-ton Patria are among hundreds of ships that Western nations have sanctioned to choke off resources for Russia's war in Ukraine. The ships docked and unloaded in Conakry, Guinea, in late May, AP satellite images showed.",
      "Other ships made deliveries to the same port in January. They delivered tanks, armored vehicles and other hardware that was then trucked overland to neighboring Mali, according to European military officials and a Malian blogger's video of the long convoy.",
      "The military officials spoke to AP about Russian operations on condition of anonymity. The AP verified the blogger's video, geolocating it to the RN5 highway leading into Bamako, the Malian capital.",
      "After the latest delivery in Conakry, trucks carrying Russian-made armored vehicles, howitzers and other equipment were again spotted on the overland route to Mali.",
      "Malian broadcaster ORTM confirmed that the West African nation's army took delivery of new military equipment. AP analysis of its video and images filmed by the Malian blogger in the same spot as the January delivery identified a broad array of Russian-made hardware, including 152 mm artillery guns and other smaller canons.",
      "AP also identified a wheeled, BTR-80 armored troop carrier with radio-jamming equipment, as well as Spartak armored vehicles and other armored carriers, some mounted with guns. The shipment also included at least two semi-inflatable small boats, one with a Russian flag painted on its hull, as well as tanker trucks, some marked \u201cinflammable\u201d in Russian on their sides.",
      "The military officials who spoke to AP said they believe Russia has earmarked the most potent equipment \u2014 notably the artillery and jamming equipment \u2014 for its Africa Corps, not Malian armed forces. Africa Corps appears to have been given air power, too, with satellites spotting at least one Su-24 fighter-bomber at a Bamako air base in recent months.",
      "For years, French forces supported counterinsurgency operations in Mali and neighboring Burkina Faso and Niger. But France pulled out its troops after coups in Mali in 2020 and 2021, in Burkina Faso in 2022 and Niger in 2023. Russian mercenaries stepped into the vacuum.",
      "Wagner Group, the most notable, deployed to Sudan in 2017 and expanded to other African countries, often in exchange for mining concessions.",
      "It earned a reputation for brutality, accused by Western countries and U.N. experts of human rights abuses, including in Central African Republic, Libya and Mali.",
      "Of 33 African countries in which Russian military contractors were active, the majority were Wagner-controlled, according to U.S. government-sponsored research by RAND.",
      "But after Wagner forces mutinied in Russia in 2023 and their leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was killed two months later in a suspicious plane crash, Moscow tightened its grip. Russian military operations in Africa were restructured, with the Kremlin taking greater control through Africa Corps.",
      "It is overseen by the commander of Unit 29155, one of the most notorious branches of Russia\u2019s shadowy GRU military intelligence service, according to the European Union. Unit 29155 has been accused of covertly attacking Western interests for years, including through sabotage and assassination attempts.",
      "The EU in December targeted Unit 29155 Maj. Gen. Andrey Averyanov with sanctions, alleging that he is in charge of Africa Corps operations.",
      "\u201cIn many African countries, Russian forces provide security to military juntas that have overthrown legitimate democratic governments, gravely worsening the stability, security and democracy of the countries,\u201d the EU sanctions ruling said. These operations are financed by exploiting the continent's natural resources, the ruling added.",
      "The Russian Ministry of Defense didn\u2019t immediately respond to questions about Averyanov\u2019s role in Africa Corps.",
      "Researchers and military officials say the flow of weapons from Russia appears to be speeding Africa Corps\u2019 ascendancy over Wagner, helping it win over mercenaries that have remained loyal to the group. Africa Corps is also is recruiting in Russia, offering payments of up to 2.1 million rubles ($26,500), and even plots of land, for signing a contract with the Ministry of Defense, plus more on deployment.",
      "Within days of the latest equipment delivery, Wagner announced its withdrawal from Mali, declaring \u201cmission accomplished\" in a Telegram post.",
      "Africa Corps said in a separate post that it would remain.",
      "The changeover from Wagner to Africa Corps in Mali could be a forerunner for other similar transitions elsewhere on the continent, said Julia Stanyard, a researcher of Russian mercenary activity in Africa.",

      "Armed groups in Mali have inflicted heavy losses on Malian troops and Russian mercenaries. The al-Qaida linked group JNIM killed dozens of soldiers in an attack this month on a military base. Insurgents also killed dozens of Wagner mercenaries in northern Mali last July.",
      "Some of the latest hardware could have been shipped over specifically in response to such attacks, military officials said. They said the jamming equipment, for example, could help defend against booby traps detonated using phone signals.",
      "The latest convoy attracted attention because a Russian Navy warship, the Boykiy, escorted the ships after they set off in April from Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad region on the Baltic.",
      "Last October, in what's considered a hostile act, the Boykiy's radar systems locked onto a French Navy maritime surveillance plane on patrol against suspected Russian efforts to sabotage underwater cables, according to military officials.",

    "story": [
      "A wave of new ratifications during the U.N. Ocean Conference in France has brought the High Seas Treaty closer to the 60-country threshold needed for it to enter into force",
      "NICE, France -- Eighteen countries ratified the High Seas Treaty on Monday, bringing the total to 49 \u2014 just 11 short of the 60 needed for the ocean agreement to enter into force. The surge in support, occurring during the U.N. Ocean Conference in Nice, France, adds momentum to what could become a historic shift in how the world governs the open ocean.",
      "\u201cThe entry into force is within our sight, and I call on all remaining nations to join swiftly,\u201d U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres told reporters Tuesday. \u201cWe do not have a moment to lose.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what the treaty is, why it matters and what happens next.",
      "Formally known as the Agreement on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction, the High Seas Treaty is the first legally binding agreement focused on protecting marine biodiversity in international waters. These waters, which are beyond the jurisdiction of any single country, make up nearly two-thirds of the ocean and almost half the surface of the planet.",
      "Until now, there has been no comprehensive legal framework to create marine protected areas or enforce conservation on the high seas.",
      "Despite their remoteness, the high seas are under growing pressure from overfishing, climate change and the threat of deep-sea mining. Environmental advocates warn that without proper protections, marine ecosystems in international waters face irreversible harm.",
      "\u201cUntil now, it has been the wild west on the high seas,\" said Megan Randles, global political lead for oceans at Greenpeace. \"Now we have a chance to properly put protections in place.\u201d",
      "The treaty is also essential to achieving the global \u201c30x30\u201d target \u2014 an international pledge to protect 30% of the planet\u2019s land and sea by 2030.",
      "The treaty creates a legal process for countries to establish marine protected areas in the high seas, including rules for destructive activities like deep-sea mining and geo-engineering. It also establishes a framework for technology-sharing, funding mechanisms and scientific collaboration among countries.",
      "Crucially, decisions under the treaty will be made multilaterally through conferences of parties (COPs) rather than by individual countries acting alone.",
      "Once 60 countries ratify the treaty, a 120-day countdown begins before it officially enters into force. That would unlock the ability to begin designating protected areas in the high seas and put oversight mechanisms into motion.",
      "As of Monday evening, 49 countries and the EU had ratified, meaning 11 more are needed to trigger that countdown.",
      "Guterres called the pace of progress \u201ca record,\u201d noting that the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea took 12 years to reach entry into force, while the BBNJ treaty appears poised to do so in just over two.",
      "\u201cI see a momentum and an enthusiasm that was difficult to find in the past,\u201d he said.",
      "The first Conference of the Parties (COP1) must take place within one year of the treaty\u2019s entry into force. That meeting will lay the groundwork for implementation, including decisions on governance, financing and the creation of key bodies to evaluate marine protection proposals.",
      "Environmental groups are pushing to surpass the required 60 ratifications, and to do so quickly \u2013 the more countries that ratify, the stronger and more representative the treaty\u2019s implementation will be. There\u2019s also a deadline: only countries that ratify by COP1 will be eligible to vote on critical decisions that determine how the treaty will operate.",
      "\u201cTo reach 60 ratifications would be an absolutely enormous achievement, but for the treaty to be as effective as possible, we need countries from all over the world to engage in its implementation,\u201d said Rebecca Hubbard, director of the High Seas Alliance. \u201cSo the next step will be to go from 60 to global.\u201d",
      "The surge in support on Monday has raised hopes that 2025 could mark a turning point for high seas protection.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re on the brink of making high seas history,\u201d Hubbard said.",

      "The American Civil Liberties Union of Puerto Rico and an immigration attorney are demanding that the federal government release and return a 47-year-old woman from the Dominican Republic",
      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- In late May, a 47-year-old woman from the Dominican Republic was detained by police in Puerto Rico after she entered a municipal building seeking a permit to sell ice cream on the beach to support herself.",
      "Upon being turned over to federal agents, the Dominican woman presented her passport, driver\u2019s license and work permits that proved she was living in the U.S. territory legally, her attorney \u00c1ngel Robles and the American Civil Liberties Union of Puerto Rico, said Monday.",
      "Despite the documents presented, authorities recently transferred her to Texas as part of a federal crackdown on migrants living illegally in U.S. jurisdictions.",
      "The woman, whose first name is Aracelis, has not been fully identified because she is a victim of domestic violence.",
      "Aracelis is among hundreds of people who have been detained in Puerto Rico since large-scale arrests began in late January, surprising many in the U.S. territory that has long welcomed migrants.",
      "Robles and the ACLU demanded Aracelis' release and return to Puerto Rico.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous,\u201d Robles said in a phone interview. \u201cNo charges have been filed against her, and she is not in the system.\u201d",
      "Because her name does not appear in a federal database, Robles\u2019 request for a bond hearing was denied. \u201cThis case is one of unspeakable abuse,\u201d said Annette Mart\u00ednez Orabona, the ACLU director in Puerto Rico.",
      "The case has fueled already simmering anger against the administration of Puerto Rico Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n and local authorities who have been working with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to arrest those believed to be living illegally in the U.S. territory.",
      "In a letter sent Monday to the governor and the island\u2019s justice secretary, the ACLU accused Puerto Rico\u2019s government of violating the Constitution and local laws by providing ICE and U.S. Homeland Security with confidential information on nearly 6,000 immigrants.",
      "It also accused ICE of using that data to go on a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d that it called \u201carbitrary and abusive.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for Homeland Security Investigations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Puerto Rico, undocumented immigrants are allowed to open bank accounts and obtain a special driver\u2019s license.",
      "The ACLU in Puerto Rico also accused Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n\u2019s administration of not providing protocols to local government agencies for how to deal with such requests from the federal government.",
      "The ACLU requested, among other things, that Puerto Rico\u2019s government issue an executive order barring public agencies from collaborating with ICE subpoenas not accompanied by a court order.",
      "A spokeswoman for the governor did not immediately return a message for comment.",
      "From Jan. 26 to March 20, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have arrested more than 200 people, the majority of them Dominican. Updated numbers were not immediately available.",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Peru\u2019s government has reversed its controversial decision to shrink the protected area surrounding the Nazca Lines, which had faced criticism for opening the area to informal miners.",
      "The country's culture ministry on Sunday nullified last week's resolution that had reinstated the boundary map set in 2004. The switch followed severe backlash after the government approved a 42% reduction in the zone \u2014 about 2,400\u202f square kilometers (926 square miles) \u2014 and to allow miners to seek formal permits in previously restricted areas.",
      "The original protected zone \u2014 spanning 5,600 square kilometers (2,162 square miles) \u2014 will remain in effect. The ministry also ordered an update of the site\u2019s management plan within 10 days and the formation of a technical panel, which will include government representatives, academics, UNESCO, and civil society figures to define future use and conservation strategies.",
      "The area in question forms part of a UNESCO-recognized World Heritage Site, home to the Nazca Lines \u2014 massive geoglyphs etched into the desert over 1,500 years ago \u2014 and one of Peru\u2019s most fragile desert ecosystems.",
      "\u201cThanks to the strong rejection by national and international public opinion, the government revoked the reduction of the area of the Nazca Archaeological Reserve,\u201d Mariano Castro, Peru\u2019s former vice minister of the environment, told The Associated Press.",
      "Castro said the government justified its decision by saying it had not previously discussed its decision publicly.",
      "\u201cIn other words, it (the government) does not go so far as to admit the measure was wrong, despite evidence of the presence of illegal mining, which seriously endangers and threatens the integrity of the Nazca Lines and petroglyphs,\u201d he said.",
      "The ministry said a new government entity will be created to oversee the site\u2019s management, and technical studies will be published to ensure transparency and accountability.",
      "Peruvian environmental lawyer, C\u00e9sar Ipenza, who follows the issue closely, welcomes the technical panel, which will include local authorities, but he still has concerns.",
      "\u201cThe truth is that the local authority is actually the one that has been calling for the reduction of the boundaries of the Nazca Lines,\u201d Ipenza told the AP. \u201cThere will also be strong pressure from miners for this to go ahead.\"",
      "Ipenza is concerned that informal mining has been steadily expanding in the area, even though all mining activity is officially banned.",
      "\u201cThe government hasn\u2019t taken action to remove these miners and as a result, there has been pressure to officially open the area to allow informal and illegal miners to become formalized,\u201d he said.",
      "The AP contacted UNESCO for comment. The organization said it would aim to provide information on Tuesday, as Monday was a public holiday in France, where it is headquartered.",

      "TAPACHULA, Mexico -- Mexican state police killed four gunmen near the border with Guatemala, then pursued more suspects into that country in three armored police vehicles, where they engaged in a shootout in the streets of a border town. Authorities in both countries said Monday they were investigating.",
      "The rare case of Mexican law enforcement crossing the border into Guatemala on Sunday in La Mesilla was captured by onlookers in videos widely circulated online. With the border crossing a short distance in the background, armed men in ballistic vests and carrying rifles can be seen shouting at the open driver side door of a Chiapas state police armored vehicle.",
      "Suddenly, another such vehicle comes speeding through the border crossing from behind scattering the armed men. The initial vehicle reverses back toward Mexico and a third armored police vehicle enters from a side street slamming a civilian vehicle into the side of the other armored police truck. Gunfire erupts with the police trucks and civilian vehicles getting hit by bullets.",
      "All the while, a Guatemalan military truck with a soldier in the turret, sits in the middle of the melee.",
      "It was the latest flare-up of violence along a section of the border that has become a flashpoint as rival Mexican drug cartels and their local affiliates battle for control of valuable smuggling routes for migrants, guns and drugs.",
      "Asked about the events, Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said Monday that everything appeared to show that Mexican authorities entered Guatemala.",
      "\u201cThey are investigating it and it is not all right that has happened,\u201d she said.",
      "Chiapas state Gov. Eduardo Ram\u00edrez Aguilar criticized what he suggested were Guatemalan authorities protecting members of organized crime. His security chief, Oscar Aparicio Avenda\u00f1o, told The Associated Press on Monday that police had used a drone to detect armed men crossing the border into Mexico.",

      "\u201cThey try to cross (back to Guatemala) to evade justice and that\u2019s where we intercept them and there\u2019s the shooting,\u201d Ram\u00edrez said. The police involved were part of a state police force called the Pakales, which have also been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Across the border in Guatemala, authorities were cautious in their initial response.",
      "Guatemala Vice President Karin Herrera said Monday that the Guatemalan government was talking to Mexican authorities about what happened, \u201cbut there are many things that must be confirmed.\u201d",
      "Guatemala Defense Minister Henry S\u00e1enz said none of the Guatemalan soldiers present in La Mesilla fired their weapons and that it remained under investigation.",
      "The stretch of the Mexico-Guatemala border has seen near continuous violence in the past two years as the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels battle for control.",
      "Last year, the violence spurred hundreds of Mexican residents to flee into Guatemala for safety. At other moments, towns have seen their power cut and cartel convoys parade through their communities.",

      "Colombian conservative presidential hopeful Miguel Uribe is in critical condition after being shot in the head during an assassination attempt over the weekend",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Miguel Uribe, a conservative Colombian presidential hopeful, was in critical condition on Monday after being shot in the head from close range during a rally over the weekend.",
      "In a statement, doctors said the 39-year-old senator had \u201cbarely\u201d responded to medical interventions that included brain surgery following the assassination attempt that has had a chilling effect on the South American nation.",
      "Uribe was shot on Saturday as he addressed a small crowd of people who had gathered in a park in Bogota\u2019s Modelia neighborhood.",
      "On Sunday hundreds of people gathered outside the hospital where Uribe is being treated to pray for his recovery. Some carried rosaries in their hands, while others chanted slogans against President Gustavo Petro.",
      "\u201cThis is terrible,\u201d said Walter Jimenez, a lawyer who showed up outside the hospital with a sign calling for Petro's removal. \u201cIt feels like we are going back to the 1990\u2019s,\u201d he said, referring to a decade during which drug cartels and rebel groups murdered judges, presidential candidates and journalists with impunity.",
      "Petro has condemned the attack and urged his opponents to not use it for political ends. But some Colombians have also asked the president to tone down his rhetoric against opposition leaders.",
      "The assassination attempt stunned the nation, with many politicians describing it as the latest sign of how security has deteriorated in Colombia, where the government is struggling to control violence in rural and urban areas, despite a 2016 peace deal with the nation\u2019s largest rebel group.",
      "The attack on Uribe comes amid growing animosity between Petro and the Senate over blocked reforms to the nation\u2019s labor laws.",
      "Petro has organized protests in favor of the reforms, where he has delivered fiery speeches referring to opposition leaders as \u201coligarchs\u201d and \u201cenemies of the people.\"",
      "\u201cThere is no way to argue that the president \u2026 who describes his opponents as enemies of the people, paramilitaries and assassins has no responsibility in this,\u201d Andres Mejia, a prominent political analyst, wrote on X.",
      "On Monday, Colombia's Senate said it will suspend sessions for an undetermined number of days to show its solidarity with Uribe. The Senate was expected to vote this week on labor legislation that Colombia's president wants to enact through a referendum.",
      "Also on Monday, in a joint statement nine opposition parties said they will turn to \u201cinternational entities\" that can provide them with \u201cconditions of equality that have been denied\u201d to them by Colombia's government. The parties also called on the Inspector General's office to create a commission that will guarantee transparency and security in elections.",
      "The Attorney General\u2019s office said a 15-year-old boy was arrested at the scene of the attack against Uribe. Videos captured on social media show a suspect shooting at Uribe from close range.",
      "The suspect was injured in the leg and was recovering at another clinic, authorities said. Defense Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez added that over 100 officers are investigating the attack.",
      "On Monday, Colombia\u2019s Attorney General Luz Adriana Camargo said that minors in Colombia face sentences of up to eight years in detention for committing murders.",
      "Camargo acknowledged that lenient sentences have encouraged armed groups to recruit minors to commit crimes. However, she said that Colombian law also considers that minors who are recruited by armed groups are victims, and is trying to protect them.",
      "\u201cAs a society we need to reflect on why a minor is getting caught up in a network of assassins, and what we can do to stop this from happening in the future,\u201d she said.",
      "Camargo said officials had not identified any death threats against Uribe prior to Saturday's assassination attempt. But on Monday, Uribe's lawyer said he has sued the director of the National Protection Unit, a government agency that assigns security guards and bullet proof vehicles to politicians and human rights leaders.",
      "Uribe launched his presidential campaign in October. His lawyer, Victor Mosquera, said the National Protection Unit ignored multiple requests by Uribe to have his security detail expanded as he campaigned.",
      "\u201cHis security detail had to be improved,\u201d Mosquera said in a press conference. \u201cWe have to investigate whether the attack (on Uribe) was a consequence of negligence.\u201d",
      "In a message on X on Monday, Petro wrote that Uribe's security detail was \u201cstrangely\" reduced from seven to three bodyguards on the day of the assassination attempt, and said he asked police to investigate.",
      "Petro said there are still many theories about the motive for the attack.",

      "LONDON -- The British government on Monday reversed its unpopular plan to end winter home heating subsidies for millions of retirees.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer had signaled the u-turn last month after a loud outcry from the public and some members of his Labour Party who thought the relatively modest 1.5 billion-pound ($2 billion) savings were too politically costly.",
      "Treasury chief Rachel Reeves, who canceled the payment for home heating on all but the poorest retirees after Labour came to power last summer, said the benefit would be restored to 9 million people, or three-quarters of pensioners, in England and Wales whose incomes are below 35,000 pounds ($47,500). Reeves said the move was necessary last year because the previous Conservative government had left public finances in a dire state.",
      "\u201cTargeting winter fuel payments was a tough decision, but the right decision because of the inheritance we had been left by the previous government,\" Reeves said. \u201cIt is also right that we continue to means-test this payment so that it is targeted and fair, rather than restoring eligibility to everyone including the wealthiest.\u201d",
      "The payments are worth between 200 and 300 pounds ($271 and $406) a year. The reversal will cost the government 1.25 billion, Reeve said.",
      "Canceling the payments for most people last winter was blamed for contributing to Starmer's swift decline in popularity after his party came to power in a landslide. He was blamed for punishing elderly people on limited incomes who struggled to make ends meet during a cost-of-living crisis.",
      "Labour fared poorly in local elections in England last month, with many party representatives blaming the removal of the winter fuel payment.",
      "Kemi Badenoch, leader of the main opposition Conservative Party, quickly pounced on Starmer's about-face.",
      "\u201cKeir Starmer has scrambled to clear up a mess of his own making,\" she said. \u201cThis humiliating u-turn will come as scant comfort to the pensioners forced to choose between heating and eating last winter. The prime minister should now apologize for his terrible judgment.\u201d",

      "Italians are heading to the polls Monday on the second day of referendums that would make it easier for children born in Italy to foreigners to obtain citizenship, and on providing more job protections",
      "ROME -- Italians headed to the polls Monday on the second and final day of referendums that would make it easier for children born in Italy to foreigners to obtain citizenship, and on providing more job protections. But partial data showed a low turnout, well below the required 50% plus one threshold, risking to invalidate the vote.",
      "Campaigners for the change in the citizenship law say it will help second-generation Italians born in the country to non- European Union parents better integrate into a culture they already see as theirs.",
      "Partial data from Italy\u2019s Interior Ministry published at 2100 GMT on Sunday showed that national turnout stood at 22.7%, just over half of the 41% registered at the same time of the day in the latest comparable referendum held in 2011. The polling stations close later Monday at 1300 GMT.",
      "The new rules, if passed, could affect about 2.5 million foreign nationals who still struggle to be recognized as citizens.",
      "The measures were proposed by Italy\u2019s main union and left-wing opposition parties. Premier Giorgia Meloni showed up at the polls on Sunday evening but didn't cast a ballot \u2014 an action widely criticized by the left as antidemocratic, since it won't contribute to reaching the necessary threshold to make the vote valid.",
      "\u201cWhile some members of her ruling coalition have openly called for abstention, Meloni has opted for a more subtle approach,\u201c said analyst Wolfango Piccoli of the Teneo consultancy based in London. \u201dIt\u2019s yet another example of her trademark fence-sitting.\u2019\u2019",
      "Supporters say this reform would bring Italy\u2019s citizenship law in line with many other European countries, promoting greater social integration for long-term residents. It would also allow faster access to civil and political rights, such as the right to vote, eligibility for public employment and freedom of movement within the EU.",
      "\u201cThe real drama is that neither people who will vote \u2018yes\u2019 nor those who intend to vote \u2018no\u2019 or abstain have an idea of what (an) ordeal children born from foreigners have to face in this country to obtain a residence permit,\u201d said Selam Tesfaye, an activist and campaigner with the Milan-based human rights group Il Cantiere.",
      "Activists and opposition parties also denounced the lack of public debate on the measures, accusing the governing center-right coalition of trying to dampen interest in sensitive issues that directly impact immigrants and workers.",
      "In May, Italy\u2019s AGCOM communications authority lodged a complaint against RAI state television and other broadcasters over a lack of adequate and balanced coverage.",
      "Opinion polls published in mid-May showed that only 46% of Italians were aware of the issues driving the referendums. Turnout projections were even weaker for a vote scheduled for the first weekend of Italy\u2019s school holidays, at around 35% of around 50 million electors, well below the required quorum.",
      "\u201cMany believe that the referendum institution should be reviewed in light of the high levels of abstention (that) emerged in recent elections and the turnout threshold should be lowered,\u201d said Lorenzo Pregliasco, political analyst and pollster at YouTrend.",
      "Some analysts note, however, that the center-left opposition could claim a victory even if the referendum fails on condition that the turnout surpasses the 12.3 million voters who backed the winning center-right coalition in the 2022 general election.",

      "A Kenyan company has introduced bitcoin into what is widely considered Africa\u2019s largest urban slum",
      "KIBERA, Kenya -- Dotting the roadside in what is widely considered Africa\u2019s largest urban slum are typical stands selling vegetables. What isn't typical is their acceptance of bitcoin as a form of payment.",
      "Around 200 people use bitcoin in Soweto West, a neighborhood of the Kibera slum in Kenya 's capital. It's part of an initiative to extend financial services to one of the country's poorest and most under-banked areas.",
      "Its promoters say the adoption of crypto fits with the ideals of bitcoin as an accessible, democratic technology \u2014 but experts say it also has major risks.",
      "Bitcoin came to Soweto West via AfriBit Africa, a Kenyan fintech company, through its nonprofit initiative to improve financial inclusion.",
      "\u201cIn many cases, people in Kibera do not have an opportunity to secure their lives with normal savings,\u201d said AfriBit Africa co-founder Ronnie Mdawida, a former community worker. With bitcoin, \"they do not need documentation to have a bank account \u2026 that gives them the foundation for financial freedom.\u201d",
      "Bitcoin, the first and largest crypto, was created in 2009 in the wake of the global financial crisis as a decentralized digital asset that could act as an alternative method of payment.",
      "The asset has found more popular use as a store of value, like a digital form of gold. Bitcoin has attracted enthusiastic supporters as prices have climbed almost 1,000% in the last five years. But its volatility and lack of regulation are concerns.",
      "AfriBit Africa introduced bitcoin into Soweto West in early 2022 through crypto-denominated grants to local garbage collectors, who are often funded by nonprofits. The groups are made up of dozens of young people, who Mdawida says are more likely to be open to new tech.",
      "After gathering on a Sunday to collect trash, garbage collectors are paid a few dollars' worth of bitcoin. AfriBit Africa estimates that it has put some $10,000 into the community, with garbage collectors acting as the main agents of spreading bitcoin in Soweto West. In Kibera, many people earn about a dollar a day.",
      "Now a small number of other residents hold bitcoin, and some merchants and motorcycle taxis accept payments in crypto.",
      "Damiano Magak, 23, a garbage collector and food seller, said he prefers bitcoin to M-PESA, the ubiquitous mobile money platform in Kenya, because M-PESA transaction costs are higher and the network can be slower.",
      "There are no fees for M-PESA transactions between individuals or businesses up to 100 Kenyan shillings (78 cents), but after that the fees increase with transaction size. Fees for the Lightning bitcoin network where transactions take place are free if people use a platform that AfriBit Africa introduced into the community.",
      "Onesmus Many, 30, another garbage collector, said he feels safer with his money in a bitcoin wallet instead of in cash because of crime.",
      "Some merchants have found benefits to accepting crypto, including Dotea Anyim. She said around 10% of customers at her vegetable stand pay in bitcoin.",
      "\u201cI like it because it is cheap and fast and doesn\u2019t have any transaction costs,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen people pay using bitcoin, I save that money and use cash to restock vegetables.\u201d",
      "The possibility that crypto prices could keep rising also appeals to residents of Soweto West. Magak and Many said they now have around 70% to 80% of their net worth in bitcoin, a far higher level of exposure than most people.",
      "\u201cIt is my worth and I\u2019m risking it in bitcoin,\u201d Magak said.",
      "That concerns Ali Hussein Kassim, a fintech entrepreneur and chair of the FinTech Alliance in Kenya.",
      "\u201cIn an extremely volatile asset like bitcoin, it\u2019s overexposure. I can\u2019t afford to lose 80% of my wealth. How about a guy in Kibera?\u201d Kassim said. \u201cYou are exposing a vulnerable community to an ecosystem and to financial services that they can\u2019t necessarily afford to play in.\u201d",
      "Kassim acknowledged the potential benefits that digital assets could bring, particularly in facilitating cheaper cross-border payments like remittances, but failed to see the benefit in Kibera.",
      "Bitcoin\u2019s volatility could negate the benefits of cheaper transaction fees, Kassim said, and bitcoin does not have the same protections as other financial services due to a lack of regulation.",
      "Mdawida disagreed, calling bitcoin\u2019s unregulated nature a benefit.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t shy away from the risks involved,\u201d the AfriBit Africa co-founder said, noting the group\u2019s investments in bitcoin education in Kibera, including financial literacy training and crypto courses in the community.",
      "Efforts to introduce bitcoin into developing countries have faced challenges. Bitcoin was adopted as legal tender in El Salvador and Central African Republic but both countries have reversed their decision.",
      "In Kenya, the digital asset sector has faced legal and regulatory challenges, including crackdowns on cryptocurrency giveaways. This small project, focusing only on Soweto West, has been allowed.",
      "\u201cOn my phone I put notifications on when bitcoin rises \u2026 and it\u2019s all smiles,\" Magak said. \"Whenever it fluctuates up and down, I know at the end of the day it will just rise.\u201d",

      "According to NATO figures, Canada was estimated to be spending 1.33% of GDP on its military budget in 2023, below the 2% target that NATO countries have set for themselves. Canada previously said it was on track to meet NATO\u2019s spending target by the end of the decade.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to protect Canadians, not to satisfy NATO accountants,\u201d Carney said.",
      "The announcement of increased spending came as Canada is about to host U.S. President Donald Trump and other leaders at a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations in Alberta on June 15-17, and before the NATO summit in Europe. It also comes as NATO allies are poised to increase the commitment well beyond the 2% target.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said last week that most U.S. allies at NATO endorse Trump\u2019s demand that they invest 5% of gross domestic product on their defense needs and are ready to ramp up security spending even more.",
      "Carney has said that he intends to diversify Canada\u2019s procurement and enhance the country\u2019s relationship with the EU.",
      "\u201cWe should no longer send three quarters of our defense capital spending to America,\u201d Carney said in a speech at the University of Toronto. \u201cWe will invest in new submarines, aircraft, ships, armed vehicles and artillery, as well as new radar, drones and sensors to monitor the seafloor and the Arctic.\u201d",
      "Canada has been in discussions with the European Union to join an EU drive to break its security dependency on the United States, with a focus on buying more defense equipment, including fighter jets, in Europe. Carney\u2019s government is reviewing the purchase of U.S. F-35 fighter jets to see if there are other options.",
      "\u201cWe stood shoulder to shoulder with the Americans throughout the Cold War and in the decades that followed, as the United States played a predominant role on the world stage. Today, that predominance is a thing of the past,\u201d Carney said in French.",
      "He added that with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the United States became the global hegemon, noting its gravitational pull, always strong, became virtually irresistible and made the U.S. \u201cour closest ally and dominant trading partner.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow the United States is beginning to monetize its hegemony: charging for access to its markets and reducing its relative contributions to our collective security,\u201d Carney said.",
      "The prime minister said that \"a new imperialism threatens.\u201d",
      "\u201cMiddle powers compete for interests and attention, knowing that if they are not at the table, they will be on the menu,\" Carney said.",
      "Trump\u2019s calls to make Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, and Carney won the job of prime minister after promising to confront the increased aggression shown by Trump.",
      "Carney said that the long-held view that Canada\u2019s geographic location will protect Canadians is becoming increasingly archaic.",
      "European allies and Canada have already been investing heavily in their armed forces, as well as on weapons and ammunition, since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",

      "The British government say it is reversing its unpopular plan to end winter home heating subsidies for millions of retirees",
      "LONDON -- The British government on Monday reversed its unpopular plan to end winter home heating subsidies for millions of retirees.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer had signaled the u-turn last month after a loud outcry from the public and some members of his Labour Party who thought the relatively modest 1.5 billion-pound ($2 billion) savings were too politically costly.",
      "Treasury chief Rachel Reeves, who canceled the payment for home heating on all but the poorest retirees after Labour came to power last summer, said the benefit would be restored to 9 million people, or three-quarters of pensioners, in England and Wales whose incomes are below 35,000 pounds ($47,500). Reeves said the move was necessary last year because the previous Conservative government had left public finances in a dire state.",
      "\u201cTargeting winter fuel payments was a tough decision, but the right decision because of the inheritance we had been left by the previous government,\" Reeves said. \u201cIt is also right that we continue to means-test this payment so that it is targeted and fair, rather than restoring eligibility to everyone including the wealthiest.\u201d",
      "The payments are worth between 200 and 300 pounds ($271 and $406) a year. The reversal will cost the government 1.25 billion, Reeve said.",
      "Canceling the payments for most people last winter was blamed for contributing to Starmer's swift decline in popularity after his party came to power in a landslide. He was blamed for punishing elderly people on limited incomes who struggled to make ends meet during a cost-of-living crisis.",
      "Labour fared poorly in local elections in England last month, with many party representatives blaming the removal of the winter fuel payment.",
      "Kemi Badenoch, leader of the main opposition Conservative Party, quickly pounced on Starmer's about-face.",
      "\u201cKeir Starmer has scrambled to clear up a mess of his own making,\" she said. \u201cThis humiliating u-turn will come as scant comfort to the pensioners forced to choose between heating and eating last winter. The prime minister should now apologize for his terrible judgment.\u201d",

      "The crypto industry is seeing growing support from the Democratic Party, though it's far from unanimous",
      "WASHINGTON -- As President Donald Trump builds a crypto empire \u2014 including hosting a private dinner with top investors at his golf club \u2014 Democrats have united in condemning what they call blatant corruption from the White House.",
      "But the Democratic Party\u2019s own relationship with the emerging crypto industry is far less cut and dried.",
      "Work in the Republican-led Senate to legitimize cryptocurrency by adding guardrails has drawn backing from some Democrats, underscoring growing support for the industry in the party. But divisions have opened over the bill, with many demanding it prevent the Republican president and his family from directly profiting from cryptocurrency.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m all on board with the idea of regulating crypto,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. \u201cBut at this moment, when cryptocurrency is being so clearly used by Donald Trump to facilitate his corruption, I don\u2019t think you can close your eyes to that when you\u2019re legislating.\u201d",
      "The legislation is moving ahead more rapidly than Congress usually acts when an industry is new. But the big money and campaign donations flowing from cryptocurrency firms have made them a new powerhouse on the political scene, one that's increasingly gaining allies and capturing the attention of lawmakers.",
      "A look at what to know about the industry's clout and the political fight over what's known as the GENIUS Act:",
      "To understand the growing clout of the crypto industry, look no further than the 2024 election. Fairshake, a crypto super political action committee, and its affiliated PACs spent more than $130 million in congressional races.",
      "Fairshake spent roughly $40 million supporting Republican Bernie Moreno in Ohio in an effort to defeat Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. Brown, who lost to Moreno by more than 3 percentage points, was seen as a chief critic of the industry as the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.",
      "\u201cDC received a clear message that being anti-crypto is a good way to end your career, as it doesn\u2019t represent the will of the voters,\u201d Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, wrote in a social media post the day after the 2024 election.",
      "Coinbase \u2014 the largest crypto exchange in the U.S. and biggest contributor to Fairshake \u2014 does not view support for its industry as partisan, according to Kara Calvert, the company's vice president of U.S. policy. The industry also spent heavily to support Democrats Ruben Gallego and Elissa Slotkin in their races for open Senate seats in battleground states.",
      "Fairshake spent $10 million in support of Slotkin during her successful Senate run against Republican Mike Rodgers, and Slotkin, who won the Michigan race by fewer than 20,000 votes, spoke in favor of crypto on the campaign trail. Slotkin declined to be interviewed.",
      "Similar dynamics are setting up ahead of 2026 in contested House and Senate races. Fairshake said in January that it already had $116 million in cash on hand aimed at the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not slowing down, and everything remains on the table,\u201d Josh Vlasto, a spokesperson for Fairshake, told The Associated Press.",
      "Hours before a May 19 vote to move forward on cryptocurrency legislation in the Senate, an advocacy group tied to Coinbase sent an email to the offices of U.S. senators warning that the vote would count toward their crypto-friendliness scores.",
      "\u201cWhat the spending does is put crypto on the map. It lets members know that this is not a phase, this is real industry, with real dollars, that is developing its hold in Washington,\u201d said Calvert.",
      "A significant number of Democrats, 16, joined Republicans in advancing the crypto legislation. The GENIUS Act would create a new regulatory structure for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. It is viewed as a step toward consumer protections and greater legitimacy for the industry.",
      "The sticking point for many Democrats is that while the bill prohibits members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins, it excludes the president from those restrictions.",
      "Trump, once a skeptic of the industry, has vowed in his second term to make the U.S. the global capital of crypto. Meanwhile, he and his family have moved aggressively into nearly every corner of the industry: mining operations, billion-dollar bitcoin purchases, a newly minted stablecoin and a Trump-branded meme coin.",
      "Days after Trump\u2019s interests in the industry became public in early May, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York urged the Democratic caucus to unite and vote against the package to have a stronger hand in negotiations, according to a person familiar with the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss private discussions.",
      "On May 8, a bloc of Senate Democrats who had previously backed the GENIUS Act reversed course \u2014 ultimately voting to block the bill from advancing. Negotiations between Senate Democrats and Republicans followed. The White House was also involved, and in contact with senators' offices on both sides of the aisle, according to a senior official granted anonymity to discuss private conversations.",
      "The new version of the bill is now expected to pass the 100-member Senate this month. Amendments are still possible. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. has filed an amendment \u2014 cosponsored by Schumer \u2014 that would bar the president and his family from profiting off stablecoins, though it\u2019s unlikely to pass.",
      "\u201cThere is room for improvements as there often is with a lot of legislation. But with this in particular, we\u2019ve got issues with the president,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona \u201cHaving said that, this was negotiated with Democrats and Republicans. We got to a place. We voted on it. I expect this is the version we\u2019re going to pass.\u201d",
      "Still, the legislation is stirring unease. Schumer, asked if he\u2019s urging members to vote against the bill, noted that he has opposed the legislation and said \u201cthere\u2019s division in our caucus on that issue.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a gaping hole in this bill that everybody sees,\" Murphy said. \"After it\u2019s passed, it will be illegal for me to issue a cryptocurrency, but it\u2019s legal for the president of the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf this bill passes, we kind of go from a dirt road to a paved road,\u201d he said.",
      "If the Senate approves the stablecoin legislation, the bill will still need to clear the House before reaching the president\u2019s desk.",
      "Crypto advocates say the next priority is pushing Congress for market structure legislation, a far more sweeping effort than simply regulating stablecoins.",
      "\u201cStablecoin is one step of the path. Then you need market structure. We're hopeful that the Senate works together to pass something quickly,\u201d Calvert said.",
      "Some Democrats view the legislation as a chance to impose basic guardrails on a rapidly growing industry that's particularly popular among men and younger voters, two groups that drifted from the party in 2024.",

      "The Senate has set an ambitious timeline to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping legislation to cut taxes and spending",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate has set an ambitious timeline for passing President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping legislation to cut taxes and spending. But getting it on the Republican president's desk by July 4 will require some big decisions, and soon.",
      "Republican senators are airing concerns about different parts of the legislation, including cuts to Medicaid, changes to food aid and the impact on the deficit. To push the bill to passage, Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota and other negotiators will need to find a compromise that satisfies both ends of their conference \u2014 and that can still satisfy the House, which passed the bill last month by only one vote.",
      "A look at some of the groups and senators who leaders will have to convince as they work to push Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d bill toward a Senate vote:",
      "Every Republican senator represents a state with a rural constituency \u2014 and some of their states are among the most rural in the country. Many in those less-populated areas rely heavily on Medicaid for health care, leading several of them to warn that the changes to the program in the bill could be devastating to communities that are already struggling.",
      "Of particular concern is a freeze on a so-called provider tax that some states use to help pay for large portions of their Medicaid programs. The extra tax often leads to higher payments from the federal government, which critics say is a loophole that allows states to inflate their budgets. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and several others have argued that freezing that tax revenue would hurt rural hospitals, in particular.",
      "\u201cHospitals will close,\u201d Hawley said last month. \u201cIt\u2019s that simple. And that pattern will replicate in states across the country.\u201d",
      "Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville said Thursday that provider taxes in his state are \u201cthe money we use for Medicaid.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou start cutting that out, we\u2019ve got big problems,\u201d Tuberville said. Eliminating those taxes \u201cmight lose some folks.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Republican senators have little interest in a House-passed provision that spends more money by raising a cap on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT. The higher cap traditionally benefits more urban areas in states with high taxes, such as New York and California.",
      "The House included the new cap after New York Republicans threatened to oppose the bill, but Senate Republicans uniformly dislike it. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to have to be some adjustment\u201d on the SALT provision, Thune said Wednesday, noting that \u201csenators are just in a very different place\u201d from the House.",
      "The House-passed bill would also shift some Medicaid and food stamp costs to states, a change that has the former governors in the Senate, in particular, worried.",
      "West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice, who was governor of his state for eight years before his election to the Senate last year, said he favors many aspects of the bill. He supports the new work requirements for Medicaid and food stamp recipients, the restrictions on benefits for immigrants who are in the country illegally and the efforts to cut down on fraud. \u201cThere\u2019s real savings there,\u201d Justice said. \u201cBut then we ought to stop.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re on our way to cannibalizing ourselves,\u201d Justice said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to hurt kids and hurt our families.\u201d",
      "The provision stirring the most unease would shift 5% of administrative costs to the state for administering food stamps \u2014 known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. States that have high error rates in the program would have to take on an even higher percentage of federal costs.",
      "North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, also a former governor, said senators are working to get feedback from current governors and may propose some \u201cincentive-oriented ideas\u201d instead of a penalty for the high error rates.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the states have really looked at the impacts of some of this yet,\u201d Hoeven said.",
      "Tuberville, who is running for governor of Alabama next year, said the program should be reformed instead of shifting costs.",
      "\u201cI know what our budget is and what we can afford, and we can\u2019t start a federal program and then say, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s, let\u2019s send it back to the states and let them take a big hunk of it,\u2019\u201d Tuberville said. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s not the way we do it.\u201d",
      "Thune needs to bring Republican moderates on board with the bill, including Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Both have reservations with the Medicaid cuts, among other things.",
      "Collins said she wants to review how the SNAP changes will affect her state. Murkowski has questioned expiring subsidies for the Affordable Care Act and whether they might be needed if people are kicked off Medicaid.",
      "Last month, Murkowski said she wants to make sure that people are not negatively impacted by the bill, \u201cso we\u2019re looking at it through that lens for both Medicaid and on energy.\u201d",
      "Murkowski and Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas have also supported energy tax credits that would be phased out quickly under the House bill. The four senators argued that the quick repeal creates uncertainty for businesses and could raise prices for consumers.",
      "Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mike Lee of Utah and Rick Scott of Florida have argued the legislation does not save enough money and threatened to vote against it.",
      "Paul is considered the least likely to support the measure. He says he won\u2019t vote for it if it raises the debt ceiling \u2014 a key priority for GOP leaders in both the House and the Senate. The package would raise the nation\u2019s debt limit by $4 trillion to allow more borrowing to pay the nation's bills, as the Treasury Department says the limit needs to be raised by the middle of July.",
      "Johnson has been railing against the legislation since it was unveiled in the House, arguing that it does little to reduce government spending over time. He took those arguments to Trump last week at a meeting between the president and members of the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "After the meeting, Johnson said he would continue to argue that the bill needs to do more to cut costs. But he said he came away with the recognition that he needed to be \u201cmore positive\u201d as Trump exerts political pressure on Republicans to pass it.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a long ways from making the deficit curve bend down, but I recognize that\u2019s going to take time,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe truth is, there are a lot of good things in this bill that I absolutely support. I want it to succeed.\u201d",

      "The changes at Majid Al Futtaim come as Dubai tries to guide the family-run businesses that powered the city-state's growth in the United Arab Emirates through generational change. Authorities also likely want to avoid any further infighting that could slow down the growth of a firm that long has made hiring Emiratis a key goal.",
      "The Financial Times first reported on the changes to Majid Al Futtaim's board, saying it came at the orders of a government-established special judicial committee.",
      "In 2022, Dubai\u2019s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, established a special judicial committee to look after the estate of Majid Al Futtaim's founder \u2014 also named Majid Al Futtaim \u2014 following his death in 2021.",
      "Responding to questions Monday from The Associated Press, the company appeared to acknowledge the changes at Majid Al Futtaim Capital, which oversees its group of companies.",
      "The changes \u201creflect a shareholder-led effort to evolve governance in line with the long-term interests of the Group,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThese changes do not affect the operations or governance of Majid Al Futtaim Holding. Majid Al Futtaim continues to operate under an independent board and strong oversight.\u201d",
      "Dubai's government did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Financial Times described Majid Al Futtaim's parent company as now being overseen by five government and four family representatives.",
      "Succession battles aren\u2019t unusual in the United Arab Emirates, where family-run businesses dominate private enterprise. Rulers have given merchant families broad control over different sectors in exchange for the promise of big investments and fast-paced development.",

      "The central government has accused the Kurdish regional authorities of making illegal deals and facilitating oil smuggling. Baghdad cut off funding for public sector salaries in the Kurdish region ahead of the Eid al-Adha holiday. Kurdish authorities called the move \u201ccollective punishment\u201d and threatened to retaliate.",
      "It\u2019s the latest flare-up in a long-running dispute between officials in Baghdad and Irbil, the seat of the Kurdish regional government, over sharing of oil revenues. In 2014, the Kurdish region decided to unilaterally export oil through an independent pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan.",
      "The central government considers it illegal for Irbil to export oil without going through the Iraqi national oil company and filed a case against Turkey in the International Court of Arbitration, arguing that Turkey was violating the provisions of the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline agreement signed in 1973.",
      "Iraq stopped sending oil through the pipeline in March 2023 after the arbitration court ruled in Baghdad\u2019s favor. Attempts to reach a deal to restart exports have repeatedly stalled.",

The federal government in Baghdad then sued in an Iraqi court, asserting that it was illegal for the regional government to make the deals without going through Baghdad.",
      "The Iraqi Ministry of Finance announced a decision last month to halt funding for salaries of public sector employees in the Kurdish region. The move sparked widespread outrage in Irbil, triggering strong political and public reactions.",
      "The ministry said in a statement that the decision was due to the Kurdish regional authorities\u2019 \u201cfailure to hand over oil and non-oil revenues to the federal treasury, as stipulated in the federal budget laws.\u201d It added that any transfer of funds would be conditional on \u201cthe region\u2019s commitment to transparency and financial accountability.\u201d",
      "The federal Ministry of Oil accused Irbil of failing to deliver crude oil produced in the region\u2019s fields to the ministry for export through the state-run SOMO company, which it said had led to massive financial losses amounting to billions of dollars.",

      "Baghdad has also accused Irbil of smuggling oil out of the country. An Iraqi official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly said the government had tracked 240 cases of illegal border crossings from Iraq\u2019s Kurdish region into Iran between Dec. 25, 2024, and May 24, 2025, aimed at smuggling oil derivatives.",
      "The Kurdish region\u2019s Ministry of Natural Resources in a statement called those allegations \u201ca smokescreen to distract from widespread corruption and smuggling in other parts of Iraq. The KRG agreed to sell its oil through SOMO, opened an escrow account, and handed over revenues \u2014 yet Baghdad failed to meet its financial obligations.\u201d",
      "It accused the federal government of being responsible for the halt in oil exports via Turkey due to the lawsuit it filed in 2023 and said the Kurdish region had delivered over 11 million barrels of oil to the Ministry of Oil without receiving any financial compensation.",
      "The ministry accused Baghdad of \u201cviolating the constitution and pursuing a deliberate policy of collective punishment and starvation against the people\" of the Kurdish region through the halt in funding for salaries.",
      "Barzani in a statement on the eve of the Eid al-Adha holiday described the withholding of salaries as an \u201cunjust and oppressive decision\u201d and a \u201cpolicy of mass starvation\u201d comparable to the chemical attacks and \u201cgenocide\u201d launched by Iraq\u2019s former longtime strongman ruler, Saddam Hussein, against the Kurds.",
      "The Iraqi Kurdish people \"have resisted with steadfastness and courage in the face of all forms of pressure and tyranny\u201d and \u201cregret was the fate of the tyrants,\" he said.",
      "In the meantime, residents of the Kurdish region feel caught in the middle of the yearslong political dispute once again.",
      "Saman Ali Salah, a public school teacher from the city of Sulaimaniyah, said the salary cutoff comes at a particularly bad time for him \u2014 his daughter was hit by a car 40 days ago and is still in the hospital. He blamed both Baghdad and Irbil for the situation.",
      "\u201cAll the money I had was spent on transportation from the house to the hospital and I haven\u2019t paid my rent for the past two months,\" Salah said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. All I can say is that God will take revenge on these so-called officials on Judgement Day.\u201d",

      "The crashes, which began late last year and carried into 2025, were the tipoff to a sophisticated cyberattack that may have allowed hackers to infiltrate a phone without a single click from the user.",
      "The attackers left no clues about their identities, but investigators at the cybersecurity firm iVerify noticed that the victims all had something in common: They worked in fields of interest to China's government and had been targeted by Chinese hackers in the past.",
      "Foreign hackers have increasingly identified smartphones, other mobile devices and the apps they use as a weak link in U.S. cyberdefenses. Groups linked to China's military and intelligence service have targeted the smartphones of prominent Americans and burrowed deep into telecommunication networks, according to national security and tech experts.",
      "It shows how vulnerable mobile devices and apps are and the risk that security failures could expose sensitive information or leave American interests open to cyberattack, those experts say.",
      "\u201cThe world is in a mobile security crisis right now,\u201d said Rocky Cole, a former cybersecurity expert at the National Security Agency and Google and now chief operations officer at iVerify. \u201cNo one is watching the phones.\u201d",

      "Chinese hackers also sought access to phones used by Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance during the 2024 campaign.",

      "U.S. intelligence officials have said China poses a significant, persistent threat to U.S. economic and political interests, and it has harnessed the tools of digital conflict: online propaganda and disinformation, artificial intelligence and cyber surveillance and espionage designed to deliver a significant advantage in any military conflict.",
      "Mobile networks are a top concern. The U.S. and many of its closest allies have banned Chinese telecom companies from their networks. Other countries, including Germany, are phasing out Chinese involvement because of security concerns. But Chinese tech firms remain a big part of the systems in many nations, giving state-controlled companies a global footprint they could exploit for cyberattacks, experts say.",

      "While most smartphones and tablets come with robust security, apps and connected devices often lack these protections or the regular software updates needed to stay ahead of new threats. That makes every fitness tracker, baby monitor or smart appliance another potential foothold for hackers looking to penetrate networks, retrieve information or infect systems with malware.",
      "Federal officials launched a program this year creating a \u201ccyber trust mark\u201d for connected devices that meet federal security standards.

      "The latest frictions began just a day after the May 12 announcement of the Geneva agreement to \u201cpause\u201d tariffs for 90 days.",
      "The U.S. Commerce Department issued guidance saying the use of Ascend AI chips from Huawei, a leading Chinese tech company, could violate U.S. export controls. That's because the chips were likely developed with American technology despite restrictions on its export to China, the guidance said.",
      "The Chinese government wasn't pleased. One of its biggest beefs in recent years has been over U.S. moves to limit the access of Chinese companies to technology, and in particular to equipment and processes needed to produce the most advanced semiconductors.",
      "\"The Chinese side urges the U.S. side to immediately correct its erroneous practices,\u201d a Commerce Ministry spokesperson said.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick wasn't in Geneva but will join the talks in London. Analysts say that suggests at least a willingness on the U.S. side to hear out China's concerns on export controls.",
      "One area where China holds the upper hand is in the mining and processing of rare earths. They are crucial for not only autos but also a range of other products from robots to military equipment.",
      "The Chinese government started requiring producers to obtain a license to export seven rare earth elements in April. Resulting shortages sent automakers worldwide into a tizzy. As stockpiles ran down, some worried they would have to halt production.",
      "Trump, without mentioning rare earths specifically, took to social media to attack China.",
      "\u201cThe bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,\u201d Trump posted on May 30.",
      "The Chinese government indicated Saturday that it is addressing the concerns, which have come from European companies as well. A Commerce Ministry statement said it had granted some approvals and \u201cwill continue to strengthen the approval of applications that comply with regulations.\u201d",
      "The scramble to resolve the rare earth issue shows that China has a strong card to play if it wants to strike back against tariffs or other measures.",
      "Student visas don't normally figure in trade talks, but a U.S. announcement that it would begin revoking the visas of some Chinese students has emerged as another thorn in the relationship.",
      "China's Commerce Ministry raised the issue when asked last week about the accusation that it had violated the consensus reached in Geneva.",

      "A new study that examined five years\u2019 worth of prices at one U.S. grocery chain found that digital price tags haven\u2019t led to demand-based pricing surges",
      "Digital price labels, which are rapidly replacing paper shelf tags at U.S. supermarkets, haven\u2019t led to demand-based pricing surges, according to a new study that examined five years' worth of prices at one grocery chain.",
      "But some shoppers, consumer advocates and lawmakers remain skeptical about the tiny electronic screens, which let stores change prices instantly from a central computer instead of having workers swap out paper labels by hand.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s corporations vs. the humans, and that chasm between us goes further and further,\u201d said Dan Gallant, who works in sports media in Edmonton, Canada. Gallant's local Loblaws supermarket recently switched to digital labels.",
      "Social media is filled with warnings that grocers will use the technology to charge more for ice cream if it\u2019s hot outside, hike the price of umbrellas if it\u2019s raining or to gather information about customers.",

      "\u201cGrocery stores study when people go shopping the most. And so you might be able to see a price go down one day and then go up another day,\u201d Aguilar told The Associated Press.",
      "Researchers say those fears are misplaced. A study published in late May found \u201cvirtually no surge pricing\u201d before or after electronic shelf labels were adopted. The study was authored by Ioannis Stamatopoulos of the University of Texas, Austin, Robert Evan Sanders of the University of California, San Diego and Robert Bray of Northwestern University",
      "The researchers looked at prices between 2019 and 2024 at an unnamed grocery chain than began using digital labels in October 2022. They found that temporary price increases affected 0.005% of products on any given day before electronic shelf labels were introduced, a share that increased by only 0.0006 percentage points after digital labels were installed.",
      "The study also determined that discounts were slightly more common after digital labels were introduced.",
      "Economists have long wondered why grocery prices don\u2019t change more often, according to Stamatopoulos. If bananas are about to expire, for example, it makes sense to lower the price on them. He said the cost of having workers change prices by hand could be one issue.",
      "But there\u2019s another reason: Shoppers watch grocery prices closely, and stores don\u2019t want to risk angering them.",
      "\u201cSelling groceries is not selling a couch. It\u2019s not a one-time transaction and you will never see them again,\u201d Stamatopoulos said. \u201cYou want them coming to the store every week.\u201d",
      "Electronic price labels aren\u2019t new. They\u2019ve been in use for more than a decade at groceries in Europe and some U.S. retailers, like Kohl's.",
      "But they\u2019ve been slow to migrate to U.S. grocery stores. Only around 5% to 10% of U.S. supermarkets now have electronic labels, compared to 80% in Europe, said Amanda Oren, vice president of industry strategy for North American grocery at Relex Solutions, a technology company that helps retailers forecast demand.",
      "Oren said cost is one issue that has slowed the U.S. rollout. The tiny screens cost between $5 and $20, Oren said, but every product a store sells needs one, and the average supermarket has 100,000 or more individual products.",
      "Still, the U.S. industry is charging ahead. Walmart, the nation's largest grocer and retailer, hopes to have digital price labels at 2,300 U.S. stores by 2026. Kroger is expanding the use of digital labels this year after testing them at 20 stores. Whole Foods is testing the labels in nearly 50 stores.",
      "Companies say electronic price labels have tremendous advantages. Walmart says it used to take employees two days to change paper price labels on the 120,000 items it has in a typical store. With digital tags, it takes a few minutes.",
      "The labels can also be useful. Some have codes shoppers can scan to see recipes or nutrition information. Instacart has a system in thousands of U.S. stores, including Aldi and Schnucks, that flashes a light on the digital tag when Instacart shoppers are nearby to help them find products.",
      "Ahold Delhaize\u2019s Albert Heijn supermarket chain in the Netherlands and Belgium has been testing an artificial intelligence-enabled tool since 2022 that marks down prices on its digital labels every 15 minutes for products nearing expiration. The system has reduced more than 250 tons of food waste annually, the company said.",
      "But Warren and Casey are skeptical. In their letter to Kroger, the U.S. senators noted a partnership with Microsoft that planned to put cameras in grocery aisles and offer personalized deals to shoppers depending on their gender and age.",
      "In its response, Kroger said the prices shown on its digital labels were not connected to any sort of facial recognition technology. It also denied surging prices during periods of peak demand.",
      "\u201cKroger\u2019s business model is built on a foundation of lowering prices to attract more customers,\u201d the company said.",
      "Aguilar, the Arizona lawmaker, said he also opposes the transition to digital labels because he thinks they will cost jobs. His constituents have pointed out that grocery prices keep rising even though there are fewer workers in checkout lanes, he said.",
      "\u201cThey are supposed to be part of our community, and that means hiring people from our community that fill those jobs,\" Aguilar said.",
      "But Relex Solutions' Oren said she doesn't think cutting labor costs is the main reason stores deploy digital price tags.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about working smarter, not harder, and being able to use that labor in better ways across the store rather than these very mundane, repetitive tasks,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "The tax cuts in President Donald Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill would likely gouge a $2.4 trillion hole in the federal budget",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "The tax cuts in President Donald Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act would likely gouge a hole in the federal budget.",
      "The president has a patch handy, though: his sweeping import taxes \u2014 tariffs.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office, the government\u2019s nonpartisan arbiter of tax and spending matters, says the One Big Beautiful Bill, passed by the House last month and now under consideration in the Senate, would increase federal budget deficits by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. That is because its tax cuts would drain the government\u2019s coffers faster than its spending cuts would save money.",
      "By bringing in revenue for the Treasury, on the other hand, the tariffs that Trump announced through May 13 \u2014 including his so-called reciprocal levies of up to 50% on countries with which the United States has a trade deficit \u2014 would offset the budget impact of the tax-cut bill and reduce deficits over the next decade by $2.5 trillion.",
      "So it\u2019s basically a wash.",
      "That\u2019s the budget math anyway. The real answer is more complicated.",
      "Actually using tariffs to finance a big chunk of the federal government would be a painful and perilous undertaking, budget wonks say. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dangerous way to try to raise revenue,\u201d said Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Penn Wharton Budget Model, who served in President George W. Bush\u2019s Treasury Department.",
      "Trump has long advocated tariffs as an economic elixir. He says they can protect American industries, bring factories back to the United States, give him leverage to win concessions over foreign governments \u2014 and raise a lot of money. He\u2019s even suggested that they could replace the federal income tax, which now brings in about half of federal revenue.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s possible we\u2019ll do a complete tax cut,\u2019\u2019 he told reporters in April. \u201cI think the tariffs will be enough to cut all of the income tax.\u2019\u2019",
      "Economists and budget analysts do not share the president\u2019s enthusiasm for using tariffs to finance the government or to replace other taxes. \u201cIt\u2019s a really bad trade,\u2019\u2019 said Erica York, the Tax Foundation\u2019s vice president of federal tax policy. \u201cIt\u2019s perhaps the dumbest tax reform you could design.\u2019\u2019",
      "For one thing, Trump\u2019s tariffs are an unstable source of revenue. He bypassed Congress and imposed his biggest import tax hikes through executive orders. That means a future president could simply reverse them.",
      "\u201cOr political whims in Congress could change, and they could decide, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going revoke this authority because we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good thing that the president can just unilaterally impose a $2 trillion tax hike,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 York said.",
      "Or the courts could kill his tariffs before Congress or future presidents do. A federal court in New York has already struck down the centerpiece of his tariff program \u2014 the reciprocal and other levies he announced on what he called \u201cLiberation Day\u2019\u2019 April 2 \u2014 saying he\u2019d overstepped his authority. An appeals court has allowed the government to keep collecting the levies while the legal challenge winds its way through the court system.",
      "Economists also say that tariffs damage the economy. They are a tax on foreign products, paid by importers in the United States and usually passed along to their customers via higher prices. They raise costs for U.S. manufacturers that rely on imported raw materials, components and equipment, making them less competitive than foreign rivals that don\u2019t have to pay Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Tariffs also invite retaliatory taxes on U.S. exports by foreign countries. Indeed, the European Union this week threatened \u201ccountermeasures\u2019\u2019 against Trump\u2019s unexpected move to raise his tariff on foreign steel and aluminum to 50%.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not just getting the effect of a tax on the U.S. economy,\u201d York said. \u201cYou\u2019re also getting the effect of foreign taxes on U.S. exports.\u2019\u2019",
      "She said the tariffs will basically wipe out all economic benefits from the One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts.",
      "Smetters at the Penn Wharton Budget Model said that tariffs also isolate the United States and discourage foreigners from investing in its economy.",
      "Foreigners see U.S. Treasurys as a super-safe investment and now own about 30% of the federal government\u2019s debt. If they cut back, the federal government would have to pay higher interest rates on Treasury debt to attract a smaller number of potential investors domestically.",
      "Higher borrowing costs and reduced investment would wallop the economy, making tariffs the most economically destructive tax available, Smetters said \u2014 more than twice as costly in reduced economic growth and wages as what he sees as the next-most damaging: the tax on corporate earnings.",
      "Tariffs also hit the poor hardest. They end up being a tax on consumers, and the poor spend more of their income than wealthier people do.",
      "Even without the tariffs, the One Big Beautiful Bill slams the poorest because it makes deep cuts to federal food programs and to Medicaid, which provides health care to low-income Americans. After the bill\u2019s tax and spending cuts, an analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model found, the poorest fifth of American households earning less than $17,000 a year would see their incomes drop by $820 next year. The richest 0.1% earning more than $4.3 million a year would come out ahead by $390,070 in 2026.",
      "\u201cIf you layer a regressive tax increase like tariffs on top of that, you make a lot of low- and middle-income households substantially worse off,\u2019\u2019 said the Tax Foundation\u2019s York.",
      "Overall, she said, tariffs are \u201ca very unreliable source of revenue for the legal reasons, the political reasons as well as the economic reasons. They\u2019re a very, very inefficient way to raise revenue. If you raise a dollar of a revenue with tariffs, that\u2019s going to cause a lot more economic harm than raising revenue any other way.\u2019\u2019",

      "Air quality regulators in Southern California are debating proposed rules that would curb harmful emissions from gas-powered furnaces and water heaters",
      "DIAMOND BAR, Calif. -- Air quality regulators in Southern California heard impassioned public comments Friday before an anticipated vote on proposed rules that would curb harmful emissions from gas-powered furnaces and water heaters.",
      "The rules aim to reduce emissions of smog-contributing nitrogen oxides, also called NOx, a group of pollutants linked to respiratory issues, asthma attacks, worse allergies, decreased lung function in children, premature death and more. Burning natural gas is also one of the primary drivers of climate change.",
      "The South Coast Air Quality Management District estimates that the rules, if passed, will lower NOx emissions from gas-fired furnaces, preventing about 2,490 premature deaths and 10,200 new asthma cases over a 26-year period in the region. The district regulates air quality for 16.8 million people in Southern California, including all of Orange County and large areas of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties \u2014 one of the smoggiest areas in the U.S.",
      "The proposals come as California moves aggressively to reduce the state\u2019s reliance on planet-warming fossil fuels and ahead of a 2045 mandate for the state to have net-zero carbon emissions.",
      "The rules would set targets that aim to phase out the sale of gas-powered furnaces and water heaters starting in 2027. It does not apply to gas stoves. The sales target would start at 30%, then grow to 50% in 2029 and end at 90% in 2039. The rules would not be mandated, but manufacturers would have to pay fees ranging from $50 to $500 if they sell gas-powered appliances.",
      "That's a significant rollback from the original proposal, which would have required residential buildings to meet zero-emissions standards beginning in 2029 when appliances need to be replaced. The agency amended the rules after strong opposition from Southern California Gas and other businesses.",
      "The regulations would impact more than 10 million appliances in an estimated 5 million buildings, most of them residential.",
      "Officials and supporters say the rules would reduce air pollution and substantially improve public health. But opponents \u2014 including property owners, industry professionals and natural gas companies \u2014 fear they could raise costs for consumers and businesses, and strain the power grid by adding more electric appliances.",
      "During a packed board meeting Friday, clean air advocates held signs reading \u201cClean Air Now,\" \u201cVote 4 Clean Air, Vote 4 Justice\" and \u201cLet SoCal Breath!\u201d",
      "Before public comments, board chair Vanessa Delgado thanked the more than 200 people who signed up to speak about the rules, which took more than two years to craft.",
      "\u201cI don't believe that there's necessarily a good or right answer about these rules. I believe that it is very complicated and I know that every single one of these board members are doing what is right to move forward air quality goals in our region,\" she said.",
      "Lynwood City Councilmember Juan Mu\u00f1oz-Guevara said the rules would be a long-overdue step toward environmental justice for communities like his.",
      "\u201cI've seen firsthand how families in my community are forced to live with the health consequences of dirty air. Our children grow up with asthma, our elders struggle with respiratory illness, and too many lives are cut short,\" he said. \"Gas appliances in our home are one of the largest sources of smog-forming pollution in the region. We cannot meet clean air goals without tackling this.\u201d",
      "Peggy Huang, a member of Yorba Linda's City Council, urged the board to reject the rules.",
      "\u201cAs someone who's been advocating for affordable housing, this will increase costs for us to meet those goals,\u201d Huang said.",
      "Chino's mayor pro tem, Curtis Burton, echoed some of Huang's concerns. He said the rules would \u201ccreate an additional financial burden on residents and businesses.\u201d",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- The Bush family's nonprofit Points of Light will lead an effort to double the number of people who volunteer with U.S. charitable organizations from 75 million annually to 150 million in 10 years.",
      "The ambitious goal, announced in New Orleans at the foundation's annual conference, which concluded Friday, would represent a major change in the way Americans spend their time and interact with nonprofits.",
      "It aspires to mobilize people to volunteer with nonprofits in the U.S. at a scale that only federal programs like AmeriCorps have in the past.",
      "It also coincides with deep federal funding cuts that threaten the financial stability of many nonprofits and with an effort to gut AmeriCorps programs, which sent 200,000 volunteers all over the country. A judge on Wednesday paused those cuts in some states, which had sued the Trump administration.",
      "Jennifer Sirangelo, president and CEO of Points of Light, said that while the campaign has been in development well before the federal cuts, the nonprofit\u2019s board members recently met and decided to move forward.",
      "\u201cWhat our board said was, \u2018We have to do it now. We have to put the stake in the ground now. It\u2019s more important than it was before the disruption of AmeriCorps,\u2019\u201d she said in an interview with The Associated Press. She said the nonprofit aims to raise and spend $100 million over the next three years to support the goal.",
      "Points of Light, which is based in Atlanta, was founded by President George H.W. Bush to champion his vision of volunteerism. It has carried on his tradition of giving out a daily award to a volunteer around the country, built a global network of volunteer organizations and cultivated corporate volunteer programs.",
      "Speaking Wednesday in New Orleans, Points of Light's board chair Neil Bush told the organization's annual conference that the capacity volunteers add to nonprofits will have a huge impact on communities.",
      "\u201cOur mission is to make volunteering and service easier, more impactful, more sustained,\" Bush said. \"Because, let\u2019s be honest, the problems in our communities aren\u2019t going to fix themselves.\u201d",
      "According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and AmeriCorps, the rate of participation has plateaued since 2002, with a noticeable dip during the pandemic.",
      "Susan M. Chambr\u00e9, professor emerita at Baruch College who studied volunteering for decades, said Points of Light's goal of doubling the number of volunteers was admirable but unrealistic, given that volunteer rates have not varied significantly over time.",
      "But she said more research is needed into what motivates volunteers, which would give insight into how to recruit people. She also said volunteering has become more transactional over time, directed by staff as opposed to organized by volunteers themselves.",
      "In making its case for increasing volunteer participation in a recent report, Points of Light drew on research from nonprofits like Independent Sector, the National Alliance for Volunteer Engagement and the Do Good Institute at the University of Maryland.",
      "Sirangelo said they want to better measure the impact volunteers make, not just the hours they put in, for example. They also see a major role for technology to better connect potential volunteers to opportunities, though they acknowledge that many have tried to do that through apps and online platforms.",
      "Reaching young people will also be a major part of accomplishing this increase in volunteer participation. Sirangelo said she's observed that many young people who do want to participate are founding their own nonprofits rather than joining an existing one.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not welcoming them to our institutions, so they have to go found something,\u201d she said. \u201cThat dynamic has to change.\u201d",
      "As the board was considering this new goal, they reached out for advice to Alex Edgar, who is now the youth engagement manager at Made By Us. They ultimately invited him to join the board as a full voting member and agreed to bring on a second young person as well.",
      "\u201cI think for volunteering and the incredible work that Points of Light is leading to really have a deeper connection with my generation, it needs to be done in a way that isn\u2019t just talking to or at young people, but really co-created across generations,\u201d said Edgar, who is 21.",
      "Karmit Bulman, who has researched and supported volunteer engagement for many years, said she was very pleased to see Points of Light make this commitment.",

      "NEW YORK -- Craft labels from the now-shuttered fabrics seller Joann are making their way to a new home: Michaels.",
      "The Michaels Companies announced on Thursday that it had completed its purchase of Joann's intellectual property and private label brands \u2014 in an acquisition that arrives as the Texas-based arts and crafting chain works to expand its own fabric, sewing and yarn offerings.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re honored to have the opportunity to welcome JOANN customers into our creative community and are committed to delivering the selection, value, and inspiration they are looking for at Michaels,\u201d Michaels CEO David Boone said in a statement. The deal, he added, allows the company to better \u201crespond to rising demand\u201d among both new and existing customers.",
      "Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. The Associated Press reached out to Michaels for further information on Friday.",
      "With roots dating back to a single Ohio storefront in 1943, Joann had grown into a destination for generations of sewers, quilters, knitters and lovers of other crafts for more than 80 years. But more recently, operational challenges continued to pile up \u2014 with the retailer pointing to sluggish consumer demand, inventory shortages and rising competition.",
      "Joann announced it would be going out of business back in February, just one month after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time within a year. At the time, the company said financial services company GA Group, together with Joann\u2019s term lenders, had been selected as the winning bidder to \u201cacquire substantially all of Joann\u2019s assets\u201d and conduct going-out-of-business sales at all store locations.",
      "Michaels on Thursday said that its purchase of Joann's IP and private brands included the acquisition of \u201cBig Twist\u201d yarns, which had become a staple in Joann stores over the years.",
      "Those \u201cBig Twist\u201d labels are now being developed as part of Michaels' portfolio \u2014 and will be available in-stores and online later this year, the company said. In the meantime, Michaels has also dedicated a landing page to welcome former Joann customers online.",
      "And as part of its overall expansion into fabrics, Michaels said on Thursday that its adding more than 600 new products from new and existing brands \u2014 including quilting supplies and fabrics, specialty threads, sewing machines and more.",
      "Michaels, founded in 1973, currently operates 1,300 stores across 49 U.S. states and Canada. Its parent company also owns Artistree, a framing merchandise manufacturer.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk are showing no signs of reconciling on Friday, but Republicans are increasingly urging them to settle their dispute",
      "WASHINGTON -- As the Republican Party braces for aftershocks from President Donald Trump's spectacular clash with Elon Musk, lawmakers and conservative figures are urging d\u00e9tente, fearful of the potential consequences from a prolonged feud.",
      "At a minimum, the explosion of animosity between the two powerful men could complicate the path forward for Republicans' massive tax and border spending legislation that has been promoted by Trump but assailed by Musk.",
      "\u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t distract us from getting the job done that we need to,\u201d said Rep. Dan Newhouse, a Republican from Washington state. \"I think that it will boil over and they\u2019ll mend fences\u201d",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, was similarly optimistic.",
      "\u201cI hope that both of them come back together because when the two of them are working together, we\u2019ll get a lot more done for America than when they\u2019re at cross purposes,\u201d he told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday night.",
      "Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, sounded almost pained on social media as Trump and Musk volleyed insults at each other, sharing a photo composite of the two men and writing, \"But \u2026 I really like both of them.\u201d",
      "\u201cWho else really wants @elonmusk and @realDonaldTrump to reconcile?\u201d Lee posted, later adding: \u201cRepost if you agree that the world is a better place with the Trump-Musk bromance fully intact.\u201d",
      "So far, the feud between Trump and Musk is probably best described as a moving target, with plenty of opportunities for escalation or detente.",
      "One person familiar with the president\u2019s thinking said Musk wants to speak with Trump, but that the president doesn\u2019t want to do it \u2013 or at least do it on Friday. The person requested anonymity to disclose private matters.",
      "In a series of conversations with television anchors Friday morning, Trump showed no interest in burying the hatchet. Asked on ABC News about reports of a potential call between him and Musk, the president responded: \u201cYou mean the man who has lost his mind?\u201d",
      "Trump added in the ABC interview that he was \u201cnot particularly\u201d interested in talking to Musk at the moment.",
      "Still, others remained hopeful that it all would blow over.",
      "\u201cI grew up playing hockey and there wasn\u2019t a single day that we played hockey or basketball or football or baseball, whatever we were playing, where we didn\u2019t fight. And then we\u2019d fight, then we\u2019d become friends again,\u201d Hannity said on his show Thursday night.",
      "Acknowledging that it \u201cgot personal very quick,\u201d Hannity nonetheless added that the rift was \u201cjust a major policy difference.\u201d",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson projected confidence that the dispute would not affect prospects for the tax and border bill.",
      "\u201cMembers are not shaken at all,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to pass this legislation on our deadline.\u201d",
      "He added that he hopes Musk and Trump reconcile, saying \u201cI believe in redemption\u201d and \u201cit's good for the party and the country if all that's worked out.\u201d",
      "But he also had something of a warning for the billionaire entrepreneur.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, do not doubt and do not second-guess and don\u2019t ever challenge the president of the United States, Donald Trump,\u201d Johnson said. \"He is the leader of the party. He\u2019s the most consequential political figure of this generation and probably the modern era.\u201d",

      "Home decor's got a split personality this year: Call it \u201ccity glow\u201d and \u201ccottage flow.\u201d",
      "At the two international design fairs that I attended \u2014 Maison et Objet in France, Ambiente in Germany \u2014 acres of exhibition booths were full of Art Deco furnishings, island-vibe rattan seating and lighting, and lots of emphasis on sustainably produced materials.",
      "But a couple of aesthetics drawing crowds were especially interesting.",
      "One was an exuberant urban vibe I\u2019m nicknaming \u201ccity glow.\u201d It\u2019s full of highlighter-hued throw pillows, edgy surrealism, street art and hefty, Brutalist-style furniture \u2014 lots of sharp-cornered steel or concrete consoles and lamps that loomed over rooms \u2014 as well as rugs and wallcoverings covered in graffiti-style motifs or swaths of vibrant color.",
      "Gretchen Rivera, an interior designer in Washington, D.C., sees it as a look that resonates especially with \u201cyounger generations who grew up with digital influences. There\u2019s surrealist art, energetic colors and playful, almost toy-like design.\u201d",
      "Interior designer Anton Liakhov in Nice, France, agrees: \u201cFor a generation clamoring for creativity and self-expression, it\u2019s loud and in-your-face.\u201d",
      "For surface colors, look at Benjamin Moore\u2019s spicy orange Bryce Canyon or the bubblegum-pink Springtime Bloom. Daydream Apothecary has a whole collection of neon wall paints for intrepid decorators.",
      "Sisters Ana and Lola S\u00e1nchez use art as a bold form of self-expression at their luxe brand Oliver Gal, in South Florida. It's known for its handcrafted, statement-making pieces \u2014 including large acrylic gummy bears, graphic surfboards and wall art inspired by fashion, pop culture and modern surrealism. The result is a vibrant, edgy aesthetic.",
      "A new collection, Rococo Pop, introduces rococo-inspired frames in high-gloss acrylics paired with playful graphic imagery. \u201cWe wanted to take the opulence of 18th century rococo,\u201d notes Ana S\u00e1nchez, \u201cand give it a cheeky, pop-art punch.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese frames are like little rebels in ballgowns \u2014 elegant, over-the-top and totally unexpected,\u201d adds Lola S\u00e1nchez.",
      "The style, her sister says, \u201ccelebrates contrast. Old World charm meets modern mischief.\u201d",
      "The other impressive decor style at the design fairs was very different from the urban look. I\u2019m calling this one \u201ccottage flow,\u201d and Liakhov describes it as evoking a \u201cpeaceful sanctuary, where you can play around with textures that are anchored in, and in tune with, nature.\u201d",
      "Think nubby woolen throws in mossy hues. Softly burnished wooden tables. Vintage quilts, and dishware. Gingham and garden florals. Landscape prints. Imagery of birds and woodland animals on textiles and wallcoverings.",
      "Etsy\u2019s 2025 spring/summer trend report showed that searches for \u201cFrench cottage decor\u201d were up over 26,000% compared to 2024.",
      "\u201cI see people embracing a slower pace to life where they can,\u201d says New York-based interior and decor designer Kathy Kuo about the country cottage style.",
      "\u201cThe past two decades or so were dominated by a glorification of fast-paced \u2018hustle culture\u2019 \u2014 trends like cottagecore and coastal grandmother are evidence that the pendulum\u2019s swinging toward taking pleasure in simpler, more nature-adjacent things in life, whether or not you actually live in a country cottage,\u201d she says.",
      "Paint colors are also reflecting the trend. A calming sage green called Quietude is HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams\u2019 color of the year. Little-Greene\u2019s collection has names like Rolling Fog, Tea with Florence and Hammock.",
      "Watching design show visitors excitedly discovering new finds among the aisles, I thought THIS is what\u2019s fun about home decorating: You can think as creatively as you like when it comes to your own home.",
      "You\u2019re all about high-octane city nightlife? Come this way.",
      "Scottish crofts, Scandi cabins and cozy porches more your thing? Right over here.",
      "And if you want to mix these two aesthetics? Go for it. There\u2019s space to blend elements of both, says Kuo.",
      "\u201cDesign trends are so fluid. I absolutely see the potential to merge these into each other,\u201d she says. \u201cMany city dwellers love time in nature and have an affinity for a more rustic look, while still feeling called to honor their urban environment in their home. I see plenty of modern interior design motifs that are sleek and urban on the surface, but in the details, they\u2019re infused with organic textures and biophilic elements.\u201d",
      "\u201cReally, the best designs are the ones that are personal, rather than perfect,\u201d she adds.",
      "You could display an array of contemporary glass bowls on a curvy walnut credenza. Mix botanical patterns in vibrant, unexpected colors. Soften room elements like a sleek table and industrial-style lamp with boucle or velvet cushions and a fluffy rug. Pair polished concrete floors with vintage-inspired wallcovering.",
      "If you don\u2019t want to mix elements in one space, consider using sliding partitions from one room to another. You\u2019ll create a little style \u201cjourney.\u201d",
      "If the recent international design fairs are any indication, you\u2019re going to find loads of fun home decor in stores over the coming months. Get ready to flow.",

      "The wheels came off for the Edmonton Oilers in their 6-1 loss to the Florida Panthers in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final",
      "SUNRISE, Fla. -- Falling behind early, parading to the penalty box and losing grip of their composure, the Edmonton Oilers find themselves in an all-too-familiar position: trailing the Stanley Cup Final against the Florida Panthers.",
      "Not much went right for them in Game 3 on Monday night, a 6-1 blowout loss that put them down 2-1 in the series after taking the opener at home. Many of their 85 penalty minutes, the most by a team in the final in nearly four decades, came in garbage time, but there is far more concern about the mistakes that piled up to put them in a hole.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t play very well,\u201d said Evander Kane, who was whistled for two of his three minor penalties in a miserable first period and got a misconduct late. \"That\u2019s evident. We have nobody to blame but ourselves. We can definitely be a lot better.\u201d",
      "Stuart Skinner got pulled after allowing five goals on 23 shots, but captain Connor McDavid acknowledged, \u201cI don\u2019t know how much we\u2019re going to put on Stu.\u201d The play in front of him was disjointed and disconnected, at 5 on 5, on the power play and on the penalty kill.",
      "If not for Skinner, the score could have gotten out of hand much earlier because the Western Conference champions had their worst showing since perhaps the first couple of games of the playoffs.",
      "\u201cIt was a weird game,\u201d McDavid said. \u201cObviously it wasn\u2019t our best \u2014 not our best at all. I don\u2019t think our best has shown up all series long. But it\u2019s coming. We\u2019ll shift the focus to finding a way to get a win in Game 4.\u201d",
      "Even with an extra day off before Game 4 on Thursday night, coach Kris Knoblauch scheduled practice for his team Tuesday afternoon. There is much to discuss and work on.",
      "\u201cCollectively, goaltender, defense, all our forwards, we all have to be better,\u201d Knoblauch said. \"They played a heck of a game, and we\u2019re going to have to raise ours.\u201d",
      "Being more disciplined is a good place to start.",
      "After giving up a goal to Brad Marchand 56 seconds in, Edmonton took four minor penalties in the first period. The dam eventually broke on a power-play goal that made it too tough a deficit to overcome.",
      "\u201cAlmost half the period you\u2019re killing, so it\u2019s not a good way to get into your game,\u201d McDavid said. \"Never got to our game.\u201d",
      "The Oilers' play was almost indistinguishable from how they've looked for much of this run, getting balanced scoring and star performances from McDavid and Draisaitl. Ill-timed defensive breakdowns proved costly, and guys lost their cool \u2014 like Jake Walman squirting water at Panthers players on their bench from his place on the visiting side.",
      "\u201cI obviously did that for a reason,\u201d Walman said, reluctant to explain why. \u201cIt\u2019s just gamesmanship, I guess.\u201d",
      "By the time brawls ensued in the third period, the game was out of hand. Players downplayed the margin of defeat, quick to try to spin their thoughts forward to what they need to do to tie the final.",
      "\u201cWe know what we\u2019re going to be up against,\u201d Skinner said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change how we\u2019re going to respond again. We\u2019ve got two days to come back and I think there\u2019s some things that we\u2019re going to have to change.\u201d",
      "That could mean lineup changes and certainly some major adjustments by Knoblauch and his staff. The Oilers also need to be better prepared to play in Game 4, perhaps channeling the pain from back-to-back losses.",
      "\u201cLosing in the playoffs, whether it\u2019s in round 1 Game 1 or the Stanley Cup Final, it\u2019s never a good feeling, but we\u2019ve been here before,\" Kane said. \"We\u2019ve been down in series before, and we\u2019ve had tough losses. It will sting right now and we\u2019ll flush it tomorrow and get ready for Thursday.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Otto Kemp went undrafted out of Point Loma Nazarene University in California",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Otto Kemp wandered alone for about 20 minutes in his first trip to Citizens Bank Park \u2014 \u201cpeople were (like) what is this guy doing in this place?\u201d \u2014 when he spotted Phillies catcher J.T. Realmuto. Hours before Realmuto would score the winning run in an extra-innings comeback \u2014 a run set-up in large part by Kemp's bunt single in the two-run rally \u2014 he found the rookie and showed him the way to the clubhouse.",
      "\u201cI kind of walked with him and let him take me,\u201d Kemp said, laughing. \u201cJust trying to enjoy it. Get the lay of the land. Every clubhouse is different. Enjoy the day. Enjoy the moment.\u201d",
      "Kemp's improbable rise from undrafted Division II prospect out of Point Loma Nazarene University in California to signing a free-agent minor-league deal with the Phillies in 2022 through four minor-league stops finally brought him Monday night for the first time to Citizens Bank Park.",
      "Not as a fan such as reliever Orion Kerkering, who had to scrounge for upper deck tickets as a prospect to watch the 2022 World Series. Or even former Phillies pitcher Tyler Phillips, who practically grew up at the ballpark as a diehard fan of the team.",
      "Kemp saved his first trip to the ballpark for when he finally made the major leagues.",
      "\u201cI just tried to keep it special,\u201d he said. \u201cI just tried to keep it something that I get to do on the first day I get to the big leagues. It was kind of just a little bit of motivation to keep me pushing and get to this point.\u201d",
      "The 25-year-old Kemp's push took him first to Pittsburgh when he was called up Saturday from Triple-A Lehigh Valley with slugger Bryce Harper on the injured list. Kemp made his third straight start Monday night, this one against the Chicago Cubs and he finished a sparkling 3 for 5 with an error, his first career hit and run scored.",
      "Kemp said he hadn\u2019t bunted since he played collegiate summer baseball for the St. Cloud Rox in 2021.",
      "\u201cI popped it up straight to the catcher,\u201d he said with a laugh.",
      "The seemingly lost art in baseball came right back to Kemp. It certainly helped that he told the Phillies coaching staff over the weekend that, yes, he could in fact bunt.",
      "Realmuto made it 3-all when he drove in the automatic runner with a single off Cubs reliever Daniel Palencia.",
      "The Phillies then improbably got two straight bunt singles, the first from Bryson Stott \u2014 a late-inning replacement after he was benched amid a 2-for-24 slump \u2014and then from Kemp, who had the third of his first three big league hits in the game to set up the clutch swing from Marsh.",
      "Marsh \u2014 batting just .228 on the season \u2014 delivered a 381-foot single to center that scored Realmuto for the 4-3 victory and snapped the Phillies' five game losing streak. Marsh, a fan-favorite with his stringy hair and ZZ Top-esque beard, said it was the first walk-off winner of his career at any level of baseball.",
      "Kemp singled in the fifth for his first hit \u2014 he said he would frame the baseball \u2014 and scurried to third on Cubs starter Matthew Boyd\u2019s errant pickoff attempt. Kemp scored on Weston Wilson\u2019s RBI single for a 2-1 lead.",
      "Kemp's surprise call-up at around 11 p.m. Friday night in Charlotte, North Carolina, where the Iron Pigs played turned into a whirlwind trip for him and his family and friends. Kemp had an early morning flight on Saturday to Pittsburgh while his wife and dog drove from North Carolina and his parents scrambled to find a red-eye from California and made it to the game just in time.",
      "Kemp had his wife, his dad, three friends and his Point Loma college baseball coach Justin James and his family and friends at the game Monday for the home debut.",
      "\u201cIt's cool to execute that bunt and get it down and thank him for raising me in a West Coast baseball program,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cHe's stoked. He's just so fired up. Just to see me in that moment and out on that field, it's cool for him to see one of his products and how he helped me get to this point.\u201d",
      "Phillies manager Rob Thomson said Kemp could play first base and even the outfield the longer he stays in the major leagues. Kemp played all over the field this season at Triple-A with 33 starts at third base, 17 combined starts at second and first base and seven starts in the outfield. It was all enough to impress Thomson and the Phillies front office.",
      "\u201cHe's looked comfortable. He's got great composure,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cI really like the way he goes about his business.\u201d",
      "Kemp was slashing .313/.416/.594 with a 1.010 OPS, 49 runs, 14 home runs and 55 RBI in 58 games for the Iron Pigs.",
      "A non-roster invitee to spring training this season, the reality of going from unwanted in the draft to undeniable on the way to the majors truly came into focus over the last two seasons.",
      "\u201cDouble-A was when it really clicked,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cLike this is when it can become a real possibility.\u201d",
      "As his new Phillies teammates bathed him in sports drinks and water to celebrate his three hits and the win, he soaked in the moment and how that possibility had indeed turned into a reality.",
      "\u201cI'll have that Gatorade bath any day,\u201d he said.",

      "Hyeseong Kim had a tying double in the fifth for the Dodgers, and neither team scored again until Pages drove in Max Muncy.",
      "In front of Petco Park\u2019s usual lively bipartisan crowd for this rivalry, both starting pitchers were battered by these powerhouse lineups for 11 combined runs in the first three innings.",
      "Dylan Cease (1-5, 4.72 ERA) pitches Tuesday for San Diego. The Dodgers hadn't announced the next patch on their injury-riddled rotation.",

He's built for this time of year,\" said Brad Marchand, who opened scoring Monday with his eighth goal of the postseason. \u201cJust how competitive he is and how intense. Obviously you see the physicality piece. That shift was a perfect example of his game. He blows two guys up and then somehow leads the rush after that and scores a beautiful goal.\u201d",

      "\u201cThat goal was the perfect Benny goal,\u201d said Tkachuk said, \u201clays a big hit. (Luostarinen) makes a great block, springs Benny for a breakaway and a great goal.\u201d",

      "Panthers coach Paul Maurice, fully aware of Bennett's pending free agency, made sure to issue a warning to any teams interested in his squad's leading postseason scorer.",
      "\u201cHorrible attitude,\u201d Maurice quipped during a midgame television interview. \u201cI think he\u2019s got bubonic plague. Dengue fever. He\u2019s got a whole bunch of things. We\u2019re not sure he can be cured.\u201d",

      "The Boston Red Sox called up top prospect Roman Anthony two days after the 21-year-old outfielder hit a 497-foot grand slam for Triple-A Worcester",
      "BOSTON -- Roman Anthony was in Worcester, waiting for the 275-mile bus ride that would take him to Allentown, Pennsylvania, for his next Triple-A game, when WooSox manager Chad Tracy told the team their departure would be delayed because someone might need to head an hour east to Boston instead.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really think anything of it, to be honest,\u201d Anthony told reporters in the Red Sox dugout at Fenway Park before making his major league debut in Boston's 10-8, 11-inning loss to Tampa Bay on Monday night.",
      "\u201cI was just kind of waiting around in the food room with a few of the guys, and then all of a sudden he came out and just said, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re going to the big leagues,\u2019\u201d Anthony said. \u201cFrom there on out it\u2019s kind of been a little bit of a blur. But it was amazing. You dream of that every single day. So, to finally hear it was definitely awesome.\u201d",
      "Anthony, who played right field and batted fifth, received the biggest cheer of all during pregame introductions and then a standing ovation from the crowd of 31,422 when he came to bat in the second inning, with a runner on first and nobody out. He popped up to left field and got another cheer as he returned to the dugout.",
      "In the third, he may have been robbed of his first major league hit when he lined a ball up the middle that hit pitcher Shane Baz \u2014 at 111 mph. It deflected to the third baseman, who made the throw to first for the out. Anthony also struck out looking with runners on first and second in the third and walked in the seventh.",
      "In the ninth, with the crowd again on its feet, he came up with runners on second and third and hit a hard bouncer up the middle for an RBI groundout. He was due to lead off the 11th, but manager Alex Cora pinch-hit for him against left-hander Ian Seymour.",
      "\u201cIt was nice to finally take the field, forget about all the outside noise and just be able to take the field with the guys,\" he told reporters afterward. \"Unfortunate we couldn't get a win, but it was a good experience \u2014 good to just get the first one over with.\u201d",
      "Anthony fielded two balls easily in right field \u2014 a pair of singles in the fourth inning \u2014 but in the fifth he let a rolling ball go under his glove for a two-base error that led to an unearned run, giving Tampa a 3-0 lead.",
      "\u201cIt just can't happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's tough when you lose a game like that, you feel like that's the reason we lost \u2014 little things like that. Just got to learn from it and be better.\u201d",
      "A 21-year-old second-round draft pick who went viral over the weekend when he hit a 497-foot grand slam in Worcester, Anthony was the top-rated prospect in the minors before his call-up. He batted .288 with 10 homers and 29 RBIs in 58 games in Triple-A this season.",
      "His accomplishments in the minors had Red Sox fans clamoring for his call-up, especially with the team languishing in fourth place in the AL East, 8 1/2 games behind the rival New York Yankees. But while fellow prospects Kristian Campbell and Marcelo Mayer got the call, the Red Sox remained patient on Anthony until an injury to Wilyer Abreu left them needing another outfielder.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming,\u201d said Mayer, who was called up about two weeks ago. \u201cIt\u2019s been talked about for a very long time, and it\u2019s kind of crazy that today\u2019s the day that we\u2019re all going to share the field together in the big leagues. I\u2019m super excited. I think we have a really good team, and he\u2019s just another great addition to that.\u201d",
      "Cora said he noticed something was wrong with Abreu after Sunday\u2019s game against the Yankees. When the team realized it would be more than a day or two, they decided to make the move and put Abreu on the 10-day injured list with a left oblique strain. The Red Sox made room for Anthony on the 40-man roster by designating first baseman/outfielder Ryan Noda for assignment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to win ballgames,\u201d Cora said. \u201cThe kid has done an amazing job getting ready for this moment. We\u2019re excited. It\u2019s a big day for the organization.\u201d",
      "Anthony was perhaps known only to the most dedicated fans before his homer on Saturday that was the longest measured this year by Statcast, which tracks the major leagues, Triple-A and the Class A Florida State League. Since Statcast started tracking in the majors in 2015, only five home runs have gone farther, including Nomar Mazara's 505-foot shot in 2019 for the Rangers.",
      "After getting the promotion, Anthony had time to call his parents and siblings and an old baseball coach and gather most of his equipment \u2014 his own glove, a single bat and a borrowed pair of cleats \u2014 before driving down the MassPike to Boston. He arrived in Boston a few hours before game time and by 7:30 p.m. he was taking aim at the historic red seat that marks Ted Williams\u2019 502-foot homer that is the longest ever at Fenway Park.",
      "\u201cIt happened quick. I think no matter when that call comes, nobody\u2019s really expecting it,\" he said before the game. \u201cObviously a little bit of a short notice. But, you know, better than being on the bus to Lehigh Valley right now.\u201d",

      "The World Cup will be played at 16 stadiums in the U.S., Mexico and Canada from June 11 to July 19 next year, a tournament expanded to 48 nations and 104 games. All matches from the quarterfinals on will be in the U.S., with the final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.",

      "\u201cOne of the things that I think we all recognize is that we have to be really good at operating within that uncertainty,\u201d Kane said. \u201cI think for each of our cities, we want to be prepared to make any person that is coming and makes the decision to come to the United States or come to this World Cup feel that they are welcome.

      "Caitlin Clark will sit out a fifth consecutive game with a quadriceps strain when Indiana visits Atlanta on Tuesday",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Caitlin Clark will sit out a fifth consecutive game with a quadriceps strain when Indiana visits Atlanta on Tuesday, shifting the focus to whether the Fever star will return against the WNBA champion New York Liberty.",
      "Indiana coach Stephanie White stopped short Monday of saying Clark had been cleared for basketball activities, saying the club was ready for the reigning Rookie of the Year to start \u201cramping back up.\u201d",
      "The Fever initially said Clark would miss at least two weeks, and it has been 16 days since Clark was injured in a 90-88 loss to the Liberty. She finished the game, saying later adrenaline likely allowed her to play with the strain.",
      "Clark told reporters last week she was targeting a Tuesday return, but said she wouldn't rush it. White reiterated the patience part Monday. The rematch with the Liberty isn't until Saturday at home, which should give Clark some decent practice time.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be smart, and we\u2019re going to be cautious and we\u2019re going to play the long game and work her back in very intentionally,\u201d White said.",
      "Clark is averaging 19 points, 9.3 assists and six rebounds in four games this season. This is the first time in her college or pro career that she's missed games. She averaged 19.2 points and a WNBA-leading 8.4 assists as a rookie.",
      "The Fever are also without guard Sophie Cunningham, who has been limited to four games by ankle injury. White ruled out Cunningham against the Dream.",

      "The attorney for Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco says he will ask the court to exonerate his client of all charges in a sexual abuse case involving a girl who was 14 years old at the time of the alleged crimes",
      "PUERTO LA PLATA, Dominican Republic -- The attorney for Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco said Monday he will ask the court to exonerate his client of all charges in a sexual abuse case involving a girl who was 14 years old at the time of the alleged crimes.",
      "Franco, who was charged in July 2024 and is on supervised release, could face up to 30 years in prison if found guilty.",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t commit the acts he\u2019s accused of,\u201d Teodosio J\u00e1quez told The Associated Press at the end of the fourth hearing at the Collegiate Court of Puerto Plata, a tourist city in northern Dominican Republic where the girl is from.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re playing their part, because their job is to accuse. However, what they have to do is prove it,\u201d J\u00e1quez said of the witnesses presented by prosecutors.",
      "The prosecutors say the witnesses\u2019 testimony has been vital in proving that Franco sexually abused a minor and paid her mother money for her consent.",
      "\u201cToday, each of these expert witnesses\u2019 statements was vital. They established not only the fact of child sexual abuse, but also that they reinforced commercial sexual exploitation and money laundering,\u201d prosecutor Claudio Cordero said.",
      "Documents that prosecutors presented to the judge last year and were viewed by The Associated Press alleged that Franco, through his mother Yudelka Aybar, transferred 1 million pesos ($17,000) to the mother of the minor on Jan. 5, 2023, to consent to the purported abuse.",
      "The mother of the minor has been charged with money laundering and is under house arrest.",
      "Franco also has been charged with sexual and commercial exploitation against a minor, and human trafficking.",
      "Also, on Sunday he was charged with illegal possession of a handgun, prosecutors said.",
      "Franco was arrested Nov. 10 in San Juan de la Maguana after an altercation in a parking lot. No one was injured during the fight, and the handgun, a semiautomatic Glock 19, was found in Franco\u2019s vehicle, according to a statement from the Dominican Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office.",
      "Franco\u2019s attorney says the player did not have the weapon, that it belongs to someone else.",
      "\u201cThis is a celebrity, and some media outlets are perverse in trying to harm that young man,\u201d J\u00e1quez added.",
      "Franco, who turned 24 on March 1, was in his third major league season when his career was halted in August 2023. He agreed to an 11-year, $182 million contract in November 2021. He is currently on Major League Baseball\u2019s restricted list after initially being placed on administrative leave.",

      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- A.J. Greer is back in for the Florida Panthers in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final on Monday night after missing the first two in the series against the Edmonton Oilers because of injury.",
      "Coach Paul Maurice confirmed Greer would return on Florida\u2019s fourth line. Jesper Boqvist comes out of the lineup to make room for Greer, who will be making his first career appearance in the final.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a dream come true, but I\u2019m not really trying to focus on that,\u201d Greer said after the team's morning skate. \u201cIt\u2019s another game for me and I\u2019m just trying to enjoy it, but I\u2019m not trying to associate anything bigger than just my next shift, really.\u201d",
      "Greer, 28, gutted through injury for part of this playoff run before exiting in the Eastern Conference final against Carolina when it was clear he wasn't healthy enough to stay in. Maurice lauded Greer for his lack of selfishness and an abundance of self-awareness to understand when the pain threshold was reached and do what's best for the team.",
      "\u201cGood on him for recognizing that,\u201d Maurice said. \u201cWe were fortunate that we were able to heal A.J. to a place that he\u2019s really confident in what he\u2019s doing. ... He\u2019s been such a positive part of what we do.\u201d",
      "Greer almost wasn't here at all. A little over four years ago, he was languishing in the minors and almost giving up on his NHL dream.",
      "\u201cI was pretty much 24 hours away from just calling it, going to Europe and trying to just get a paycheck, trying to squeeze out every dollar that I can out of this sport and then live my life,\u201d Greer said. \u201cFortunately, things kind of bounced my way.\u201d",
      "Greer was essentially a throw-in as part of a trade to the New Jersey Devils that got the New York Islanders Kyle Palmieri and Travis Zajac, who helped them reach the East final. Greer \u2014 who was a second-round pick of Colorado in 2015 and played 37 games for the Avalanche from 2016-18 \u2014 developed some confidence with the American Hockey League's Utica Comets and cracked the Devils' roster a few times.",
      "Agent Philippe Lecavalier challenged Greer over whether he wanted to be an AHL player or adapt his style to be a role player in the NHL.",
      "\u201cYou could say I wanted to try to prove him wrong,\u201d Greer said. \u201cI kind of just went day by day, got better mentally, physically and matured with my game. I understood if I wanted to ever play in the NHL again, the way I have to play and the things I have to do \u2014 and I got a chance, so I\u2019m very grateful for that. It all led up to here.\u201d",
      "At 6-foot-3 and 209 pounds, Greer has been a physical force for Florida as the Panthers try to repeat as champions. He is one of the newcomers, along with their leading scorer in the final, Nate Schmidt, and teammates are happy to have Greer back.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a pain to play against,\u201d Evan Rodrigues said. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that can change the momentum of a game. He\u2019s heavy on the forecheck. For the most part, I don\u2019t think you want to get hit by him. He\u2019s a really good presence for us. And he chips in offensively. He lays the body. Just overall a pain the neck to play against.\u201d",
      "That came with time and trial and error as Greer learned how to have an impact with limited ice time. This spring brought his first taste of the Stanley Cup playoffs, and he has made the most of his nearly eight minutes a game.",
      "\u201cMy game\u2019s grown, especially this year,\u201d Greer said. \u201cMy confidence has grown, and I\u2019m ready to take on the biggest challenge that I\u2019ve really faced in my career.\u201d",

      "The takeaways from Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s fifth-set tiebreaker victory over Jannik Sinner in the French Open men\u2019s final are multiple and significant",
      "The takeaways from Carlos Alcaraz's fifth-set tiebreaker victory over Jannik Sinner in the riveting and record-breaking French Open men's final were multiple and significant.",
      "Let's start with this: Anyone worried about how men's tennis would survive in the post-Big Three era can rest easy. Alcaraz and Sinner produced 5 1/2 hours of evidence Sunday that the game is in good hands \u2014 and that their rivalry will be, and perhaps already is, a transcendent one.",
      "Take it from no less an authority than Roger Federer. The retired owner of 20 Grand Slam titles, and rival of Rafael Nadal (22 majors) and Novak Djokovic (24), began a post on social media by declaring, \u201c3 winners in Paris today,\u201d then listed Alcaraz, Sinner and \u201cthe beautiful game of tennis. What a match!\u201d",
      "This was the 12th Alcaraz-Sinner meeting, the first in a major final.",
      "\u201cHopefully not the last time,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cEvery time that we face ... each other, we raise our level to the top.\u201d",
      "It would be shocking if there weren\u2019t many more of these to come \u2014 perhaps as soon as at Wimbledon, where play begins on June 30 and No. 2-ranked Alcaraz is the two-time defending champion.",
      "His comeback against No. 1 Sinner from two sets down, then three championship points down, to win 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (10-2) was unprecedented at Roland-Garros. It was unforgettable. Alcaraz's coach, Juan Carlos Ferrero, described his guy's best trait this way: \u201cHis strength is (to) keep believing all the time, until the last ball is gone.\u201d",
      "Alcaraz's five Grand Slam titles at 22 \u2014 that's the age at which Nadal, Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras also got to five; no one's done it younger \u2014 show how special he is. So does the Spaniard's 5-0 record in major finals, a career start surpassed among men only by Federer's 7-0.",
      "Sinner is pretty good, too. Tuesday marks a full year that he has been ranked No. 1. He has reached the finals of his last eight tournaments, a run last accomplished by Djokovic a decade ago. He has won three majors. He has won 47 of his last 50 matches.",
      "Notably, all three of those losses came against \u2014 yes, you guessed it \u2014 Alcaraz. That hearkens back to the days when Federer would beat everyone other than Nadal.",
      "Sinner had claimed 31 Slam sets in a row right up until the moment he was up 2-0 against Alcaraz.",
      "What was unmistakable to anyone watching in-person at Court Philippe-Chatrier or following along from afar on TV is that Alcaraz vs. Sinner is a must-see.",
      "\u201cThe level,\u201d Alcaraz said, \u201cwas insane.\u201d",
      "Sinner's take?",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy to be part of this,\u201d the 23-year-old Italian said. \u201cWould be even more happy if I would have ... the big trophy.\u201d",
      "As with any great rivalry \u2014 think Evert vs. Navratilova or Borg vs. McEnroe or Federer vs. Nadal, no first names needed \u2014 Alcaraz vs. Sinner provides a clash of excellence and a study in contrasts.",
      "Alcaraz displays emotion, pumping his fists, pointing to an ear to ask for more noise, yelling \u201cVamos!\u201d Sinner is rather contained. Sinner's long limbs get him to nearly every ball. Alcaraz's motor reaches speeds no one can equal. Sinner's ball-striking is pure. Alcaraz's drop shots are legendary. Both hammer groundstrokes that leave opponents exasperated and spectators gasping.",
      "Both can improve. Sinner has never won a match that lasted four hours. Alcaraz loses focus on occasion.",
      "Both are eager to improve. When Sinner returned from a three-month doping ban last month, he introduced a new, angled return stance. Alcaraz tweaked his serve and backhand technique.",
      "Who knows what heights each can reach? They split the past six Slam trophies, and eight of the past 11.",
      "Federer saw this coming.",
      "During an interview with The Associated Press in December 2019, Federer predicted someone would win major after major the way he, Nadal and Djokovic did. Just didn't know there would be a Big Two doing it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to happen, inevitably,\u201d Federer said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s almost not going to be that hard, maybe ... because the players will have seen what we did. And they didn\u2019t see just one guy doing it, once every 30 years. They saw like three guys doing it, in the shortest period of time. ... Players are going to believe more.\"",

      "The Florida Panthers lead the Stanley Cup Final 2-1 after routing the Edmonton Oilers 6-1 in Game 3",
      "SUNRISE, Fla. -- Taking advantage of the Edmonton Oilers' worst performance in several weeks, the defending Florida Panthers pounced on mistakes to win Game 3 in a 6-1 rout Monday night and take a 2-1 series lead.",
      "Brad Marchand became the oldest player to score in each of the first three games of a final, while Sam Bennett added his NHL playoff-leading 14th goal after making a big hit on Edmonton\u2019s Vasily Podkolzin that contributed to the turnover to spring him on a breakaway. Marchand and Bennett have combined to score eight goals for Florida, which was dominant in just about every way.",
      "\"We ended up playing what Florida kind of wanted,\" said Oilers goalie Stuart Skinner, who got pulled after allowing five goals on 23 shots. \u201cThey were great tonight.\u201d",
      "And it was not just Bennett and Marchand. Carter Verhaeghe and Sam Reinhart each got his first goal of the series, Aaron Ekblad scored to chase Skinner and Evan Rodrigues added the exclamation point in the waning minutes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a very deep team,\u201d Marchand said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of our strengths is the depth of the group from the front end to the back end to the goaltending.\u201d",
      "At the other end of the ice, Sergei Bobrovsky earned the \u201cBobby! Bobby!\u201d chants from a fired up South Florida crowd. The two-time Vezina Trophy-winning goaltender known as \u201cBob\u201d was on his game for the very few quality chances the discombobulated Oilers mustered, making 32 saves.",
      "\u201cNothing\u2019s going to be perfect in the way we play,\u201d Reinhart said. \u201cThis time of year, you need some world-class goaltending and that\u2019s what we get consistently.\u201d",
      "Perry \u2014 at 40 the oldest player in the series \u2014 beat Bobrovsky with some silky hands for a power-play goal, keeping up this final being a showcase of cagey veterans along with Marchand.",
      "Connor McDavid could not get his team on track, and Edmonton took 15 minors \u2014 led by Evander Kane's three plus a misconduct to add up to 85 penalty minutes \u2014 including a brawl that ensued with less than 10 minutes left. Trent Frederic and Darnell Nurse, who fought Jonah Gadjovich, got misconducts that knocked them out of a game with an outcome determined long before.",
      "\u201cEmotions in all these games are extremely high,' Marchand said. \u201dThis is the time of year you want to be playing, and you\u2019re enjoying every minute.\"",
      "After the final looked as evenly matched as can be with Games 1 and 2 each needing extra time, overtime and then double OT, Game 3 was a lopsided mismatch. The Oilers came unglued to the point Jake Walman resorted to squirting water on Panthers players on their bench from his spot on the visiting side.",
      "The teams have some extra time off before Game 4 on Thursday night, when the Panthers have the chance to take a 3-1 lead and move to the verge of going back to back.",
      "\"Game 4 is a really big game,\" McDavid said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big swing game.\u201d",

      "Pavel appointed Eva Decroix after her predecessor Pavel Bla\u017eek resigned from the post on May 30. He was under fire from the opposition because his ministry accepted a donation of bitcoins and sold them for almost 1 billion Czech koruna ($46 million) earlier this year.",
      "Bla\u017eek said that he wasn\u2019t aware of any wrongdoing, but didn\u2019t want the four-party coalition government led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala to be harmed by the scandal. Fiala said that he appreciated his resignation and believed that Bla\u017eek acted with goodwill.",

      "The estimated population of 16 penguin colonies \u2014 visible in satellite photos taken between 2009 and 2024 \u2013 had declined 22% during that period mainly because of climate change that's shrinking the amount of available sea ice. It's unclear whether this drop is seen across the continent, scientists said.",
      "\u201cSea ice is very important for the penguins because they breed on sea ice and forage on sea ice,\u201d said Peter Fretwell with British Antarctic Survey, who helped analyze the data.",
      "Scientists previously estimated that the total emperor penguin population declined about 10% across all of Antarctica over the past decade and a half. The latest survey included a region covering the Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea and Bellingshausen Sea.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely alarming that the numbers are so much worse than predicted,\u201d said Daniel Zitterbart, a penguin researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "There are uncertainties in the latest estimate. The analysis relies on a calculation of how densely the penguins are clustered in each area where they're detected in a single satellite photo taken each year.",
      "The colonies studied represent about 30% of the total emperor penguin population, which lives only in Antarctica. The loss of stable sea ice may be affecting the penguins in ways beyond shrinking their breeding grounds.",
      "\u201cMore predators like leopard seals and orcas may be able to come in closer to the colonies if sea ice breaks up earlier in the year,\u201d said Fretwell.",
      "Warming ocean temperatures and changing rainfall patterns may also impact the survival of penguin chicks, he added.",

      "The red fox is such a fixture of life in London that it has its own ambulance service",
      "PADDOCK WOOD, England -- The injured fox is cornered in a cage, teeth bared and snarling at the woman trying to help it.",
      "Nicki Townsend is unfazed. Wearing only rubber gloves and an outfit suitable for a yoga class, she approaches with soothing words. \u201cAll right, baby,\" she coos as she deftly drapes a towel over his head, grabs him by the scruff of his neck, scoops up his wounded legs and moves him to a clean cage.",
      "It\u2019s not the way her day typically begins, but there\u2019s nothing routine about rescuing foxes.",
      "\u201cYou can never predict what you\u2019re going to arrive at,\u201d Townsend said.",
      "While not as visible as phone boxes or double-decker buses, the red fox is a fixture in London, a city not known for its wildlife. But living on the streets, alleys and back gardens of a dense urban environment can be rough and when foxes need help, they have their own ambulance service \u2014 and Townsend may be on her way.",
      "The foxes didn't invade London so much as adapt and expand their range inward as the city spread to their habitat in the 1930s and suburbs grew.",
      "But people and the bushy-tailed member of the canine family have not always lived in harmony, and the species has admirers and adversaries.",
      "For everyone enchanted seeing a fox trotting nonchalantly down their street at dusk or basking in a sunny backyard, there are plenty who see them as pests. They poop where they like, tear into garbage and the vixens in heat let out terrifying shrieks in the dead of winter when attracting a mate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like Marmite with foxes,\u201d Townsend said, referring to the food spread that is an acquired and divisive taste. \u201cYou either love them or hate them.\u201d",
      "The divide between the two camps led Trevor Williams to found what became The Fox Project nearly 35 years ago.",
      "Once a bass player in the rock group Audience that opened for Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, Williams had been active in the campaign to stop fox hunting when he redirected his protection efforts to the city, where foxes were once routinely killed.",
      "\u201cBecause of the myths that have occurred over the years, there\u2019s still a lot of suspicion about what foxes might be,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou know, they\u2019re going to bite the baby, they\u2019re going to eat the cat, they\u2019re going to run away with your husband.\u201d",
      "The project has since grown from providing information on deterring foxes to rescuing 1,400 a year, including 400 cubs, though only about half survive to be released.",
      "There are estimated to be 15,000 foxes in London. The project covers a swath of south London and its leafy suburbs while other organizations not devoted solely to foxes handle other parts of the city.",
      "While the omnivores survive on small animals, bugs and berries in the wild, they favor easily scavenged leftovers in the city and handouts that make them more dependent on humans.",
      "Their main urban menaces are cars, getting snagged in soccer nets or getting stuck in tight spaces. In their effort to get free, they often get nasty abrasions that can become infected. Many also suffer from mange, a parasitic infestation that leads to all kinds of problems.",
      "Townsend pilots her VW Caddy on city streets, highways and narrow lanes that roll through lush hills, responding to calls about injured or ill foxes or cubs that have lost their mothers.",
      "She's seen a bit of everything since her first humbling call 2 1/2 years ago when the supposedly injured fox bolted.",
      "\u201cIn my inexperience, I chased after him, which is comical because you\u2019re never going to outrun a fox,\u201d she said. \u201cI just remember he ran very fast and I looked silly running after him.\u201d",
      "Despite many challenging situations \u2014 she once managed to rescue a fox that lost its footing atop a fence and ended upside down at eye level with its paw lodged between boards \u2014 she's only been bitten once.",
      "Her van carries the distinctly musky scent of foxes. The odor becomes unpleasant when an anxious passenger in a litter of cubs relieves itself enroute to being delivered to a foster care pen where they will stay until being released in the wild.",
      "\u201cFeel free to open the window,\u201d said Townsend, who is accustomed to the stench. \u201cThis is a stinky job.\"",
      "On a recent day, she was dispatched to meet a heartbroken couple who found a cub with a puncture wound collapsed on their back lawn.",
      "\u201cWe thought he was asleep at first, so we went to go and have a close look because we love them,\" Charlotte English said. \u201cThen he just didn\u2019t move, so we knew something was wrong.\u201d",
      "That cub had to be put to sleep, as did the adult Townsend transferred at the start of her shift.",
      "Cubs that recover are socialized in packs of five until they mature and are then released in a rural location while the adults are freed in the neighborhoods where they were found.",
      "Given a second chance, it's not clear how well the foxes fare, because they are rarely tracked. A 2016 study in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science found that rehabilitated foxes were more likely to behave as if they had been displaced when returned to their original territory. They were tracked wandering farther away, potentially exposing them to more traffic and greater stress.",
      "\u201cIt is a gap in the knowledge and there\u2019s an assumption that when you release them, they thrive and I think that that assumption needs to be challenged more,\u201d said Bryony Tolhurst, a University of Brighton honorary research fellow and lead author of the study.",
      "For Townsend, fox deaths are offset by the joy of seeing little ones venture into the unknown or an adult darting into a neighborhood it instantly recognizes.",
      "\u201cSometimes they look back and people like to romanticize that they\u2019re saying \u2018thank you,'\" she said. \"They\u2019re just making sure we\u2019re not chasing after them.\u201d",

      "Financial aid fraud is exploding, thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence",
      "It was an unusual question coming from a police officer. Heather Brady was napping at home in San Francisco on a Sunday afternoon when the officer knocked on her door to ask: Had she applied to Arizona Western College?",
      "She had not, and as the officer suspected, somebody else had applied to Arizona community colleges in her name to scam the government into paying out financial aid money.",
      "When she checked her student loan servicer account, Brady saw the scammers hadn't stopped there. A loan for over $9,000 had been paid out in her name \u2014 but to another person \u2014 for coursework at a California college.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine how many people this is happening to that have no idea,\u201d Brady said.",
      "The rise of artificial intelligence and the popularity of online classes have led to an explosion of financial aid fraud. Fake college enrollments have been surging as crime rings deploy \u201cghost students\u201d \u2014 chatbots that join online classrooms and stay just long enough to collect a financial aid check.",
      "In some cases, professors discover almost no one in their class is real. Students get locked out of the classes they need to graduate as bots push courses over their enrollment limits. And victims of identity theft who discover loans fraudulently taken out in their names must go through months of calling colleges, the Federal Student Aid office and loan servicers to try to get the debt erased.",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Education Department introduced a temporary rule requiring students to show colleges a government-issued ID to prove their identity. It will apply only to first-time applicants for federal student aid for the summer term, affecting some 125,000 borrowers. The agency said it is developing more advanced screening for the fall.",
      "\u201cThe rate of fraud through stolen identities has reached a level that imperils the federal student aid program,\u201d the department said in its guidance to colleges.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of fraud reports obtained through a public records request shows California colleges in 2024 reported 1.2 million fraudulent applications, which resulted in 223,000 suspected fake enrollments. Other states are affected by the same problem, but with 116 community colleges, California is a particularly large target.",
      "Criminals stole at least $11.1 million in federal, state and local financial aid from California community colleges last year that could not be recovered, according to the reports.",
      "Colleges typically receive a portion of the loans intended for tuition, with the balance going directly to students for other expenses. Community colleges are targeted in part because their lower tuition means larger percentages of grants and loans go to borrowers.",
      "Scammers frequently use AI chatbots to carry out the fraud, targeting courses that are online and allow students to watch lectures and complete coursework on their own time.",
      "In January, Wayne Chaw started getting emails about a class he never signed up for at De Anza Community College, where he had taken coding classes a decade earlier. Identity thieves had obtained his Social Security number and collected $1,395 in financial aid in his name.",
      "The energy management class required students to submit a homework assignment to prove they were real. But someone wrote submissions impersonating Chaw, likely using a chatbot.",
      "\u201cThis person is typing as me, saying my first and last name. ... It\u2019s very freaky when I saw that,\u201d said Chaw.",
      "The fraud involved a grant, not loans, so Chaw himself did not lose money. He called the Social Security Administration to report the identity theft, but after five hours on hold, he never got through to a person.",
      "As the Trump administration moves to dismantle the Education Department, federal cuts may make it harder to catch criminals and help victims of identity theft. In March, the Trump administration fired more than 300 people from the Federal Student Aid office, and the department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, which investigates fraud, has lost more than 20% of its staff through attrition and retirements since October.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just nervous that I\u2019m going to be stuck with this,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThe agency is going to be so broken down and disintegrated that I won\u2019t be able to do anything, and I\u2019m just going to be stuck with those $9,000\u201d in loans.",
      "Criminal cases around the country offer a glimpse of the schemes' pervasiveness.",
      "In the past year, investigators indicted a man accused of leading a Texas fraud ring that used stolen identities to pursue $1.5 million in student aid. Another person in Texas pleaded guilty to using the names of prison inmates to apply for over $650,000 in student aid at colleges across the South and Southwest. And a person in New York recently pleaded guilty to a $450,000 student aid scam that lasted a decade.",
      "Brittnee Nelson of Shreveport, Louisiana, was bringing her daughter to day care two years ago when she received a notification that her credit score had dropped 27 points.",
      "Loans had been taken out in her name for colleges in California and Louisiana, she discovered. She canceled one before it was paid out, but it was too late to stop a loan of over $5,000 for Delgado Community College in New Orleans.",
      "Nelson runs her own housecleaning business and didn\u2019t go to college. She already was signed up for identity theft protection and carefully monitored her credit. Still, her debt almost went into collections before the loan was put in forbearance. She recently got the loans taken off her record after two years of effort.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like if someone came into your house and robbed you,\u201d she said.",
      "The federal government's efforts to verify borrowers' identity could help, she said.",
      "\u201cIf they can make these hurdles a little bit harder and have these verifications more provable, I think that\u2019s really, really, really going to protect people in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Delgado spokesperson Barbara Waiters said responsibility for approving loans ultimately lies with federal agencies.",
      "\u201cThis is an unfortunate and serious matter, but it is not the direct or indirect result of Delgado\u2019s internal processes,\u201d Waiters said.",
      "In San Francisco, the loans taken out in Brady's name are in a grace period, but still on the books. That has not been her only challenge. A few months ago, she was laid off from her job and decided to sign up for a class at City College San Francisco to help her career. But all the classes were full.",
      "After a few weeks, Brady finally was able to sign up for a class. The professor apologized for the delay in spots opening up: The college has been struggling with fraudulent applications.",

      "Geoff Kendrick, the bank\u2019s head of digital assets research, said in the report that restrictions on investors buying bitcoin directly help explain the popularity of bitcoin treasury companies, as their stocks can serve as bitcoin proxies. But as crypto becomes more mainstream, the case for investing in bitcoin treasury companies becomes weaker, Kendrick said.",

But you could feel the strain in 2023\u2019s The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, with its at-times blurry graphics and sluggish framerate. The Switch 2, with a faster framerate of 120 fps, corrects much of the fuzziness.",
      "That's not to say it comes close to matching the high-definition performance of the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox X/S. If you're expecting the jaw-dropping graphics of, say, Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows ... well, no.",
      "There is good news for those of us who have gotten weary of the old Switch's dinky 32 gigabytes of internal storage. The Switch 2 multiplies that by eight, for 256 GB. Of course, flashier games take up more space, so if you want more room you'll have to invest in a microSD Express card \u2014 which is a bit pricier than the standard memory card used in most portable devices.",
      "The Switch 2's Joy-Con controllers have undergone some tinkering. As before, you can attach them to the sides of the screen if you're playing on the go. If you're at home, you can attach them to a doohickey that feels more like a traditional joystick. Either way, they're now more firmly connected with magnets, which provide a satisfying snap.",
      "Both the left and right Joy-Cons now include an optical mouse, which you can use by placing the controller on its edge and rolling it around on a table. (Nintendo says you can also use it on your pants, but I prefer using a clipboard on my lap.) It remains to be seen how many Switch 2 games will call for a mouse, but 2K's port of Sid Meier's Civilization VII seems like a good candidate.",
      "And then there's a new button labeled \u201cC\u201d on the right-hand Joy-Con. That calls up GameChat, which lets you start up a conversation with other players \u2014 provided you've all taken the time to register yourselves as friends. (Eventually, you'll also need to subscribe to the Nintendo Switch Online service, but that requirement doesn't kick in until March 31, 2026.) The microphone is built into the Switch 2, though if you want to upgrade to video chat, you'll need to buy a separate Nintendo camera.",
      "Finally, there\u2019s GameShare, which lets you play selected titles with other Switch users even if they don\u2019t own the software.",
      "Nintendo has been emphasizing the new social features in its marketing, though it feels like it's catching up to the competition. The kids I know who play Fortnite or Minecraft on competing consoles seem to have figured out long ago how to chat with their pals. Welcome to the 2010s?",
      "As with any console launch, the driving question is: Does it have the games?",
      "There are just a couple of Switch 2 exclusives out now: Mario Kart World and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a $10 demo package that really should have been free. There are some new-to-Nintendo ports of excellent titles like Split Fiction and Cyberpunk 2077. You can get upgrades of classics like the last two Legend of Zelda adventures. And the Switch 2 is fully backward-compatible, so you can play everything that came out for the Switch as well as a substantial library of older titles.",
      "There\u2019s no other machine that will let you play future installments of beloved franchises like Zelda, Super Mario Bros., Super Smash Bros. and Animal Crossing. None of those have been announced yet, but some marquee names \u2014 Donkey Kong and Kirby \u2014 will star in Switch 2 exclusives later this year.",
      "There\u2019s plenty of competition out there, though, and not just in the TV-connected console market Switch shares with the PlayStation and the Xbox. Nintendo no longer has the portable market to itself, thanks to Valve\u2019s SteamDeck. Some models of that device cost less than the Switch 2, and it already has a huge library of PC games. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced over the weekend that it's teaming up with Asus on the ROG Xbox Ally, a handheld that will be out before Christmas.",
      "Honestly, we\u2019ll probably have a better idea of the Switch\u2019s quality a few years down the line, after developers get a handle on what the new hardware can do. If you\u2019re dying to get back behind the wheel with Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach right now, though, you know what you need to do.",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "A previous version of this story was corrected to say that the Switch 2 social options can be used without a subscription until March 31, 2026.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Amazon said Monday that it will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, including one it is building alongside a nuclear power plant that has drawn federal scrutiny over an arrangement to essentially plug right into the power plant.",
      "Kevin Miller, vice president of global data centers at Amazon\u2019s cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, told The Associated Press that the company will build another data center complex just north of Philadelphia.",
      "One data center is being built next to northeastern Pennsylvania's Susquehanna nuclear power plant. The other will be in Fairless Hills at a logistics campus, the Keystone Trade Center, on what was once a U.S. Steel mill.",
      "In a statement, Gov. Josh Shapiro called it the largest capital investment in Pennsylvania's history.",
      "The announcements add to the billions of dollars in Big Tech's data center cash already flowing into the state.",
      "Since 2024 started, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina as it ramps up its investment in infrastructure to compete with other tech giants to meet growing demand for artificial intelligence products.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "The majority owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant, Talen Energy, announced last year that it had sold its data center to Amazon for $650 million in a deal to eventually provide 960 megawatts. That's 40% of the output of one of the nation's largest nuclear power plants, or enough to power more than a half-million homes.",
      "However, the arrangement between Talen and Amazon \u2014 called a \u201cbehind the meter\u201d connection \u2014 has been held up by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the first such case to come before the agency.",
      "It has raised questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it\u2019s fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid.",
      "For Big Tech, plugging energy-hungry data centers directly into a power plant can take years off their development timelines and is a much faster route to procuring power than having to connect to the congested electricity grid.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on a procedural grounds, will decide the matter, leaving in limbo regulatory treatment of the deal and others that likely would follow.",
      "Already in Pennsylvania, Microsoft announced a deal with the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to restart the reactor under a 20-year agreement to supply its data centers in four states with energy.",
      "Meanwhile, the owners of what was once Pennsylvania\u2019s biggest coal-fired power plant say they will turn it into a $10 billion natural gas-powered data center campus.",

      "LONDON -- Getty Images is facing off against artificial intelligence company Stability AI in a London courtroom for the first major copyright trial of the generative AI industry.",
      "Opening arguments before a judge at the British High Court are scheduled for Monday. The trial could last for three weeks.",
      "Stability, based in London, owns a widely used AI image-making tool that sparked enthusiasm for the instant creation of AI artwork and photorealistic images upon its release in August 2022. OpenAI introduced its surprise hit chatbot ChatGPT three months later.",
      "Seattle-based Getty has argued that the development of the AI image maker, called Stable Diffusion, involved \u201cbrazen infringement\u201d of Getty\u2019s photography collection \u201con a staggering scale.\"",
      "Tech companies have long argued that \u201cfair use\u201d or \u201cfair dealing\u201d legal doctrines in the United States and United Kingdom allow them to train their AI systems on large troves of writings or images. Getty was among the first to challenge those practices when it filed copyright infringement lawsuits in the United States and the United Kingdom in early 2023.",
      "\u201cWhat Stability did was inappropriate,\u201d Getty CEO Craig Peters told The Associated Press in 2023. He said creators of intellectual property should be asked for permission before their works are fed into AI systems rather than having to participate in an \u201copt-out regime.\"",
      "Stability has argued that the case doesn't belong in the United Kingdom because the training of the AI model technically happened elsewhere, on computers run by U.S. tech giant Amazon.",
      "Similar cases in the U.S. have not yet gone to trial.",
      "Stable Diffusion\u2019s roots trace to Germany, where computer scientists at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich worked with the New York-based tech company Runway to develop the original algorithms. The university researchers credited Stability AI for providing the servers that trained the models, which require large amounts of computing power.",

      "After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech\u2019s pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple tried to regain its footing Monday during a developers conference that focused mostly on incremental advances and cosmetic changes in it...",
      "CUPERTINO, Calif. -- After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech\u2019s pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple tried to regain its footing Monday during an annual developers conference that focused mostly on incremental advances and cosmetic changes in its technology.",
      "The presummer rite, which attracted thousands of developers from nearly 60 countries to Apple's Silicon Valley headquarters, subdued compared with the feverish anticipation that surrounded the event in the last two years.",
      "Apple highlighted plans for more AI tools designed to simplify people's lives and make its products even more intuitive. It also provided an early glimpse at the biggest redesign of its iPhone software in a decade. In doing so, Apple executives refrained from issuing bold promises of breakthroughs that punctuated recent conferences, prompting CFRA analyst Angelo Zino to deride the event as a \u201cdud\u201d in a research note.",
      "In 2023, Apple unveiled a mixed-reality headset that has been little more than a niche product, and last year WWDC trumpeted its first major foray into the AI craze with an array of new features highlighted by the promise of a smarter and more versatile version of its virtual assistant, Siri \u2014 a goal that has yet to be realized.",
      "\u201cThis work needed more time to reach our high-quality bar,\u201d Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s top software executive, said Monday at the outset of the conference. The company didn't provide a precise timetable for when Siri's AI upgrade will be finished but indicated it won't happen until next year at the earliest.",
      "\"The silence surrounding Siri was deafening,\" said Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee said. \u201cNo amount of text corrections or cute emojis can fill the yawning void of an intuitive, interactive AI experience that we know Siri will be capable of when ready. We just don\u2019t know when that will happen. The end of the Siri runway is coming up fast, and Apple needs to lift off.\u201d",
      "The showcase unfolded amid nagging questions about whether Apple has lost some of the mystique and innovative drive that has made it a tech trendsetter during its nearly 50-year history.",
      "Instead of making a big splash as it did with the Vision Pro headset and its AI suite, Apple took a mostly low-key approach that emphasized its effort to spruce up the look of its software with a new design called \u201cLiquid Glass\" while also unveiling a new hub for its video games and new features like a \u201cWorkout Buddy\u201d to help manage physical fitness.",
      "Apple executives promised to make its software more compatible with the increasingly sophisticated computer chips that have been powering its products while also making it easier to toggle between the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.",
      "\u201cOur product experience has become even more seamless and enjoyable,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told the crowd as the 90-minute showcase wrapped up.",
      "IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo said Apple seemed to be largely using Monday's conference to demonstrate the company still has a blueprint for success in AI, even if it's going to take longer to realize the vision that was presented a year ago.",
      "\u201cThis year\u2019s event was not about disruptive innovation, but rather careful calibration, platform refinement and developer enablement \u2014positioning itself for future moves rather than unveiling game-changing technologies,\u201d Jeronimo said.",
      "Besides redesigning its software. Apple will switch to a method that automakers have used to telegraph their latest car models by linking them to the year after they first arrive at dealerships. That means the next version of the iPhone operating system due out this autumn will be known as iOS 26 instead of iOS 19 \u2014 as it would be under the previous naming approach that has been used since the device's 2007 debut.",
      "The iOS 26 upgrade is expected to be released in September around the same time Apple traditionally rolls out the next iPhone models.",
      "Apple opened the proceedings with a short video clip featuring Federighi speeding around a track in a Formula 1 race car. Although it was meant to promote the June 27 release of the Apple film, \u201cF1\u201d starring Brad Pitt, the segment could also be viewed as an unintentional analogy to the company's attempt to catch up to the rest of the pack in AI technology.",
      "While some of the new AI tricks compatible with the latest iPhones began rolling out late last year as part of free software updates, the delays in a souped-up Siri became so glaring that the chastened company stopped promoting it in its marketing campaigns earlier this year.",
      "While Apple has been struggling to make AI that meets its standards, the gap separating it from other tech powerhouses is widening. Google keeps packing more AI into its Pixel smartphone lineup while introducing more of the technology into its search engine to dramatically change the way it works. Samsung, Apple's biggest smartphone rival, is also leaning heavily into AI. Meanwhile, ChatGPT recently struck a deal that will bring former Apple design guru Jony Ive into the fold to work on a new device expected to compete against the iPhone.",
      "Besides grappling with innovation challenges, Apple also faces regulatory threats that could siphon away billions of dollars in revenue that help finance its research and development. A federal judge is currently weighing whether proposed countermeasures to Google's illegal monopoly in search should include a ban on long-running deals worth $20 billion annually to Apple while another federal judge recently banned the company from collecting commissions on in-app transactions processed outside its once-exclusive payment system.",
      "On top of all that, Apple has been caught in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump's trade war with China, a key manufacturing hub for the Cupertino, California, company. Cook successfully persuaded Trump to exempt the iPhone from tariffs during the president's first administration, but he has had less success during Trump's second term, which seems more determined to prod Apple to make its products in the U.S.",
      "The multidimensional gauntlet facing Apple is spooking investors, causing the company's stock price to plunge by 20% so far this year \u2014 a decline that has erased about $750 billion in shareholder wealth. After beginning the year as the most valuable company in the world, Apple now ranks third behind longtime rival Microsoft, another AI leader, and AI chipmaker Nvidia.",
      "Apple's shares closed down by more than 1% on Monday \u2014 an early indication the company's latest announcements didn't inspire investors.",

      "The crashes, which began late last year and carried into 2025, were the tipoff to a sophisticated cyberattack that may have allowed hackers to infiltrate a phone without a single click from the user.",
      "The attackers left no clues about their identities, but investigators at the cybersecurity firm iVerify noticed that the victims all had something in common: They worked in fields of interest to China's government and had been targeted by Chinese hackers in the past.",
      "Foreign hackers have increasingly identified smartphones, other mobile devices and the apps they use as a weak link in U.S. cyberdefenses. Groups linked to China's military and intelligence service have targeted the smartphones of prominent Americans and burrowed deep into telecommunication networks, according to national security and tech experts.",
      "It shows how vulnerable mobile devices and apps are and the risk that security failures could expose sensitive information or leave American interests open to cyberattack, those experts say.",
      "\u201cThe world is in a mobile security crisis right now,\u201d said Rocky Cole, a former cybersecurity expert at the National Security Agency and Google and now chief operations officer at iVerify. \u201cNo one is watching the phones.\u201d",

      "\u201cThey were able to listen in on phone calls in real time and able to read text messages,\u201d said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois. He is a member of the House Intelligence Committee and the senior Democrat on the Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, created to study the geopolitical threat from China.",
      "Chinese hackers also sought access to phones used by Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance during the 2024 campaign.",
      "The Chinese government has denied allegations of cyberespionage, and accused the U.S. of mounting its own cyberoperations. It says America cites national security as an excuse to issue sanctions against Chinese organizations and keep Chinese technology companies from the global market.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. has long been using all kinds of despicable methods to steal other countries\u2019 secrets,\u201d Lin Jian, a spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, said at a recent press conference in response to questions about a CIA push to recruit Chinese informants.",
      "U.S. intelligence officials have said China poses a significant, persistent threat to U.S. economic and political interests, and it has harnessed the tools of digital conflict: online propaganda and disinformation, artificial intelligence and cyber surveillance and espionage designed to deliver a significant advantage in any military conflict.",
      "Mobile networks are a top concern. The U.S. and many of its closest allies have banned Chinese telecom companies from their networks. Other countries, including Germany, are phasing out Chinese involvement because of security concerns. But Chinese tech firms remain a big part of the systems in many nations, giving state-controlled companies a global footprint they could exploit for cyberattacks, experts say.",
      "Chinese telecom firms still maintain some routing and cloud storage systems in the U.S. \u2014 a growing concern to lawmakers.",
      "\u201cThe American people deserve to know if Beijing is quietly using state-owned firms to infiltrate our critical infrastructure,\u201d U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich. and chairman of the China committee, which in April issued subpoenas to Chinese telecom companies seeking information about their U.S. operations.",
      "Mobile devices can buy stocks, launch drones and run power plants. Their proliferation has often outpaced their security.",
      "The phones of top government officials are especially valuable, containing sensitive government information, passwords and an insider's glimpse into policy discussions and decision-making.",
      "The White House said last week that someone impersonating Susie Wiles, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, reached out to governors, senators and business leaders with texts and phone calls.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how the person obtained Wiles\u2019 connections, but they apparently gained access to the contacts in her personal cellphone, The Wall Street Journal reported. The messages and calls were not coming from Wiles\u2019 number, the newspaper reported.",
      "While most smartphones and tablets come with robust security, apps and connected devices often lack these protections or the regular software updates needed to stay ahead of new threats. That makes every fitness tracker, baby monitor or smart appliance another potential foothold for hackers looking to penetrate networks, retrieve information or infect systems with malware.",
      "Federal officials launched a program this year creating a \u201ccyber trust mark\u201d for connected devices that meet federal security standards. But consumers and officials shouldn\u2019t lower their guard, said Snehal Antani, former chief technology officer for the Pentagon\u2019s Joint Special Operations Command.",

      "Democratic U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania fired off a letter to Kroger last fall demanding to know whether it would use its electronic labels as part of a dynamic pricing strategy.",
      "Lawmakers in Rhode Island and Maine have introduced bills to limit the use of digital labels. In Arizona, Democratic state Rep. Cesar Aguilar recently introduced a bill that would ban them altogether.",
      "The bill hasn\u2019t gotten a hearing, but Aguilar said he\u2019s determined to start a conversation about digital labels and how stores could abuse them.",
      "\u201cGrocery stores study when people go shopping the most. And so you might be able to see a price go down one day and then go up another day,\u201d Aguilar told The Associated Press.",
      "Researchers say those fears are misplaced. A study published in late May found \u201cvirtually no surge pricing\u201d before or after electronic shelf labels were adopted. The study was authored by Ioannis Stamatopoulos of the University of Texas, Austin, Robert Evan Sanders of the University of California, San Diego and Robert Bray of Northwestern University",
      "The researchers looked at prices between 2019 and 2024 at an unnamed grocery chain than began using digital labels in October 2022. They found that temporary price increases affected 0.005% of products on any given day before electronic shelf labels were introduced, a share that increased by only 0.0006 percentage points after digital labels were installed.",
      "The study also determined that discounts were slightly more common after digital labels were introduced.",
      "Economists have long wondered why grocery prices don\u2019t change more often, according to Stamatopoulos. If bananas are about to expire, for example, it makes sense to lower the price on them. He said the cost of having workers change prices by hand could be one issue.",
      "But there\u2019s another reason: Shoppers watch grocery prices closely, and stores don\u2019t want to risk angering them.",
      "\u201cSelling groceries is not selling a couch. It\u2019s not a one-time transaction and you will never see them again,\u201d Stamatopoulos said. \u201cYou want them coming to the store every week.\u201d",
      "Electronic price labels aren\u2019t new. They\u2019ve been in use for more than a decade at groceries in Europe and some U.S. retailers, like Kohl's.",
      "But they\u2019ve been slow to migrate to U.S. grocery stores. Only around 5% to 10% of U.S. supermarkets now have electronic labels, compared to 80% in Europe, said Amanda Oren, vice president of industry strategy for North American grocery at Relex Solutions, a technology company that helps retailers forecast demand.",
      "Oren said cost is one issue that has slowed the U.S. rollout. The tiny screens cost between $5 and $20, Oren said, but every product a store sells needs one, and the average supermarket has 100,000 or more individual products.",
      "Still, the U.S. industry is charging ahead. Walmart, the nation's largest grocer and retailer, hopes to have digital price labels at 2,300 U.S. stores by 2026. Kroger is expanding the use of digital labels this year after testing them at 20 stores. Whole Foods is testing the labels in nearly 50 stores.",
      "Companies say electronic price labels have tremendous advantages. Walmart says it used to take employees two days to change paper price labels on the 120,000 items it has in a typical store. With digital tags, it takes a few minutes.",
      "The labels can also be useful. Some have codes shoppers can scan to see recipes or nutrition information. Instacart has a system in thousands of U.S. stores, including Aldi and Schnucks, that flashes a light on the digital tag when Instacart shoppers are nearby to help them find products.",
      "Ahold Delhaize\u2019s Albert Heijn supermarket chain in the Netherlands and Belgium has been testing an artificial intelligence-enabled tool since 2022 that marks down prices on its digital labels every 15 minutes for products nearing expiration. The system has reduced more than 250 tons of food waste annually, the company said.",
      "But Warren and Casey are skeptical. In their letter to Kroger, the U.S. senators noted a partnership with Microsoft that planned to put cameras in grocery aisles and offer personalized deals to shoppers depending on their gender and age.",
      "In its response, Kroger said the prices shown on its digital labels were not connected to any sort of facial recognition technology. It also denied surging prices during periods of peak demand.",
      "\u201cKroger\u2019s business model is built on a foundation of lowering prices to attract more customers,\u201d the company said.",
      "Aguilar, the Arizona lawmaker, said he also opposes the transition to digital labels because he thinks they will cost jobs. His constituents have pointed out that grocery prices keep rising even though there are fewer workers in checkout lanes, he said.",
      "\u201cThey are supposed to be part of our community, and that means hiring people from our community that fill those jobs,\" Aguilar said.",
      "But Relex Solutions' Oren said she doesn't think cutting labor costs is the main reason stores deploy digital price tags.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about working smarter, not harder, and being able to use that labor in better ways across the store rather than these very mundane, repetitive tasks,\u201d she said.",

      "NEW YORK -- The world\u2019s richest man could lose billions in his fight with world\u2019s most powerful politician.",
      "The feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump could mean Tesla\u2019s plans for self-driving cars hit a roadblock, SpaceX flies fewer missions for NASA, Starlink gets fewer overseas satellite contracts and the social media platform X loses advertisers.",
      "Maybe, that is. It all depends on Trump\u2019s appetite for revenge and how the dispute unfolds.",
      "Joked Telemetry Insight auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid, \u201cSince Trump has no history of retaliating against perceived adversaries, he\u2019ll probably just let this pass.\u201d",
      "Turning serious, he sees trouble ahead for Musk.",
      "\u201cFor someone that rants so much about government pork, all of Elon\u2019s businesses are extremely dependent on government largesse, which makes him vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Trump and the federal government also stand to lose from a long-running dispute, but not as much as Musk.",
      "The dispute comes just a week before a planned test of Tesla\u2019s driverless taxis in Austin, Texas, a major event for the company because sales of its EVs are lagging in many markets, and Musk needs a win.",
      "Trump can mess things up for Tesla by encouraging federal safety regulators to step in at any sign of trouble for the robotaxis.",
      "Even before the war of words broke out on Thursday, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration requested data on how Musk\u2019s driverless, autonomous taxis will perform in low-visibility conditions. That request follows an investigation last year into 2.4 million Teslas equipped with full self-driving software after several accidents, including one that killed a pedestrian.",
      "A spokesman for NHTSA said the probe was ongoing and that the agency \"will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice has also probed the safety of Tesla cars, but the status of that investigation is unclear. The DOJ did not respond immediately to requests for comment.",
      "The promise of a self-driving future led by Tesla inspired shareholders to boost the stock by 50% in the weeks after Musk confirmed the Austin rollout. But on Thursday, the stock plunged more than 14% amid the Trump-Musk standoff. On Friday, it recovered a bit, bouncing back nearly 4%.",
      "\u201cTesla\u2019s recent rise was almost entirely driven by robotaxi enthusiasm,\" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \u201cElon\u2019s feud with Trump could be a negative.\u201d",
      "One often-overlooked but important part of Tesla\u2019s business that could take a hit is its sales of carbon credits.",
      "As Musk and Trump were slugging it out Thursday, Republican senators inserted new language into Trump\u2019s budget bill that would eliminate fines for gas-powered cars that fall short of fuel economy standards. Tesla has a thriving side business selling \u201cregulatory credits\u201d to other automakers to make up for their shortfalls.",
      "Musk has downplayed the importance of the credits business, but the changes would hurt Tesla as it reels from boycotts of its cars tied to Musk\u2019s time working for Trump.",
      "Credit sales jumped by a third to $595 million in the first three months of the year even as total revenue slumped.",
      "Musk\u2019s foray into right-wing politics cost Tesla sales among the environmentally minded consumers who embraced electric cars and led to boycotts of Tesla showrooms.",
      "If Musk has indeed ended his close association with Trump, those buyers could come back, but that\u2019s far from certain.",
      "Meanwhile, one analyst speculated earlier this year that Trump voters in so-called red counties could buy Teslas \u201cin a meaningful way.\u201d But he\u2019s now less hopeful.",
      "\u201cThere are more questions than answers following Thursday developments,\u201d TD Cowen\u2019s Itay Michaeli wrote in his latest report, \u201cand it\u2019s still too early to determine any lasting impacts.\u201d",
      "Michaeli\u2019s stock target for Tesla earlier this year was $388. He has since lowered it to $330. Tesla was trading Friday at $300.",
      "Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump said Thursday that he could cut government contracts to Musk\u2019s rocket company, SpaceX, a massive threat to a company that has received billions of federal dollars.",
      "The privately held company that is reportedly worth $350 billion provides launches, sends astronauts into space for NASA and has a contract to send a team from the space agency to the moon next year.",
      "But if Musk has a lot to lose, so does the U.S.",
      "SpaceX is the only U.S. company capable of transporting crews to and from the space station, using its four-person Dragon capsules. The other alternative is politically dicey: depending wholly on Russia's Soyuz capsules.",
      "Musk knew all this when he shot back at Trump that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft. But it is unclear how serious his threat was. Several hours later \u2014 in a reply to another X user \u2014 he said he wouldn\u2019t do it.",
      "A subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk\u2019s once-close relationship with the president.",
      "Musk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved Starlink for some services during a trip with Trump in the Middle East last month. The company has also won a string of other recent deals in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and elsewhere as Trump has threatened tariffs.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much politics played a role, and how much is pure business.",
      "On Friday, The Associated Press confirmed that India had approved a key license to Starlink. At least 40% of India\u2019s more than 1.4 billion people have no access to the internet.",
      "Big advertisers that fled X after Musk welcomed all manner of conspiracy theories to the social media platform have started to trickle back in recent months, possibly out of fear of a conservative backlash.",
      "Musk has called their decision to leave an \u201cillegal boycott\u201d and sued them, and the Trump administration recently weighed in with a Federal Trade Commission probe into possible coordination among them.",
      "Now advertisers may have to worry about a different danger.",
      "If Trump sours on X, \"there\u2019s a risk that it could again become politically radioactive for major brands,\u201d said Sarah Kreps, a political scientist at Cornell University. She added, though, that an \u201cexodus isn\u2019t obvious, and it would depend heavily on how the conflict escalates, how long it lasts and how it ends.\u201d",

      "Artificial Intelligence\u2019s use in filmmaking is growing",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Artificial intelligence 's use in movie making is exploding. And a young film festival, now in its junior year, is showcasing what this technology can do on screen today.",
      "The annual AI Film Festival organized by Runway, a company that specializes in AI-generated video, kicked off in New York Thursday night with ten short films from around the world making their debut on the big screen.",
      "\u201cThree years ago, this was such a crazy idea,\u201d Runway CEO Crist\u00f3bal Valenzuela told the crowd. \u201cToday, millions of people are making billions of videos using tools we only dreamed of.\u201d",
      "The film festival itself has grown significantly since its 2023 debut. About 300 people submitted films when it first began, Valenzuela said, compared to about 6,000 submissions received this year.",
      "The one and half-hour lineup stretched across a range of creative styles and ambitious themes \u2014 with Jacob Alder's \u201c Total Pixel Space \" taking home the festival's top prize. The 9-minute and 28-second film questions how many possible images \u2014 real or not \u2014 exist in the digital space, and uses math to calculate a colossal number. A stunning series of images, ranging from the familiar life moments to those that completely bend reality, gives viewers a glimpse of what's out there.",
      "Meanwhile, Andrew Salter's \u201cJailbird,\" which snagged second place, chronicles a chicken's journey \u2014 from the bird's perspective \u2014 to a human prison in the United Kingdom to take part in a joint-rehabilitation program. And \u201cOne,\u201d a futuristic story by Ricardo Villavicencio and Edward Saatchi about interplanetary travel followed in third place.",
      "The 10 films shown were finalists selected from thousands submitted to Runway's AI Film Festival this year. The shorts will also be shown at screenings held in Los Angeles and Paris next week.",
      "How AI is used and executed is a factor judges evaluate when determining festival winners. But not every film entered was made entirely using AI. While submission criteria requires each movie include the use of AI-generated video, there's no set threshold, meaning some films can take a more \u201cmixed media\u201d approach \u2014 such as combining live shots of actors or real-life images and sounds with AI-generated elements.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to encourage people to explore and experiment with it,\u201d Valenzuela said in an interview prior to Thursday's screening.",
      "Creating a coherent film using generative AI is no easy feat. It can take a long list of directions and numerous, detailed prompts to get even a short scene to make sense and look consistent. Still, the scope of what this kind of technology can do has grown significantly since Runway's first AI Film Festival in 2023 \u2014 and Valenzuela says that's reflected in today's submissions. While there are still limits, AI-generated video is becoming more and more life-like and realistic.",
      "Runway encourages the use of its own AI tools for films entered into its festival, but creators are also allowed to turn to other resources and tools as they put together the films \u2014 and across the industry, tools that use AI to create videos spanning from text, image and/or audio prompts have rapidly improved over recent years, while becoming increasingly available.",
      "\u201cThe way (this technology) has lived within film and media culture, and pop culture, has really accelerated,\u201d said Joshua Glick, an associate professor of film and electronic arts at Bard College.",
      "He adds that Runway's film fest, which is among a handful of showcases aimed at spotlighting AI's creative capabilities, arrives as companies in this space are searching for heightened \u201clegitimacy and recognition\u201d for the tools they are creating \u2014 with aims to cement partnerships in Hollywood as a result.",
      "AI's presence in Hollywood is already far-reaching, and perhaps more expansive than many moviegoers realize. Beyond \u201cheadline-grabbing\u201d (and at times controversial) applications that big-budget films have done to \u201cde-age\u201d actors or create eye-catching stunts, Glick notes, this technology is often incorporated in an array of post-production editing, digital touch-ups and additional behind-the-scenes work like sorting footage.",
      "Industry executives repeatedly point to how AI can improve efficiency in the movie making process \u2014 allowing creatives to perform a task that once took hours, for example, in a matter of minutes \u2014 and foster further innovation.",
      "Still, AI's rapid growth and adoption has also heightened anxieties around the burgeoning technology \u2014 notably its implications for workers.",
      "The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees \u2014 which represents behind-the-scenes entertainment workers in the U.S. and Canada \u2014 has \u201clong embraced new technologies that enhance storytelling,\u201d Vanessa Holtgrewe, IATSE's international vice president, said in an emailed statement. \u201cBut we\u2019ve also been clear: AI must not be used to undermine workers\u2019 rights or livelihoods.\u201d",
      "IATSE and other unions have continued to meet with major studios and establish provisions in efforts to provide guardrails around the use of AI. The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists has also been vocal about AI protections for its members, a key sticking point in recent labor actions.",
      "For Runway's AI Film Festival, Valenzuela hopes screening films that incorporate AI-generated video can showcase what's possible \u2014 and how he says this technology can help, not hurt, creatives in the work they do today.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s natural to fear change ... (But) it's important to understand what you can do with it,\" Valenzuela said. Even filmmaking, he adds, was born \u201cbecause of scientific breakthroughs that at the time were very uncomfortable for many people.\"",

      "LONDON -- Amazon has pledged to beef up fight against fake reviews, Britain's competition regulator said Friday after an investigation into whether big online platforms are doing enough to crack down on phony online ratings for products and services.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority said it secured the \u201cundertakings\u201d from Amazon, after getting a similar agreement earlier this year from Google to clamp down on rogue reviews plaguing the internet.",
      "The company promised to strengthen its existing systems for fighting fake reviews. It will also tackle catalog abuse, which involves sellers boosting star ratings for a product by hijacking good reviews from a completely different one.",
      "As an example, a shopper might come across a pair of headphones with a five-star rating. But, after looking closer, most of the reviews are for a mobile phone charger, the watchdog said.",
      "As part of its commitments, Amazon has agreed to sanction anyone caught using these tactics. Businesses could be banned from selling on the Amazon website and users posting fake reviews could be banned from posting them, the CMA said.",
      "The watchdog's chief executive, Sarah Cardell, said that so many people shop on Amazon and \u201cstar ratings and reviews have a huge impact on their choices.\u201d",
      "Amazon's pledges \u201cmean people can make decisions with greater confidence \u2013 knowing that those who seek to pull the wool over their eyes will be swiftly dealt with.\u201d",

      "The CMA opened its investigations into Amazon and Google in 2021 to examine whether the two companies broke U.K. consumer law by failing to protect shoppers. It began looking into phony reviews on some big websites amid the boom in online shopping fueled by the coronavirus pandemic.",

      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation\u2019s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans\u2019 health.",
      "Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products \u2014 including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service \u2014 in ways that put money in her own pocket.",
      "A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses.",
      "In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.",
      "Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn\u2019t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a \u201cmaterial connection\u201d to a product they promote.",
      "Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.",
      "\u201cI fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.",
      "The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users\u2019 glucose levels, could benefit from this administration\u2019s health guidance and policy.",
      "Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.",
      "The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being \u201cbought off\u201d or \u201ccorrupt\u201d because of ties to industry.",
      "Means' use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.",
      "Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.",
      "\u201cDuring my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,\u201d she wrote on her website.",
      "Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.",
      "Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.",
      "\u201cAt the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we\u2019re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we\u2019d want it,\u201d she said on Megyn Kelly's podcast last year.",
      "But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.",
      "During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn\u2019t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.",
      "Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to \u201cencompass more and more of our lives,\u201d said Emily Hund, author of \u201cThe Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.\u201d",
      "With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.",
      "Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don\u2019t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.",
      "\u201cA lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,\u201d said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don\u2019t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.",
      "Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.",
      "Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, \u201cGood Energy\"; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.",
      "She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included \u201caffiliate\u201d or \u201cpartner\u201d coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a \u201cmetabolic health collection.\u201d",
      "On a \u201cMy Faves\u201d page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links \u201care affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.\u201d",
      "It's not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.",
      "Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast \u201cLet\u2019s Be Honest\u201d that \u201crelationships are influential.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,\" Means said. \"We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.\u201d",
      "In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was \u201cinsanity\u201d to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, \u201cWe need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren\u2019t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.\u201d",

      "Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a \u201cClean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations\u201d guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales.",
      "Means has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company.",
      "Means also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an \u201cInvestor and/or Advisor.\u201d The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship.",
      "Though the \u201cAbout\u201d page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that\u2019s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it.",
      "Representatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives' LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil's founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means' business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it.

      "\u201cI am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,\u201d Niazi said in an email.",

      "Means isn\u2019t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.",
      "Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job \u2014 among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group.

      "Elon Musk is threatening to decommission a capsule used to take astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station for NASA",
      "As President Donald Trump and Elon Musk argued on social media on Thursday, the world's richest man threatened to decommission a space capsule used to take astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station.",
      "After Trump threatened to cut government contracts given to Musk's SpaceX rocket company and his Starlink internet satellite services, Musk responded via X that SpaceX \"will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.\u201d",
      "It's unclear how serious Musk's threat was. But the capsule, developed with the help of government contracts, is an important part of keeping the space station running. NASA also relies heavily on SpaceX for other programs including launching science missions and, later this decade, returning astronauts to the surface of the moon.",
      "SpaceX is the only U.S. company capable right now of transporting crews to and from the space station, using its four-person Dragon capsules.",
      "Boeing\u2019s Starliner capsule has flown astronauts only once; last year\u2019s test flight went so badly that the two NASA astronauts had to hitch a ride back to Earth via SpaceX in March, more than nine months after launching last June.",
      "Starliner remains grounded as NASA decides whether to go with another test flight with cargo, rather than a crew.",
      "SpaceX also uses a Dragon capsule for its own privately run missions. The next one of those is due to fly next week on a trip chartered by Axiom Space, a Houston company.",
      "Cargo versions of the Dragon capsule are also used to ferry food and other supplies to the orbiting lab.",
      "Russia\u2019s Soyuz capsules are the only other means of getting crews to the space station right now.",
      "The Soyuz capsules hold three people at a time. For now, each Soyuz launch carries two Russians and one NASA astronaut, and each SpaceX launch has one Russian on board under a barter system. That way, in an emergency requiring a capsule to return, there is always someone from the U.S. and Russian on board.",
      "With its first crew launch for NASA in 2020 \u2014 the first orbital flight of a crew by a private company \u2014 SpaceX enabled NASA to reduce its reliance on Russia for crew transport. The Russian flights had been costing the U.S. tens of millions of dollars per seat, for years.",
      "NASA has also used Russian spacecraft for cargo, along with U.S. contractor Northrup Grumman.",
      "The company has used its rockets to launch several science missions for NASA as well as military equipment.",
      "Last year, SpaceX also won a NASA contract to help bring the space station out of orbit when it is no longer usable.",
      "SpaceX\u2019s Starship mega rocket is what NASA has picked to get astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface of the moon, at least for the first two landing missions. Starship made its ninth test flight last week from Texas, but tumbled out of control and broke apart.",

      "Shares of Elon Musk\u2019s electric vehicle maker fell sharply Thursday as investors fear his dispute with President Donald Trump could end up hurting the company",
      "Investors bought hundreds of billions of dollars of Tesla stock after Donald Trump was elected on a bet that politics were more important than profits.",
      "In three hours Thursday, they learned yet again how dangerous that gamble could be.",
      "Shares of Elon Musk\u2019s electric vehicle maker plunged more than 14% in a stunning wipeout as investors dumped holdings amid a bitter war of words between the president and the world's richest man. By the end of the trading day, $150 billion of Tesla's value had been erased, more than what it would take to buy all the shares of Starbucks and hundreds of other big publicly traded U.S. companies.",
      "In after-hours trading, Tesla shares rose 0.8%.",
      "The disagreement started over the president's budget bill, then quickly turned nasty. After Musk said that Trump wouldn't haven't gotten elected without his help, Trump implied that he may turn the federal government against his companies, including Tesla and SpaceX.",
      "\u201cThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,\u201d Trump wrote on his social messaging service Truth Social. \u201cI was always surprised that Biden didn\u2019t do it!\u201d",
      "The drop on Thursday partially reversed a big runup in the eight weeks since Musk confirmed that Tesla would be testing an autonomous, driverless \u201crobotaxi\u201d service in Austin, Texas, this month.",
      "Investors fear Trump might not be in such a rush to usher in a future of self-driving cars in the U.S., and that could slam Tesla. So much of its real business selling electric cars is struggling now and so it needs the promise of a new age of driverless cars to be realized\u2014 and fast.",
      "\u201cThe whole goal of robotaxis is to have them in 20 or 25 cities next year,\" said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, one of Tesla's biggest fans, but now worried. \"If you start to heighten the regulatory environment, that could delay that path.\u201d",
      "He added, \"There is a fear that Trump is not going to play Mr. Nice Guy.\u201d",
      "Trump's threat to cut government contracts seems targeted more to another of Musk's businesses, SpaceX, than his car company. The privately held rocket company has received billions of dollars for sending astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, providing launches and doing other work for NASA. The company is currently racing to develop a mega rocket for the space agency to send astronauts to moon next year.",
      "A subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk's once-close relationship with the president.",
      "On a trip with Trump to the Middle East last month, Musk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved Starlink for aviation and maritime use. Though its not clear how much politics has played a role, a string of other recent deals in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and elsewhere has come as Trump has threatened tariffs and sent diplomats scrambling to please the president.",
      "One measure of SpaceX's success: A private financing round followed by a private sale of shares in recent months reportedly valued it at an $350 billion, up from an estimated $210 billion a year ago.",
      "Now all that is possibly in danger. Tesla shares got even a bigger lift from Musk's close relationship with Trump, initially at least.",
      "After the presidential election in November, investors rushed into the stock, adding more than $450 billion to its value in a few weeks. The belief was that the company would see big riches as Trump eased regulatory oversight of Tesla. They also were betting that the new administration would embrace Musk's plans for millions of cars on U.S. roads without drivers behind the wheel.",
      "After hitting an all-time high on Dec. 17, the shares retreated as Musk\u2019s time as head of a government cost-cutting group led to boycotts and a hit to Tesla's reputation. They've recently popped higher again after Musk vowed to focus more on Tesla and its upcoming driverless taxi launch.",
      "Now investors aren't so sure, a worry that has translated into big paper losses in Tesla stock held by Musk personally \u2014 down $20 billion for the day.",

    "story": [
      "A study published in the academic journal Science has found that cutting off the horns of rhinos in Africa leads to a reduction in poaching of the endangered species",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- Cutting off the horns of sedated rhinos with a chainsaw has been viewed by wildlife conservationists in Africa for more than 30 years as a necessary evil to save the iconic endangered species from poaching.",
      "They hoped the drastic action was working, but evidence was scarce.",
      "Now, a study published Thursday in the academic journal Science has found that dehorning rhinos has led to a large reduction in poaching in game reserves in and around the Kruger National Park in northern South Africa \u2014 an area that's home to 25% of the world's rhinos and is especially vulnerable to poaching.",
      "The results of the seven-year study that ended in 2023 are seen as long-awaited evidence that removing rhinos' horns \u2014 which needs to be done every one to two years because they grow back \u2014 helps them survive, even if the animals lose part of their makeup.",
      "The conclusions seem obvious. Lucrative illegal markets in parts of southeast Asia and China crave rhino horns for use in traditional medicines, and removing the rhinos' horns take away what poachers are after.",
      "But Tim Kuiper, a biodiversity scientist at South Africa's Nelson Mandela University and the lead author of the study, said it was new to have long-term data from multiple sites on dehorning rhinos. He said the study, conducted between January 2017 and December 2023, focused on 11 reserves in the Kruger area and compared data from eight that dehorned their rhinos against the three that didn't.",
      "It also analyzed data from the reserves before and after they dehorned their rhinos.",
      "The study showed that dehorning consistently reduced poaching, Kuiper said. It found that the dehorning of more than 2,000 rhinos resulted in a 78% reduction in poaching in those eight reserves, providing some confirmation that such an invasive intervention was worth it.",
      "\u201cIt is a big part of what a rhino is, having a horn,\u201d Kuiper said. \u201cSo having to remove it is kind of a necessary evil, if I can put it that way. But it\u2019s very effective. There\u2019s no doubt it saved hundreds of rhinos' lives.\u201d",
      "South Africa has the largest numbers of black and white rhinos. Namibia, Zimbabwe and Kenya also have significant populations. There are around 17,500 white rhinos and 6,500 black rhinos left in the world, with black rhino numbers reduced from 70,000 in 1970 to less than 2,500 by the time poaching reached a crisis point in the mid-1990s, according to the Save the Rhino organization.",
      "Dehorning rhinos started in southern Africa as early as 1989. It has not been accepted without question.",
      "There has been opposition from animal rights activists but also questions from conservationists over what impact it has on a rhino's wellbeing, and what a future might look like with more hornless rhinos.",
      "Vanessa Duthe, a rhino researcher in South Africa not involved in the study, said rhinos use their horns to defend themselves against predators, to compete for territory and, in the case of black rhinos, to look for food. There is also evidence that dehorned rhinos adjust their movements to live in smaller ranges, she said.",
      "She said conservationists don't know the full impacts of dehorning, but research had found it had no adverse effect on rhinos' breeding rates or mortality rates.",
      "\u201cWhat we do know is that the benefits of dehorning by far outweigh any ecological cost that we\u2019re aware of today,\u201d Duthe said. She said dehorning a rhino now takes around 10 minutes and the process causes minimum distress. Blindfolds and earmuffs are put on sedated rhinos during dehorning, which also provides an opportunity to microchip rhinos and collect samples that aid research.",
      "Conservationists agree that dehorning alone will not end rhino poaching and Kuiper said he saw it as a short-to-mid-term solution. Other efforts like more effective law enforcement and better support for game rangers on the frontline are key.",
      "While South Africa has helped pull rhinos back from the threat of extinction, more than 400 rhinos a year are still killed by poachers in the country.",
      "The dehorning study was a collaboration between scientists from three South African universities, Oxford University in England and game reserve managers and rangers. It also involved the South African National Parks department, the World Wildlife Fund and the Rhino Recovery Fund.",

      "Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body",
      "WASHINGTON -- Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body. Today, they account for 26%.",
      "Like other prestigious U.S. universities, Harvard for years has been cashing in on its global cache to recruit the world\u2019s best students. Now, the booming international enrollment has left colleges vulnerable to a new line of attack from President Donald Trump. The president has begun to use his control over the nation\u2019s borders as leverage in his fight to reshape American higher education.",
      "Trump\u2019s latest salvo against Harvard uses a broad federal law to bar foreign students from entering the country to attend the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His proclamation applies only to Harvard, and a federal judge late Thursday temporarily blocked it. But Trump's order poses a threat to other universities his administration has targeted as hotbeds of liberalism in need of reform.",
      "It\u2019s rattling campuses under federal scrutiny, including Columbia University, where foreign students make up 40% of the campus. As the Trump administration stepped up reviews of new student visas last week, a group of Columbia faculty and alumni raised concerns over Trump\u2019s gatekeeping powers.",
      "\u201cColumbia\u2019s exposure to this \u2018stroke of pen\u2019 risk is uniquely high,\u201d the Stand Columbia Society wrote in a newsletter.",
      "People from other countries made up about 6% of all college students in the U.S. in 2023, but they accounted for 27% of the eight schools in the Ivy League, according to an Associated Press analysis of Education Department data. Columbia\u2019s 40% was the largest concentration, followed by Harvard and Cornell at about 25%. Brown University had the smallest share at 20%.",
      "Other highly selective private universities have seen similar trends, including at Northeastern University and New York University, which each saw foreign enrollment double between 2013 and 2023. Growth at public universities has been more muted. Even at the 50 most selective public schools, foreign students account for about 11% of the student body.",
      "As the middle class has grown in other countries, more families have been able to afford test prep and admissions guidance to compete for spots in the Ivy League, said Rajika Bhandari, who leads a firm of higher education consultants.",
      "\u201cThe Ivy League brand is very strong overseas, especially in countries like India and China, where families are extremely brand-aware of top institutions in the U.S. and other competing countries,\u201d Bhandari said in an email.",
      "Over the last two decades, she said, U.S. universities have increasingly recognized the benefits of international exchange, seeing it as a crucial revenue source that subsidizes U.S. students and keeps enrollments up in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and math.",
      "America\u2019s universities have been widening their doors to foreign students for decades, but the numbers shot upward starting around 2008, as Chinese students came to U.S. universities in rising numbers.",
      "It was part of a \u201cgold rush\u201d in higher education, said William Brustein, who orchestrated the international expansion of several universities.",
      "\u201cWhether you were private or you were public, you had to be out in front in terms of being able to claim you were the most global university,\" said Brustein, who led efforts at Ohio State University and West Virginia University.",
      "The race was driven in part by economics, he said. Foreign students typically aren\u2019t eligible for financial aid and, at some schools, they pay much higher tuition than their American counterparts. Colleges also were eyeing global rankings that gave schools a boost if they recruited larger numbers of foreign students and scholars, he said.",
      "Some wealthier universities \u2014 including Harvard \u2014 offer financial aid to foreign students. But students who get into those top-tier U.S. universities often have the means to pay higher tuition rates, Brustein said. That provides further incentive to enroll more foreign students, he said, saving more scholarship money for American students.",
      "Still, international enrollment didn't expand equally across all types of colleges. Public universities often face pressure from state lawmakers to limit foreign enrollment and keep more seats open for state residents. Private universities don\u2019t face that pressure, and many aggressively recruited foreign students as their enrollment of U.S. students stayed flat. The college-going rate among American students has changed little for decades, and some have been turned off on college by rising costs and student debt loads.",
      "Proponents of international exchange say foreign students pour billions of dollars into the U.S. economy, and many go on to support the nation\u2019s tech industry and other fields in need of skilled workers. Most international students study STEM fields.",
      "In the Ivy League, most international growth has been at the graduate level, while undergraduate numbers have seen more modest increases. Foreign graduate students make up more than half the students at Harvard\u2019s government and design schools, along with five of Columbia\u2019s schools.",
      "Harvard's undergraduate foreign population increased by about 100 students from 2013 to 2023, while graduate numbers increased by nearly 2,000. Part of that growth can be explained by increasing global competition at the graduate level, said William Kirby, a historian at Harvard who has written about the evolution of higher education.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t recruit the very best students internationally in your most important graduate programs, particularly in science and engineering, then you will not be competitive,\" Kirby said.",
      "The Ivy League has been able to outpace other schools in large part because of its reputation, Brustein said. He recalls trips to China and India, where he spoke with families that could recite where each Ivy League school sat in world rankings.",
      "\u201cThat was the golden calf for these families. They really thought, \u2018If we could just get into these schools, the rest of our lives would be on easy street,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Last week, Trump said he thought Harvard should cap its foreign students to about 15%.",
      "\u201cWe have people who want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can\u2019t get in because we have foreign students there,\u201d Trump said at a news conference.",
      "The university called Trump's latest action banning entry into the country to attend Harvard \u201cyet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard\u2019s First Amendment rights.\u201d",
      "In a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration\u2019s previous attempt to block international students at Harvard, the university said its foreign student population was the result of \u201ca painstaking, decades-long project\u201d to attract the most qualified international students. Losing access to student visas would immediately harm the school\u2019s mission and reputation, it said.",
      "\u201cIn our interconnected global economy,\" the school said, \u201ca university that cannot welcome students from all corners of the world is at a competitive disadvantage.\u201d",

      "In a sign of how much politics is driving the confrontation, Trump, when asked on Monday afternoon by ABC News what crime Newsom has committed to warrant his arrest, Trump said the governor's \"primary crime is running for governor because he's done such a bad job.\" Newsom responded on X, \"Donald Trump admits he will arrest a sitting governor simply because he ran for office.\"",
      "With the protests, Trump, who has characterized them as \"violent, insurrectionist mobs\" and \"Gavin Newscum inspired Riots,\" has deployed National Guard members to Los Angeles. Newsom has asked the administration to rescind the deployment and said Monday that he is suing the Trump administration, claiming Trump illegally federalized the National Guard.",

      "\"The very incompetent 'Governor,' Gavin Newscum, and 'Mayor,' Karen Bass, should be saying, 'THANK YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOU ARE SO WONDERFUL. WE WOULD BE NOTHING WITHOUT YOU, SIR,'\" Trump wrote on his social media platform on Monday. \"Instead, they choose to lie to the People of California and America by saying that we weren't needed, and that these are 'peaceful protests.'\"",

      "Protests in Los Angeles are entering their fourth day over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.",
      "President Donald Trump, over the weekend, called protesters \"violent, insurrectionist mobs\" after he deployed the National Guard despite objections from California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "The escalatory step is prompting a host of legal questions, including how far Trump is willing to go to use his authority to curb protests over his administration's immigration raids.",
      "On Sunday, Trump was asked by ABC News Senior Political Correspondent Rachel Scott if he is prepared to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act. The last time the act was used was in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots.",
      "\"Depends on whether or not there is an insurrection,\" Trump replied.",
      "When asked by Scott if he thought an insurrection was taking place in Los Angeles, Trump replied, \u201cNo, no. But you have violent people, and we are not going to let them get away with it,\" Trump said at the time. But by Sunday night, he was referring to the protesters on his Truth Social platform as \u201cviolent, insurrectionist mobs\u201d and \u201cpaid insurrectionists.\u201d",
      "Asked to define insurrection, Trump said, \"You actually really just have to look at the site to see what's happening.\"",
      "Trump notably did not rule out sending active-duty Marines to California after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said they were standing by. A U.S. official confirmed on Monday afternoon that 700 Marines from Twentynine Palms, California, have been ordered to assist in Los Angeles.",
      "The bar for sending active-duty Marines? \"The bar is what I think is,\" Trump had said on Sunday.",
      "What to know about the Insurrection Act",
      "Generally, the use of federal troops on U.S. soil is mostly prohibited. The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act limits the military from being involved in civilian law enforcement unless Congress approves it or under circumstances \"expressly authorized by the Constitution.\"",
      "One exception is the Insurrection Act, a 218-year-old law signed by President Thomas Jefferson.",
      "The Insurrection Act states, in part: \"Whenever there is an insurrection in any State against its government, the President may, upon the request of its legislature or of its governor if the legislature cannot be convened, call into Federal service such of the militia of the other States, in the number requested by that State, and use such of the armed forces, as he considers necessary to suppress the insurrection.\"",
      "Another provision states it can be used \"whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States in any State by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings.\"",
      "Some legal experts have warned the law is overly broad and vague, and there have been various calls for it to be reformed to provide greater checks on presidential power.",
      "The Insurrection Act has been invoked in response to 30 crises over its history, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, including presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy to desegregate schools after the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education",
      "Most of its uses involved federal troops being deployed, though a few situations were resolved after troops were ordered to respond but before they arrived on the scene, the Brennan Center noted.",
      "When it was last used in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush to send the National Guard to Los Angeles, it was at the request of then-Gov. Pete Wilson as riots exploded in the city after the acquittal of four white police officers charged in the beating of Rodney King.",
      "If Trump were to invoke the act, he would likely be doing so against Newsom's wishes -- something that hasn't been done since President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960s to deal with civil unrest.",
      "How Trump mobilized the National Guard",
      "Trump did not invoke the Insurrection Act when he activated and deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles.",
      "Instead, he cited Title 10 of the U.S. Code -- which contains a provision that allows the president to call on federal service members when there \"is a rebellion or danger of rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States\" or when \"the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "According to a presidential memorandum, Trump said he was sending National Guard to \"temporarily protect ICE and other United States Government personnel who are performing Federal functions, including the enforcement of Federal law, and to protect Federal property, at locations where protests against these functions are occurring or are likely to occur based on current threat assessments and planned operations.\"",
      "The memo stated that 2,000 National Guard troops could be deployed for 60 days or \"at the discretion\" of Hegseth.",
      "Troops called up under Title 10 fall generally are prevented from direct involvement in law enforcement duties under the Posse Comitatus Act, unless Trump invokes the Insurrection Act or other limited exceptions apply.",
      "Gov. Newsom said on Monday the state is suing the administration over Trump deploying the National Guard.",
      "\"He flamed the fires and illegally acted to federalize the National Guard,\" Newsom wrote on social media. \"The order he signed doesn\u2019t just apply to CA. It will allow him to go into ANY STATE and do the same thing. We\u2019re suing him.\"",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump defended his decision to send the National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quash protests.",
    "story": [
      "\"He flamed the fires,\" Gov. Newsom said of Trump.",
      "President Donald Trump defended his decision to send the National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quash protests that turned violent, saying in a social media post on Sunday that \"if we had not done so, Los Angeles would have been completely obliterated.\"",
      "Trump alleged the nation's second largest city, which covers more than 500 square miles, had been \"invaded and occupied by illegal aliens and criminals\" and that he had directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi to coordinate with all relevant agencies to \"take all such actions necessary to liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion, and put an end to these Migrant riots.\"",
      "While Trump has painted Los Angeles as being under siege and out of control, most of the demonstrations this past weekend over his administration's crackdown on illegal immigration has been concentrated in downtown Los Angeles near the federal building and federal detention center. Other protests have also occurred outside of the downtown area, one in the Los Angeles County city of Paramount, about 14 miles from downtown, and another in Compton, which is next to Paramount, and about 12 miles from downtown LA, according to local law enforcement.",
      "Meanwhile the rest of Los Angeles appeared to go about life as normal over the weekend. The city's annual Pride Parade even took place on Sunday without incident in Hollywood about 7 miles from downtown.",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom have accused Trump of making sensational public claims about how widespread the violence has been, and both have said the Los Angeles police and sheriff's departments could handle the unrest on their own.",
      "\"He flamed the fires and illegally acted\" by mobilizing the National Guard to go to LA without the conscent of local and state officials, Newsom said of the president in a statement on Monday posted on social media. \"The order he signed doesn\u2019t just apply to CA. It will allow him to go into ANY STATE and do the same thing. We\u2019re suing him.\"",
      "On Monday, a U.S. official confirmed that 700 Marines in California have been ordered to assist in Los Angeles and they\u2019re expected to arrive over the next 24 hours, a U.S. official confirmed.",
      "LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell has decried the escalation of violence during the protests, saying officers had been targeted with Molotov cocktails, fireworks and rocks.",
      "But he also said Monday that the arrival of the military troops in Los Angeles \"presents a significant logistical and operation challenge for those of us charged with safeguarding this city.\"",
      "\"The Los Angeles Police Department, alongside our mutual aid partners, has decades of experience managing large-scale public demonstrations, and we remain confident in our ability to do so professionally and effectively. That said, our top priority is the safety of both the public and the officers on the ground,\" McDonnell said.",
      "At a news conference Monday evening, as the protests entered their fourth night -- with some tense confrontations between protesters and police leading to the firing of less lethal munitions by police -- Bass insisted the city could handle the unrest on its own.",
      "Asked about the deployment of the Marines, Bass responded incredulously.",
      "\"We didn't need the National Guard,\" she told reporters. \"Why on earth -- what are they going to do? Do you know what the National Guard is doing now? They are guarding two buildings. They're guarding the federal building here in downtown and they're guarding the federal building in Westwood. That's what they're doing. So they need Marines on top of it, I don't understand that.\"",
      "Trump bypassed Newsom and activated 2,100 California National Guard troops, including 1,700 on the ground in Los Angeles as of Monday night and the remainder on standby to be sent there, the U.S. Northern Command said in a social media post late Monday night. It marks the first time a president has mobilized troops without a governor's consent since President Lyndon B. Johnson did so in 1965, when he sent National Guard troops to Alabama to protect civil rights activists marching from Selma to Montgomery.",
      "Protest erupts",
      "The protests erupted on Friday in downtown Los Angeles after word filtered into the community that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were conducting raids on multiple locations in the downtown area without the consent of city officials, including a Home Depot in the Westlake neighborhood near downtown. The raids resulted in the arrests of 40 people, 35 of them Mexican citizens, Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Sunday.",
      "Dozens of protesters began gathering in the Fashion District of downtown, where one of the raids occurred at an apparel business, officials said. Around 3 p.m. local time on Friday, aerial footage taken by ABC Los Angeles station KABC, showed what appeared to be ICE agents loading two white vans with people in handcuffs. As the vans left the apparel business, protesters tried unsuccessfully to stop them, including one individual who was seen lying down in the path of one of the vans.",
      "As the raids were unfolding on Friday, Mayor Bass, issued a post on X, condemning ICE's actions, writing, \"we will not stand for this.\"",
      "Around 6 p.m. on Friday, crowds gathered outside the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building and the U.S. Courthouse downtown and began vandalizing the buildings, spay painting profanities directed at ICE on the facade and clashing with ICE agents. Federal authorities asked the LAPD to assist around 6:30 p.m., but it took city officers about an hour to arrive at the scene due to \"significant traffic congestions, and the presence of demonstrators, and notably, by the fact that federal agents had deployed irritants into the crowd prior to LAPD's arrival.\"",
      "The LAPD declared the protest an \"unlawful assembly\" soon after officers arrived on scene on Friday night, writing on social media that \"officers are reporting that a small group of violent individuals are throwing large pieces of concrete\" and warning protesters that \"the use of less lethal munitions has been authorized by the Incident Commander\" to disperse the crowd.",
      "\"Within 55 minutes of receiving the call, we began to disperse the hostile and riotous crowd,\" the LAPD said.",
      "Video showed police in riot gear confronting protesters with batons and firing what appeared to be tear gas canisters and flash bangs at the demonstators.",
      "Demonstration moves to Paramount",
      "On Saturday, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department received calls around 10:15 a.m. that a \"significant\" crowd was gathering in Paramount and obstructing traffic and that deputies observed the presence of federal agents in the area.",
      "\"As the situation escalated, the crowd of protesters became increasingly agitated, throwing objects and exhibiting violent behavior toward federal agents and deputy sheriffs,\" the sheriff's department said in a statement. \"In response, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department (LASD) requested additional resources countywide, deploying additional deputies to maintain order.\"",
      "The sheriff's department said it responded to the scene to protect federal agents under attack, but emphasized, \"This does not mean that we are assisting with their immigration actions or operations.\"",
      "Bass said that there were no ICE raids in Paramount or anywhere else in Los Angeles County on Saturday. She said the building that protesters gathered near was being used as a staging area for federal resources.",
      "Around the same time, a protest broke out in neighboring Compton, where a vehicle was set ablaze in the street near the iconic Dale's Donuts sign, according to video taken at the scene.",
      "The LAPD said 29 people were arrested during Saturday's protest, mostly for failing to disperse, but overall it said in a statement that demonstrations across the city of Los Angeles on Saturday \"remained peaceful, and we commend all those who exercised their First Amendment rights responsibly.\"",
      "Trump deploys National Guard",
      "On Saturday night, Trump signed a presidential memorandum authorizing the deployment of National Guard members to Los Angeles, saying it was necessary to \"address the lawlessness\" in Los Angeles.",
      "Newsom called Trump's move, \"purposely inflammatory and will only escalate tensions.\"",
      "Bass agreed and issued a plea to the White House to reverse the decision.",
      "\"Deploying federalized troops on the heels of these raids is a chaotic escalation,\" Bass said in a statement posted on social media on Saturday afternoon. \"The fear people are feeling in our city right now is very real -- it's felt in our communities and within our families and it puts our neighborhoods at risk. This is the last thing that our city needs, and I urge protestors to remain peaceful.\"",
      "Newsom called the president's decision \"an alarming abuse of power.\"",
      "Around 2:18 a.m. local time time on Sunday, the LAPD issued a traffic advisory, reporting that demonstrators were approaching the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles and warned that the unlawful assembly order declared on Friday was still in effect. Around the same time, the LAPD said it received reports that demonstrators were jumping onto the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation tracks near the Little Tokyo Train Station downtown, causing all trains to be halted as officers reponded.",
      "The National Guard began arriving in Los Angeles around 4 a.m. on Sunday, taking up a position outside the Roybal federal building.",
      "Protesters who defied the order to stay away, assembled in front of the Roybal federal building, heckling National Guard members and police within earshot. Around 3:30 p.m., the LAPD issued another traffic advisory that a group of demonstrators was marching into the downtown area.",
      "Later Sunday, demonstrators began approaching to 101 Freeway and eventually got onto the southbound lanes of the freeway, prompting authorities to close the freeway in both directions, police said.",
      "The protest soon devolved into demonstrators standing on an overpass throwing concrete, bottles and other objects at officers attempting to remove demonstrators from the freeway.",
      "As the protest grew more rowdy, several Waymo autonomous vehicles were set on fire in the downtown area, prompting the company to halt service to downtown LA. Police said protesters threw fireworks at officers during the standoff and police said stores were looted in the downtown area.",
      "Officials said two LAPD officers were injured by motorcyclists attempting to breach a skirmish line police had established.",
      "The LAPD said 21 people were arrested on Sunday on charges ranging from attempted murder with a Molotov cocktail to looting to failure to disperse. The California Highway Patrol said 19 people were arrested for disobeying orders to disperse from the 101 Freeway.",
      "The LAPD announced on Monday that the police force was going on \"Tactical Alert,\" meaning all personnel are to remain on duty as the city braced for another evening of protests.",
      "As protests in Los Angeles entered their fourth night, photos from the scene showed tense moments as demonstrators confronted authorities.",
      "At one point, police said protesters near Temple Street and Los Angeles Street in downtown LA began throwing objects at police and police authorized the use of \"less lethal munitions\" in response.",

      "He spoke with ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl.",
      "In a phone interview Friday morning, hours after his blistering exchange with Elon Musk, President Donald Trump sounded remarkably unconcerned about their feud, as if it weren't even the most interesting thing that happened Thursday.",
      "When he answered a phone call Friday morning shortly before 7 a.m., ABC News asked him about reports he had a call scheduled with Musk for later in the day.",
      "\"You mean the man who has lost his mind?\" he asked, saying he was \"not particularly\" interested in talking to him right now.",
      "He said Musk wants to talk to him, but he's not ready to talk to Musk.",
      "Trump then talked for a couple of minutes about other things -- referring to inflation (down), foreign investment (up) and his plans for a visit to China (huge).",
      "People close to Trump have described him as more sad than angry at Musk. One adviser who was with Trump on Thursday night said he seemed \"bummed\" about the breakup. And that's the way he sounded on Friday morning.",
      "Trump is considering either giving away or selling the red Tesla he purchased to support Musk, a senior administration official told ABC News' Rachel Scott Friday morning. The Tesla was parked just on West Executive Avenue on Thursday. Trump made a show of checking out Tesla models at the White House in March as Musk's company took a hit as he arrived in Washington.",
      "Speaking to Al Arabiya English from the Delhi Airport lounge, Musk's father, Errol Musk, said he urged his tech billionaire son to end the feud.",
      "\"I haven't spoken to him, but I did send him a message, you know, telling him to make sure this fizzles out,\" he said before saying who he thinks will come out of this battle victorious. \"Trump, of course, will prevail, because he is has been voted in by the majority of the people in America.\"",
      "The elder Musk blamed \"a great deal of stress\" for his son's actions on Thursday.",
      "The war of words on Thursday, stemming from Musk's criticism of Trump's signature tax and immigration bill, had Musk suggesting Trump would have lost the 2024 election without him, backing calls for Trump's impeachment and even claiming Trump was \"in\" the Epstein files regarding the investigation into the accused sex trafficker.",
      "\"That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!\" Musk posted.",
      "Trump, in turn, had said Musk had gone \"CRAZY\" and suggested terminating Musk's government contracts and subsidies.",
      "Vice President JD Vance expressed his support for Trump amid the public dispute in a brief post to X -- albeit hours after the back-and-forth between Trump and Musk began. The post didn't directly weigh in on Musk's attacks or criticize the Tesla billionaire, with whom Vance has his own history that predates his time as Trump's running mate and vice president.",
      "\"President Trump has done more than anyone in my lifetime to earn the trust of the movement he leads. I am proud to stand beside him,\" Vance wrote on social media.",
      "Vance still hadn't directly responded to Musk's accusations against Trump when he posted again on Friday morning.",
      "\"There are many lies the corporate media tells about President Trump. One of the most glaring is that he's impulsive or short-tempered. Anyone who has seen him operate under pressure knows that's ridiculous,\" Vance wrote, focusing his fury on the media.",
      "The White House called the public feud between Trump and Elon Musk \"an unfortunate episode from Elon, who doesn't like the One Big Beautiful Bill because it doesn't include his policies.\"",
      "\"The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.",
      "Just hours after accusing Trump, without evidence, of appearing in the Epstein files, Musk showed some signs of trying to soften his tone -- even appearing to agree with a post on X calling for the two to \"make peace.\"",
      "The first sign Musk was starting to walk things back came thanks to an account with just over 141 followers on X who suggested to \"cool off\" and \"take a step back.\"",
      "The post from the seemingly random user led Musk to reverse his threat to decommission the spacecraft used to transport astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station, a threat Musk had made just hours earlier.",
      "\"Good advice,\" Musk responded to the user. \"Ok, we won't decommission Dragon.\"",

    "summary": "More than 300 scientists from the NIH signed an open letter on Monday to director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, criticizing the Trump administration over recent moves.",
    "story": [
      "The letter called for staff to be reinstated and funding to be restored.",
      "More than 300 scientists from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) signed an open letter on Monday morning to director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, criticizing the Trump administration over recent moves.",
      "The letter, including 92 signed names and 250 anonymous but verified signatories, shares concerns that research is being politicized, global collaboration is being interrupted and that budget and staff cuts have hindered the ability of NIH to do important research.",
      "\"[W]e dissent to Administration policies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe,\" the letter reads. \"We are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources.\"",
      "Some of the NIH scientists who signed the letter, speaking in their personal capacity and not on behalf of the agency, told ABC News they and their colleagues have tried to raise concerns internally -- and repeatedly -- but to no avail.",
      "They said there is now an urgency to speak up, especially as Bhattacharya is set to testify on Tuesday at a hearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee on the proposed NIH budget for the upcoming fiscal year.",
      "\"There is a lot of risk to speaking up, and I am very scared still, even after it's already done, even after it's already said,\" Jenna Norton, a program officer at the NIH's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and one of the lead organizers of the letter, told ABC News. \"I think a lot of people are focused on the risk of speaking up, but we also need to think about the risk of not speaking up.\"",
      "The letter, called the Bethesda Declaration -- NIH is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland -- is modeled after the Great Barrington Declaration, of which Bhattacharya was a co-author.",
      "Published in October 2020 and named after the Massachusetts town in which it was drafted, the Great Barrington Declaration called for COVID-19 lockdowns to be avoided and a new plan for handling the pandemic by protecting the most vulnerable individuals but allowing most to resume normal activities, achieving herd immunity naturally.",
      "At the time, it was widely criticized by public health professionals, including Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, who said allowing a virus \"we don't fully understand to run free is simply unethical.\" During testimony before Congress in March 2023, Bhattacharya said the declaration was targeted for \"suppression\" by federal health officials.",
      "\"We modeled the Bethesda Declaration after the Great Barrington Declaration \u2026 because we wanted him to see himself in our action,\" Norton said. \"He's spoken a lot about his commitment to academic freedom and to dissent. If Jay Bhattacharya is the person he very publicly claims to be, and if he is actually in charge at NIH, our hope is that this will move him to action. And if he's not the person he says to be or he's not in charge at NIH, I think the public and Congress should be aware of that.\"",
      "The letter called on Bhattacharya to reverse grants that have been delayed or terminated for \"political reasons\" and to allow work with foreign collaborators.",
      "The signatories also asked Bhattacharya to reverse a policy capping indirect costs for research at 15% and to reinstate essential staff who were fired at NIH.",
      "\"The Bethesda Declaration has some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months, including the continuing support of the NIH for international collaboration,\" Bhattacharya said in a statement to ABC News. \"Nevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive. We all want the NIH to succeed.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health & Human Services told ABC News that the agency has not halted \"legitimate\" collaborations with international partners. Additionally, the spokesperson said other funders, like the Gates Foundation, cap indirect costs at 15% and that each case of termination is being reviewed.",
      "Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral researcher at the NIH's National Institute of General Medical Sciences whose work focused on antimicrobial resistance, told ABC News seeing the changes at the agency has been a \"traumatic experience.\"",
      "He said when the Trump administration came into office, he was prevented from doing research in his lab because he couldn't purchase essential items and he was not allowed to attend a conference in February to speak with potential collaborators. He also saw many of his coworkers get accidentally terminated and then reinstated.",
      "\"It's just really traumatic and really disruptive for researchers at the NIH,\" Morgan, who signed the letter, said. \"We get into this not because we're trying to make money, not because of our own benefit. We're getting into this because we want to serve the public. We want to do life-saving research.\"",
      "Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute (NCI) who also signed the letter, said prior to the new administration, she worked with researchers interested either in receiving funds from NCI or who had funds already and were requesting assistance from NCI.",
      "However, with more than 2,100 research grants totaling around $9.5 billion terminated at NIH -- according to the letter -- she said some of her daily tasks have changed.",
      "\"I spend my time on the phone now talking with people who've just learned that their projects have been cut and have been given false, pseudo-scientific reasons to say their work is not valuable, not important for public health for America, and it's just not true,\" Kobrin told ABC News.",
      "The NIH researchers told ABC News there is a public letter that people can sign to express their support or they can contact their congressional representatives to express their concerns.",
      "Morgan, the antimicrobial researcher, said he doesn't want the letter to just be about detailing all the changes that occurred at NIH since Trump took office.",
      "\"It is us standing up and showing that that not everything is lost, and certainly there's been irreparable damage, but we still have time to right the ship and take it in the right direction,\" he said. \"I need to leave people with that message of hope because, otherwise, they can feel there's nothing that they can do, and that we're powerless, but we are all powerful.\"",

      "After a bruising war between Israel and Hezbollah, Lebanon\u2019s new leaders sense an opportunity to revitalize the country\u2019s devastated economy with help from its wealthy Gulf neighbors",
      "BEIRUT -- Fireworks lit up the night sky over Beirut\u2019s famous St. Georges Hotel as hit songs from the 1960s and 70s filled the air in a courtyard overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "The retro-themed event was hosted last month by Lebanon\u2019s Tourism Ministry to promote the upcoming summer season and perhaps recapture some of the good vibes from an era viewed as a golden one for the country. In the years before a civil war began in 1975, Lebanon was the go-to destination for wealthy tourists from neighboring Gulf countries seeking beaches in summer, snow-capped mountains in winter and urban nightlife year-round.",
      "In the decade after the war, tourists from Gulf countries \u2013 and crucially, Saudi Arabia \u2013 came back, and so did Lebanon\u2019s economy. But by the early 2000s, as the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah gained power, Lebanon's relations with Gulf countries began to sour. Tourism gradually dried up, starving its economy of billions of dollars in annual spending.",
      "Now, after last year's bruising war with Israel, Hezbollah is much weaker and Lebanon's new political leaders sense an opportunity to revitalize the economy once again with help from wealthy neighbors. They aim to disarm Hezbollah and rekindle ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, which in recent years have prohibited their citizens from visiting Lebanon or importing its products.",
      "\u201cTourism is a big catalyst, and so it\u2019s very important that the bans get lifted,\u201d said Laura Khazen Lahoud, the country's tourism minister.",
      "On the highway leading to the Beirut airport, once-ubiquitous banners touting Hezbollah\u2019s leadership have been replaced with commercial billboards and posters that read \u201ca new era for Lebanon.\u201d In the center of Beirut, and especially in neighborhoods that hope to attract tourists, political posters are coming down, and police and army patrols are on the rise.",
      "There are signs of thawing relations with some Gulf neighbors. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have lifted yearslong travel bans.",
      "All eyes are now on Saudi Arabia, a regional political and economic powerhouse, to see if it will follow suit, according to Lahoud and other Lebanese officials. A key sticking point is security, these officials say. Although a ceasefire with Israel has been in place since November, near-daily airstrikes have continued in southern and eastern Lebanon, where Hezbollah over the years had built its political base and powerful military arsenal.",
      "As vital as tourism is \u2014 it accounted for almost 20% of Lebanon's economy before it tanked in 2019 \u2014 the country's leaders say it is just one piece of a larger puzzle they are trying to put back together.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s agricultural and industrial sectors are in shambles, suffering a major blow in 2021, when Saudi Arabia banned their exports after accusing Hezbollah of smuggling drugs into Riyadh. Years of economic dysfunction have left the country's once-thriving middle class in a state of desperation.",
      "The World Bank says poverty nearly tripled in Lebanon over the past decade, affecting close to half its population of nearly 6 million. To make matters worse, inflation is soaring, with the Lebanese pound losing 90% of its value, and many families lost their savings when banks collapsed.",
      "Tourism is seen by Lebanon's leaders as the best way to kickstart the reconciliation needed with Gulf countries -- and only then can they move on to exports and other economic growth opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the thing that makes most sense, because that\u2019s all Lebanon can sell now,\u201d said Sami Zoughaib, research manager at The Policy Initiative, a Beirut-based think tank.",
      "With summer still weeks away, flights to Lebanon are already packed with expats and locals from countries that overturned their travel bans, and hotels say bookings have been brisk.",
      "At the event hosted last month by the tourism ministry, the owner of the St. Georges Hotel, Fady El-Khoury, beamed. The hotel, owned by his father in its heyday, has acutely felt Lebanon's ups and downs over the decades, closing and reopening multiple times because of wars. \u201cI have a feeling that the country is coming back after 50 years,\u201d he said.",
      "On a recent weekend, as people crammed the beaches of the northern city of Batroun, and jet skis whizzed along the Mediterranean, local business people sounded optimistic that the country was on the right path.",
      "\u201cWe are happy, and everyone here is happy,\u201d said Jad Nasr, co-owner of a private beach club. \u201cAfter years of being boycotted by the Arabs and our brothers in the Gulf, we expect this year for us to always be full.\u201d",
      "Still, tourism is not a panacea for Lebanon's economy, which for decades has suffered from rampant corruption and waste.",
      "Lebanon has been in talks with the International Monetary Fund for years over a recovery plan that would include billions in loans and require the country to combat corruption, restructure its banks, and bring improvements to a range of public services, including electricity and water.",
      "Without those and other reforms, Lebanon's wealthy neighbors will lack confidence to invest there, experts said. A tourism boom alone would serve as a \u201cmorphine shot that would only temporarily ease the pain\" rather than stop the deepening poverty in Lebanon, Zoughaib said.",
      "The tourism minister, Lahoud, agreed, saying a long-term process has only just begun.",
      "\"But we\u2019re talking about subjects we never talked about before,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think the whole country has realized that war doesn\u2019t serve anyone, and that we really need our economy to be back and flourish again.\u201d",

A messy war of words between President Donald Trump and Gov. Gavin Newsom.

      "In a city still reeling from January's deadly wildfires \u2014 and with the World Cup soccer championships and the 2028 Olympics on the horizon \u2014 Mayor Karen Bass has been urging residents to come together to revitalize LA's image by sprucing up streets, planting trees and painting murals so LA shows its best face to nations near and far.",
      "\u201cIt's about pride,\u201d she's said. \u201cThis is the city of dreams.\u201d",
      "Instead, a less flattering side of Los Angeles has been broadcast to the world in recent days. Protests have mostly taken place in a small swath of downtown in the sprawling city of 4 million people. As Trump has activated nearly 5,000 troops to respond in the city, Bass has staunchly pushed back against his assertions that her city is overrun and in crisis.",
      "Bass, in response to Trump, said she was troubled by depictions that the city has been \u201cinvaded and occupied by illegal aliens and criminals, and that now violent, insurrectionist mobs are swarming our federal agents. I don\u2019t know if anybody has seen that happen, but I\u2019ve not seen that happen.\u201d",
      "The series of protests began Friday outside a federal detention center, where demonstrators demanded the release of more than 40 people arrested by federal immigration authorities.",
      "Immigration advocates say the people who were detained do not have criminal histories and are being denied their due process rights.",
      "Much like New York, Los Angeles is an international city that many immigrants call home. The city\u2019s official seal carries images referencing the region\u2019s time under Spanish and Mexican rule. Over 150 languages are spoken by students in the Los Angeles Unified School District. About half of the city's residents are Latino and about one-third were born outside the U.S.",
      "Bass faulted the Trump administration for creating \"a chaotic escalation\u201d by mobilizing troops to quell protests.",

The scenes of conflict are \u201cnot exactly the best way to entice the world to plan their next tourist trip to the U.S. to watch a sports mega-event.\u201d",
      "The federal raids and protests have created another dicey political moment for Bass, who has been struggling with a budget crisis while trying to recover from political fallout from the wildfires that ignited when she was out of the country.",
      "She's been careful not to discourage protests but at the same time has pleaded for residents to remain peaceful. The mayor will likely face backlash for involving the Los Angeles Police.",
      "And she needs to fight the perception that the city is unsafe and disorderly, an image fostered by Trump, who in social media posts has depicted Bass as incompetent and said the city has been \u201cinvaded\u201d by people who entered the U.S. illegally. Los Angeles is sprawling \u2014 roughly 470 square miles (750 square kilometers) \u2014 and the protests were mostly concentrated downtown.",
      "\"The most important thing right now is that our city be peaceful,\" Bass said. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to fall into the chaos that I believe is being created by the (Trump) administration.\u201d",
      "On Monday, workers were clearing debris and broken glass from sidewalks and power-washing graffiti from buildings \u2014 among the structures vandalized was the one-time home of the Los Angeles Times across the street from City Hall. Downtown has yet to bounce back since long-running pandemic lockdowns, which reordered work life and left many office towers with high vacancy rates.",

Hegseth has deployed about 700 active-duty Marines to assist more than 4,100 National Guard troops in protecting federal buildings and personnel. But there are questions about what the troops will have to do and how much it will all cost.",
      "Under the Posse Comitatus Act, troops are prohibited from policing U.S. citizens on American soil. Invoking the Insurrection Act, which allows troops to do that, is incredibly rare, and it's not clear if Trump plans to do it.",
      "The commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Eric Smith, will be on Capitol Hill testifying at a separate budget hearing at the same time as Hegseth and is likely to face similar questions.",
      "Hegseth has spent vast amounts of time during his first five months in office promoting the social changes he's making at the Pentagon. He\u2019s been far less visible in the administration\u2019s more critical international security crises and negotiations involving Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Gaza and Iran.",
      "Most recently, Hegseth directed the renaming of a Navy ship that had honored Harvey Milk, a slain gay rights activist who served as a sailor during the Korean War. His spokesman, Sean Parnell, said the renaming was needed to ensure \"the names attached to all DOD installations and assets are reflective of the commander-in-chief\u2019s priorities, our nation\u2019s history, and the warrior ethos.\u201d",
      "Hegseth has posted numerous videos of his morning workouts with troops or of himself signing directives to purge diversity and equity programs and online content from the military. He has boasted of removing transgender service members from the force and firing so-called woke generals, many of whom were women.",
      "He was on the international stage about a week ago, addressing an annual national security conference in Asia about threats from China. But a trip to NATO headquarters last week was quick and quiet, and he deliberately skipped a gathering of about 50 allies and partners where they discussed ongoing support for Ukraine.",
      "Hegseth's hearing Tuesday before the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee will be his first public appearance on Capitol Hill since he squeaked through his Senate confirmation with a tie-breaking vote. It was the closest vote of any Cabinet member.",
      "While he has talked a lot about making the military more lethal, it was his use of the unclassified, unsecured Signal messaging app that quickly caught public attention.",
      "Set up by then-national security adviser Mike Waltz, a group chat included Hegseth and other senior administration leaders and was used to share information about upcoming military strikes in Yemen.",
      "The chat became a public embarrassment because the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to it. Waltz took responsibility for the gaffe, but Hegseth was roundly criticized for sharing details about the military strikes in this chat and in another one that included his wife and brother.",
      "Multiple investigations are looking into his use of Signal. The Defense Department's acting inspector general has been looking into the initial chat at the request of the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Pentagon\u2019s watchdog also is reviewing whether any of Hegseth's aides were asked to delete any Signal messages.",
      "While any number of those issues could come up at the House Armed Services Committee hearing Thursday, money issues are more likely to be the focus of the hearings Tuesday in the House and Wednesday before the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee.",
      "Already defense leaders have been grilled in other hearings on the plans to retrofit the Qatari jet and the costs of the military parade. Trump has long wanted a parade, and Army leaders defended it as a good way to attract new recruits.",
      "Other questions may involve the costs of expanding the use of military forces to secure the southern border, the plans for the Golden Dome missile defense program, and how the department intends to fund modernization programs for drones and other critical weapons systems.",

      "Alabama is preparing to execute a man with nitrogen gas for the 1988 beating death of a woman",
      "ATMORE, Ala. -- A man convicted of beating a woman to death nearly 37 years ago is scheduled to be executed Tuesday in Alabama in what will be the nation's sixth execution with nitrogen gas.",
      "Gregory Hunt is scheduled to be put to death Tuesday night at a south Alabama prison. Hunt was convicted of killing Karen Lane, a woman he had been dating for about a month, according to court records.",
      "The Alabama execution is one of four that had been scheduled this week in the United States. Executions are also scheduled in Florida and South Carolina. A judge in Oklahoma on Monday issued a temporary stay for an execution in that state, but the state attorney general is seeking to get it lifted.",
      "Lane was 32 when she was murdered Aug. 2, 1988, in the Cordova apartment she shared with a woman who was Hunt's cousin.",
      "Prosecutors said Hunt broke into her apartment and killed her after sexually abusing her. A physician who performed an autopsy testified that she died from blunt force trauma and that Lane had sustained some 60 injuries, including 20 to the head.",
      "A jury on June 19, 1990, found Hunt guilty of capital murder during sexual abuse and burglary. Jurors recommended by a vote of 11-1 that he receive a death sentence, which a judge imposed.",
      "Hunt's final request for a stay of execution, which he filed himself, focused on claims that prosecutors made false statements to jurors about evidence of sexual abuse. The element of sexual abuse is what elevated the crime to a death penalty offense.",
      "In a filing to the U.S. Supreme Court, Hunt, acting as his own attorney, wrote that a prosecutor told jurors that cervical mucus was on a broomstick near Hunt\u2019s body. However, the victim did not have a cervix because of an earlier hysterectomy. The Alabama attorney general\u2019s office called the claim meritless and said even if the prosecutor erred in that statement, it did not throw the conviction into doubt.",
      "Hunt, speaking by telephone last month from prison, did not dispute killing Lane but maintained he did not sexually assault her. He also described himself as someone who was changed by prison.",
      "\u201cKaren didn\u2019t deserve what happened to her,\u201d Hunt said.",
      "Hunt said he had been drinking and doing drugs on the night of the crime and became jealous when he saw Lane in a car with another man.",
      "\u201cYou have your come-to-Jesus moment. Of course, after the fact, you can't believe what has happened. You can't believe you were part of it and did it,\u201d Hunt said.",
      "Hunt, who was born in 1960 and came to death row in 1990, is now among the longest-serving inmates on Alabama's death row. He said prison became his \u201chospital\u201d to heal his broken mind. He said since 1988, he has been leading a Bible class attended by two dozen or more inmates.",
      "\u201cJust trying to be a light in a dark place, trying to tell people if I can change, they can too. ... become people of love instead of hate,\" he said.",
      "Lane\u2019s sister declined to comment when reached by telephone. The family is expected to give a written statement Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cThe way she was killed is just devastating,\u201d Denise Gurganus, Lane\u2019s sister, told TV station WBRC at a 2014 vigil for crime victims. \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to lose a family member to death, but when it\u2019s this gruesome.\u201d",
      "The Alabama attorney general's office, in asking justices to reject Hunt's request for a stay of execution, wrote that Hunt has now been on death row longer than Lane was alive.",
      "Alabama last year became the first state to carry out an execution with nitrogen gas. Nitrogen has now been used in five executions \u2014 four in Alabama and one in Louisiana. The method involves using a gas mask to force an inmate to breathe pure nitrogen gas, depriving them of the oxygen needed to stay alive.",
      "Hunt had named nitrogen as his preferred execution method. He made the selection before Alabama had developed procedures for using gas. Alabama also allows inmates to choose lethal injection or the electric chair.",

    "story": [
      "New Jersey voters are set to settle the Democratic and Republican primaries for governor",
      "TRENTON, N..J. -- New Jersey voters on Tuesday will settle the Democratic and Republican primaries for governor in a contest that could send signals about how the public is responding to President Donald Trump's agenda and how Democratic voters think their leaders should push back.",
      "New Jersey is one of just two states with a race for governor this year \u2014 the other is Virginia \u2014 and the fact two-term Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy is term-limited has created fresh drama for the open seat.",
      "There's a six-way race on the Democratic side that features several seasoned political figures. Trump\u2019s endorsement of former state lawmaker Jack Ciattarelli may have given him a boost on the Republican side, where he faces four primary challengers.",
      "Polls are open from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m. Tuesday, but it's not the only day of voting. Early in-person voting was held from June 3-8. Mail-in ballots were sent to voters beginning in April.",
      "The contest hinges in part on New Jersey issues, including high property taxes and the soaring cost of living, but national politics are sure to figure in. Trump, who has long had a strong presence in New Jersey, waded into the race with his endorsement, attacking Democratic control of state government. Democrats are looking for a winning message and leadership after the sting of bitter losses in 2024.",
      "\"Because these are the first major elections since Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House, there\u2019s a tremendous amount at stake simply through public perception,\" said Ben Dworkin, director of the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship.",
      "For Democrats? \u201cThey'll just get further in a hole if they don't hold this seat,\u201d he said.",
      "For Republicans? They could win because New Jersey tends to be purple during gubernatorial years, Dworkin said, but that would be viewed as a tremendous victory for Trump.",
      "The Democrats running are Mayors Ras Baraka of Newark and Steven Fulop of Jersey City; U.S. Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill; teachers union President Sean Spiller and former state Senate President Steve Sweeney. The Democratic campaign has been hard fought and pricey, with tens of millions spent in one of the country's most expensive media markets.",
      "On the Republican side, most of the candidates declared their support for the president's agenda, pressing for a state-level version of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency. They've also said they would end so-called sanctuary policies and, in a New Jersey-specific pitch, called for the end of the state's 2020 law banning single-use plastic bags.",
      "Ciattarelli has said he would sign an order on his first day in office ending New Jersey's Immigrant Trust Directive, which bars local police from cooperating with federal officials on civil immigration matters. He has also said he would direct whomever he names attorney general to end lawsuits against the Trump administration, including a case aimed at stopping the president's order ending birthright citizenship for people whose parents were in the country illegally.",
      "Murphy, who became the first Democrat to be reelected in more than four decades in 2021, is barred from running again by term limits and hasn't endorsed a successor in the primary.",
      "Both parties will look to build their general election campaigns on widespread voter frustration. For Democrats, that means focusing on the parts of Trump\u2019s aggressive second-term agenda that are unpopular. Republicans, meanwhile, are casting blame for economic hardships on Democrats who\u2019ve run state government for the last eight years.",
      "New Jersey has been reliably Democratic in Senate and presidential contests for decades. But the odd-year races for governor have tended to swing back and forth, and each of the last three GOP governors has won a second term.",
      "Democrats have the largest share of registered voters in the state, followed closely by independent voters and then Republicans, who have roughly 800,000 fewer registrations than the Democratic Party. But the GOP has made gains in recent years, shaving the Democrats\u2019 lead of more than 1 million more registrations to the current level.",

      "Florida plans to execute a man convicted of raping and killing a woman three decades ago after kidnapping her from a supermarket parking lot",
      "A man convicted of raping and killing a woman three decades ago after kidnapping her from a supermarket parking lot in Florida is scheduled to be executed Tuesday.",
      "Anthony Wainwright, 54, is scheduled to receive a lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke. He was convicted in the April 1994 killing of 23-year-old Carmen Gayheart, a mother of two young children, in Lake City.",
      "Wainwright would be the sixth person put to death in Florida this year. The state also executed six people in 2023, but only carried out one execution last year. There are four executions scheduled around the country this week, including another one on Tuesday in Alabama. On Monday an Oklahoma judge granted a temporary stay of execution for a man scheduled to be put to death Thursday.",
      "Richard Hamilton, the other man convicted in Gayheart\u2019s killing, was also sentenced to death. But he died on death row in January 2023 at the age of 59.",
      "Gayheart's sister, who plans to attend the execution, said three decades is too long to wait for justice.",
      "\u201cIt's ridiculous how many appeals they get,\u201d Maria David told The Associated Press, adding that each step of the appeals process reopened her family's wounds. \u201cYou have to relive it again because they have to tell the whole story again.\u201d",
      "Wainwright and Hamilton escaped from prison in North Carolina, stole a green Cadillac and burglarized a home the next morning, taking guns and money. Then they drove to Florida and when the Cadillac began to have problems in Lake City, they decided to steal another vehicle.",
      "They confronted Gayheart, a community college student, on April 27, 1994, as she loaded groceries into her blue Ford Bronco, according to court documents. They forced her into the vehicle at gunpoint and drove off. They raped her in the backseat and then took her out of the vehicle and tried to strangle her before shooting her twice in the back of the head, court filings say. They dragged her body several dozen yards from the road and drove off.",
      "The two men were arrested in Mississippi the next day after a shootout with police.",
      "A jury in 1995 convicted Wainwright of murder, kidnapping, robbery and rape and unanimously recommended that he be sentenced to death.",
      "Wainwright's lawyers have filed multiple unsuccessful appeals over the years based on what they said were problems with his trial and evidence that he suffered from brain damage and intellectual disability.",
      "Since his execution was scheduled, his lawyers have argued in state and federal court filings that his execution should be put on hold to allow time for courts to hear additional legal arguments in his case.",
      "In a filing with the U.S. Supreme Court, his lawyers argue that his case has been \u201cmarred by critical, systemic failures at virtually every stage and through the signing of his death warrant.\u201d Those failures include flawed DNA evidence that wasn't disclosed to the defense until after opening statements, erroneous jury instructions, inflammatory and inaccurate closing arguments and missteps by court-appointed lawyers, the filing says.",
      "The filing also says that a jailhouse informant who testified at Wainwright's trial finally admitted last month that he and another informant had testified in exchange for lighter sentences, a fact that had not been disclosed to the defense.",
      "The Supreme Court on Monday denied Wainwright's final appeals without comment.",
      "David, Gayheart's sister, said she feels cheated that Hamilton died before the state could execute him.",
      "She said she was \u201covercome with emotion\u201d when she heard the governor had signed a death warrant for Wainwright. Her parents both died while waiting for justice to be served, she said, but she plans to be there to witness the final chapter of her family's tragedy.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that would keep me from seeing this all the way through,\u201d she said.",
      "Her sister loved animals and surprised her by training to become a nurse rather than a veterinarian, David said. Gayheart was two years younger than her sister but became a mother first, and David said she marveled at her sister's patience with her young children.",
      "\u201cShe was here, she mattered, she should be remembered, and she was loved,\u201d David said of her sister.",
      "Over the years, she has kept a book where she put every court filing, from the initial indictment through the latest appeals.",
      "\u201cI'm looking forward to getting the last pieces of paperwork that say he's been executed to put into the book and never having to think about Anthony Wainwright ever again,\u201d she said.",

      "Financial aid fraud is exploding, thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence",
      "It was an unusual question coming from a police officer. Heather Brady was napping at home in San Francisco on a Sunday afternoon when the officer knocked on her door to ask: Had she applied to Arizona Western College?",
      "She had not, and as the officer suspected, somebody else had applied to Arizona community colleges in her name to scam the government into paying out financial aid money.",
      "When she checked her student loan servicer account, Brady saw the scammers hadn't stopped there. A loan for over $9,000 had been paid out in her name \u2014 but to another person \u2014 for coursework at a California college.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine how many people this is happening to that have no idea,\u201d Brady said.",
      "The rise of artificial intelligence and the popularity of online classes have led to an explosion of financial aid fraud. Fake college enrollments have been surging as crime rings deploy \u201cghost students\u201d \u2014 chatbots that join online classrooms and stay just long enough to collect a financial aid check.",
      "In some cases, professors discover almost no one in their class is real. Students get locked out of the classes they need to graduate as bots push courses over their enrollment limits. And victims of identity theft who discover loans fraudulently taken out in their names must go through months of calling colleges, the Federal Student Aid office and loan servicers to try to get the debt erased.",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Education Department introduced a temporary rule requiring students to show colleges a government-issued ID to prove their identity. It will apply only to first-time applicants for federal student aid for the summer term, affecting some 125,000 borrowers. The agency said it is developing more advanced screening for the fall.",
      "\u201cThe rate of fraud through stolen identities has reached a level that imperils the federal student aid program,\u201d the department said in its guidance to colleges.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of fraud reports obtained through a public records request shows California colleges in 2024 reported 1.2 million fraudulent applications, which resulted in 223,000 suspected fake enrollments. Other states are affected by the same problem, but with 116 community colleges, California is a particularly large target.",
      "Criminals stole at least $11.1 million in federal, state and local financial aid from California community colleges last year that could not be recovered, according to the reports.",
      "Colleges typically receive a portion of the loans intended for tuition, with the balance going directly to students for other expenses. Community colleges are targeted in part because their lower tuition means larger percentages of grants and loans go to borrowers.",
      "Scammers frequently use AI chatbots to carry out the fraud, targeting courses that are online and allow students to watch lectures and complete coursework on their own time.",
      "In January, Wayne Chaw started getting emails about a class he never signed up for at De Anza Community College, where he had taken coding classes a decade earlier. Identity thieves had obtained his Social Security number and collected $1,395 in financial aid in his name.",
      "The energy management class required students to submit a homework assignment to prove they were real. But someone wrote submissions impersonating Chaw, likely using a chatbot.",
      "\u201cThis person is typing as me, saying my first and last name. ... It\u2019s very freaky when I saw that,\u201d said Chaw.",
      "The fraud involved a grant, not loans, so Chaw himself did not lose money. He called the Social Security Administration to report the identity theft, but after five hours on hold, he never got through to a person.",
      "As the Trump administration moves to dismantle the Education Department, federal cuts may make it harder to catch criminals and help victims of identity theft. In March, the Trump administration fired more than 300 people from the Federal Student Aid office, and the department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, which investigates fraud, has lost more than 20% of its staff through attrition and retirements since October.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just nervous that I\u2019m going to be stuck with this,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThe agency is going to be so broken down and disintegrated that I won\u2019t be able to do anything, and I\u2019m just going to be stuck with those $9,000\u201d in loans.",
      "Criminal cases around the country offer a glimpse of the schemes' pervasiveness.",
      "In the past year, investigators indicted a man accused of leading a Texas fraud ring that used stolen identities to pursue $1.5 million in student aid. Another person in Texas pleaded guilty to using the names of prison inmates to apply for over $650,000 in student aid at colleges across the South and Southwest. And a person in New York recently pleaded guilty to a $450,000 student aid scam that lasted a decade.",
      "Brittnee Nelson of Shreveport, Louisiana, was bringing her daughter to day care two years ago when she received a notification that her credit score had dropped 27 points.",
      "Loans had been taken out in her name for colleges in California and Louisiana, she discovered. She canceled one before it was paid out, but it was too late to stop a loan of over $5,000 for Delgado Community College in New Orleans.",
      "Nelson runs her own housecleaning business and didn\u2019t go to college. She already was signed up for identity theft protection and carefully monitored her credit. Still, her debt almost went into collections before the loan was put in forbearance. She recently got the loans taken off her record after two years of effort.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like if someone came into your house and robbed you,\u201d she said.",
      "The federal government's efforts to verify borrowers' identity could help, she said.",
      "\u201cIf they can make these hurdles a little bit harder and have these verifications more provable, I think that\u2019s really, really, really going to protect people in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Delgado spokesperson Barbara Waiters said responsibility for approving loans ultimately lies with federal agencies.",
      "\u201cThis is an unfortunate and serious matter, but it is not the direct or indirect result of Delgado\u2019s internal processes,\u201d Waiters said.",
      "In San Francisco, the loans taken out in Brady's name are in a grace period, but still on the books. That has not been her only challenge. A few months ago, she was laid off from her job and decided to sign up for a class at City College San Francisco to help her career. But all the classes were full.",
      "After a few weeks, Brady finally was able to sign up for a class. The professor apologized for the delay in spots opening up: The college has been struggling with fraudulent applications.",

The lawsuit comes as a biotechnology company seeks the court's approval to buy the struggling firm.",

      "Investigators have been looking for Travis Caleb Decker, 32, since the night of May 30, when he failed to return the girls to their mother's home in Wenatchee, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Seattle, after a scheduled visit.",
      "Three days later, a sheriff's deputy discovered the bodies of 9-year-old Paityn Decker, 8-year-old Evelyn Decker and 5-year-old Olivia Decker down an embankment at a campsite in the Cascade Mountains. The campsite, west of Leavenworth, is about 11 miles (18 km) from the Pacific Crest Trail, which runs from the U.S.-Mexico border to the U.S.-Canada border.",
      "Decker has been charged with murder and kidnapping. According to a probable cause statement filed in Chelan County Superior Court last week, Decker's truck was left at the campsite, and it had two bloody handprints on the tailgate. In a news release Monday, the Chelan County Sheriff's Office said tests revealed that one blood sample taken from the scene belonged to a male, and another turned out to be from an animal.",
      "The sheriff's office did not say whether the tested samples had been taken from the tailgate. DNA and fingerprint analyses are pending, the news release said. Decker's dog was also found alive at the scene and turned over to the humane society for care.",
      "The sheriff's office said that while it is retaining command of the criminal investigation, it had turned over control of the search efforts to federal authorities to give its personnel time to rest. Officials have searched hundreds of square miles, much of it mountainous and remote, by land, water and air.",
      "Decker has also been charged in federal court with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. According to an affidavit filed by deputy U.S. marshal Keegan Stanley in that case, Decker has training in navigation, survival and other skills that make him \u201ca very avid and well-versed outdoorsman.\u201d",
      "Decker once spent 2.5 months in the backwoods living off the grid, Stanley wrote, and in the days before he took the girls, he searched online for how to relocate to and find a job in Canada.",
      "Decker was an infantryman in the Army from March 2013 to July 2021 and deployed to Afghanistan for four months in 2014, according to Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Ruth Castro. From 2014 to 2016, he was an automatic rifleman with the 75th Ranger Regiment at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington.",
      "Last September his ex-wife, Whitney Decker, wrote in a petition to modify their parenting plan that his mental health issues had worsened and that he had become increasingly unstable, often living out of his truck. She sought to restrict him from having overnight visits with the girls until he found housing.",
      "An autopsy on Friday determined the cause of death to be suffocation, the sheriff's office said. The girls had been bound with zip ties and had plastic bags placed over their heads.",
      "Authorities have reopened popular camping and backpacking areas in the Icicle Creek area, near where the girls were discovered. Other trails in the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area have reopened for day use but not camping.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is moving swiftly to act on his immigration promises with little internal restraint, determined to test the bounds of his executive authority in order to fulfill the promises of his reelection campaign",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump made no secret of his willingness to exert a maximalist approach to enforcing immigration laws and keeping order as he campaigned to return to the White House. The fulfillment of that pledge is now on full display in Los Angeles.",
      "The president has put hundreds of National Guard troops on the streets to quell protests over his administration's immigration raids, a deployment that state and city officials say has only inflamed tensions. Trump called up the California National Guard over the objections of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2014 the first time in 60 years a president has done so \u2014 and is deploying active-duty troops to support the guard.",
      "By overriding Newsom, Trump is already going beyond what he did to respond to Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, when he warned he could send troops to contain demonstrations that turned violent if governors in the states did not act to do so themselves. Trump said in September of that year that he \u201ccan\u2019t call in the National Guard unless we\u2019re requested by a governor\u201d and that \u201cwe have to go by the laws.\u201d",
      "But now, the past and current president is moving swiftly, with little internal restraint to test the bounds of his executive authority in order to deliver on his promise of mass deportations. What remains to be seen is whether Americans will stand by him once it\u2019s operationalized nationwide, as Trump looks to secure billions from Congress to dramatically expand the country's detention and deportation operations.",
      "For now, Trump is betting that they will.",
      "\u201cIf we didn't do the job, that place would be burning down,\" Trump told reporters Monday, speaking about California. \u201cI feel we had no choice. ... I don't want to see what happened so many times in this country.\u201d",
      "The protests began to unfold Friday as federal authorities arrested immigrants in several locations throughout the sprawling city, including in the fashion district of Los Angeles and at a Home Depot. The anger over the administration\u2019s actions quickly spread, with protests in Chicago and Boston as demonstrations in the southern California city also continued Monday.",
      "But Trump and other administration officials remained unbowed, capitalizing on the images of burning cars, graffiti and Mexican flags \u2014 which, while not dominant, started to become the defining images of the unrest \u2014 to bolster their law-and-order cause.",
      "Leaders in the country\u2019s most populous state were similarly defiant.",
      "California officials sued the Trump administration Monday, with the state\u2019s attorney general, Rob Bonta, arguing that the deployment of troops \u201ctrampled\u201d on the state\u2019s sovereignty and pushing for a restraining order. The initial deployment of 300 National Guard troops was expected to quickly expand to the full 4,000 that has been authorized by Trump.",
      "The state\u2019s senior Democratic senator, Alex Padilla, said in an interview that \u201cthis is absolutely a crisis of Trump\u2019s own making.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of people who are passionate about speaking up for fundamental rights and respecting due process, but the deployment of National Guard only serves to escalate tensions and the situation,\u201d Padilla told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what Donald Trump wanted to do.\u201d",
      "Padilla slammed the deployment as \u201ccounterproductive\u201d and said the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Department was not advised ahead of the federalization of the National Guard. His office has also pushed the Pentagon for a justification on the deployment, and \u201cas far as we\u2019re told, the Department of Defense isn\u2019t sure what the mission is here,\" Padilla added.",
      "Much of this was predictable.",
      "During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump pledged to conduct the largest domestic deportation operation in American history to expel millions of immigrants in the country without legal status. He often praised President Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s military-style immigration raids, and the candidate and his advisers suggested they would have broad power to deploy troops domestically to enact Trump's far-reaching immigration and public safety goals.",
      "Trump\u2019s speedy deployment in California of troops against those whom the president has alluded to as \u201cinsurrectionists\u201d on social media is a sharp contrast to his decision to issue no order or formal request for National Guard troops during the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, despite his repeated and false assertions that he had made such an offer.",
      "Trump is now surrounded by officials who have no interest in constraining his power. In 2020, Trump\u2019s then-Pentagon chief publicly rebuked Trump\u2019s threat to send in troops using the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that empowers the president to use the military within the U.S. and against American citizens.",
      "Current Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signaled support on his personal X account for deploying troops to California, writing, \u201cThe National Guard, and Marines if need be, stand with ICE,\u201d referring to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.",
      "The Defense Department said Monday it is deploying about 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles to support National Guard troops already on the ground to respond to the protests.",
      "Protesters over the weekend blocked off a major freeway and burned self-driving cars as police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades in clashes that encompassed several downtown blocks in Los Angeles and led to several dozen arrests. Much of the city saw no violence.",
      "But the protests prompted Trump to issue the directive Saturday mobilizing the California National Guard over Newsom's objections. The president and his top immigration aides accused the governor of mismanaging the protests, with border czar Tom Homan asserting in a Fox News interview Monday that Newsom stoked anti-ICE sentiments and waited two days to declare unlawful assembly in the city.",
      "Trump told Newsom in a phone call Friday evening to get the situation in Los Angeles under control, a White House official said. It was only when the administration felt Newsom was not restoring order in the city \u2014 and after Trump watched the situation escalate for 24 hours and White House officials saw imagery of federal law enforcement officers with lacerations and other injuries \u2014 that the president moved to deploy the Guard, according to the official, who was granted anonymity to discuss private deliberations.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s an incompetent governor,\u201d Trump said Monday. \u201cLook at the job he\u2019s doing in California. He\u2019s destroying one of our great states.\u201d",
      "Local law enforcement officials said Los Angeles police responded as quickly as they could once the protests erupted, and Newsom repeatedly asserted that state and city authorities had the situation under control.",
      "\u201cLos Angeles is no stranger to demonstrations and protests and rallies and marches,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cLocal law enforcement knows how to handle this and has a rapport with the community and community leaders to be able to allow for that.\u201d",
      "The aggressive moves prompted blowback from some of Trump's erstwhile allies. Ileana Garcia, a Florida state senator who in 2016 founded the group Latinas for Trump and was hired to direct Latino outreach, called the recent escalation \u201cunacceptable and inhumane.\u201d",
      "\u201cI understand the importance of deporting criminal aliens, but what we are witnessing are arbitrary measures to hunt down people who are complying with their immigration hearings \u2014 in many cases, with credible fear of persecution claims \u2014 all driven by a Miller-like desire to satisfy a self-fabricated deportation goal,\" said Garcia, referring to Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff and key architect of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "The tactics could be just a preview to what more could come from the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress. GOP lawmakers are working to pass a massive tax-and-border package that includes billions to hire thousands of new officers for Border Patrol and for ICE. The goal, under the Trump-backed plan, is to remove 1 million immigrants without status annually and house 100,000 people in immigration detention centers.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon was scrambling Monday to establish rules to guide U.S. Marines who could be faced with the rare and difficult prospect of using force against citizens on American soil, now that the Trump administration is deploying active duty troops to the immigration raid protests in Los Angeles.",
      "U.S. Northern Command said it is sending 700 Marines into the Los Angeles area to protect federal property and personnel, including federal immigration agents. The 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines are coming from Twentynine Palms, California, and will augment about 4,100 National Guard members already in LA or authorized to be deployed there to respond to the protests.",
      "The forces have been trained in deescalation, crowd control and standing rules for the use of force, Northern Command said.",
      "But the use of the active duty forces still raises difficult questions.",
      "The Marines are highly trained in combat and crisis response, with time in conflict zones like Syria and Afghanistan. But that is starkly different from the role they will face now: They could potentially be hit by protesters carrying gas canisters and have to quickly decide how to respond or face decisions about protecting an immigration enforcement agent from crowds.",
      "According to a U.S. official, troops will be armed with their normal service weapons but will not be carrying tear gas. They also will have protective equipment such as helmets, shields and gas masks.",
      "When troops are overseas, how they can respond to threats is outlined by the rules of engagement. At home, they are guided by standing rules for the use of force, which have to be set and agreed to by Northern Command, and then each Marine should receive a card explaining what they can and cannot do, another U.S. official said.",
      "For example, warning shots would be prohibited, according to use-of-force draft documents viewed by The Associated Press. Marines are directed to deescalate a situation whenever possible but also are authorized to act in self-defense, the documents say.",
      "The AP reviewed documents and interviewed nine U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet public, about the guidance being determined for the Marines.",
      "The Pentagon also is working on a memo with clarifying language for the Marines that will lay out the steps they can take to protect federal personnel and property. Those guidelines also will include specifics on the possibility that they could temporarily detain civilians if troops are under assault or to prevent harm, the first U.S. official said.",
      "Those measures could involve detaining civilians until they can be turned over to law enforcement.",
      "Having the Marines deploy to protect federal buildings allows them to be used without invoking the Insurrection Act, one U.S. official said.",
      "The Insurrection Act allows the president to direct federal troops to conduct law enforcement functions in national emergencies. But the use of that act is extremely rare. Officials said that has not yet been done in this case and that it's not clear it will be done.",
      "President George H.W. Bush used the Insurrection Act to respond to riots in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of white police officers who were videotaped beating Black motorist Rodney King.",
      "If their role expands if the violence escalates, it is not clear under what legal authority they would be able to engage, said Elizabeth Goitein, a senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law.",
      "\u201cIf in fact those Marines are laying hands on civilians, doing searches, then you have pretty powerful legal concerns,\u201d Goitein said. \u201cNo statutory authority Trump has invoked so far permits this.\u201d",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth tweeted late Saturday that he was considering deploying the Marines to respond to the unrest after getting advice earlier in the day from Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, according to one of the U.S. officials.",
      "Still, the tweet, which was posted to Hegseth's personal X account and not to his official government account, caught many inside the Pentagon by surprise. As late as Monday, the military's highest offices were still considering the potential ramifications.",
      "But the Marine Corps were asking broader questions, too: Do they send more senior, experienced personnel so as not to put newer, less experienced troops at risk of potentially making a judgment call on whether to use force against a civilian?",
      "What's lawful under a domestic deployment \u2014 where troops may end up in a policing role \u2014 is governed by the Fourth Amendment in the U.S. Constitution, which forbids seizure of persons, including temporarily restraining them, unless it could be considered reasonable under the circumstances.",
      "Troops under federal authorities are in general prohibited from conducting law enforcement on U.S. soil under the Posse Comitatus Act.",

They claim board member Sean Malloy was biased because he worked for the Tulsa County District Attorney\u2019s Office when Hanson was being prosecuted.",
      "Malloy has said he never worked on Hanson's case at the time and was unfamiliar with it before the clemency hearing. Malloy was one of three members who voted 3-2 to deny Hanson a clemency recommendation.",
      "\u201cA condemned prisoner, such as Mr. Hanson, possesses a clear and grave interest in the right to due process and the equitable administration of Oklahoma's constitutional process for executive clemency,\u201d Hanson's attorney, Emma Rolls, wrote in their petition.",

In December, the Maui County Council approved acquiring privately owned land next to Maui\u2019s existing landfill for a permanent disposal site.",
      "Handling debris after large wildfires is always a logistical challenge. It took Paradise, California, officials about a year to transport more than 300,000 truck loads of debris to three different landfills after the 2018 Camp Fire killed 85 people and burned most of the town.",
      "Maui County said it evaluated the debris with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Hawaii Department of Health and determined transporting and storing it at the landfill didn't post a public health risk. Workers will lightly wet it before loading it onto trucks to control dust. The debris will be wrapped in thick plastic sheets. In total, it weighs about 400,000 tons (363,00 metric tons).",
      "Some Olowalu residents were worried the debris would stay in their community permanently, potentially desecrating Native Hawaiian shrines, ancient burial sites and offshore coral reefs and marine life.",
      "Most of the steel and concrete left behind by the fire was to be recycled. Much of the debris heading for the landfill is ash and small particles, which state Department of Health tests found had arsenic, lead and other toxins.",

      "Adults living in the U.S. illegally will be excluded from a state-run health care program under a budget deal that the Minnesota Legislature convened to pass in a special session Monday",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Adults living in the U.S. illegally will be excluded from a state-run health care program under an overall budget deal that the closely divided Minnesota Legislature convened to pass in a special session Monday.",
      "Repealing a 2023 state law that made those immigrants eligible for the MinnesotaCare program for the working poor was a priority for Republicans in the negotiations that produced the budget agreement. The Legislature is split 101-100, with the House tied and Democrats holding just a one-seat majority in the Senate, and the health care compromise was a bitter pill for Democrats to accept.",
      "The change is expected to affect about 17,000 residents.",
      "After an emotional near four-hour debate, the House aroved the bill 68-65. Under the agreement, the top House Democratic leader, Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park, was the only member of her caucus to vote yes. The bill then went to the Senate, where it passed 37-30. Democratic Majority Leader Erin Murphy, of St. Paul, called it \u201ca wound on the soul of Minnesota,\u201d but kept her promise to vote yes as part of the deal, calling it \"among the most painful votes I've ever taken.\"",
      "Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who insisted on maintaining eligibility for children who aren\u2019t in the country legally, has promised to sign the legislation, and all 13 other bills scheduled for action in the special session, to complete a $66 billion, two-year budget that will take effect July 1.",
      "\u201cThis is 100% about the GOP campaign against immigrants,\u201d said House Democratic Floor Leader Jamie Long, of Minneapolis, who voted no. \u201cFrom Trump\u2019s renewed travel ban announced this week, to his effort to expel those with protected status, to harassing students here to study, to disproportionate military and law enforcement responses that we\u2019ve seen from Minneapolis to L.A., this all comes back to attacking immigrants and the name of dividing us.\u201d",
      "But GOP Rep. Jeff Backer, of Browns Valley, the lead author of the bill, said taxpayers shouldn't have to subsidize health care for people who aren't in the country legally.",
      "Backer said California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, has proposed freezing enrollment for immigrants without legal status in a similar state-funded program and that Illinois' Democratic governor, JB Pritzker, has proposed cutting a similar program.",
      "He said residents can still buy health insurance on the private market regardless of their immigration status.",
      "\u201cThis is about being fiscally responsible,\u201d Backer said.",
      "Enrollment by people who entered the country illegally in MinnesotaCare has run triple the initial projections, which Republicans said could have pushed the costs over $600 million over the next four years. Critics said the change won't save any money because those affected will forego preventive care and need much more expensive care later.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t suddenly stop getting sick when they don\u2019t have insurance, but they do put off seeking care until a condition gets bad enough to require a visit to the emergency room, increasing overall health care costs for everyone,\u201d Bernie Burnham, president of the Minnesota AFL-CIO, told reporters at a news conference organized by the critics.",
      "Walz and legislative leaders agreed on the broad framework for the budget over four weeks ago, contrasting the bipartisan cooperation that produced it with the deep divisions at the federal level in Washington.",
      "But with the tie in the House and the razor-thin Senate Democratic majority, few major policy initiatives got off the ground before the regular session ended May 19. Leaders announced Friday that the details were settled and that they had enough votes to pass everything in the budget package.",

They said they hired an investigator to examine claims that a former administrator and professor sexually assaulted a woman who was a student and later a university employee.

      "The 3,100-student university says the administrator\u2019s employment ended within days and that school leaders later learned that the administrator had sent \u201chundreds\u201d of \u201csexually-explicit and theologically-twisted\u201d emails from a personal account. Sheriff\u2019s deputies concluded there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to seek criminal charges, the university said. The sheriff's office didn't immediately respond Monday to a phone call and email seeking comment.",

      "California union leader David Huerta has been released from federal custody on a $50,000 bond",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The arrest of a California labor leader has become a rallying cry for immigrant advocates across the country who called for his release and an end to President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "David Huerta, the 58-year-old president of Service Employees International Union California, was arrested Friday while protesting outside a business where federal law enforcement agents were investigating suspected immigration violations, authorities said. He was released from federal custody Monday on a $50,000 bond after a hearing in federal court in Los Angeles.",
      "Meanwhile, union members and immigrant advocates led rallies in cities from Los Angeles to Chicago to New York to call for Huerta's release. In Boston, hundreds of people gathered in City Hall Plaza, with protesters shouting \u201cFree David, free them all.\u201d",
      "Huerta, a long-time labor leader born and raised in Los Angeles County, has become the face of the pushback against Trump\u2019s effort to drive up immigration arrests. His case has also drawn attention to the longstanding ties between Democratic officials and the union that represents hundreds of thousands of janitors, security officers and other workers across California.",
      "After he was released, Huerta told reporters he did not intend to get arrested, and said the only way to win change is through nonviolence.",
      "\u201cThis fight is ours, it's our community's, but it belongs to everyone,\u201d Huerta said in Spanish. \u201cWe all have to fight for them.\u201d",
      "Protests broke out last week in Los Angeles in response to reports of immigration raids, and have escalated with thousands taking to the streets of the nation's second-largest city after Trump took the extraordinary move of deploying the National Guard. Over the weekend, demonstrators blocked a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire as law enforcement used tear gas and rubber bullets to control the crowd.",
      "Huerta was arrested while law enforcement officers were executing a federal search warrant at a Los Angeles business suspected of hiring illegal immigrants and falsifying employment papers, a special agent for Homeland Security Investigations, which is part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, wrote in a federal court filing.",
      "A crowd of people including Huerta gathered outside the business yelling at the officers. Huerta sat down in front of a vehicular gate and encouraged others to walk in circles to try to prevent law enforcement from going in or out, the agent wrote, adding it was clear \u201che and the others had planned in advance of arrival to disrupt the operation.\u201d",
      "A law enforcement officer approached Huerta and told him to leave, then put his hands on Huerta to move him out of the way of a vehicle, the agent wrote. Huerta pushed back and the officer pushed Huerta to the ground and arrested him, according to the filing.",
      "\u201cLet me be clear: I don\u2019t care who you are\u2014if you impede federal agents, you will be arrested and prosecuted,\u201d Bill Essayli, U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles, said in a post on the social platform X. \u201cNo one has the right to assault, obstruct, or interfere with federal authorities carrying out their duties.\u201d",
      "Messages left for Huerta\u2019s attorney, Marilyn Bednarski, have not been returned.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and California\u2019s two Democratic senators wrote a letter to federal officials demanding answers regarding Huerta\u2019s arrest. California Sen. Adam Schiff attended Huerta\u2019s bond hearing.",
      "\u201cIt is deeply troubling that a U.S. citizen, union leader, and upstanding member of the Los Angeles community continues to be detained by the federal government for exercising his rights to observe immigration enforcement,\u201d the senators wrote.",
      "Huerta has worked for the SEIU for more than 25 years and was elected president of SEIU California, which has more than 750,000 members, in 2022. He was honored during the Obama administration for his efforts to build an immigrant integration program that included English classes for union members.",

      "On Sunday evening, a large group of inmates at Trousdale Turner Correctional Center from several housing units left their cells and accessed an inner yard, becoming \u201cdisruptive and confrontational\u201d and refusing to follow the staff's directions, according to CoreCivic spokesperson Ryan Gustin. The prison in Hartsville, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Nashville, is the subject of an ongoing U.S. Department of Justice investigation.",
      "One correctional officer was assaulted and released from the hospital. Three inmates were being treated for minor injuries, Gustin said.",
      "The prison's staff used chemical agents on the inmates, who were secured by early Monday morning. They did not reach the perimeter and state troopers and local law enforcement officers were positioned outside the facility. The Tennessee Highway Patrol deployed about 75 troopers and the agency remained on site overnight until \u201cevery prisoner had been accounted for,\u201d Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security spokesperson Jason Pack said.",
      "The prison remained on lockdown while CoreCivic and the Tennessee Department of Correction investigate the riot, Gustin said.",
      "The incident followed an assault by two Trousdale inmates Saturday that injured a correctional officer who remains at the hospital, Gustin said.",
      "Last August, the U.S. Department of Justice announced an investigation into the Trousdale prison after years of \u201creports of physical assaults, sexual assaults, murders and unchecked flow of contraband and severe staffing shortages,\u201d according to then-U.S. Attorney Henry Leventis. The department confirmed Monday the investigation remains ongoing.",
      "Tennessee\u2019s corrections agency has fined CoreCivic $37.7 million across four prisons since 2016, including for understaffing violations. Records obtained by The Associated Press also show the company has spent more than $4.4 million to settle about 80 lawsuits and out-of-court complaints alleging mistreatment \u2014 including at least 22 inmate deaths \u2014 at four Tennessee prisons and two jails since 2016.",
      "The state comptroller released scathing audits in 2017, 2020 and 2023.",
      "The Brentwood, Tennessee-based company has defended itself by pointing to industry-wide problems with hiring and keeping workers. CoreCivic has said it offers hiring incentives and strategically backfills with workers from other facilities nationally.",
      "Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee's administration has stood by CoreCivic.",
      "However, the Republican-led Legislature this year showed its concern by unanimously passing a bill that would move 10% of inmates out of a private prison each time the annual death rate is twice as high as a comparable state-run facility. Lee signed the legislation. Department of Correction spokesperson Sarah Gallagher said the agency is developing a procedure to calculate and report the death rate for 2025 under the new law.",
      "The legislation was spurred by the advocacy of Tim Leeper, a roofing businessman who has attended the same local Rotary Club as the two Republicans who ultimately sponsored the bill, Rep. Clark Boyd and Sen. Mark Pody. Leeper's son Kylan was an inmate at Trousdale when he died of a fentanyl overdose. His family has sued CoreCivic over his death.",

      "Oklahoma prosecutors say they will retry longtime death row inmate Richard Glossip a third time for his role in the 1997 killing of his former boss",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- Oklahoma prosecutors will retry longtime death row inmate Richard Glossip a third time for his role in the 1997 killing of his former boss, Attorney General Gentner Drummond said Monday.",
      "The decision comes after the U.S. Supreme Court in February tossed Glossip\u2019s conviction and death sentence. The court determined the original prosecutors in the case allowed a key witness to give testimony they knew to be false, violating Glossip\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial.",
      "Glossip, who had long maintained his innocence, was twice convicted and sentenced to death for the killing of Oklahoma City motel owner Barry Van Treese in what prosecutors alleged was a murder-for-hire killing. Another man, Justin Sneed, admitted robbing Van Treese and beating him to death with a baseball bat, but testified that he did so after Glossip promised to pay him $10,000. Sneed was the state\u2019s key witness against Glossip and was sentenced to life in prison.",
      "After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Drummond, acknowledged retrying the case more than 25 years later would be difficult. Drummond had taken the unusual step of asking the court to overturn Glossip\u2019s conviction, arguing that while he believed Glossip had a role in the killing, he did not believe he had received a fair trial.",
      "\u201cI do not believe Richard Glossip is innocent,\u201d Drummond said after the high court\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe mission of this office is to seek justice, not to defend the prosecution.\u201d",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote for five of the high court's justices, said additional prosecutorial misconduct, including interfering with Sneed\u2019s testimony, destroying evidence and withholding witness statements, further undermined confidence in the verdict.",
      "During his time on death row, courts in Oklahoma set nine different execution dates for Glossip, and he came so close to being put to death that he had three separate last meals. In 2015, he was being held in a cell next to Oklahoma\u2019s execution chamber, waiting to be strapped to a gurney and injected with drugs that would kill him.",
      "But the scheduled time for his execution came and went. And behind the walls of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, prison officials were scrambling after learning one of the lethal drugs they received to carry out the procedure didn\u2019t match the execution protocols. The drug mix-up ultimately led to a nearly seven-year moratorium on executions in Oklahoma.",

      "Sixteen states have sued the Trump administration over its plan to allow the sale of forced-reset triggers and return seized devices",
      "Sixteen states have sued the Trump administration over its plan to allow the sale of forced-reset triggers that make semiautomatic rifles fire more rapidly and return devices already seized to their owners.",
      "The suit announced Monday argues that returning the triggers would violate federal law, pose a threat to residents and law enforcement and worsen gun violence. It was filed in federal court in Maryland.",
      "There had been several legal battles over the devices, which replace the typical trigger on an AR-15-style rifle. The Biden administration had previously argued the triggers qualify as machine guns under federal law because constant finger pressure on the triggers will keep a rifle firing, essentially creating an illegal machine gun.",
      "Rare Breed Triggers, the maker of the devices, had argued that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was wrong in its classification and ignored demands to stop selling the triggers before being sued by the Biden administration.",
      "The Justice Department reached a deal announced last month to allow the sale of forced-reset triggers with Rare Breed Triggers, which was previously represented by David Warrington, Trump\u2019s current White House counsel.",
      "Under the settlement, Rare Breed Triggers agreed not to develop such devices to be used on handguns, according to the Justice Department. The settlement requires the ATF to return triggers that it had seized or that owners had voluntarily surrendered to the government.",
      "The states' lawsuit is being led by the attorneys general of Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey. Other states involved are Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, along with the District of Columbia.",

    "story": [
      "If President Donald Trump's budget proposal wins final congressional approval, funding will be slashed for tribal colleges and universities",
      "In President Donald Trump's budget request, he's proposing slashing funding for tribal colleges and universities, including eliminating support for the country's only federally funded college for contemporary Native American arts.",
      "If the budget is approved by Congress, beginning in October, the more than $13 million in annual appropriations for the Institute for American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico, would be reduced to zero. It would be the first time in nearly 40 years that the congressionally chartered school would not receive federal support, said Robert Martin, the school's president.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t wipe out 63 years of our history and what we\u2019ve accomplished with one budget,\u201d Martin said on Friday. \u201cI just can\u2019t understand or comprehend why they would do something like this.\u201d",
      "The college, founded in 1962, has provided affordable education to thousands of Native artists and culture bearers, including U.S. poet laureate Joy Harjo, painter T.C. Cannon and bestselling novelist Tommy Orange. It's the only four-year degree fine arts institution in the world devoted to contemporary Native American and Alaskan Native arts, according to its website.",
      "Martin said he has spoken with members of Congress from both major political parties who have assured him they'll work to keep the institute's budget level for the next fiscal year, but he worries the morale of students and staff will be affected. Martin said he also spoke with staff in the office of U.S. Rep. Tom Cole, a member of the Chickasaw Nation and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. Cole, a Republican and former member of IAIA's board of trustees and a longtime advocate in Congress for funding that supports tribal citizens, was unavailable for comment.",
      "Breana Brave Heart, a junior studying arts and business, said the proposal shocked her and made her wonder: \u201cWill I be able to continue my education at IAIA with these budget cuts?\u201d Brave Heart said she started organizing with other students to contact members of Congress. \u201cIAIA is under attack,\" she said, \"and I need other students to know this.\u201d",
      "Martin said that amid the Republican Trump administration's crackdown on federal policies and funding that support diversity, equity and inclusion, trust responsibilities and treaty rights owed to tribal nations have also come under attack.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a problem for us and many other organizations when you\u2019ve got that DEI initiative which really is not applicable to us, because we\u2019re not a racial category, we\u2019re a political status as a result of the treaties,\" he said. \u201cWe\u2019re easily identified as what this administration might refer to as a \u2018woke\u2019.\u201d",
      "Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico said the cuts are another example of the Trump administration \u201cturning its back on Native communities and breaking our trust responsibilities.\u201d",
      "\"As a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, I remain committed to keeping IAIA fully funded and will continue working with appropriators and the New Mexico Congressional Delegation to ensure its future,\u201d Luj\u00e1n said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The congressional budget bill includes roughly $3.75 trillion in tax cuts, extending the expiring 2017 individual income tax breaks and temporarily adding new ones that Trump campaigned on. The revenue loss would be partially offset by nearly $1.3 trillion in reduced federal spending elsewhere, namely through Medicaid and food assistance.",
      "A Jan. 30 order from the Interior Department titled \u201cEnding DEI Programs and Gender Ideology Extremism\u201d stated that any efforts to eradicate diversity, equity and inclusion in the department\u2019s policy should exclude trust obligations to tribal nations.",
      "However, earlier this year, several staff members at the other two congressionally chartered schools in the country \u2014 the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Haskell Indian Nations University in Kansas \u2014 were laid off as part of Trump's push to downsize the federal workforce. In a lawsuit filed in March, both institutions reported that some staff and faculty were rehired, but the Bureau of Indian Education notified those people that might be temporary and they may be laid off again.",
      "\u201cIt shows what a president\u2019s values and priorities are, and that\u2019s been hard,\u201d said Ahniwake Rose, president of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, an organization that represents more than 30 Tribal Colleges and Universities. \"That\u2019s been hard for our staff, our students, our faculty to see that the priority of the administration through the Department of Interior might not be on tribal colleges.\"",
      "In its budget request this year, the Interior Department is proposing reducing funding to the BIE's post secondary programs by more than 80%, and that would have a devastating affect on tribal colleges and universities, or TCUs, which rely on the federal government for most of their funding, said Rose. Most TCUs offer tribal citizens a tuition-free higher education, she said, and funding them is a moral and fiduciary responsibility the federal government owes tribal nations.",
      "In the many treaties the U.S. signed with tribal nations, it outlined several rights owed to them \u2014 like land rights, health care and education through departments established later, like the BIE. Trust responsibilities are the legal and moral obligations the U.S. has to protect and uphold those rights.",
      "The Interior Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

A statement released by the American Medical Association said it \"upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives.\" The American Academy of Pediatrics called it\u00a0part of an \"escalating effort by the Administration to silence independent medical expertise and stoke distrust in lifesaving vaccines.\"",
      "It comes after months of criticism over how Kennedy has wielded his authority and platform as the head of the nation's public health agencies, including\u00a0ordering changes to COVID-19 vaccine guidance, terminating bird flu vaccine\u00a0research funding, forcing out federal vaccines officials and spreading myths about\u00a0measles shots.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration wants to shutter the CDC's National Asthma Control Program, which provides millions in funding to state-administered initiatives aimed at fighting the disease.",
    "story": [
      "Esther Bejarano's son was 11 months old when asthma landed him in the hospital. She didn't know what had triggered his symptoms \u2014 neither she nor her husband had asthma \u2014 but she suspected it was the pesticides sprayed on the agricultural fields near her family's home.",
      "Pesticides are a known contributor to asthma and are commonly used where Bejarano lives in California's Imperial Valley, a landlocked region that straddles two counties on the U.S.-Mexico border and is one of the main producers of the nation's winter crops. It also has some of the worst air pollution in the nation and one of the highest rates of childhood asthma emergency room visits in the state, according to data collected by the California Department of Public Health.",
      "Bejarano has since learned to manage her now-19-year-old son's asthma and works at Comite Civico del Valle, a local rights organization focused on environmental justice in the Imperial Valley. The organization trains health care workers to educate patients on proper asthma management, enabling them to avoid hospitalization and eliminate triggers at home. The course is so popular that there's a waiting list, Bejarano said.",
      "But the group's Asthma Management Academy program and similar initiatives nationwide face extinction with the Trump administration's mass layoffs, grant cancellations, and proposed budget cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency. Asthma experts fear the cumulative impact of the reductions could result in more ER visits and deaths, particularly for children and people in low-income communities \u2014 populations disproportionately vulnerable to the disease.",
      "\"Asthma is a preventive condition,\" Bejarano said. \"No one should die of asthma.\"",
      "Asthma can block airways, making it hard to breathe, and in severe cases can cause death if not treated quickly. Nearly 28 million people in the U.S. have asthma, and about 10 people still die every day from the disease, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.",
      "In May, the White House released a budget proposal that would permanently shutter\u00a0the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Asthma Control Program, which was already gutted by federal health department layoffs in April. It's unclear whether Congress will approve the closure.",
      "Last year, the program allotted $33.5 million to state-administered initiatives in 27 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C., to help communities with asthma education. The funding is distributed in four-year grant cycles, during which the programs receive up to $725,000 each annually.",
      "Comite Civico del Valle's academy in Southern California, a clinician workshop in Houston, and asthma medical management training in Allentown, Pennsylvania \u2014 ranked the most challenging U.S. city to live in with asthma \u2014 are among the programs largely surviving on these grants. The first year of the current grant cycle ends Aug. 31, and it's unknown whether funding will continue beyond then.",
      "Data suggests that the CDC's National Asthma Control Program has had a significant impact. The agency's own research has shown that the program saves $71 in health care costs for every $1 invested. And the asthma death rate decreased 44% between the 1999 launch of the program and 2021, according to the American Lung Association.",
      "\"Losing support from the CDC will have devastating impacts on asthma programs in states and communities across the country, programs that we know are improving the lives of millions of people with asthma,\" said Anne Kelsey Lamb, director of the Public Health Institute's Regional Asthma Management and Prevention program. \"And the thing is that we know a lot about what works to help people keep their asthma well controlled, and that's why it's so devastating.\"",
      "The Trump administration cited cost savings and efficiency in its April announcement of the cuts to HHS. Requests for comment from the White House and HHS's CDC about cuts to federal asthma and related programs were not answered.",
      "The information wars",
      "Fresno, in the heart of California's Central Valley, is one of the country's top 20 \"asthma capitals,\" with high rates of asthma and related emergencies and deaths. It's home to programs that receive funding through the National Asthma Control Program. Health care professionals there also rely on another aspect of the program that is under threat if it's shuttered: countrywide data.",
      "The federal asthma program collects information on asthma rates and offers a tool to study prevalence and rates of death from the disease, see what populations are most affected, and assess state and local trends. Asthma educators and health care providers worry that the loss of these numbers could be the biggest impact of the cuts, because it would mean a dearth of information crucial to forming educated recommendations and treatment plans.",
      "\"How do we justify the services we provide if the data isn't there?\" said Graciela Anaya, director of community health at the Central California Asthma Collaborative in Fresno.",
      "Mitchell Grayson, chair of the Asthma and Allergy Foundation's Medical Scientific Council, is similarly concerned.",
      "\"My fear is we're going to live in a world that is frozen in Jan. 19, 2025, as far as data, because that was the last time you know that this information was safely collected,\" he said.",
      "Grayson, an allergist who practices in Columbus, Ohio, said he also worries government websites will delete important recommendations that asthma sufferers avoid heavy air pollution, get annual flu shots, and get COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Disproportionate risk",
      "Asthma disproportionately affects communities of color because of \"historic structural issues,\" said Lynda Mitchell, CEO of the Asthma and Allergy Network, citing a higher likelihood of living in public housing or near highways and other pollution sources.",
      "She and other experts in the field said cuts to diversity initiatives across federal agencies, combined with the rollback of environmental protections, will have an outsize impact on these at-risk populations.",
      "In December, the Biden administration awarded nearly $1.6 billion through the EPA's Community Change Grants program to help disadvantaged communities address pollution and climate threats. The Trump administration moved to cut this funding in March. The grant freezes, which have been temporarily blocked by the courts, are part of a broader effort by the Trump EPA to eliminate aid to environmental justice programs across the agency.",
      "In 2023 and 2024, the National Institutes of Health's Climate Change and Health Initiative received $40 million for research, including on the link between asthma and climate change. The Trump administration has moved to cut that money. And a March memo essentially halted all NIH grants focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI \u2014 funds many of the asthma programs serving low-income communities rely on to operate.",
      "On top of those cuts, environmental advocates like Isabel Gonz\u00e1lez Whitaker of Memphis, Tennessee, worry that the proposed reversals of environmental regulations will further harm the health of communities like hers that are already reeling from the effects of climate change. Shelby County, home to Memphis, recently received an F on the American Lung Association's annual report card for having so many high ozone days. Gonz\u00e1lez Whitaker is director of EcoMadres, a program within the national organization Moms for Clean Air that advocates for better environmental conditions for Latino communities.",
      "\"Urgent asthma needs in communities are getting defunded at a time when I just see things getting worse in terms of deregulation,\" said Gonz\u00e1lez Whitaker, who took her 12-year-old son to the hospital because of breathing issues for the first time this year. \"We're being assaulted by this data and science, which is clearly stating that we need to be doing better around preserving the regulations.\"",
      "Back in California's Imperial Valley \u2014 where the majority-Hispanic, working-class population surrounds California's largest lake, the Salton Sea \u2014 is an area called Bombay Beach. Bejarano calls it the \"forgotten community.\" Homes there lack clean running water, because of naturally occurring arsenic in the groundwater, and residents frequently experience a smell like rotten eggs blowing off the drying lakebed, exposing decades of pesticide-tinged dirt.",
      "In 2022, a 12-year-old girl died in Bombay Beach after an asthma attack. Bejarano said she later learned that the girl's school had recommended that she take part in Comite Civico del Valle's at-home asthma education program. She said the girl was on the waiting list when she died.",
      "\"It hit home. Her death showed the personal need we have here in Imperial County,\" Bejarano said. \"Deaths are preventable. Asthma is reversible. If you have asthma, you should be able to live a healthy life.\"",

      "The legislation, called the \"Higher Wages for American Workers Act,\" would raise the federal standard starting in 2026 and would also call for an increase in subsequent years to match inflation, CBS News has exclusively learned. Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch has signed on as a co-sponsor.",
      "\"For decades, working Americans have seen their wages flatline. One major culprit of this is the failure of the federal minimum wage to keep up with the economic reality facing hard-working Americans every day,\" Hawley said in a statement to CBS News. \"This bipartisan legislation would ensure that workers across America benefit from higher wages.\"",
      "\"We're in the midst of a severe affordability crisis, with families in red and blue states alike struggling to afford necessities like housing and groceries,\" Welch said in a statement to CBS. \"A stagnant federal minimum wage only adds fuel to the fire. Every hard-working American deserves a living wage that helps put a roof over their head and food on the table\u2013$7.25 an hour doesn't even come close.\"",
      "The federal minimum wage currently sits at $7.25 per hour and has not risen since 2009, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.",
      "The move by Hawley puts him at odds with conservative party orthodoxy, which has traditionally opposed a federal minimum wage increase on the grounds that it would be costly for businesses and ultimately, for consumers. But Hawley's pitch is reflective of the party's realignment in the Trump era, where the president's brand of populism has fueled a shift among working-class voters away from Democrats and towards Republicans.",
      "Hawley has been pushing Republicans to embrace this shift. The minimum wage legislation is part of a broader, aspirational package of legislative proposals he dubbed the \"Pro-Worker Framework for the 119th Congress.\" This includes a proposal to help strengthen protections for union jobs, as well as for organizing and collective bargaining.",
      "Earlier this year, he teamed up with Sen. Bernie Sanders to introduce legislation to cap credit card interest rates at 10%. And in the last Congress, he introduced legislation that would require companies with revenues of $1 billion or more to pay their employees at least $15 per hour. In recent weeks, Hawley has been urging his party against cuts to Medicaid benefits in the budget reconciliation bill.",
      "In November, voters in Hawley's home state of Missouri approved a ballot measure to raise the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour, starting in 2026. But the Legislature repealed part of the law that would allow later increases to adjust for inflation.",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump rescinded a Biden-era executive order that raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to $17.75 per hour. At his Senate confirmation hearing in January, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he does not support raising the federal minimum wage, arguing that it is a decision best left up to the states.",

    "story": [
      "Something rare is happening in Hatfield, Pennsylvania, about an hour outside of Philadelphia. The Rodon Group, a privately held plastics injection molding company, is doing what only a few manufacturers in the US are equipped to do: They are making toys.",
      "The facility produces billions of plastic parts every year, among which include window parts, beverage caps, swabs for COVID-19 tests, and, perhaps most iconic, K'nex toy sets.",
      "Michael Araten is the President and CEO of The Rodon Group, which his family founded in 1956. For Araten, the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs has meant one thing, business is booming.",
      "\"Our phone's ringing off the hook, email's up, everything, because people are in panic mode. It reminds me very much of the pandemic, where it's a supply shock.\"",
      "Since Mr. Trump first announced tariffs, Araten has seen demand increase by nearly 50%. The surge comes as consumers strive to navigate the ever-changing tariff landscape.",
      "A U.S. agreement with China, announced in early May\u00a0by the White House, would effectively reduce the level of U.S. taxes still in place on Chinese goods to about 30% from 145%. China meanwhile, has agreed to cut its tariffs on American goods to 10% from 125%.",
      "Despite the agreement, there is still massive uncertainty surrounding Mr. Trump's tariffs. China said the Trump administration is undermining the temporary trade agreement between the two nations by issuing AI chip export control guidelines, stopping the sale of chip design software to China and planning to revoke Chinese student visas.",
      "But the uncertainty isn't just coming from China. The U.S. Court of International Trade\u00a0last month permanently blocked Mr. Trump's 10% tariff assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner, as well as the president's duties on imports from Mexico, Canada and China. However, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.,\u00a0temporarily halted the federal trade court's decision, for now reinstating the levies imposed by the president under an emergency powers law.",
      "If the tariffs do go into effect, Areton believes that a 30% levy is still too high and that the tariffs could impact supplies this holiday season. According to a statement from the United States Toy Association, 77% of toys sold in the United States are made in China.",
      "Major toymaker Basic Fun!, which manufacturers toys like Lincoln Logs, Tonka Trucks and Care Bears, told CBS News it halted the production of all its toys manufactured in China when tariffs went up to 145%, but restarted everything when the tariffs dropped back to 30%. However, the toymaker still expects prices to go up by 10% to 15% later this year.",
      "The Rodon Group has avoided the tariff chaos by using automation to keep production of K'nex toys stateside. The company invested in robots in the 1980s that \"did almost nothing, but could pick stuff up,\" Aretan said. Over the last four decades, the company has continued to invest in robotics, which allowed it to take the advantage away from offshore manufacturers, where labor costs are lower.",
      "According to Araten, an employee at the Rodon Group is able to accomplish what 150 workers overseas are able to accomplish. However, despite believing in automation, Araten says that domestic production will only work if the United States invests in its workforce.",
      "\"It's automation and STEM education. It's that combination. You're going to need talented people,\" insisted Araten from his factory floor.",
      "\"That's what we need to invest in, and that takes time. But whenever we put our mind to something as a nation, we've done it.\"",

      "Apple kicked off its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday with an array of announcements on new features coming this fall via iOS 26, its latest operating system upgrade. Leading the pack is a new user interface enhancement called Liquid Glass.",
      "CEO Tim Cook and other Apple executives used words like \"beautiful,\" \"gorgeous\" and \"delightful\" to describe changes on the horizon for its devices. And while they emphasized a fresh user interface and elevated app features, they also reassured users that the tools would remain familiar and accessible.",
      "Read on for details on the latest bells and whistles coming to Apple's user interface.",
      "iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26",
      "Apple is adopting a new nomenclature for identifying its operating systems, one that is more straightforward than its previous numbering system. Rather than iOS 19, Apple's next iPhone iOS will be called iOS 26 to align with the upcoming year. iOS 26, along with iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 261 are slated to be released as free updates in September 2025.",

      "A hallmark feature of the new OS is\u00a0Liquid Glass, described by the company as an \"expressive material\" meant to mimic the qualities of glass. The dynamic new interface make apps, widgets and docs appear translucent, allowing users to see multiple layers of their screen at once.",
      "Liquid Glass also creates more movement on your interface by morphing into your display. For example, as messages pop up on your home screen, the time display starts to shrink to accommodate them. The color of Liquid Glass also shifts depending on the content on your screen and adapts between light and dark environments.",
      "\"From navigating apps to system experiences like the lock screen notifications and control center app icons have been crafted with multiple layers of Liquid Glass and come to life in light mode, dark mode, colorful, new tints, or an all new clear look,\" said Dye during the company's keynote Monday.",

      "Visual Intelligence, another AI tool, allows users to take a screenshot of an image they see online \u2014 say, a cute sweater they come across on one of their apps \u2014 and then look up where to find a similar design online. They can also ask ChatGPT specific questions about the image, such as, keeping with the example of the sweater, \"What material is this made of?\"",
      "Another feature builds on Apple broad selection of emojis by giving users the power to combine and personalize existing emojis to create their own unique expressions. In their presentation, Apple showed how someone could merge the lightbulb emoji with the sloth emoji to indicate they were the last one to get a joke, for example.",
      "Still lingering on Apple's to do list is new AI integrations for Siri. Apple introduced updates to the voice assistant at last year's conference, but the full suite of upgrades for the voice assistant have yet to take effect. \"We're continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal,\" said senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi on Monday. \"This work needed more time to reach our high quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.\"",

    "story": [
      "The dream of homeownership is fading for millions of Americans.",
      "Figures from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) show that only 24% of housing sales last year were by first-time homebuyers \u2014 that's down from 50% in 2010. The typical purchaser is also older than in the past, with an average age of 38, or about 10 years above historical norms.",
      "Such trends reflect the challenges of climbing on the property ladder as home prices hover near record highs, inventory remains low and with mortgage rates at their highest level in years.",
      "\"There are fewer first-time homebuyers and they are older than we've ever seen, both because of headwinds inside and outside of the housing market,\" NAR deputy chief economist Jessica Lautz told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Opportunity missed",
      "Americans who are shut out from buying their first homes miss out on an opportunity to build wealth through homeownership, Lautz said.",
      "\"It's their biggest asset, and with the delay into homeownership first-time homebuyers are losing about 10 years of housing wealth. And that's for those who can enter into the market,\" she said. \"For those who can't, they lose out on housing wealth by not having that as the biggest asset in their nest egg.\"",
      "Only about 1 in 5 listed homes in March\u00a0were affordable\u00a0for households with $75,000 in annual income, according to a NAR\u00a0analysis\u00a0of property listings. Today, a household with annual income of $50,000 can only afford 8.7% of listings, down from 9.4% a year ago, according to the data.",
      "\"The lack of homes, especially at affordable price points where they would be entering the market, has been plaguing first-time homebuyers for the last several years,\" Lautz said. \"It's been a continual issue, especially with interest rates. It makes the cost of homeownership quite high.\"",
      "Along with inadequate construction of affordable housing, many existing homeowners are reluctant to sell their properties given their lower mortgage rates.",
      "\"People who are homeowners have no motivational factors to move, so that's not freeing up inventory,\" Lautz said. \"It's almost created a hoarding situation for those in low-interest rate mortgages who don't want to separate from them.\"",
      "Financial squeeze",
      "Other factors are making it hard for people to buy a first home. The high cost of rent gets in the way of saving for a down payment, while credit card debt, car loans and child care costs also hold first-time homebuyers back. More recently, meanwhile, the resumption of student loan payments is putting many people under financial pressure.",
      "Some Americans are managing to save enough for a first home by temporarily moving in with family or friends to minimize the cost of rent, Lautz said. But that approach isn't viable for everyone.",
      "\"It has been a pathway to ownership for some. But for someone who is 38-years-old, moving in with mom and dad can get uncomfortable,\" she said. \"For an older homebuyer, that might be less attractive for everyone involved.\"",

      "CBS News Los Angeles reported that several fires were set in dumpsters and trash bins, and at least one store had windows shattered by alleged looters. Dozens of buildings were tagged with graffiti, including the LAPD Headquarters, the U.S. Courthouse and the old Los Angeles Times building.",
      "Footage from the CBS News Los Angeles helicopter showed that multiple windows of the police headquarters had been shattered, as well.",
      "Separately, police in San Francisco issued a statement late Monday saying, \"Thousands participated in demonstrations today that were overwhelmingly peaceful. At the very end of the night, two small groups broke off and committed vandalism and other criminal acts. Detained multiple individuals who refused to comply and made arrests.\" The statement referred to protests\u00a0at the city's Civic Center and in its Mission District.",
      "The protests came just a day after\u00a0154 people were arrested there\u00a0during demonstrations denouncing ICE raids.",
      "L.A. demonstrations intensified",
      "Sunday's protests in Los Angeles, a sprawling city of 4 million people, were centered in several blocks of downtown. It was the third and most intense day of demonstrations against Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown in the region, as the arrival of around 300 Guard troops spurred anger and fear among many residents.",
      "The Guard was deployed specifically to protect federal buildings, including the downtown detention center where protesters concentrated.",
      "McDonnell, the L.A, police chief, said officers were \"overwhelmed\" by the remaining protesters. He said they included regular agitators who show up at demonstrations to cause trouble.",
      "Dozens of people were arrested throughout the weekend.",
      "Mr. Trump responded to McDonnell on Truth Social, telling him to arrest protesters in face masks.",
      "\"Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!\" he wrote.",
      "Starting in the morning, the troops stood shoulder to shoulder, carrying long guns and riot shields as protesters shouted \"shame\" and \"go home.\" After some closely approached the Guard members, another set of uniformed officers advanced on the group, shooting smoke-filled canisters into the street.",
      "Minutes later, L.A. police fired rounds of crowd-control munitions to disperse the protesters, whom they said were assembled unlawfully. Much of the group then moved to block traffic on the 101 Freeway until state patrol officers cleared them from the roadway by late afternoon.",
      "Nearby, at least four self-driving Waymo cars were set on fire, sending large plumes of black smoke into the sky and exploding intermittently as the electric vehicles burned. By evening, police had issued an unlawful assembly order shutting down several blocks of downtown Los Angeles.",
      "Flash-bangs echoed out every few seconds into the evening.",
      "National Guard troops mobilized and Marines activated",
      "The military said Monday that it's\u00a0mobilizing another 2,000 members of the California National Guard to respond to the protests.",
      "Pentagon chief spokesman Sean Parnell\u00a0said on X late Monday\u00a0that the additional troops have been \"called into federal service to support ICE & to enable federal law-enforcement officers to safely conduct their duties.\"",
      "The move adds to 2,000 National Guard troops who were\u00a0called up\u00a0by the president late Saturday to protect federal personnel and property.",
      "The military\u00a0also activated\u00a0about 700 active-duty Marines on Monday to assist the Guard, U.S. Northern Command said in a\u00a0statement. Marines could start arriving in the Los Angeles area as soon as Tuesday, a defense official told CBS News. The Marines are based in Twentynine Palms, a city east of Los Angeles.",
      "Newsom said late Monday on X that California would sue over the deployment of the Marines to L.A.",
      "How the demonstrations started",
      "The arrival of the National Guard followed two days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading on Saturday to Paramount, a heavily Latino city south of the city, and neighboring Compton.",
      "Federal agents arrested immigrants in LA's fashion district, in a Home Depot parking lot and at several other locations on Friday. The next day, they were staging at a Department of Homeland Security office near another Home Depot in Paramount, which drew out protesters who suspected another raid. Federal authorities later said there was no enforcement activity at that Home Depot.",
      "The weeklong tally of immigrant arrests in the LA area climbed above 100, federal authorities said. Many more were arrested while protesting, including a prominent union leader who was accused of impeding law enforcement.",
      "What are officials saying?",
      "Newsom requested that Mr. Trump remove the guard members in a letter Sunday afternoon, calling their deployment a \"serious breach of state sovereignty.\" He was in Los Angeles meeting with local law enforcement and officials.",
      "The deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts.",
      "Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass blamed the increasingly aggressive protests on the president's decision to deploy the Guard, calling it a move designed to enflame tensions. They've both urged protesters to remain peaceful.",
      "\"What we're seeing in Los Angeles is chaos that is provoked by the administration,\" Bass said in an afternoon press conference. \"This is about another agenda, this isn't about public safety.\"",
      "But McDonnell, the LAPD chief, said the protests were following a similar pattern for episodes of civil unrest, with things ramping up in the second and third days.",
      "He pushed back against claims by the Trump administration that the LAPD had failed to help federal authorities when protests broke out Friday after a series of immigration raids. His department responded as quickly as it could, and had not been notified in advance of the raids and therefore was not pre-positioned for protests, he said.",
      "Newsom, meanwhile, has repeatedly said that California authorities had the situation under control. He mocked Mr. Trump for posting a congratulatory message to the Guard on social media before troops had even arrived in Los Angeles, and said on MSNBC that Mr. Trump never floated deploying the Guard during a Friday phone call. He called the president a \"stone-cold liar.\"",
      "The admonishments didn't deter the administration.",
      "\"It's a bald-faced lie for Newsom to claim there was no problem in Los Angeles before President Trump got involved,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement.",
      "Democratic California Rep. Maxine Waters on Sunday strongly rebuked the president's decision to deploy the National Guard, calling the situation \"outrageous\" and \"horrible\" and adding that she believes Mr. Trump is using L.A., a sanctuary city, as an example.",
      "\"He's using deportation as a way to enhance his position with all those right-wingers out there who do not want this country to be a country of people coming from other places,\" the Democrat told a reporter outside the Metropolitan Detention Center. \"I think he's up to creating martial law.\"",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris also condemned the Trump administration's actions in L.A. on Sunday, calling the deployment of the National Guard \"a dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos.\"",
      "\"In addition to the recent ICE raids in Southern California and across our nation, it is part of the Trump Administration's cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division,\" said Harris, who also previously served as a senator and attorney general of California. \"This Administration's actions are not about public safety \u2014 they're about stoking fear. Fear of a community demanding dignity and due process.\"",
      "Some perspective on the protests",
      "The protests didn't reach the size of past demonstrations that brought the National Guard to Los Angeles, including the Watts and Rodney King riots, and the 2020 protests against police violence, in which Newsom requested the assistance of federal troops.",
      "The last time the National Guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.",

The protests lasted through the weekend, with President Trump announcing Saturday that he would be deploying the National Guard \u2014 over California Gov. Gavin Newsom's objections.",
      "According to a Homeland Security Investigation officer's sworn affidavit, Huerta sat down in front of a vehicular gate to a staging ground for ICE operations that were ongoing nearby.",
      "The complaint alleges he yelled to the protestors \"stop the vehicles,\" and \"it's a public sidewalk, they can't stop us.\"",
      "The officer then says he asked Huerta to move from the gate so that cars could get in and out of the facility, and Huerta replied, \"What are you going to do? You can't arrest all of us.\"",
      "After a law enforcement van attempted to get into the site through the gate that was blocked by protestors, Huerta, the officer says, was \"being uncooperative\" after being asked\u00a0 to move out of the path before the officer attempted to physically move him out of the way. The officer then says Huerta pushed back, and as a result, Huerta was arrested.",
      "According to the union, Huerta was injured during the arrest and was hospitalized as a result.",
      "After he was released from the hospital, Huerta said in a statement through the SEIU, \"What happened to me is not about me. This is about something much bigger. This is about how we as a community stand together and resist the injustice that's happening. Hard-working people, and members of our family and our community, are being treated like criminals. We all collectively have to object to this madness because this is not justice. This is injustice. And we all have to stand on the right side of justice.\"",
      "Newsom and other Democratic leaders denounced the arrest, with Newsom writing in a statement that Huerta is a \"respected leader, a patriot, and an advocate for working people.\"",

      "The administration and Newsom have sharply criticized each other over the handling of the Los Angeles protests, which were sparked by Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions in the city. Mr. Trump has accused Newsom of failing to deal with violence and ordered Marines and National Guard troops to the city. Newsom responded with a lawsuit over the troop deployments and argues Mr. Trump is inflaming the situation.",

      "It comes after months of criticism over how Kennedy has wielded his authority and platform as the head of the nation's public health agencies, including\u00a0ordering changes to COVID-19 vaccine guidance, terminating bird flu vaccine\u00a0research funding, forcing out federal vaccines officials and spreading myths about\u00a0measles shots.",

      "On the first day of his second administration, Mr. Trump directed officials to perform a security review of high-risk regions and make recommendations for where immigration and travel restrictions should be imposed.",
      "The president said the factors considered were \"the largescale presence of terrorists, failure to cooperate on visa security, inability to verify travelers' identities, inadequate record keeping of criminal histories and persistently high rates of illegal visa overstays, and other things.\"",
      "\"Very simply, we cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter the United States,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The president cited the recent attack in Boulder, where an Egyptian national was charged, as part of the justification for the bans. Egypt is not among the countries on the White House's list. But the proclamation directed officials to assess the \"adequacy\" of Egypt's vetting policies \"in light of recent events.\"",
      "Are there exceptions to the new travel ban?",
      "The president's decree contains certain exemptions, including for U.S. permanent residents and the spouses and children of U.S. citizens who have \"clear and convincing evidence of identity and family relationship.\"",
      "The proclamation also outlines exemptions for Afghans who assisted American forces and have special visas; diplomats; athletes coming to the U.S. for the World Cup, the Olympics and other major sporting events; dual nationals with a passport from a country not listed in the president's decree; and for adoptions.",
      "Mr. Trump said the list could be revised if countries make \"material improvements,\" and new countries could be added \"as threats emerge around the world.\"",
      "Did Trump do this before?",
      "The president's actions follow a series of travel bans issued during his first administration that initially targeted predominantly Muslim countries. Like those orders, his latest proclamation could be subject to lawsuits, although the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the revised ban from his first term, which the White House noted in a fact sheet outlining his second-term bans.",
      "The president touted his first-term travel bans in his video statement released Wednesday.",
      "\"In my first term, my powerful travel restrictions were one of our most successful policies, and they were a key part of preventing major foreign terror attacks on American soil,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "In January 2017, Mr. Trump signed a travel ban restricting the entry of most citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The ban sparked widespread outcry, creating chaos at airports and prompting legal challenges, as opponents argued the ban was discriminatory.",
      "Then in March 2017, Mr. Trump removed Iraq from the list and added Chad, Venezuela and North Korea. The president expanded the ban in 2020, adding immigration restrictions for nationals of Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Myanmar and Kyrgyzstan. Chad was later removed from the list.",
      "The third iteration of the president's first-term ban was upheld by the Supreme Court in the summer of 2018.

      "The insect was first discovered in the U.S. in 1932 in Georgia, but has only recently started to \"cause problems in North America after being relatively unnoticed for many years,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "The pest has now been detected all the way from Washington state to Florida, according to the site\u00a0antmaps.org as well as Mississippi State University, and the ant is recently getting more attention in Texas.",
      "Suiter says Asian needle ants are \"sneaky\" because they are less than a quarter of an inch long and are adept at hiding.",
      "\"Unlike many invasive species that tend to colonize areas in the wake of natural or human disturbance, Asian needle ants are capable of invading undisturbed forest areas where they nest under and within logs and other debris, under stones, and in leaf litter,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "Environmental impacts",
      "According to Suiter, Asian needle ants wreak havoc in native environments.",
      "\"They outcompete other ant species that are important to the ecology of that area,\" he says.",
      "Asian needle ants prey on other insects and are capable of displacing ant species that are critical for seed dispersal, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Researchers have documented large decreases in seed dispersal in forests where Asian needle ants are present.",
      "\"Thus, this invasive species could have dramatic, long-term negative effects on forest understory,\" the service says.",
      "What should people do if they see Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are about 0.2 inches in length, and dark brown or black with the end of the antennae and the legs being a lighter orange-brown, the U.S. Forest Service says. Other ant species can look similar, \"so it takes an experienced eye to positively identify them,\" the service says.",
      "Suiter says that you can send a photograph or a specimen to a local University of Georgia Extension office, which can help with identification. The public can also contact a professional to come out and bait for the ants, he says.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service advises people to avoid the pest and to be especially vigilant in areas with logs, rotting wood or rocks where the ants can nest.",
      "\"Unfortunately, as with many invasive species, it appears Asian needle ants are here to stay,\" the service says.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 21:16:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A private lunar lander from Tokyo-based company ispace was aiming for a touchdown in the unexplored far north with a mini rover.",
    "story": [
      "Four-and-a-half months after launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket, a privately-built Japanese lander attempted to touch down on the moon Thursday, but telemetry indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity moments before communications were lost. The data suggested a mission-ending crash landing.",
      "\"Based on the currently available data, the Mission Control Center has been able to confirm the following: The laser rangefinder used to measure the distance to the lunar surface experienced delays in obtaining valid measurement values,\" ispace, builder of the Resilience lander, said in a statement.",
      "\"As a result, the lander was unable to decelerate sufficiently to reach the required speed for the planned lunar landing. Based on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface.\"",
      "After unsuccessful attempts to re-establish communications, flight controllers in Tokyo uplinked commands to reboot the Resilience lander's flight computer. But there was no response.",
      "\"Given that there is currently no prospect of a successful lunar landing, our top priority is to swiftly analyze the telemetry data we have obtained thus far and work diligently to identify the cause,\" said ispace founder and CEO Takeshi Hakamada.",
      "\"We will strive to restore trust by providing a report of the findings to our shareholders, payload customers, (mission) partners, government officials and all supporters of ispace.\"",
      "The landing attempt came two years after ispace's first lander malfunctioned during the final stages of its descent to the moon, making a similar hard landing. But Hakamada said it was too early to establish any common cause and that engineers needed more time to analyze the telemetry that made it back to Earth.",
      "Carrying cameras, a few science payloads, a tiny rover and even an art project, Resilience   fired its thrusters just after 2:10 p.m. EDT to begin the 66-minute descent from a 62-mile-high circular orbit to touchdown near the center of Mare Frigoris \u2014 the Sea of Cold \u2014 in the moon's northern hemisphere at 60 degrees north latitude.",
      "All appeared to be going smoothly when, around 3:17 p.m. \u2014 the projected landing time \u2014 telemetry suddenly ceased. The last data received indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity and an altitude of 630 feet above the surface.",
      "\"At this moment, we have not yet been able to establish communication with Resilience, but ispace engineers in our Mission Control Center are continuing to work to contact the lander,\" the company posted on X just after 5 p.m.",
      "\"We will share an update with the latest information in a media announcement in the next few hours. Thank you for your patience -- please check back with us soon.\" Three hours later, officials announced the landing failure during a news briefing.",
      "The primary goals of the mission were to land on the moon and deploy the small micro rover Tenacious. The rover, in turn, carried the art project, a tiny model of a Swedish house, designed by artist Mikael Genberg. The traditionally styled red-and-white house measures just 4.7 inches long, 4 inches high and weighs just 3.5 ounces.",
      "Asked why he took on the project, which required years of planning, fundraising and engineering, Genberg said \"we have done as human beings things from time to time that (do not) seemingly have a purpose beyond just being creative.\"",
      "\"The Eiffel Tower, for instance, I mean it's a stupid thing to build,\" he said. \"Today, it has a purpose as maybe the most important thing to make Paris the most visited city in the world.\"",
      "While the \"moonhouse\" could survive for thousands if not millions of years in the airless environment of the moon, its custom paint was expected to fade in the sun's harsh radiation, and lunar dust will slowly coat its surface. Genberg joked that he would happily await an invitation to repaint it.",
      "Ispace is one of a handful of companies attempting to provide non-government transportation services to the moon for a variety of payloads ranging from science instruments to technology demonstrations.",
      "But as it turns out, getting low-cost spacecraft to the moon's surface is extremely difficult.",
      "Ispace tried and\u00a0failed in 2023\u00a0when its first lander ran out of propellant nearing the surface, dropping to a \"hard\" crash landing. Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology launched its\u00a0Peregrine lander in January 2024, but the spacecraft suffered a propulsion system leak and never made it to the moon.",
      "Houston-based Intuitive Machines successfully put two landers down on the lunar surface\u00a0in 2024, and again\u00a0earlier this year, but both spacecraft tipped over on touchdown. While each one survived its landing, neither was able to accomplish all of its pre-flight objectives.",
      "Before Thursday, only Firefly Aerospace had successfully touched down and carried out its mission, landing the\u00a0Blue Ghost spacecraft on March 2, 53 years after the final Apollo mission.",
      "Resilience and Blue Ghost\u00a0were launched atop a single SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Jan. 15. The Blue Ghost lander took a direct route to the moon and carried out a successful touchdown, operating for a full two-week lunar \"day.\"",
      "Resilience followed a longer, low-energy trajectory that carried it well past its target, using the moon's gravity to bring it back to an initially elliptical orbit and finally, using its thrusters, to the 62-mile circular orbit that set the stage for descent.",

    "story": [
      "The fungus labeled a \"potential agroterrorism weapon\" in a recent arrest touted by the Trump administration likely originated in North America and is already widely prevalent around the country, a researcher who studied the fungus for the federal government says.",
      "University of Michigan researcher Yunqing Jian and her boyfriend, Zunyong Liu, were charged with trying to smuggle strains of a fungus called Fusarium graminearum into the United States. Jian worked at the University of Michigan, according to officials, and Liu works at a Chinese university. The two have co-authored research into the fungus.",
      "\"I can confirm that the FBI arrested a Chinese national within the United States who allegedly smuggled a dangerous biological pathogen into the country,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said Tuesday in a post\u00a0on X.",
      "According to charging documents in the case, Liu told customs officers he was trying to continue his research with the strains at the University of Michigan lab that Jian worked in, skirting the rules that require paperwork and safeguards to safely import fungi for studies.",
      "F. graminearum is already widely prevalent across the U.S. in native grasses around the country as well as crops, scientists say. It spreads and thrives usually during wet weather, causing a common crop disease called Fusarium head blight or head scab, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service.",
      "\"It's extremely prevalent in North America. It likely arose in North America, so it's not like a foreign agent coming in. And it's already causing a lot of problems in U.S. agriculture,\" Harold Kistler, an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota, told CBS News.",
      "Kistler said scientists believe F. graminearum likely originated in North America because all of its closest relatives have been found on the continent.",
      "\"Graminearum itself is distributed worldwide, and likely because of the distribution of grain from North America worldwide,\" he said.",
      "Kistler previously worked as a researcher for the USDA's Agricultural Research Service, studying fungi like F. graminearum and the crop disease it causes. While at the agency, he co-authored research with Liu and Jian uncovering new molecular clues to how the disease might be mitigated.",
      "\"It's a real problem. The problem is because there's no naturally occurring resistance to the disease. And people have been trying for decades to find resistance. It's just a tough nut to crack,\" Kistler said of the head blight caused by F. graminearum.",
      "Farmers in the U.S. rely on a number of methods to mitigate the risk of F. graminearum, including the use of fungicides, though scientists have worried about the possibility of mutations that could make the fungicides less effective.",
      "\"The fungicides are not cheap. So it's extra cost to farmers. But it's worth it because, without it, their crops could be completely lost. Not only due to yield reduction, but because what grain they may have would be contaminated with these toxins,\" Kistler said.",
      "Billions of dollars were lost to epidemics caused by the fungus in the 1990s, researchers and agriculture officials estimate. The Food and Drug Administration monitors for the toxins that are produced by fungi like F. graminearum, including deoxynivalenol, also called vomitoxin or DON, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea in humans who ingest too much of it.",
      "\"It is not possible to completely avoid the presence of DON in wheat. DON is sometimes found in wheat grown under normal weather conditions, however, the fungus thrives in cool, wet conditions,\" the FDA said in a 2010 advisory to states and grain groups.",
      "Kistler said U.S. distributors also test grain for the presence of the toxins to prevent there being too much of it in the food supply.",
      "\"If it's too high, they will reject it. They won't buy it. Or they will reduce the amount that they'll pay for it. If it's just marginal, they can blend it with grain that doesn't have the toxin to get below the limit of what's considered safe,\" he said.",

    "summary": "It had not been thought possible that such tiny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
    "story": [
      "Astronomers announced Wednesday they have discovered a massive planet orbiting a tiny star, a bizarre pairing that has stumped scientists.",
      "Most of the stars across the Milky Way are small red dwarfs like TOI-6894, which has only 20% the mass of our sun.",
      "It had not been thought possible that such puny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
      "But an international team of astronomers have detected the unmistakable signature of a gas giant planet orbiting the undersized TOI-6894, according to a study in the journal Nature Astronomy. This makes the star the smallest star yet known to host a gas giant.",
      "The planet has a slightly larger radius than Saturn, but only half its mass. It orbits its star in a little over three days.",
      "The astronomers discovered the planet when searching through more than 91,000 low-mass red dwarfs observed by NASA's TESS space telescope. Its existence was then confirmed by ground-based telescopes, including Chile's Very Large Telescope.",
      "\"The fact that this star hosts a giant planet has big implications for the total number of giant planets we estimate exist in our galaxy,\" study co-author Daniel Bayliss of the UK's Warwick University said in a statement.",
      "Another co-author, Vincent Van Eylen, of University College London, said it was an \"intriguing discovery.\"",
      "\"We don't really understand how a star with so little mass can form such a massive planet!\" he said. \"This is one of the goals of the search for more exoplanets. By finding planetary systems different from our solar system, we can test our models and better understand how our own solar system formed.\"",
      "Planet is unusually cold",
      "The most prominent theory for how planets form is called core accretion.",
      "The process begins when a ring of gas and dust \u2014 called a protoplanetary disc \u2014 which surrounds a newly formed star builds up into a planetary core. This core attracts more gas that forms an atmosphere, eventually snowballing into a gas giant.",
      "Under this theory, it is difficult for low-mass stars to host giant planets because there is not enough gas and dust to begin building a core in the first place.",
      "A rival theory proposes that these planets instead form when their protoplanetary disc becomes gravitationally unstable and breaks up, with the collapsing gas and dust forming a planet.",
      "However neither theory seems to explain the existence of the newly discovered planet, TOI-6894b, the researchers said.",
      "The planet also interests scientists because it is strangely cold.",
      "Most of the gas giants discovered outside our solar system so far have been what are known as \"hot Jupiters,\" where temperatures soar well over 1,000 degrees Celsius. But the newly discovered planet appears to be under 150C, the researchers said.",
      "\"Temperatures are low enough that atmospheric observations could even show us ammonia, which would be the first time it is found in an exoplanet atmosphere,\" said study co-author Amaury Triaud of Birmingham University.",
      "The James Webb space telescope is scheduled to turn its powerful gaze toward the planet in the next year, which could help uncover some more mysteries of this strange planet.",
      "Recent cosmic discoveries",
      "The spotting of the giant planet orbiting the undersized star marks the latest in a string of recent celestial discoveries.",
      "Last month, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive \"Planet Nine\" said they instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, making it three times smaller than Pluto.",
      "Also in May, an international team reported that a newly found celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it's shooting out radio waves.",
      "Meanwhile, scientists announced recently that a new planetarium show about the Milky Way helped them unlock one of the solar system's many secrets. Experts at the American Museum of Natural History in New York were fine-tuning a scene about the Oort Cloud that's far beyond Pluto. Scientists have never glimpsed this region, but when museum experts projected their scene onto the planetarium dome, created using simulation data, they saw a spiral shape.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",

The show features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker, including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",
      "No matter how striking and beautiful the visuals of the show, the museum was committed to making it scientifically accurate. That's what created the perfect conditions to stumble upon something new, said the museum's Carter Emmart.",

      "After unsuccessful attempts to re-establish communications, flight controllers in Tokyo uplinked commands to reboot the Resilience lander's flight computer. But there was no response.",
      "\"Given that there is currently no prospect of a successful lunar landing, our top priority is to swiftly analyze the telemetry data we have obtained thus far and work diligently to identify the cause,\" said ispace founder and CEO Takeshi Hakamada.",
      "\"We will strive to restore trust by providing a report of the findings to our shareholders, payload customers, (mission) partners, government officials and all supporters of ispace.\"",
      "The landing attempt came two years after ispace's first lander malfunctioned during the final stages of its descent to the moon, making a similar hard landing. But Hakamada said it was too early to establish any common cause and that engineers needed more time to analyze the telemetry that made it back to Earth.",
      "Carrying cameras, a few science payloads, a tiny rover and even an art project, Resilience   fired its thrusters just after 2:10 p.m. EDT to begin the 66-minute descent from a 62-mile-high circular orbit to touchdown near the center of Mare Frigoris \u2014 the Sea of Cold \u2014 in the moon's northern hemisphere at 60 degrees north latitude.",
      "All appeared to be going smoothly when, around 3:17 p.m. \u2014 the projected landing time \u2014 telemetry suddenly ceased. The last data received indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity and an altitude of 630 feet above the surface.",
      "\"At this moment, we have not yet been able to establish communication with Resilience, but ispace engineers in our Mission Control Center are continuing to work to contact the lander,\" the company posted on X just after 5 p.m.",
      "\"We will share an update with the latest information in a media announcement in the next few hours. Thank you for your patience -- please check back with us soon.\" Three hours later, officials announced the landing failure during a news briefing.",
      "The primary goals of the mission were to land on the moon and deploy the small micro rover Tenacious. The rover, in turn, carried the art project, a tiny model of a Swedish house, designed by artist Mikael Genberg. The traditionally styled red-and-white house measures just 4.7 inches long, 4 inches high and weighs just 3.5 ounces.",
      "Asked why he took on the project, which required years of planning, fundraising and engineering, Genberg said \"we have done as human beings things from time to time that (do not) seemingly have a purpose beyond just being creative.\"",
      "\"The Eiffel Tower, for instance, I mean it's a stupid thing to build,\" he said. \"Today, it has a purpose as maybe the most important thing to make Paris the most visited city in the world.\"",
      "While the \"moonhouse\" could survive for thousands if not millions of years in the airless environment of the moon, its custom paint was expected to fade in the sun's harsh radiation, and lunar dust will slowly coat its surface. Genberg joked that he would happily await an invitation to repaint it.",
      "Ispace is one of a handful of companies attempting to provide non-government transportation services to the moon for a variety of payloads ranging from science instruments to technology demonstrations.",
      "But as it turns out, getting low-cost spacecraft to the moon's surface is extremely difficult.",
      "Ispace tried and\u00a0failed in 2023\u00a0when its first lander ran out of propellant nearing the surface, dropping to a \"hard\" crash landing. Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology launched its\u00a0Peregrine lander in January 2024, but the spacecraft suffered a propulsion system leak and never made it to the moon.",
      "Houston-based Intuitive Machines successfully put two landers down on the lunar surface\u00a0in 2024, and again\u00a0earlier this year, but both spacecraft tipped over on touchdown. While each one survived its landing, neither was able to accomplish all of its pre-flight objectives.",
      "Before Thursday, only Firefly Aerospace had successfully touched down and carried out its mission, landing the\u00a0Blue Ghost spacecraft on March 2, 53 years after the final Apollo mission.",
      "Resilience and Blue Ghost\u00a0were launched atop a single SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Jan. 15. The Blue Ghost lander took a direct route to the moon and carried out a successful touchdown, operating for a full two-week lunar \"day.\"",
      "Resilience followed a longer, low-energy trajectory that carried it well past its target, using the moon's gravity to bring it back to an initially elliptical orbit and finally, using its thrusters, to the 62-mile circular orbit that set the stage for descent.",

    "summary": "It had not been thought possible that such tiny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
    "story": [
      "Astronomers announced Wednesday they have discovered a massive planet orbiting a tiny star, a bizarre pairing that has stumped scientists.",
      "Most of the stars across the Milky Way are small red dwarfs like TOI-6894, which has only 20% the mass of our sun.",
      "It had not been thought possible that such puny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
      "But an international team of astronomers have detected the unmistakable signature of a gas giant planet orbiting the undersized TOI-6894, according to a study in the journal Nature Astronomy. This makes the star the smallest star yet known to host a gas giant.",
      "The planet has a slightly larger radius than Saturn, but only half its mass. It orbits its star in a little over three days.",
      "The astronomers discovered the planet when searching through more than 91,000 low-mass red dwarfs observed by NASA's TESS space telescope. Its existence was then confirmed by ground-based telescopes, including Chile's Very Large Telescope.",
      "\"The fact that this star hosts a giant planet has big implications for the total number of giant planets we estimate exist in our galaxy,\" study co-author Daniel Bayliss of the UK's Warwick University said in a statement.",
      "Another co-author, Vincent Van Eylen, of University College London, said it was an \"intriguing discovery.\"",
      "\"We don't really understand how a star with so little mass can form such a massive planet!\" he said. \"This is one of the goals of the search for more exoplanets. By finding planetary systems different from our solar system, we can test our models and better understand how our own solar system formed.\"",
      "Planet is unusually cold",
      "The most prominent theory for how planets form is called core accretion.",
      "The process begins when a ring of gas and dust \u2014 called a protoplanetary disc \u2014 which surrounds a newly formed star builds up into a planetary core. This core attracts more gas that forms an atmosphere, eventually snowballing into a gas giant.",
      "Under this theory, it is difficult for low-mass stars to host giant planets because there is not enough gas and dust to begin building a core in the first place.",
      "A rival theory proposes that these planets instead form when their protoplanetary disc becomes gravitationally unstable and breaks up, with the collapsing gas and dust forming a planet.",
      "However neither theory seems to explain the existence of the newly discovered planet, TOI-6894b, the researchers said.",
      "The planet also interests scientists because it is strangely cold.",
      "Most of the gas giants discovered outside our solar system so far have been what are known as \"hot Jupiters,\" where temperatures soar well over 1,000 degrees Celsius. But the newly discovered planet appears to be under 150C, the researchers said.",
      "\"Temperatures are low enough that atmospheric observations could even show us ammonia, which would be the first time it is found in an exoplanet atmosphere,\" said study co-author Amaury Triaud of Birmingham University.",
      "The James Webb space telescope is scheduled to turn its powerful gaze toward the planet in the next year, which could help uncover some more mysteries of this strange planet.",
      "Recent cosmic discoveries",
      "The spotting of the giant planet orbiting the undersized star marks the latest in a string of recent celestial discoveries.",
      "Last month, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive \"Planet Nine\" said they instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, making it three times smaller than Pluto.",
      "Also in May, an international team reported that a newly found celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it's shooting out radio waves.",
      "Meanwhile, scientists announced recently that a new planetarium show about the Milky Way helped them unlock one of the solar system's many secrets. Experts at the American Museum of Natural History in New York were fine-tuning a scene about the Oort Cloud that's far beyond Pluto. Scientists have never glimpsed this region, but when museum experts projected their scene onto the planetarium dome, created using simulation data, they saw a spiral shape.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",

      "\"Why is there a spiral there?\" said Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist who leads the museum's educational programs and helped put together the planetarium show.",
      "The inner section of the Oort Cloud, made of billions of comets, resembled a bar with two waving arms, similar to the shape of our Milky Way galaxy.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",
      "The museum contacted the researcher who provided the Oort Cloud data for the show, who was also surprised to see the spiral.",
      "\"It's kind of a freak accident that it actually happened,\" said David Nesvorny with the Southwest Research Institute.",
      "Realizing they'd stumbled on something new, the researchers published their findings earlier this year in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The spiral is \"a striking shift in our understanding of the outer solar system,\" planetary scientist Andre Izidoro with Rice University, who was not involved with the study, said in an email.",
      "The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. But knowing more about the orbits of distant comets could give scientists some clues, Izidoro said.",
      "While putting together the planetarium show, the museum's experts weren't expecting a window into the universe's inner workings. The show features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker, including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",
      "No matter how striking and beautiful the visuals of the show, the museum was committed to making it scientifically accurate. That's what created the perfect conditions to stumble upon something new, said the museum's Carter Emmart.",
      "\"You just never know what you're going to find,\" Emmart said.",
      "According to the planetarium, \"Encounters in the Milky Way\" \u2014 narrated by actor Pedro Pascal \u2014 is a \"a time-traveling journey about the cosmic movements that shape our galactic neighborhood.\"",
      "The film, a collaboration of astronomers and science visualization experts, pulls from data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission. The mission is called the \"billion-star survey\" as it aims to map the precise positions and motions of nearly 2 billion stars in our galaxy.",

      "Apple kicked off its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday with an array of announcements on new features coming this fall via iOS 26, its latest operating system upgrade. Leading the pack is a new user interface enhancement called Liquid Glass.",
      "CEO Tim Cook and other Apple executives used words like \"beautiful,\" \"gorgeous\" and \"delightful\" to describe changes on the horizon for its devices. And while they emphasized a fresh user interface and elevated app features, they also reassured users that the tools would remain familiar and accessible.",
      "Read on for details on the latest bells and whistles coming to Apple's user interface.",
      "iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26",
      "Apple is adopting a new nomenclature for identifying its operating systems, one that is more straightforward than its previous numbering system. Rather than iOS 19, Apple's next iPhone iOS will be called iOS 26 to align with the upcoming year. iOS 26, along with iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 261 are slated to be released as free updates in September 2025.",
      "Design upgrades, including Liquid Glass",
      "Alan Dye, Apple's vice president of human interface design, calls the new OS, the company's \u00a0\"broadest design update ever.\"",
      "A hallmark feature of the new OS is\u00a0Liquid Glass, described by the company as an \"expressive material\" meant to mimic the qualities of glass. The dynamic new interface make apps, widgets and docs appear translucent, allowing users to see multiple layers of their screen at once.",
      "Liquid Glass also creates more movement on your interface by morphing into your display. For example, as messages pop up on your home screen, the time display starts to shrink to accommodate them. The color of Liquid Glass also shifts depending on the content on your screen and adapts between light and dark environments.",
      "\"From navigating apps to system experiences like the lock screen notifications and control center app icons have been crafted with multiple layers of Liquid Glass and come to life in light mode, dark mode, colorful, new tints, or an all new clear look,\" said Dye during the company's keynote Monday.",

      "Apple also delivered long-awaited updates to Apple Intelligence, the company's artificial intelligence system that's now integrated with ChatGPT. AI-powered features arriving this fall include Live Translation, which automatically translates messages as they're being received.",
      "\"So if you're making plans with some new friends while studying abroad, your message can be translated as you type and delivered in their preferred language, and when they respond, each text can be instantly translated for you,\" said Leslie Ikemoto, an engineering director at Apple said at the conference Monday.",
      "Visual Intelligence, another AI tool, allows users to take a screenshot of an image they see online \u2014 say, a cute sweater they come across on one of their apps \u2014 and then look up where to find a similar design online. They can also ask ChatGPT specific questions about the image, such as, keeping with the example of the sweater, \"What material is this made of?\"",
      "Another feature builds on Apple broad selection of emojis by giving users the power to combine and personalize existing emojis to create their own unique expressions. In their presentation, Apple showed how someone could merge the lightbulb emoji with the sloth emoji to indicate they were the last one to get a joke, for example.",
      "Still lingering on Apple's to do list is new AI integrations for Siri. Apple introduced updates to the voice assistant at last year's conference, but the full suite of upgrades for the voice assistant have yet to take effect. \"We're continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal,\" said senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi on Monday. \"This work needed more time to reach our high quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.\"",

      "New college graduates this year face an especially daunting task \u2014 putting their degrees to work just as \"generative\" artificial intelligence technology like ChatGPT is beginning to change the American workplace.",
      "\"We are entering an entirely new economy, so the knowledge economy that we have been in for the last 50 years or so is on the way out, and a new economy is on the way in,\" Aneesh Raman, Chief Economic Opportunity Officer at LinkedIn, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The impact of AI on Americans recently out of college is already visible across a range of industries and jobs, from technology and finance to media, legal fields and market research. As a result, for the first time\u00a0unemployment among fresh grads recently surpassed the nation's overall jobless rate \u2014 a shift some experts attribute in part to the creeping influence of AI.",
      "\"There are signs that entry-level positions are being displaced by artificial intelligence at higher rates than the roles above them,\" said Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.",
      "With the adoption of AI at work only expected to accelerate, we asked three experts across academia, recruitment and consulting for advice on how new college grads should navigate this new normal. Here's what they said.",
      "Become fluent in AI",
      "Perhaps most important, young job-seekers start using gen-AI tools \u2014 today.",
      "\"Almost anybody in that audience, irrespective of the job that they're pursuing, will be expected to use AI with some facility right away,\" said Joseph Fuller, a professor at Harvard Business School and founder of the Managing the Future of Work\u00a0project, comparing the task to learning how to use Microsoft Office for a previous generation of grads.",
      "To get the ball rolling, experts encourage those who are starting to hunt for work to familiarize themselves with the array of tools at their disposal, such as Anthropic's Claude or OpenAI's ChatGPT. That means learning how to engage with such tools beyond simply using them as a search engine.",
      "\"You want to get in a dialogue with it,\" Fuller said. \"You want to ask it to take different perspectives.\"",
      "Emily Rose McRae, an analyst at research and advisory firm Gartner, said learning how to use AI apps can also be a good way to develop transferable skills. For example, asking AI to summarize documents and then validating its findings to ensure accuracy.",
      "Meanwhile, although AI can be helpful when it comes time to filling out job applications, users should proceed with caution given that recruiters can often spot AI-generated language, experts note. Nearly two-thirds of job candidates today use AI at some point in the application process, according to a\u00a0report from recruitment firm Career Group Companies.",
      "\"If you're using it to write your cover letter and your resume and you did not review it, everyone can tell,\" McRae said.",
      "Another way to gain potentially valuable experience with AI, while also seeking work, is for interview practice. For example, users can ask the chatbot both to provide sample questions they might face in an interview and then rate the quality of their responses.",
      "\"If you are using it as a tool to get your own understanding of self in interviews, you're going to start being leaps ahead of everyone else,\" Raman said.",
      "Hone your soft skills",
      "Experts say that as AI surpasses humans in executing certain tasks \u2014 think actuarial math or corporate compliance, for example \u2014more attention will shift to job candidates' so-called soft skills, such as problem solving and communication.",
      "\"You cannot outsource your thinking to AI,\" LinkedIn's Raman said. \"You have to continue to hone critical thinking and complex strategy thinking.\"",
      "The focus will be less on your pedigree \u2014 where you went to school or even whether you have a college degree \u2014 he added, and more on what he calls the \"5 Cs\": curiosity, compassion, creativity, courage and communication.",
      "To improve their soft skills, Fuller encourages entry-level job candidates to work on turning what they regard as their biggest weakness into a strength. For instance, if you typically shy away from public speaking or talking in groups, push yourself to get comfortable in those situations.",
      "\"The inability to do that is going to be penalized more severely in the work of the future than it has been in the past,\" he said.",
      "The Harvard professor also suggested highlighting examples of advanced social skills directly on your resume to help paint a picture for recruiters of how you can contribute to the workplace.",
      "Choose your employer wisely",
      "Beyond skills development, experts say college grads should be thoughtful about the type of company they choose to work at, knowing that AI could drastically alter the business in the coming years.",
      "\"The most important thing, if you're a new grad, is where you work \u2014 not what you do at the place you're going to work,\" Raman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He encouraged college graduates to seek out employers that are integrating AI responsibly and with respect for their workforce \u2014 as opposed to embracing it chiefly to replace people. Companies that are adapting to what is a major technological shift in real time will typically offer the best opportunities for learning and growth, Fuller said.",
      "In evaluating a prospective employer, young job candidates should try to gain an understanding of how they fit into the company's future. For example, McRae recommends asking hiring managers up front what types of investments the organization is making in its employees and what the room for growth looks like.",
      "\"What are they telling me they care about? What do career paths look like for this role like now? How do you help people develop the skills they need to become experts?\" she said.",

      "Apple's guidelines for its app store explicitly state that \"content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy\" is banned.",
      "Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell University's tech research center, has been studying the surge in AI deepfake networks marketing on social platforms for more than a year. He told CBS News in a phone interview on Tuesday that he'd seen thousands more of these ads across Meta platforms, as well as on platforms such as X and Telegram, during that period.",
      "Although Telegram and X have what he described as a structural \"lawlessness\" that allows for this sort of content, he believes Meta's leadership lacks the will to address the issue, despite having content moderators in place.",
      "\"I do think that trust and safety teams at these companies care. I don't think, frankly, that they care at the very top of the company in Meta's case,\" he said. \"They're clearly under-resourcing the teams that have to fight this stuff, because as sophisticated as these [deepfake] networks are \u2026 they don't have Meta money to throw at it.\"",
      "Mantzarlis also said that he found in his research that \"nudify\" deepfake generators are available to download on both Apple's app store and Google's Play store, expressing frustration with these massive platforms' inability to enforce such content.",
      "\"The problem with apps is that they have this dual-use front where they present on the app store as a fun way to face swap, but then they are marketing on Meta as their primary purpose being nudification. So when these apps come up for review on the Apple or Google store, they don't necessarily have the wherewithal to ban them,\" he said.",
      "\"There needs to be cross-industry cooperation where if the app or the website markets itself as a tool for nudification on any place on the web, then everyone else can be like, 'All right, I don't care what you present yourself as on my platform, you're gone,'\" Mantzarlis added.",
      "CBS News has reached out to both Apple and Google for comment as to how they moderate their respective platforms. Neither company had responded by the time of writing.",
      "Major tech companies' promotion of such apps raises serious questions about both user consent and about online safety for minors. A CBS News analysis of one \"nudify\" website promoted on Instagram showed that the site did not prompt any form of age verification prior to a user uploading a photo to generate a deepfake image.",
      "Such issues are widespread. In December, CBS News' 60 Minutes reported on the lack of age verification on one of the most popular sites using artificial intelligence to generate fake nude photos of real people.",
      "Despite visitors being told that they must be 18 or older to use the site, and that \"processing of minors is impossible,\" 60 Minutes was able to immediately gain access to uploading photos once the user clicked \"accept\" on the age warning prompt, with no other age verification necessary.",
      "Data also shows that a high percentage of underage teenagers have interacted with deepfake content. A March 2025 study conducted by the children's protection nonprofit Thorn showed that among teens, 41% said they had heard of the term \"deepfake nudes,\" while 10% reported personally knowing someone who had had deepfake nude imagery created of them.",

The Courts and Congress must act. Checks and balances are crumbling. This is a red line \u2014 and they're crossing it. WAKE UP!\"",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Jun 2025 06:03:25 -0400",
    "summary": "GOP Sen. Josh Hawley's position on the minimum wage aligns him with some of the Senate's most liberal members.",
    "story": [
      "Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley plans to introduce legislation Tuesday to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour \u2014 a position that aligns one of the most conservative Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill with some of the most liberal members of Congress.",
      "The legislation, called the \"Higher Wages for American Workers Act,\" would raise the federal standard starting in 2026 and would also call for an increase in subsequent years to match inflation, CBS News has exclusively learned. Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch has signed on as a co-sponsor.",
      "\"For decades, working Americans have seen their wages flatline. One major culprit of this is the failure of the federal minimum wage to keep up with the economic reality facing hard-working Americans every day,\" Hawley said in a statement to CBS News. \"This bipartisan legislation would ensure that workers across America benefit from higher wages.\"",
      "\"We're in the midst of a severe affordability crisis, with families in red and blue states alike struggling to afford necessities like housing and groceries,\" Welch said in a statement to CBS. \"A stagnant federal minimum wage only adds fuel to the fire. Every hard-working American deserves a living wage that helps put a roof over their head and food on the table\u2013$7.25 an hour doesn't even come close.\"",
      "The federal minimum wage currently sits at $7.25 per hour and has not risen since 2009, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.",
      "The move by Hawley puts him at odds with conservative party orthodoxy, which has traditionally opposed a federal minimum wage increase on the grounds that it would be costly for businesses and ultimately, for consumers. But Hawley's pitch is reflective of the party's realignment in the Trump era, where the president's brand of populism has fueled a shift among working-class voters away from Democrats and towards Republicans.",
      "Hawley has been pushing Republicans to embrace this shift. The minimum wage legislation is part of a broader, aspirational package of legislative proposals he dubbed the \"Pro-Worker Framework for the 119th Congress.\" This includes a proposal to help strengthen protections for union jobs, as well as for organizing and collective bargaining.",
      "Earlier this year, he teamed up with Sen. Bernie Sanders to introduce legislation to cap credit card interest rates at 10%. And in the last Congress, he introduced legislation that would require companies with revenues of $1 billion or more to pay their employees at least $15 per hour. In recent weeks, Hawley has been urging his party against cuts to Medicaid benefits in the budget reconciliation bill.",
      "In November, voters in Hawley's home state of Missouri approved a ballot measure to raise the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour, starting in 2026. But the Legislature repealed part of the law that would allow later increases to adjust for inflation.",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump rescinded a Biden-era executive order that raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to $17.75 per hour. At his Senate confirmation hearing in January, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he does not support raising the federal minimum wage, arguing that it is a decision best left up to the states.",

    "story": [
      "The Joro spider, Asian long-horned beetle and spotted lanternfly have company this summer.",
      "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting continues to spread across the U.S. and can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
      "Asian needle ants were first detected in the U.S. almost a century ago, but the species has continued to expand its reach, primarily throughout the Southeast, and this pest could potentially be deadly to humans, according to Dan Suiter, a professor of urban entomology at the University of Georgia.",
      "\"It injects venom that can harm you. Its sting can be life threatening,\" Suiter recently told the university.",
      "Suiter added that people who have adverse reactions to bee and ant stings are especially vulnerable and could go into anaphylactic shock from the needle ant's sting. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within seconds of being exposed to something you're allergic to, such as a sting, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"If you suffer from anaphylaxis, you should really know what this ant looks like,\" Suiter says. \"And it might be smart to carry an EpiPen.\"",
      "Suiter urged people to be vigilant for these invasive species, especially with ant populations peaking later this summer.",
      "What are Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are technically known as Brachyponera chinensis\u00a0\u2014 roughly translated as \"short, wicked ant from China\" \u2014 but their native range also includes Japan and the Koreas, according to the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "The insect was first discovered in the U.S. in 1932 in Georgia, but has only recently started to \"cause problems in North America after being relatively unnoticed for many years,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "The pest has now been detected all the way from Washington state to Florida, according to the site\u00a0antmaps.org as well as Mississippi State University, and the ant is recently getting more attention in Texas.",
      "Suiter says Asian needle ants are \"sneaky\" because they are less than a quarter of an inch long and are adept at hiding.",
      "\"Unlike many invasive species that tend to colonize areas in the wake of natural or human disturbance, Asian needle ants are capable of invading undisturbed forest areas where they nest under and within logs and other debris, under stones, and in leaf litter,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "Environmental impacts",
      "According to Suiter, Asian needle ants wreak havoc in native environments.",
      "\"They outcompete other ant species that are important to the ecology of that area,\" he says.",
      "Asian needle ants prey on other insects and are capable of displacing ant species that are critical for seed dispersal, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Researchers have documented large decreases in seed dispersal in forests where Asian needle ants are present.",
      "\"Thus, this invasive species could have dramatic, long-term negative effects on forest understory,\" the service says.",
      "What should people do if they see Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are about 0.2 inches in length, and dark brown or black with the end of the antennae and the legs being a lighter orange-brown, the U.S. Forest Service says. Other ant species can look similar, \"so it takes an experienced eye to positively identify them,\" the service says.",
      "Suiter says that you can send a photograph or a specimen to a local University of Georgia Extension office, which can help with identification. The public can also contact a professional to come out and bait for the ants, he says.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service advises people to avoid the pest and to be especially vigilant in areas with logs, rotting wood or rocks where the ants can nest.",
      "\"Unfortunately, as with many invasive species, it appears Asian needle ants are here to stay,\" the service says.",

      "Federal agents arrested immigrants in LA's fashion district, in a Home Depot parking lot and at several other locations on Friday. The next day, they were staging at a Department of Homeland Security office near another Home Depot in Paramount, which drew out protesters who suspected another raid. Federal authorities later said there was no enforcement activity at that Home Depot.",
      "The weeklong tally of immigrant arrests in the LA area climbed above 100, federal authorities said. Many more were arrested while protesting, including a prominent union leader who was accused of impeding law enforcement.",
      "What are officials saying?",
      "Newsom requested that Mr. Trump remove the guard members in a letter Sunday afternoon, calling their deployment a \"serious breach of state sovereignty.\" He was in Los Angeles meeting with local law enforcement and officials.",
      "The deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts.",
      "Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass blamed the increasingly aggressive protests on the president's decision to deploy the Guard, calling it a move designed to enflame tensions. They've both urged protesters to remain peaceful.",
      "\"What we're seeing in Los Angeles is chaos that is provoked by the administration,\" Bass said in an afternoon press conference. \"This is about another agenda, this isn't about public safety.\"",

      "He pushed back against claims by the Trump administration that the LAPD had failed to help federal authorities when protests broke out Friday after a series of immigration raids. His department responded as quickly as it could, and had not been notified in advance of the raids and therefore was not pre-positioned for protests, he said.",
      "Newsom, meanwhile, has repeatedly said that California authorities had the situation under control. He mocked Mr. Trump for posting a congratulatory message to the Guard on social media before troops had even arrived in Los Angeles, and said on MSNBC that Mr. Trump never floated deploying the Guard during a Friday phone call. He called the president a \"stone-cold liar.\"",
      "The admonishments didn't deter the administration.",
      "\"It's a bald-faced lie for Newsom to claim there was no problem in Los Angeles before President Trump got involved,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement.",
      "Democratic California Rep. Maxine Waters on Sunday strongly rebuked the president's decision to deploy the National Guard, calling the situation \"outrageous\" and \"horrible\" and adding that she believes Mr. Trump is using L.A., a sanctuary city, as an example.",

    "summary": "New touch-responsive Liquid Glass interface design \"dynamically reacts\" when you touch it, according to Apple.",
    "story": [
      "Apple kicked off its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday with an array of announcements on new features coming this fall via iOS 26, its latest operating system upgrade. Leading the pack is a new user interface enhancement called Liquid Glass.",
      "CEO Tim Cook and other Apple executives used words like \"beautiful,\" \"gorgeous\" and \"delightful\" to describe changes on the horizon for its devices. And while they emphasized a fresh user interface and elevated app features, they also reassured users that the tools would remain familiar and accessible.",
      "Read on for details on the latest bells and whistles coming to Apple's user interface.",
      "iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26",
      "Apple is adopting a new nomenclature for identifying its operating systems, one that is more straightforward than its previous numbering system. Rather than iOS 19, Apple's next iPhone iOS will be called iOS 26 to align with the upcoming year. iOS 26, along with iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 261 are slated to be released as free updates in September 2025.",
      "Design upgrades, including Liquid Glass",
      "Alan Dye, Apple's vice president of human interface design, calls the new OS, the company's \u00a0\"broadest design update ever.\"",
      "A hallmark feature of the new OS is\u00a0Liquid Glass, described by the company as an \"expressive material\" meant to mimic the qualities of glass. The dynamic new interface make apps, widgets and docs appear translucent, allowing users to see multiple layers of their screen at once.",
      "Liquid Glass also creates more movement on your interface by morphing into your display. For example, as messages pop up on your home screen, the time display starts to shrink to accommodate them. The color of Liquid Glass also shifts depending on the content on your screen and adapts between light and dark environments.",
      "\"From navigating apps to system experiences like the lock screen notifications and control center app icons have been crafted with multiple layers of Liquid Glass and come to life in light mode, dark mode, colorful, new tints, or an all new clear look,\" said Dye during the company's keynote Monday.",
      "Apple Intelligence",
      "Apple also delivered long-awaited updates to Apple Intelligence, the company's artificial intelligence system that's now integrated with ChatGPT. AI-powered features arriving this fall include Live Translation, which automatically translates messages as they're being received.",
      "\"So if you're making plans with some new friends while studying abroad, your message can be translated as you type and delivered in their preferred language, and when they respond, each text can be instantly translated for you,\" said Leslie Ikemoto, an engineering director at Apple said at the conference Monday.",
      "Visual Intelligence, another AI tool, allows users to take a screenshot of an image they see online \u2014 say, a cute sweater they come across on one of their apps \u2014 and then look up where to find a similar design online. They can also ask ChatGPT specific questions about the image, such as, keeping with the example of the sweater, \"What material is this made of?\"",
      "Another feature builds on Apple broad selection of emojis by giving users the power to combine and personalize existing emojis to create their own unique expressions. In their presentation, Apple showed how someone could merge the lightbulb emoji with the sloth emoji to indicate they were the last one to get a joke, for example.",
      "Still lingering on Apple's to do list is new AI integrations for Siri. Apple introduced updates to the voice assistant at last year's conference, but the full suite of upgrades for the voice assistant have yet to take effect. \"We're continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal,\" said senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi on Monday. \"This work needed more time to reach our high quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.\"",
      "In a research note, Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives noted that the Apple Intelligence rollout has been slower than expected, but also estimates that over the next few years, 25% of the world population will access AI through an Apple-powered device.",
      "\"While many on [Wall] Street are heading into WWDC as underwhelming given the slower-than-expected rollout of Apple Intelligence, we disagree with this bearish narrative and strongly believe this will be the start of AI monetization period of the Apple ecosystem as the company will continue to lay the foundation through its new operating system updates across Mac, iOS, iPad and others with its '26\" update,'\" Ives said.",

      "The ban went into effect at 12:01 a.m. on Monday, June 9.",
      "Why were the countries selected?",
      "On the first day of his second administration, Mr. Trump directed officials to perform a security review of high-risk regions and make recommendations for where immigration and travel restrictions should be imposed.",
      "The president said the factors considered were \"the largescale presence of terrorists, failure to cooperate on visa security, inability to verify travelers' identities, inadequate record keeping of criminal histories and persistently high rates of illegal visa overstays, and other things.\"",
      "\"Very simply, we cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter the United States,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The president cited the recent attack in Boulder, where an Egyptian national was charged, as part of the justification for the bans. Egypt is not among the countries on the White House's list. But the proclamation directed officials to assess the \"adequacy\" of Egypt's vetting policies \"in light of recent events.\"",
      "Are there exceptions to the new travel ban?",
      "The president's decree contains certain exemptions, including for U.S. permanent residents and the spouses and children of U.S. citizens who have \"clear and convincing evidence of identity and family relationship.\"",
      "The proclamation also outlines exemptions for Afghans who assisted American forces and have special visas; diplomats; athletes coming to the U.S. for the World Cup, the Olympics and other major sporting events; dual nationals with a passport from a country not listed in the president's decree; and for adoptions.",
      "Mr. Trump said the list could be revised if countries make \"material improvements,\" and new countries could be added \"as threats emerge around the world.\"",
      "Did Trump do this before?",
      "The president's actions follow a series of travel bans issued during his first administration that initially targeted predominantly Muslim countries. Like those orders, his latest proclamation could be subject to lawsuits, although the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the revised ban from his first term, which the White House noted in a fact sheet outlining his second-term bans.",
      "The president touted his first-term travel bans in his video statement released Wednesday.",
      "\"In my first term, my powerful travel restrictions were one of our most successful policies, and they were a key part of preventing major foreign terror attacks on American soil,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "In January 2017, Mr. Trump signed a travel ban restricting the entry of most citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The ban sparked widespread outcry, creating chaos at airports and prompting legal challenges, as opponents argued the ban was discriminatory.",
      "Then in March 2017, Mr. Trump removed Iraq from the list and added Chad, Venezuela and North Korea. The president expanded the ban in 2020, adding immigration restrictions for nationals of Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Myanmar and Kyrgyzstan. Chad was later removed from the list.",
      "The third iteration of the president's first-term ban was upheld by the Supreme Court in the summer of 2018. At the time, conservative justices cited the president's broad authority to restrict the entry of foreigners on national security grounds. When President Joe Biden took office, he scrapped that ban.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's\u00a0proclamation\u00a0 barring travelers and immigrants from 12 countries, and restricting the entry of nationals from seven other nations,\u00a0went into effect early on Monday, June 9.",
      "With the move, the White House cited concerns about national security. The president said the recent attack at a march supporting Israeli hostages in Boulder, Colorado,\u00a0had \"underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas.\"",
      "\"We don't want them,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "An internal memo from Customs and Border Protection issued on June 7 said \"the suspensions and limitations on entry for nationals of the above-listed countries are effective at 12:01 am Eastern Daylight Time on June 9, 2025 for travelers that do not have a valid visa issued on or prior to June 8, 2025.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the travel bans:",
      "What are the travel ban countries?",
      "With some exceptions, the proclamation bans the entry of foreigners from 12 countries who are seeking to come to the U.S. permanently as legal immigrants, as well as those with temporary visas, including tourists:",

      "When does the ban take effect?",
      "The ban went into effect at 12:01 a.m. on Monday, June 9.",
      "Why were the countries selected?",
      "On the first day of his second administration, Mr. Trump directed officials to perform a security review of high-risk regions and make recommendations for where immigration and travel restrictions should be imposed.",
      "The president said the factors considered were \"the largescale presence of terrorists, failure to cooperate on visa security, inability to verify travelers' identities, inadequate record keeping of criminal histories and persistently high rates of illegal visa overstays, and other things.\"",
      "\"Very simply, we cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter the United States,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The president cited the recent attack in Boulder, where an Egyptian national was charged, as part of the justification for the bans. Egypt is not among the countries on the White House's list. But the proclamation directed officials to assess the \"adequacy\" of Egypt's vetting policies \"in light of recent events.\"",
      "Are there exceptions to the new travel ban?",
      "The president's decree contains certain exemptions, including for U.S. permanent residents and the spouses and children of U.S. citizens who have \"clear and convincing evidence of identity and family relationship.\"",
      "The proclamation also outlines exemptions for Afghans who assisted American forces and have special visas; diplomats; athletes coming to the U.S. for the World Cup, the Olympics and other major sporting events; dual nationals with a passport from a country not listed in the president's decree; and for adoptions.",
      "Mr. Trump said the list could be revised if countries make \"material improvements,\" and new countries could be added \"as threats emerge around the world.\"",
      "Did Trump do this before?",
      "The president's actions follow a series of travel bans issued during his first administration that initially targeted predominantly Muslim countries. Like those orders, his latest proclamation could be subject to lawsuits, although the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the revised ban from his first term, which the White House noted in a fact sheet outlining his second-term bans.",
      "The president touted his first-term travel bans in his video statement released Wednesday.",
      "\"In my first term, my powerful travel restrictions were one of our most successful policies, and they were a key part of preventing major foreign terror attacks on American soil,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "In January 2017, Mr. Trump signed a travel ban restricting the entry of most citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The ban sparked widespread outcry, creating chaos at airports and prompting legal challenges, as opponents argued the ban was discriminatory.",
      "Then in March 2017, Mr. Trump removed Iraq from the list and added Chad, Venezuela and North Korea. The president expanded the ban in 2020, adding immigration restrictions for nationals of Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Myanmar and Kyrgyzstan. Chad was later removed from the list.",
      "The third iteration of the president's first-term ban was upheld by the Supreme Court in the summer of 2018. At the time, conservative justices cited the president's broad authority to restrict the entry of foreigners on national security grounds. When President Joe Biden took office, he scrapped that ban.",

      "Fox News' Bryan Llenas reports from New York City on Sean 'Diddy' Combs being reprimanded for body language directed at the jury.",
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' ex-girlfriend took the stand Monday and testified for the third day in the rapper's federal trial for sex crimes.",
      "His ex, who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane,\" told prosecutors that there were times she felt coerced into hotel nights with Diddy and that the Bad Boy Records founder still pays for both her legal fees and rent.",
      "Jane recalled alleged instances of abuse while dating Diddy on and off for three years and up until the week before he was arrested in New York City on federal charges.",
      "Jennifer Beidel, a former assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York who now practices at Dykema, told Fox News Digital that Jane's testimony may be \"powerful\" to the jury.",

      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' ex-girlfriend took the stand Monday and testified for the third day in the rapper's federal trial for sex crimes. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"Jane Doe commented on the consistency between her experience and that of Cassie Ventura after she read Ventura\u2019s civil lawsuit,\" Beidel said. \"If the jury also finds the two women\u2019s experiences similar, Jane Doe\u2019s testimony becomes powerful corroboration of Ventura\u2019s testimony. Adding in the voice memos could lend even more credence to the two women\u2019s accounts, as those voice memos are evidence of Mr. Combs\u2019 views at the time in his own words.\"",
      "Jane told the court that Diddy asked her about coercion after he allegedly forced her to take drugs before having sex with a male escort. She testified about Diddy's alleged violent behavior and said he once put her in a chokehold after kicking and punching her. The jury was shown video evidence of Jane's injuries, which included a bruised eye and welts on her forehead.",
      "Texts shown in federal court on Monday between Diddy and Jane revealed that she felt manipulated and wanted monetary income.",
      "The rapper allegedly texted Jane back, \"F--- you.\" Jane allegedly told Diddy, \"You're the only opportunist ... you had three years of fun with my body ... you were a full time job and consumed my life.\" The \"Last Night\" rapper allegedly texted back that he was blocking Jane's number and also calling the police.",
      "\"You conned me into sucking d--- for you,\" Jane allegedly texted. After several texts, she wrote, \"I'm going to kill myself.\"",
      "Diddy listened to testimony from an ex-girlfriend, who testified under the nickname \"Jane.\" (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"Early in the trial, the prosecutors introduced extensive evidence to support their theory that Combs used violence and threats of violence to coerce Ventura into engaging in sexual activity,\" former federal prosecutor Mark Chutkow told Fox News Digital. \"However, the prosecution\u2019s evidence of Jane Doe\u2019s alleged coercion centers more on emotional manipulation than violence.\u00a0That could prove to be a weakness for the prosecution case because Jane\u2019s evidence was introduced later in the trial, closer to when the jurors will deliberate.\"",
      "Mark Chuktow, who now practices at Dykema, added, \"As a result, it might dilute the impact of Ventura\u2019s earlier testimony because Jane\u2019s evidence is less clear-cut regarding whether Combs coerced her to engage in sexual activity.\u00a0To counter this, the prosecutors might put more weight in closing arguments on the evidence that Combs blackmailed both women into complying with his sexual demands through threats of destroying their reputations and careers by publicly exposing the video recordings of their participation in the freak-offs.",
      "\"Blackmail like this might resonate more with the jury than Combs\u2019 emotional manipulation of Jane when deciding whether or not the victims consented to the sexual activity.\"",

      "In court, Jane testified that after fleeing from the \"All About the Benjamins\" rapper during an alleged violent encounter, she returned to the home and claimed she was on the patio when she allegedly punched Diddy around his temple on his forehead. He allegedly retaliated by punching Jane in the head twice in the forehead and eye area.",
      "She told the court she retreated to a deep part of the backyard, fell and curled up in a ball to cover her head and face while Diddy allegedly continued to punch and kick her. He allegedly said Jane was trying to take him away from his kids and family.",
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs talks with his lawyers on the 17th day of testimony in his federal trial. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "Diddy then allegedly grabbed Jane by the hair and her arm and dragged her back into the house, saying she was \"f---ing crazy.\" She claimed to keep asking him to leave.",
      "\"Jane\u2019s testimony is more of the same in regards to the defendant\u2019s conduct, and it certainly does not paint a good picture of Mr. Combs,\" Los Angeles litigator John J. Perlstein told Fox News Digital. \"It is hard to say whether or not the jury is numb to it all. However, they are unlikely to be shocked by Jane\u2019s testimony given what everyone else has said thus far.",
      "\"This trial is a lengthy process for jurors, and recordings and videos of the testimonies typically fare better than readings.\"",
      "Jane also testified to being with Diddy when she saw the video of the rapper assaulting Cassie Ventura at the InterContinental Hotel in 2016. Diddy was with his friends and family in May 2024 when she was invited to a \"huddle,\" where she remembered the group trying to come up with a form of a sincere apology post regarding the video.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER",
      "She told the court that she never heard the \"Victory\" rapper deny he was the one in the video assaulting Cassie. Jane testified that Diddy showed her a final draft of what he would say, and she understood he would post it on social media. She said she thought the message was heartfelt.",
      "Jane claimed they eventually talked about the video in June or July 2024. Diddy allegedly told her that was the only time he and Cassie had physical violence. Diddy allegedly told Jane that Cassie \"was a hitter.\"",
      "WATCH: SEAN \u2018DIDDY\u2019 COMBS ASSAULTS CASSIE VENTURA IN 2016 HOTEL INCIDENT",
      "Attorney Christopher Melche told Fox News Digital, \"Jane testified about horrific acts of abuse in the relationship similar to what Cassie experienced, but what was unique about her testimony today is that Jane is still having her rent paid for by Diddy to this very day, and they continued their relationship right up to the time that he was arrested, so I'm not sure how the jury is going to reconcile all of these horrible things that happened to her and how her rent is being paid and accepted right 'til now.\"",

      "In a federal indictment unsealed on Sept. 17, Diddy was charged with racketeering conspiracy (RICO); sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution. If found guilty, he faces a minimum of 15 years behind bars or a maximum sentence of life in prison.",
      "He has maintained his innocence throughout the trial, where witnesses have testified to alleged rape, sexual assault, severe physical abuse, forced labor and drug trafficking. The trial is expected to wrap up by July 4.",

      "\"The majority of our decision-making is based on science,\" said Dr. Gbolahan Okubadejo, an orthopedic spine surgeon located in the New York City metro area. \"We do a lot of research \u2026 a lot about decision-making is research-based.\"",

      "They can have a variety of specialties and certifications, with a focus on manual spinal adjustments and other musculoskeletal issues.",

      "A chiropractor\u2019s methods are generally less invasive than a surgeon's.",
      "\"The ultimate goal of chiropractic is to help your body move and function the way it\u2019s meant to,\" Tori Hartline, a chiropractor at Sunlife Chiropractic in Frisco, Texas, told Fox News Digital. \"When your spine is out of alignment, it puts unnecessary pressure on muscles, causing them to tighten up.\"",
      "\"The ultimate goal of chiropractic is to help your body move and function the way it\u2019s meant to.\"",

      "Radiating pain may warrant a visit to an orthopedic specialist, experts say. (iStock)",
      "That's why he encourages patients not to avoid a chiropractor altogether, but to use a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to care.",
      "\"But if it's just primarily pain, then in those cases, if a patient has an interest in chiropractic, I wouldn't discourage it,\" Okubadejo said. \"If it's something mild to moderate, strictly musculoskeletal, in that case, it's safe.\"",

      "The best \"green flag,\" he said, \"is someone who's very transparent, who explains everything to you, someone who shows you the imaging, who takes on the role as an educator \u2026 and has a very clear treatment plan.\"",

      "Prevention of infection",
      "To prevent contracting the fatal infection, the CDC recommends using \"distilled, sterile or boiled and cooled tap water for nasal irrigation,\" as \"improperly maintained\" municipal water and RV water systems carry the risk of disease.",

      "More than 100 Democrats voted against a House GOP-led resolution to condemn the accused terror attack in Boulder, Colorado.",
      "It passed 280-113, with 75 Democrats joining Republicans to vote for the bill. Six lawmakers, five Democrats and one Republican, voted \"present.\"",
      "The legislation was introduced by Rep. Gabe Evans, R-Colo., last week in response to the attack. But Democrat lawmakers made clear they were opposed to language in the resolution that they felt was politically charged.",
      "In addition to condemning the attack, Evans' resolution also appeared to rebuke blue-leaning sanctuary jurisdictions that were at odds with federal immigration authorities, and he condemned illegal immigrants who overstay their visas as well.",
      "A second bill, led by Reps. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., and Joe Neguse, D-Colo., more broadly condemned the rise in antisemitic attacks in the U.S. That legislation netted much wider bipartisan support, passing 400-0, with just two lawmakers voting \"present.\"",

      "But Evans' resolution more specifically noted that the case of terror suspect Mohammed Sabry Soliman, who overstayed a tourist visa and a subsequent work authorization, \"demonstrates the dangers of not removing from the country aliens who fail to comply with the terms of their visas.\"",
      "The Egyptian national is facing federal charges after allegedly attempting to set fire to peaceful demonstrators who were protesting Hamas' continued possession of Israeli hostages in Gaza.",
      "The Trump administration has vowed that he and his family will be deported from the U.S.",
      "Evans' resolution also \"affirms that free and open communication between State and local law enforcement and their Federal counterparts remains the bedrock of public safety and is necessary in preventing terrorist attacks\" and it \"expresses gratitude to law enforcement officers, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel, for protecting the homeland.\"",
      "It comes as Democrat-controlled cities like Los Angeles and Nashville, Tennessee, have seen their leaders criticize the Trump administration's ICE crackdown.",
      "The Trump administration's handling of anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles has spurred an outpouring of scorn from Democrat officials, particularly the decision to send National Guard troops in to break up the demonstrations.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., criticized Evans' resolution in comments to reporters on Monday.",
      "Rep. Gabe Evans led the resolution. (Tierney L. Cross/Getty Images)",
      "\"Who is this guy? He's not seriously concerned with combating antisemitism in America. This is not a serious effort,\" Jeffries said. \"Antisemitism is a scourge on America. It shouldn't be weaponized politically.\"",
      "Jeffries also called Evans \"a joke.\"",
      "Evans responded on X, \"I served our nation in uniform in the Middle East, as a cop in Colorado, & now as a Congressman. This wildly offensive sentiment from Democrat\u2019s Leader is why antisemitism persists. The Left is unserious about finding real solutions.\"",
      "Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., who is Jewish, also criticized Evans' resolution.",

      "But Van Drew, who is leading a bipartisan resolution that similarly condemns antisemitism but does not discuss immigration, defended Evans' measure.",
      "\"Yes, it is different than mine. Mine focused purely on antisemitism here in the world. But he brings up a valid point not only for Jews, but for many innocent victims. Whether it was Laken Riley, whether it was the women that were raped, the women and men that were killed, those that were beaten, those that were hurt, who were in law enforcement. Illegal immigration is not a good thing,\" Van Drew said.",
      "The two lawmakers who voted \"present\" on Van Drew's resolution were Reps. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.",
      "Greene wrote on X after the vote, \"Antisemitic hate crimes are wrong, but so are all hate crimes. Yet Congress never votes on hate crimes committed against white people, Christians, men, the homeless, or countless others. Tonight, the House passed two more antisemitism-related resolutions, the 20th and 21st I\u2019ve voted on since taking office. Meanwhile, Americans from every background are being murdered \u2014 even in the womb \u2014 and Congress stays silent.\"",

      "6) Request an IRS Identity Protection PIN: Prevent fraudulent tax filings using your SSN by setting up an\u00a0Identity Protection PIN with the IRS. This six-digit number adds another layer of protection during tax season.",
      "7) Review your Social Security earnings record: Log in to your\u00a0\"My Social Security\" account regularly to review your earnings history and benefits. This helps ensure your information hasn\u2019t been altered or compromised.",

      "Glide underwater with CudaJet and make the ocean your playground. Kurt Knutsson discusses the redesigned tech that might be your next big thrilling adventure.",
      "If you've ever dreamed of gliding underwater with the freedom of a dolphin, the CudaJet might be the gadget for you. Unlike most underwater propulsion systems that strap onto your arms or legs, the CudaJet is worn like a backpack, giving you a hands-free way to cruise beneath the surface. It's a fresh approach that feels a lot more natural and comfortable, especially for longer swims.",
      "The CudaJet's story started almost seven years ago. Back then, it was just a prototype called the Cuda, a passion project by British designer Archie O'Brien during his final year at Loughborough College of Art and Design, now known as Loughborough Design School. Archie wanted something lighter and faster than anything else out there, and in 2023 his vision became reality with the first commercial CudaJet.",
      "Now, the CudaJet has been redesigned with a longer battery life, lighter build and updated features, making it even more appealing to underwater adventure seekers.",

      "CudaJet underwater jetpack: How it works and what\u2019s new",
      "So, what's it like to use? The main unit is a dual-jet-drive pack that attaches to a padded neoprene harness, which you wear on your torso. You control everything with a hardwired, trigger-style remote that lets you adjust your speed and keep an eye on the battery level. One of the biggest improvements for 2025 is the battery. While the original model provided approximately 40 minutes of underwater fun for every 75-minute charge, the latest version extends that time to a full 90 minutes per charge. That's more than double the original runtime, so you can explore even more on a single outing.",
      "CudaJet can take you down to a maximum depth of 131 feet, and it delivers about 88 pounds of thrust. That translates to a top speed of roughly 10 feet per second, or about 6.7 mph. Now, that might not sound fast on land, but underwater it's a whole different story. The company likes to point out that at 10 feet per second, the drag force on your body is about the same as flying through air at nearly 200 mph. It's an exhilarating experience that feels powerful and smooth.",
      "The 2025 redesign also trimmed some weight from the original, reducing it from approximately 33 pounds to just over 30 pounds, including the harness. The harness itself comes in four sizes, so you can get a fit that feels just right. Safety is clearly a priority as well. Each CudaJet ships with a factory-set safety depth of about 10 feet, which you can adjust up to the full 131 feet if you're feeling adventurous. If you ever go past your set limit, the motor cuts out and floats you right back to the surface. The controller's full-color display keeps you updated on your speed, battery and depth at all times.",

Each jetpack is made to order, handcrafted and painted in the U.K. The\u00a02025 package starts at around $31,000, which is a jump from the original price, but it now includes a two-year warranty, a luxury hard case and a fast charger. For those who want something even more exclusive, there's a Founder's Edition with lifetime product access, in-water training with the founder and a lifetime warranty, but only 20 of those are being made.",

The process involves custom-fitting the harness to your size and selecting your preferred finish, all of which are handcrafted in the U.K. Due to this approach, there is typically a wait time before delivery, which varies depending on demand and the customization options.

      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Online scams thrive on the urgency and fear of their victims. If you've ever been a victim of a scam, you\u2019d know that bad actors often try to rush you into taking action by creating a sense of fear. A scammer may call you impersonating a government agency and claim your Social Security number has been linked to drug trafficking.",
      "A phishing email might ask you to update your tax details or claim you\u2019ve won a lottery or a free product, all to get you to click a malicious link.",
      "A more effective tactic scammers use is sending fake login alerts. These are warnings that someone has logged into your account, prompting you to take immediate action. This method works well because legitimate services like Google, Apple, Netflix and Facebook also send these types of notifications when someone, including you, logs in from a new device. It can be tricky to tell the difference.",

      "How login alert scams work and why they\u2019re so effective",
      "Scammers often pose as login alerts from Google, Apple, Meta or even your bank, complete with official-looking logos, because fear is effective. But not every alert is a scam. In many cases, these notifications are legitimate and can help you detect unauthorized access to your accounts. Let\u2019s focus on the scam side first.",
      "Login alert scams have been around for a while. Early reports date back to 2021, and the trend has persisted since then. In 2022, reports surfaced that scammers were impersonating Meta and sending phishing emails to users.",
      "FBI WARNS OF SCAM TARGETING VICTIMS WITH FAKE HOSPITALS AND POLICE",
      "One such email used a clean layout with minimal text. It avoided the usual scare tactics and stuck to a simple message. But that is not always the case. A common red flag in phishing attempts is the tendency to overload the email with unnecessary details. These messages often include cluttered formatting, excessive explanations and an increasing number of typos or design errors. One phishing email simply gets to the point:",
      "Someone tried to Iog into Your Account, User lD",

      "What\u2019s concerning now is that poor grammar is no longer a reliable sign of a scam. Thanks to AI, even those with limited English skills can write emails that sound polished and professional. As a result, many phishing messages today read just like legitimate emails from trusted companies.",
      "Receiving a phishing email is not the real issue. The real problem starts when you click on it. Most of these emails contain links that lead to fake login pages, designed to look exactly like platforms such as Facebook, Google or your bank.",
      "If you enter your credentials there, they go directly to the scammer. In some cases, simply clicking the link can trigger a malware download, especially if your browser is outdated or your device lacks proper security. Once inside, attackers can steal personal information, monitor your activity or take control of your accounts.",

      "For instance, a legit Google security alert might say, \"We detected a login from a new sign-in to your Google Account on a Pixel 6 Pro device. If this was you, you don't need to do anything. If not, we'll help you secure your account.\"\u00a0\u00a0It may include a \"Check activity\" button, but that link always redirects to a google.com address, and it won\u2019t prompt you to reenter your password via the email link.

      "1. Don\u2019t click any links or attachments and use strong antivirus software: Instead, manually log in to the real site (or open the official app) by typing the URL or using a bookmarked link. This guarantees you\u2019re not walking into a scammer\u2019s trap. The FTC recommends this: if you have an account with that company, contact them via the website or phone number you know is real,\u00a0not the info in the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Remove your data from the internet: Scammers are able to send you targeted messages because your data, like your email address or phone number, is already out there. This often happens due to past data breaches and shady data brokers. A data removal service can help clean up your digital trail by removing your information from public databases and people-search sites. It\u2019s not a quick fix, but over time, it reduces how easily scammers can find and target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "3. Check your account activity:\u00a0Go to your account\u2019s security or sign-in page. Services like Gmail, iCloud or your bank let you review recent logins and devices. If you see nothing unusual, you\u2019re safe. If you do find a strange login, follow the site\u2019s process (usually changing your password and logging out all devices). Even if you don\u2019t find anything odd, change your password as a precaution. Do it through the official site or app, not the email. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): This is your best backup. With\u00a02FA enabled, even if someone has your password, they can\u2019t gain access without your phone and an additional second factor. Both Google and Apple make 2FA easy and say it \"makes it harder for scammers\" to hijack your account.",
      "5. Report suspicious emails: If you receive a suspicious email claiming to be from a specific organization, report it to that organization\u2019s official support or security team so they can take appropriate action.",
      "THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING WRONG WHEN SCAMMERS CALL",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "You shouldn\u2019t have to vet every sketchy email. In fact, your email\u2019s spam filters catch most phishing attempts for you. Keep them enabled, and make sure your software is up to date so that malicious sites and attachments are blocked. Still, the most powerful filter is your own awareness. You're definitely not alone in this. People receive these spammy login scares every day. By keeping a cool head and following the steps above, you're already ahead of the game.",

      "If you've received a text message claiming to be from your state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and threatening you with fines or penalties unless you pay up, you're not alone. A new wave of scam texts is sweeping across the country, targeting drivers in states like Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida, New York, California, Illinois, New Jersey, Virginia, Colorado, Vermont, Texas, North Carolina and even Washington, D.C.",
      "These messages look official and urgent, warning you about supposed unpaid tickets or tolls and demanding immediate payment. But don't be fooled, as these texts are sophisticated scams designed to steal your personal information or money.",

The text threatens consequences, such as credit score damage, revoked driving privileges, suspended vehicle registration or increased toll fees, if you do not pay the bill you have supposedly incurred. To make the message appear legit, the scammers often include a date for penalties to begin, a fake administrative code and a link that appears to be an official DMV website.",

These are two powerful psychological motivators that can send you into a panic since your driving privileges are at risk, or you're facing financial consequences. The aim is to get you to act hastily without pausing to verify the source.

      "If you receive a suspicious text message claiming to be from your state's DMV and demanding payment or personal information, follow these steps to protect yourself:",
      "1. Be skeptical of any message creating urgency or panic: Scammers rely on fear and urgency to trick you into acting without thinking. If a message pressures you to act immediately, that's a major red flag.",
      "2. Check for obvious red flags: Look for signs like strange sender addresses, awkward language, misspellings or links that don't match your state's official DMV website.",
      "3. Do not click any links or reply, and use strong antivirus software: Legitimate DMVs will not ask for payments, personal details or sensitive information via unsolicited text messages. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Verify directly with your DMV: If you're concerned the message might be real, contact your state's DMV using the official website or a trusted phone number. Never use the contact information provided in the suspicious text.",
      "5. Consider a Personal Data Removal Service:\u00a0Your personal information is widely available online, which can make you a bigger target for these types of scams, therefore you might look into a personal data removal service. These services work by submitting opt-out requests to data brokers that collect and sell your information, helping to reduce your digital footprint and making it harder for scammers to find your contact details.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6. Delete the message immediately and block the sender: Removing the text helps prevent accidental clicks and reduces the risk of falling for the scam later. Also, be sure to\u00a0block phone numbers and texts that send spam or scam messages, reducing future risk.",
      "7. Register your number with the\u00a0National Do Not Call Registry: While this won't stop all scams, it can help reduce unwanted communications.",
      "8. Don't provide any personal or financial information: Never share your Social Security number, driver's license number, banking information, or passwords in response to an unsolicited text.",
      "9. If you clicked the link or gave out information, act quickly: If you accidentally entered personal or financial information, contact your bank, credit card provider or local law enforcement right away to minimize potential damage.",
      "10. Keep your phone's security features updated: Ensure your\u00a0device's operating system and security software are current to help block known scam numbers and malicious links.",
      "11. Report the scam:\u00a0Forward the message to 7726 (SPAM) to alert your mobile provider and help block similar messages in the future. Mark the message as junk or spam within your messaging app, if possible. File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at\u00a0reportfraud.ftc.gov or the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center at\u00a0ic3.gov.",
      "DON\u2019T GET CAUGHT IN THE \"APPLE ID SUSPENDED\" PHISHING SCAM",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Scam texts pretending to be from the DMV are getting more convincing, but you don't have to be their next victim. Staying skeptical of urgent messages, double-checking anything that seems off and never clicking suspicious links can go a long way in protecting your personal information. Remember, the real DMV will never pressure you for payment or sensitive details over text. By staying alert, you can help prevent these scams and keep your personal information and money secure.",

      "The demographic landscape in the U.S. is shifting rapidly, with the median age now at 38.9, almost a decade older than it was in 1980.",
      "By 2050, the population of adults over 65 is projected to surge from 58 million to 82 million, intensifying the already urgent challenge of eldercare. With falls remaining the top cause of injury among older adults, the need for innovative, tech-driven solutions has never been clearer.",

      "How MIT\u2019s E-BAR robot helps prevent falls and support senior mobility",
      "E-BAR, short for\u00a0Elderly Bodily Assistance Robot, is not your typical assistive device. Rather than relying on harnesses or wearables, which many seniors find cumbersome or stigmatizing, E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users from behind. This allows individuals to walk freely, lean on the robot's arms for support or receive full-body assistance when transitioning between sitting and standing. The robot's articulated body, constructed from 18 interconnected bars, mimics the natural movement of the human body, delivering a seamless and intuitive experience.",
      "AI ROBOTS HELP NURSES BEAT BURNOUT AND TRANSFORM HOSPITAL CARE",
      "The engineering behind E-BAR's mobility is equally impressive. The robot's 220-pound base is meticulously designed to support the weight of an average adult without tipping or slipping, and its omnidirectional wheels enable smooth navigation through tight spaces and around household obstacles. This means E-BAR can move effortlessly alongside users, providing support in real time, whether they are reaching for a high shelf or stepping out of a bathtub.",

      "BEST CREDIT CARDS FOR SENIORS AND RETIREES 2025",
      "Inside MIT\u2019s E-BAR: A fall-prevention robot designed for aging in place",
      "What sets E-BAR apart from previous eldercare robots is its integrated fall-prevention system. Each arm is embedded with airbags made from soft, grippable materials that can inflate instantly if a fall is detected. This rapid response cushions the user without causing bruising, and, crucially, it does so without requiring the user to wear any special gear. In lab tests, E-BAR successfully supported elderly volunteers as they performed everyday tasks that often pose a risk for falls, such as bending down, stretching up or navigating the tricky edge of a bathtub.",
      "Currently, E-BAR is operated via remote control, but the MIT team is already working on automating its navigation and assistance features. The vision is for future versions to autonomously follow users, assess their real-time fall risk using machine learning algorithms and provide adaptive support as their mobility needs evolve.",

      "The E-BAR project is rooted in extensive interviews with seniors and caregivers, which revealed a strong preference for unobtrusive, non-restrictive support systems. E-BAR's U-shaped handlebars leave the front of the user completely open, allowing for a natural stride and easy exit at any time. The robot is slim enough to fit through standard doorways and is designed to blend into the home environment, making it a practical addition rather than an intrusive medical device.",
      "MIT researchers see E-BAR as part of a broader ecosystem of assistive technologies, each tailored to different stages of aging and mobility. While some devices may offer predictive fall detection or harness-based support, E-BAR's unique combination of full-body assistance, fall prevention and user autonomy addresses a critical gap for those who want to maintain independence but need occasional support.",

The research team is continuing to refine the design and aims to bring it to market in the coming years, but it could take 5\u201310 years before the device receives full regulatory approval and becomes commercially accessible.",
      "Looking forward, the research team is also focused on refining E-BAR's design to make it slimmer, more maneuverable and even more intuitive to use. They are also exploring ways to integrate advanced AI for real-time fall prediction and adaptive assistance, ensuring that the robot can meet users' changing needs as they age.

And now another data broker, LexisNexis, a major name in the industry, has reported a significant breach that exposed sensitive information from more than 364,000 people.",

      "LexisNexis filed a\u00a0notice with the Maine attorney general revealing that a hacker accessed consumer data through a third-party software development platform. The breach happened on Dec. 25, 2024, but the company only discovered it months later. LexisNexis was alerted on April 1, 2025, by an unnamed individual who claimed to have found sensitive files. It remains unclear whether this person was responsible for the breach or merely came across the exposed data.",

Security guidelines repeatedly warn against storing sensitive information in such repositories; however, mistakes such as exposed access tokens and personal data files continue to occur.",

      "LexisNexis isn\u2019t a household name for most people, but it plays a major role in how personal data is harvested and used behind the scenes. The company pulls information from a wide range of sources, compiling detailed profiles that help other businesses assess risk and detect fraud. Its clients include banks, insurance companies and government agencies.",
      "In 2023, the New York Times reported that several car manufacturers had been sharing driving data with LexisNexis without notifying vehicle owners. That information was then sold to insurance companies, which used it to adjust premiums based on individual driving behavior. The story made one thing clear. LexisNexis has access to a staggering amount of personal detail, even from people who have never willingly engaged with the company.",
      "Law enforcement also uses LexisNexis tools to dig up information on suspects. These systems offer access to phone records, home addresses and other historical data. While such tools might assist in investigations, they also highlight a serious issue. When this much sensitive information is concentrated in one place, it becomes a single point of failure.

      "Keeping your personal data safe online can feel overwhelming, but a few practical steps can make a big difference in protecting your privacy and reducing your digital footprint. Here are 7 effective ways to take control of your information and keep it out of the wrong hands:",
      "1. Remove your data from the internet:\u00a0The most effective way to take control of your data and avoid data brokers from selling it is to opt for data removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "2. Review privacy settings: Take a few minutes to explore the privacy and security settings on the services you use. For example, limit who can see your social media posts, disable unnecessary location-sharing on your phone and consider turning off ad personalization on accounts like Google and Facebook. Most browsers let you block third-party cookies or clear tracking data. The FTC suggests comparing the privacy notices of different sites and apps and choosing ones that let you opt out of sharing when possible.",
      "3. Use privacy-friendly tools: Install browser extensions or plugins that block ads and trackers (such as uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger). You might switch to a more private search engine (like DuckDuckGo or Brave) that doesn\u2019t log your queries. Consider using a browser\u2019s \"incognito\" or private mode when you don\u2019t want your history saved, and regularly clear your cookies and cache. Even small habits, like logging out of accounts when not in use or using a password manager, make you less trackable.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Beware of phishing links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Scammers may try to get access to your financial details and other important data using phishing links. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Be cautious with personal data: Think twice before sharing extra details. Don\u2019t fill out online surveys or quizzes that ask for personal or financial information unless you trust the source. Create separate email addresses for sign-ups (so marketing emails don\u2019t go to your main inbox). Only download apps from official stores and check app permissions.",
      "6. Opt out of data broker lists: Many data brokers offer ways to opt out or delete your information, though it can be a tedious process. For example, there are sites like Privacy Rights Clearinghouse or the Whitepages opt-out page that list popular brokers and their opt-out procedures. The FTC\u2019s consumer guide,\u00a0\"Your Guide to Protecting Your Privacy Online,\" includes tips on opting out of targeted ads and removing yourself from people-search databases. Keep in mind you may have to repeat this every few months.",
      "7. Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "HR FIRM CONFIRMS 4M RECORDS EXPOSED IN MAJOR HACK",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "For many, the LexisNexis breach may be the first time they realize just how much of their data is in circulation. Unlike a social media platform or a bank, there is no clear customer relationship with a data broker, and that makes it harder to demand transparency. This incident should prompt serious discussion around what kind of oversight is necessary in industries that operate in the shadows. A more informed public and stronger regulation may be the only things standing between personal data and permanent exposure.",

      "Why is windowless design such a big deal for aircraft?",
      "Most travelers don't realize that windows are structural weak points in an aircraft. They require extra reinforcement, add weight and disrupt the smooth flow of air over the fuselage (the main body of the plane). This increases drag, a resistance force that makes flight less efficient. By removing windows, the Phantom 3500's surface allows air to flow with minimal turbulence, helping the aircraft achieve what Otto Aviation describes as \"full laminar flow characteristics.\"",
      "HYPERSONIC JET PROMISES NYC TO LONDON IN UNDER AN HOUR",

Otto Aviation refers to this system as Super Natural Vision, a proprietary technology that replaces traditional windows with state-of-the-art digital displays, seamlessly integrating real-time external views for a unique in-flight experience.",

By sustaining laminar flow, the aircraft aims to improve fuel efficiency by 35%. This allows it to maintain high-speed performance while consuming less fuel, making it one of the most aerodynamically efficient aircraft ever developed. It operates in the transonic range (Mach 0.8\u20131.2), balancing speed and efficiency. It can also reach a cruising altitude of 51,000 feet, significantly higher than most commercial airliners, which typically fly between 30,000 and 40,000 feet.",
      "Thanks to its streamlined fuselage and optimized aerodynamics, the Phantom 3500 burns 50% less fuel than conventional business jets. This reduction in fuel consumption translates to lower operating costs and a significant decrease in carbon emissions. The Phantom 3500\u2019s wings achieve complete laminar flow, allowing for smoother airflow and reduced drag, enabling the aircraft to take off from runways as short as 3,500 feet, nearly doubling the number of accessible airports in the U.S. alone compared to similar-sized jets.",

      "In the wake of the breach, Adidas began notifying potentially affected customers directly. The company's email to customers below aimed to reassure recipients and clarify what information was involved. Here is the full text of the notification sent to affected individuals.",
      "Dear customer,",
      "We are writing to inform you of an issue that we recently became aware of which may have impacted some of your data.",
      "What happened",
      "adidas recently learned that an unauthorized external party gained access to certain customer data through a third-party customer service provider.",
      "What information was involved",
      "The affected data does not contain passwords, credit card or any other payment-related information. Nor have any Social Security numbers been impacted.",
      "It mainly consists of contact information relating to customers who had contacted our customer service help desk in the past. This may have included one or more of the following: name, email address, telephone number, gender and/or birth date.",
      "What we are doing",
      "Privacy and the security of your data is our priority. Upon becoming aware of this incident, adidas took proactive and immediate steps to investigate and contain the incident. This includes further enhancing security measures and resetting passwords for customer service accounts.",
      "What you can do",
      "We are currently unaware of any harm (such as identity theft or fraud) being caused to our customers as a result of this incident. There are no immediate steps that you need to take. Although, as always, please remain vigilant and look out for any suspicious messages. As a reminder, adidas will never directly contact you to ask that you provide us with financial information, such as your credit card details, bank account information or passwords.",
      "Who you can contact",

      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK",
      "What Adidas hasn\u2019t said about the vendor hack",
      "Despite the official acknowledgment, several questions remain unanswered. Adidas has yet to clarify whether this is a single breach affecting multiple regions or several separate incidents. The lack of transparency around the name of the third-party vendor and the absence of concrete numbers or locations for affected users has created frustration among observers and possibly among customers themselves.",
      "The earlier regional reports from Turkey and Korea might suggest that this incident was either global in scale or that similar third-party vendors were independently targeted. In either case, the company's current handling of the situation has left room for speculation. Adidas claims it is in the process of informing potentially affected customers, but it has not detailed the method or timeline for this outreach.",
      "We reached out to adidas for a comment, and a representative referred us to this statement on their\u00a0website. In part, the company said, \"We remain fully committed to protecting the privacy and security of our consumers, and sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern caused by this incident.\"",

      "If you think you were affected or just want to be cautious, here are some steps you can take right now to stay safe from the Adidas data breach:",
      "1. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Adidas breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "2. Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email and phone number, Adidas attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Adidas breach. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You might want to consider investing in identity theft protection, which can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Adidas breach shows that even companies with decades of brand equity and a massive global footprint are not immune to lapses in data security. It underscores the need for companies to go beyond basic compliance and actively evaluate the cybersecurity standards of every partner in their ecosystem. Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the trade-offs they make when sharing their personal information, and brands that fail to meet this moment may find their reputations eroding faster than they expect.",

The robot handles medicine deliveries, ward patrols and visitor guidance, which Foxconn estimates can reduce nurse workloads by up to 30%. In one ward, Nurabot delivers wound care kits and educational materials directly to patient bedsides, saving nurses multiple trips to supply rooms and allowing them to dedicate more time to their patients. The robot is also especially helpful during visiting hours and night shifts, when staffing levels are typically lower.",
      "Nurses hope future versions of Nurabot will be able to converse with patients in multiple languages, recognize faces for personalized interactions and even assist with lifting patients when needed. For example, a lung patient who needs two nurses to sit up for breathing exercises might only require one nurse with Nurabot's help, freeing the other to care for other patients.",

    "story": [
      "Defense attorney Robert Alessi called for a mistrial once again Monday, alleging \"intentional misconduct\" in court from special prosecutor Hank Brennan during Karen Read's second murder trial. A prior motion was denied.",
      "Karen Read's defense called forensic pathologist Dr. Elizabeth Laposata to the stand in her murder trial Monday, a forensic pathologist who testified that victim John O'Keefe's brain injuries appeared to have stemmed from a fall backward onto a ridged surface.",
      "Read is on trial for the second time in connection with the alleged murder of her former boyfriend, who was a Boston police officer. Prosecutors accuse her of striking him with her Lexus after a night out drinking, then leaving him to die on the ground during a blizzard in Canton, Massachusetts, about 20 miles south of the city where he worked.",
      "In a hearing without jurors present, Judge Beverly Cannone ruled that Laposata's credentials did not qualify her to testify about potential dog bites as a source of injuries to O'Keefe's arm, and the judge limited what she could say about the impacts of motor vehicles on pedestrians in collisions.",
      "JURY SKEPTICISM OF EXPERTS COULD DETERMINE OUTCOME IN KAREN READ MURDER TRIAL: FORMER JUDGE",
      "Karen Read exits Norfolk County Superior Court, in Dedham, MA, Tuesday, May 20, 2025. (Hans Pennink for Fox News Digital)",
      "Before Cannone sent jurors home around 4 p.m., Laposata testified that O'Keefe's skull fracture was consistent with a \"coup-contrecoup\" type injury, meaning that it appeared as though he struck the back of his head first and then suffered internal brain injuries as the result of internal momentum.",
      "\"When the brain slaps forcefully against the base of the skull, the delicate bones above the eye break, and that's again the coup contra coup,\" she said. \"The brain slaps forward, and when those delicate bones are broken, there's bleeding, and that bleeding then goes right down into the upper eyelids. So it kind of looks like you have black eyes, but...there's not been any punch to the face.\"",
      "She said that the injury pattern also indicated that he fell on a ridged surface, not something flat.",
      "That also caused the \"raccoon eyes\" swelling and bruising in the front of his face. However, she testified, the cut over O'Keefe's right eye was caused by something else \u2013 an application of force involving a small object.",
      "Officer John O\u2019Keefe poses for his official headshot. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s girlfriend, Karen Reed, is currently on trial for murder after he was found dead outside of a Massachusetts home in January 2022. (Boston Police Department)",

      "\"Sure,\" she replied. \"A fist is an object.\"",
      "Dr. Aizik Wolf, a brain surgeon who testified earlier on behalf of the prosecution, also said that O'Keefe's skull fracture was consistent with a backward fall onto the frozen ground. But he conceded that cuts to the front of O'Keefe's face, on his eyelid and nose, were caused by something else.",
      "Laposata will return to the stand Tuesday for additional testimony.",
      "Read's defense called two other witnesses Monday, including a private investigator hired just last week named John Tedeman. He said he took measurements outside 34 Fairview Road in Canton, Massachusetts \u2013 the Boston suburb where her O'Keefe was found dead on Jan. 29, 2022.",
      "Read is accused of clipping him with a 2021 Lexus LX 570 SUV and leaving him to die during a blizzard. She denies striking him at all, and her defense is attempting to illustrate how O'Keefe could have walked into the home before his death contrary to prosecution claims.",

      "While the medical examiner could not rule O'Keefe's death a homicide, Wolf testified that his skull fractures were consistent with falling backward and striking his head on the ground. Another witness for the commonwealth, Dr. Judson Welcher, testified that scratches on O'Keefe's arm were consistent with an impact from Read's taillight, which was broken when police seized it.",
      "But a defense dog bite expert, Dr. Marie Russell, testified that the injuries were consistent with dog bites and scratches, not a vehicular strike, and a crash reconstructionist testified that the damage to her taillight could have come from someone throwing a bar glass like the one found shattered near O'Keefe's remains.",

      "\"We go where other people don\u2019t or won\u2019t,\" Graham said during a visit to Arab al-Aramshe, a northern Israeli village hit by Hezbollah missiles and drones. \"Not just because we love you, but because God loves you.\"",
      "Before arriving, Graham flew low over the Jordan River Valley, just beyond the West Bank.\"These communities were hit up here, and they are also forgotten about,\" he said. \"But Samaritan\u2019s Purse hasn\u2019t forgotten them. We\u2019ve got great relationships with local community leaders and churches in the area. These people are hurting. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here \u2014 to let Israel know they\u2019re not forgotten. And God bless them.\"",
      "Arab al-Aramshe is still picking up the pieces after a deadly drone strike blew the roof off the local community center and killed a man who was trying to protect it.

      "\"We\u2019re delivering ambulances throughout Israel to support communities like this one,\" Graham said. \"We\u2019re also building ambulance exchange points, safe places where medical teams can store ambulances and respond to emergencies. It\u2019s about restoring confidence so people feel safe enough to move back.\"\"This was a dead zone filled with alarm every day,\" said Moshe Davidovitz, mayor of the Matte Asher Regional Council and head of the Northern Conflict Zone Forum. \"We don\u2019t just want to fix the place. We want to grow the place \u2026 but we need to be able to provide some safety.\"Thousands of people evacuated,\" Davidovitz added. \"They are refugees in their own country. While they were gone, they didn\u2019t know what happened to their home, to their dogs, everything they left behind.\"",
      "That safety is arriving in the form of 42 ambulances, 28 armored, donated by Samaritan\u2019s Purse to Israel\u2019s national emergency service, Magen David Adom (MDA). One of them has already been assigned to Arab al-Aramshe.",
      "Ali Wahid, a senior medic in the area, said the new ambulance makes a big difference.",
      "\"We are not afraid to respond. But now we will feel safe when we respond,\" he said.",

      "\"Hamas came out and attacked the communities down here,\" he said. \"Jewish and Arab communities were hit. Today I\u2019m seeing another ambulance exchange point location. There are still a lot of displaced people. We want to bring back confidence and security, so people can come home.\"",
      "In Nir Oz, a kibbutz where one in four residents were either kidnapped or murdered during Hamas\u2019 brutal October 2024 attack, the damage is still overwhelming. Houses are burned and shattered. Posters show the faces of loved ones, including baby Kfir Bibas and 83-year-old grandfather Oded Lifshitz, both killed by Hamas.\"This is where they burned houses, pulled children from their parents, murdered babies,\" Graham said, standing in the ruins.\"You see the pictures of the people who are no longer here. Explosions have been going off the whole time I\u2019ve been in this village. But the leaders here are rebuilding. They want to bring people back this summer. And Samaritan\u2019s Purse just committed to help with a community clinic and resilience center.\"",
      "Mayor Michal Uziyahu of the Eshkol region walked Graham through the destruction. Her region lost 244 people Oct 7. Half of the hostages still held by Hamas come from her communities.\"Seventy percent of the massacre happened here,\" she said. \"Every fourth person was either murdered or kidnapped.\"",
      "Still, she insists the region will not be defined by terror.",
      "\"We are determined to make sure that the tragedy won\u2019t define us,\" Uziyahu said. \"This place will be filled with life again. The thing terrorists fear most isn\u2019t tanks or fighter jets. It\u2019s the sound of children laughing in our streets.\"",
      "Graham, moved by what he saw, offered a simple message.\"There\u2019s been so much pain, murder and brokenness here,\" he said. \"But I\u2019ve talked to the survivors and asked if they carry hate. And they don\u2019t. They still love their neighbors. They want peace. I don\u2019t even understand that myself. But I ask everyone, please keep praying for Israel. They need your prayers and our support.\"",
      "Samaritan\u2019s Purse is building a resilience center in the Eshkol region and another in the nearby Merhavim area, home to about 4,000 children, many of whom have experienced devastating trauma.\"We never define ourselves through the tragedy,\" Uziyahu said. \"We define ourselves with life and hope.\"",
      "Along with the trauma centers, Samaritan\u2019s Purse is building two EMS stations, one near the Gaza border, where residents bled to death during the October attacks because medics couldn\u2019t reach them in time.\u00a0The group is also installing 25 bomb shelters across Israel, 11 in the north and 14 in the south.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

    "story": [
      "New Jersey voters are heading to the polls on Tuesday to pick nominees for this year\u2019s race for governor, in the first high-profile primaries for both parties since the 2024 election.",
      "New Jersey is one of two states with a gubernatorial race this year, along with Virginia. And both contests will be closely watched as early indicators of how voters are responding to President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Democratic New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy cannot run for re-election due to term limits, so there are contested races for both parties\u2019 nominations. Candidates and groups have spent $85 million on ads this year in both primaries, according to to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact, with more than $75 million spent in the Democratic primary alone.",
      "As Democrats nationally have tried to regroup following Trump\u2019s 2024 victory, where he also narrowed his margin of victory in bluer states like New Jersey, the six Democratic candidates have presented different paths forward for their party. And the race is still unsettled heading into the primary.",
      "On the Republican side, five candidates are on the ballot \u2014 but former state Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, whom Trump endorsed in mid-May, is viewed as the front-runner.",
      "Polls close at 8 p.m. ET. Here are three things to watch as voters make their choices.",
      "Which path will Democrats choose?",
      "The crowded Democratic primary remains the most unpredictable race New Jersey has seen in decades, in part because county parties can no longer give advantageous ballot positions to their preferred candidates, following a lawsuit from Democrat Andy Kim during his Senate run last year. The suit weakened the state's party machines and contributed to a wide-open contest.",
      "As Democratic voters in New Jersey have evaluated the candidates, some have prioritized electability, raising concerns that Ciattarelli will be tough to beat in November. The former state legislator lost to Murphy in 2021 by 3 percentage points. And Trump also made gains in the state last year, losing by 6, a 10-point improvement on his 2020 margin, which was the second-largest swing toward Trump in the country. Democratic voters also say they are looking for a candidate to take on Trump.",
      "Against that backdrop, each Democrat has been pitching a different path forward for their party, and Tuesday\u2019s primary will be Democratic voters\u2019 first major opportunity to weigh in on which path they should take.",
      "Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill has been viewed as the relative front-runner after leading in limited public polling, although candidates are often clustered together within the margin of error.",
      "Sherrill has leveraged the party\u2019s successful playbook from the 2018 midterm elections, when she and other Democrats flipped Republican-held House seats. She has emphasized her background as a Navy helicopter pilot and a federal prosecutor in her pitch as someone who can effectively govern and take on Trump.",
      "Sherrill has faced recent attacks for her House campaign accepting donations from a corporate PAC tied to Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, and for being late to disclose two stock trades related to her husband\u2019s work. Sherrill\u2019s House campaign donated the PAC money to charity. She also paid a fine for the late disclosure and supports a stock trading ban for members of Congress.",
      "Newark Mayor Ras Baraka has been pitching himself as the true progressive in the race who's willing to take on the president. He garnered national attention when he was arrested last month at a federal immigration detention facility. (The charges were later dropped, and Baraka is now suing New Jersey U.S. Attorney Alina Habba in response.)",
      "The attention has given Baraka\u2019s campaign a last-minute boost, with recent fundraising reports showing that his campaign raised $962,000 in the 17 days following the arrest, more than twice as much as his next closest Democratic competitor.",
      "Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop is also appealing to the party\u2019s liberal voters, describing his supporters as \u201cpragmatic progressive\u201d voters. Fulop has been running an anti-establishment campaign, criticizing the state\u2019s Democratic political machine and Murphy, whom he described at a recent campaign stop as a \u201csub-average\u201d governor.",
      "Teachers\u2019 union president Sean Spiller has said he also considers himself a progressive and has criticized those in his party who he says are backed by wealthy corporate interests. Spiller himself has been boosted by Working New Jersey, a super PAC funded by the New Jersey Education Association, which Spiller leads.",
      "Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer, one of the more moderate members of Congress, has been pitching an economic-focused message, saying he will work to bring down the state\u2019s high cost of living.",
      "And former state Senate President Steve Sweeney, who lost re-election in 2021 to an underfunded GOP challenger, has argued that he is best equipped to lead the state government given his legislative experience. Sweeney, who is also stressing his blue-collar roots as a former ironworker, could have a geographic advantage as the only candidate from South Jersey.",
      "How influential is Trump\u2019s endorsement?",
      "The GOP primary will be a key test for Trump\u2019s endorsement and determine whether the president has helped consolidate his supporters around Ciattarelli, his preferred candidate in the race.",
      "Ciattarelli sharply criticized then-candidate Trump in 2015, calling him a \u201ccharlatan\u201d and unfit to be president, and he notably did not campaign with Trump when he ran for governor in 2021. Trump knocked Ciattarelli for failing to do so in a radio appearance last year with Ciattarelli\u2019s chief competitor in the GOP primary, Bill Spadea.",
      "\u201cThis guy never came to ask for my support,\u201d Trump said then of Ciattarelli. \u201cAnd you know what, when MAGA sees that, they don\u2019t like it and they didn\u2019t vote for him. He would have won easily if he did.\u201d",
      "Spadea also asked for Trump\u2019s endorsement in the race, and the possibility that Trump would take sides in the primary loomed over the contest for months.",
      "The president ultimately endorsed Ciattarelli on May 12, writing on Truth Social that Ciattarelli is now \u201c100%\u201d MAGA and is best positioned to win in November.",
      "Ciattarelli, for his part, now says he fully supports Trump and dismissed his past comments in an April interview with NBC News, noting other Republicans (including Vice President JD Vance) have criticized Trump in the past.",
      "The primary could also shed light on the size of the anti-Trump wing of the GOP in New Jersey, with state Sen. Jon Bramnick in the race. Bramnick, a longtime state legislator who is also a standup comedian, has called for a return to civility, and he has sharply criticized Trump in the past.",
      "Two other candidates are also on the Republican primary ballot: former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac, a a self-described \u201cforever Trumper\u201d who has been endorsed by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and contractor Justin Barbera.",
      "Will the millions of dollars matter?",
      "Tuesday\u2019s primaries in New Jersey will also test outside groups' influence as they've spent millions of dollars in the pricey New York and Philadelphia media markets to reach Garden State voters.",
      "The pro-Spiller super PAC Working New Jersey, which is tied to the state\u2019s teachers\u2019 union, had spent a whopping $35 million on the race as of May 27, according to the latest campaign finance reports, while Spiller\u2019s campaign itself had spent $342,000. The group has spent $12.1 million on ads this year, according to AdImpact.",
      "That ad-spending sum was surpassed only by Affordable New Jersey, a super PAC supporting Gottheimer, which was funded largely by transfers from Gottheimer\u2019s congressional campaign. That group has spent $14.8 million on the airwaves.",
      "Fulop has also gotten a boost by a super PAC called Coalition for Progress, which has spent $8.1 million on ads this year. Sherrill\u2019s aligned super PAC, One Giant Leap PAC, has dropped nearly $5.9 million on the airwaves, largely over the last month of the race.",
      "Ciattarelli has had a financial advantage in the GOP primary, spending $6 million on ads, compared to Spadea\u2019s $1.7 million and Bramnick\u2019s $1.2 million, according to AdImpact. Both Ciattarelli and Spadea have also gotten boosts from super PACs, but both groups have spent less than $1 million on ads in the race."

      "Adalah, the legal center for Arab minority rights in Israel, said in a statement Monday that it had met with 11 of the 12 people detained following the Madleen\u2019s interception before some of them, who consented to deportation, flew out of Tel Aviv.",
      "It said at least four people had been deported or were being deported from Israel, while eight remained in detention at Givon Prison in Ramla and planned to contest their deportation before an Israeli tribunal. They were expected to appear before the Immigration Detention Review Tribunal on Tuesday morning.",
      "The Madleen, dubbed the \u201cFreedom Flotilla\u201d by activists, departed Sicily earlier this month in a bid to break Israel's naval blockade which has been in place since 2007, when Hamas rose to power in the Gaza Strip, and deliver aid to Palestinians.",
      "The vessel departed as Israel allowed a trickle of aid into Gaza after lifting a widely-condemned blockade that had barred the entry of food, medicine and other vital supplies for more than two months.",
      "In a post on X, an account run by Israel\u2019s foreign affairs ministry said that more than 1,200 aid trucks had entered Gaza from Israel \u201cwithin the past two weeks,\u201d with just over 10 million meals distributed from aid sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the group tasked with distributing food in the enclave under a controversial new system.",
      "Gaza has a population of around 2.1 million people, so those meals over the course of two weeks would equate to roughly a third of a meal per day for each member of the population.",

      "With more than 1 in 3 American households owning dogs, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, danger abounds for mail carriers.",
      "\u201c[It\u2019s] a real problem,\u201d David Coleman, a spokesperson for the Postal Service, said in an email. \u201cDogs are animals, they act instinctively and can bite for any number of reasons. All it takes is just one wrong interaction/movement for our carriers to be injured.\u201d",
      "The Postal Services releases its dog attack figures every year as part of its Dog Bite Awareness campaign. The incidents, mostly self-reported by employees, include chases, bites, assaults and deaths, like that of a 61-year-old mail carrier in Florida who died in 2022 after she was mauled by five dogs.",
      "Midwest states have a higher rate of dog attacks when the data is adjusted for the number of households. The six states with the highest rates of dog attacks \u2014 Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Ohio \u2014 are all Midwestern.",

      "For the 300,000-plus mail carriers in the United States, many of whom deliver to hundreds of addresses every day, the risk adds up. If a dog attack does occur, the financial and emotional impacts can be significant: In 2024, the average cost per insurance claim for a dog bite was nearly $70,000, according to the Insurance Information Institute.",
      "To help minimize the risk of attacks, the Postal Service has instituted guidelines for interacting with dogs on routes and ways to protect against harm, including carrying dog repellant and using mail satchels to create distance from dogs.",
      "Coleman had advice for dog owners: \u201cThe best way to keep safe from dog bites and attacks is to recognize and promote responsible pet ownership,\u201d he said. \u201cTeach your dog appropriate behavior and commands and don\u2019t allow a dog to roam freely.\u201d"

      "SUNRISE, Fla. \u2014 Taking advantage of the Edmonton Oilers' worst performance in several weeks, the defending Florida Panthers pounced on mistakes to win Game 3 in a 6-1 rout Monday night and take a 2-1 series lead.",
      "Brad Marchand became the oldest player to score in each of the first three games of a final, while Sam Bennett added his NHL playoff-leading 14th goal after making a big hit on Edmonton's Vasily Podkolzin that contributed to the turnover to spring him on a breakaway. Marchand and Bennett have combined to score eight goals for Florida, which was dominant in just about every way.",
      "\"We ended up playing what Florida kind of wanted,\" said Oilers goalie Stuart Skinner, who got pulled after allowing five goals on 23 shots. \"They were great tonight.\"",
      "And it was not just Bennett and Marchand. Carter Verhaeghe and Sam Reinhart each got his first goal of the series, Aaron Ekblad scored to chase Skinner and Evan Rodrigues added the exclamation point in the waning minutes.",
      "\"We're a very deep team,\" Marchand said. \"That's one of our strengths is the depth of the group from the front end to the back end to the goaltending.\"",
      "At the other end of the ice, Sergei Bobrovsky earned the \"Bobby! Bobby!\" chants from a fired up South Florida crowd. The two-time Vezina Trophy-winning goaltender known as \"Bob\" was on his game for the very few quality chances the discombobulated Oilers mustered, making 32 saves.",
      "\"Nothing's going to be perfect in the way we play,\" Reinhart said. \"This time of year, you need some world-class goaltending and that's what we get consistently.\"",
      "Perry \u2014 at 40 the oldest player in the series \u2014 beat Bobrovsky with some silky hands for a power-play goal, keeping up this final being a showcase of cagey veterans along with Marchand.",
      "Connor McDavid could not get his team on track, and Edmonton took 15 minors \u2014 led by Evander Kane's three plus a misconduct to add up to 85 penalty minutes \u2014 including a brawl that ensued with less than 10 minutes left. Trent Frederic and Darnell Nurse, who fought Jonah Gadjovich, got misconducts that knocked them out of a game with an outcome determined long before.",
      "\"Emotions in all these games are extremely high,' Marchand said. \"This is the time of year you want to be playing, and you're enjoying every minute.\"",
      "After the final looked as evenly matched as can be with Games 1 and 2 each needing extra time, overtime and then double OT, Game 3 was a lopsided mismatch. The Oilers came unglued to the point Jake Walman resorted to squirting water on Panthers players on their bench from his spot on the visiting side.",
      "The teams have some extra time off before Game 4 on Thursday night, when the Panthers have the chance to take a 3-1 lead and move to the verge of going back to back.",
      "\"Game 4 is a really big game,\" McDavid said. \"It's a big swing game.\""

      "ATMORE, Ala. \u2014 A man convicted of beating a woman to death nearly 37 years ago is scheduled to be executed Tuesday in Alabama in what will be the nation\u2019s sixth execution with nitrogen gas.",
      "Gregory Hunt is scheduled to be put to death Tuesday night at a south Alabama prison. Hunt was convicted of killing Karen Lane, a woman he had been dating for about a month, according to court records.",
      "The Alabama execution is one of four that had been scheduled this week in the United States. Executions are also scheduled in Florida and South Carolina. A judge in Oklahoma on Monday issued a temporary stay for an execution in that state, but the state attorney general is seeking to get it lifted.",
      "Lane was 32 when she was murdered Aug. 2, 1988, in the Cordova apartment she shared with a woman who was Hunt\u2019s cousin.",
      "Prosecutors said Hunt broke into her apartment and killed her after sexually abusing her. A physician who performed an autopsy testified that she died from blunt force trauma and that Lane had sustained some 60 injuries, including 20 to the head.",
      "A jury on June 19, 1990, found Hunt guilty of capital murder during sexual abuse and burglary. Jurors recommended by a vote of 11-1 that he receive a death sentence, which a judge imposed.",
      "Hunt\u2019s final request for a stay of execution, which he filed himself, focused on claims that prosecutors made false statements to jurors about evidence of sexual abuse. The element of sexual abuse is what elevated the crime to a death penalty offense.",
      "In a filing to the U.S. Supreme Court, Hunt, acting as his own attorney, wrote that a prosecutor told jurors that cervical mucus was on a broomstick near Hunt\u2019s body. However, the victim did not have a cervix because of an earlier hysterectomy. The Alabama attorney general\u2019s office called the claim meritless and said even if the prosecutor erred in that statement, it did not throw the conviction into doubt.",
      "Hunt, speaking by telephone last month from prison, did not dispute killing Lane but maintained he did not sexually assault her. He also described himself as someone who was changed by prison.",
      "\u201cKaren didn\u2019t deserve what happened to her,\u201d Hunt said.",
      "Hunt said he had been drinking and doing drugs on the night of the crime and became jealous when he saw Lane in a car with another man.",
      "\u201cYou have your come-to-Jesus moment. Of course, after the fact, you can\u2019t believe what has happened. You can\u2019t believe you were part of it and did it,\u201d Hunt said.",
      "Hunt, who was born in 1960 and came to death row in 1990, is now among the longest-serving inmates on Alabama\u2019s death row. He said prison became his \u201chospital\u201d to heal his broken mind. He said since 1988, he has been leading a Bible class attended by two dozen or more inmates.",
      "\u201cJust trying to be a light in a dark place, trying to tell people if I can change, they can too. ... become people of love instead of hate,\u201d he said.",
      "Lane\u2019s sister declined to comment when reached by telephone. The family is expected to give a written statement Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cThe way she was killed is just devastating,\u201d Denise Gurganus, Lane\u2019s sister, told TV station WBRC at a 2014 vigil for crime victims. \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to lose a family member to death, but when it\u2019s this gruesome.\u201d",
      "The Alabama attorney general\u2019s office, in asking justices to reject Hunt\u2019s request for a stay of execution, wrote that Hunt has now been on death row longer than Lane was alive.",
      "Alabama last year became the first state to carry out an execution with nitrogen gas. Nitrogen has now been used in five executions \u2014 four in Alabama and one in Louisiana. The method involves using a gas mask to force an inmate to breathe pure nitrogen gas, depriving them of the oxygen needed to stay alive.",
      "Hunt had named nitrogen as his preferred execution method. He made the selection before Alabama had developed procedures for using gas. Alabama also allows inmates to choose lethal injection or the electric chair."

    "story": [
      "A man convicted of raping and killing a woman three decades ago after kidnapping her from a supermarket parking lot in Florida is scheduled to be executed Tuesday.",
      "Anthony Wainwright, 54, is scheduled to receive a lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke. He was convicted in the April 1994 killing of 23-year-old Carmen Gayheart, a mother of two young children, in Lake City.",
      "Wainwright would be the sixth person put to death in Florida this year. The state also executed six people in 2023, but only carried out one execution last year. There are four executions scheduled around the country this week, including another one on Tuesday in Alabama. On Monday, an Oklahoma judge granted a temporary stay of execution for a man scheduled to be put to death Thursday.",
      "Richard Hamilton, the other man convicted in Gayheart\u2019s killing, was also sentenced to death. But he died on death row in January 2023 at the age of 59.",
      "Gayheart\u2019s sister, who plans to attend the execution, said three decades is too long to wait for justice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous how many appeals they get,\u201d Maria David told The Associated Press, adding that each step of the appeals process reopened her family\u2019s wounds. \u201cYou have to relive it again because they have to tell the whole story again.\u201d",
      "Wainwright and Hamilton escaped from prison in North Carolina, stole a green Cadillac and burglarized a home the next morning, taking guns and money. Then they drove to Florida and when the Cadillac began to have problems in Lake City, they decided to steal another vehicle.",
      "They confronted Gayheart, a community college student, on April 27, 1994, as she loaded groceries into her blue Ford Bronco, according to court documents. They forced her into the vehicle at gunpoint and drove off. They raped her in the backseat and then took her out of the vehicle and tried to strangle her before shooting her twice in the back of the head, court filings say. They dragged her body several dozen yards from the road and drove off.",
      "The two men were arrested in Mississippi the next day after a shootout with police.",
      "A jury in 1995 convicted Wainwright of murder, kidnapping, robbery and rape and unanimously recommended that he be sentenced to death.",
      "Wainwright\u2019s lawyers have filed multiple unsuccessful appeals over the years based on what they said were problems with his trial and evidence that he suffered from brain damage and intellectual disability.",
      "Since his execution was scheduled, his lawyers have argued in state and federal court filings that his execution should be put on hold to allow time for courts to hear additional legal arguments in his case.",
      "In a filing with the U.S. Supreme Court, his lawyers argue that his case has been \u201cmarred by critical, systemic failures at virtually every stage and through the signing of his death warrant.\u201d Those failures include flawed DNA evidence that wasn\u2019t disclosed to the defense until after opening statements, erroneous jury instructions, inflammatory and inaccurate closing arguments and missteps by court-appointed lawyers, the filing says.",
      "The filing also says that a jailhouse informant who testified at Wainwright\u2019s trial finally admitted last month that he and another informant had testified in exchange for lighter sentences, a fact that had not been disclosed to the defense.",
      "The Supreme Court on Monday denied Wainwright\u2019s final appeals without comment.",
      "David, Gayheart\u2019s sister, said she feels cheated that Hamilton died before the state could execute him.",
      "She said she was \u201covercome with emotion\u201d when she heard the governor had signed a death warrant for Wainwright. Her parents both died while waiting for justice to be served, she said, but she plans to be there to witness the final chapter of her family\u2019s tragedy.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that would keep me from seeing this all the way through,\u201d she said.",
      "Her sister loved animals and surprised her by training to become a nurse rather than a veterinarian, David said. Gayheart was two years younger than her sister but became a mother first, and David said she marveled at her sister\u2019s patience with her young children.",
      "\u201cShe was here, she mattered, she should be remembered, and she was loved,\u201d David said of her sister.",
      "Over the years, she has kept a book where she put every court filing, from the initial indictment through the latest appeals.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to getting the last pieces of paperwork that say he\u2019s been executed to put into the book and never having to think about Anthony Wainwright ever again,\u201d she said."

      "NEW YORK \u2014 The leaders of a sex-focused women's wellness company that promoted \"orgasmic meditation\" have been convicted of federal forced labor charges.",
      "A Brooklyn jury on Monday found Nicole Daedone, founder of OneTaste Inc., and Rachel Cherwitz, the California-based company's former sales director, guilty after deliberating for less than two days following a five-week trial. The two each face up to 20 years in prison when sentenced later.",
      "Prosecutors had argued the two women ran a yearslong scheme that groomed adherents \u2014 many of them victims of sexual trauma \u2014 to do their bidding.",
      "They said Daedone, 57, of New York, and Cherwitz, 44, of California, used economic, sexual and psychological abuse, intimidation and indoctrination to force OneTaste members into sexual acts they found uncomfortable or repulsive, such as having sex with prospective investors or clients.",
      "The two told followers the questionable acts were necessary in order to obtain \"freedom\" and \"enlightenment\" and demonstrate their commitment to the organization's principles.",
      "Prosecutors said OneTaste leaders also didn't pay promised earnings to the members-turned-workers and even forced some of them to take out new credit cards to continue taking the company's courses.",
      "Assistant U.S. Attorney Nina Gupta, in her closing statement last week, said the defendants \"built a business on the backs\" of victims who \"gave everything\" to them, including \"their money, their time, their bodies, their dignity, and ultimately their sanity.\"",
      "\"The jury's verdict has unmasked Daedone and Cherwitz for who they truly are: grifters who preyed on vulnerable victims by making empty promises of sexual empowerment and wellness only to manipulate them into performing labor and services for the defendants' benefit,\" said Joseph Nocella, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.",
      "Daedone's defense team cast her as a \"ceiling-shattering feminist entrepreneur\" who created a unique business around women's sexuality and empowerment.",
      "Cherwitz's lawyer, Celia Cohen, argued that the witnesses who testified weren't forced to do anything. When they didn't like the organization anymore or wanted to try other things, she said, they simply left.",
      "\"No matter what you think about OneTaste and what they were doing, they chose it. They knew what it was about,\" she said in her closing statement last week. \"The fact they are regretting the actions that they took when they were younger is not evidence of a crime.\"",
      "Lawyers for the defendants said their clients maintain their innocence and intend to appeal.",
      "\"We are deeply disappointed in today's verdict,\" the lawyers said in a statement Monday. \"This case raised numerous novel and complex legal issues that will require review by the Second Circuit.\"",
      "Daedone co-founded OneTaste in San Francisco in 2004 as a sort of self-help commune that viewed female orgasms as key to sexual and psychological wellness and interpersonal connection.",
      "A centerpiece was \"orgasmic meditation,\" or \"OM,\" which was carried out by men manually stimulating women in a group setting.",
      "The company enjoyed glowing media coverage in the 2010s and quickly opened outposts from Los Angeles to London. Portrayed as a cutting-edge enterprise that prioritized women's sexual pleasure, it generated revenue by providing courses, coaching, OM events, and other sexual practices for a fee.",
      "Daedone sold her stake in the company in 2017 for $12 million \u2014 a year before OneTaste's marketing and labor practices came under scrutiny.",
      "The company's current owners, who have rebranded it the Institute of OM Foundation, have said its work has been misconstrued and the charges against its former executives were unjustified.",
      "They maintain sexual consent has always been a cornerstone of the organization. The company didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment."

      "Iran said Monday that it will soon hand a counter-proposal for a nuclear deal to the United States in response to a U.S. offer that Tehran deems \u201cunacceptable,\u201d while U.S. President Donald Trump said talks would continue.",
      "Trump made clear that the two sides remained at odds over whether the country would be allowed to continue enriching uranium on Iranian soil.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re just asking for things that you can\u2019t do. They don\u2019t want to give up what they have to give up,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cThey seek enrichment. We can\u2019t have enrichment.\u201d",
      "Earlier, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said Tehran was preparing a counter-offer to the U.S. proposal that was presented in late May. He said there was no detail about the timing of a sixth round of talks.",
      "While Trump said the next round of talks would take place Thursday, a senior Iranian official and a U.S. official said Thursday was unlikely.",
      "Following Trump\u2019s remarks, Baghaei said \u201cbased on recent consultations, the next round of Iran\u2013U.S. indirect negotiations is being planned for next Sunday in Muscat\u201d, according to the ministry\u2019s Telegram channel.",
      "The U.S. official said the talks, led by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, could be Friday or Sunday, possibly in Oman or Oslo.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. proposal is not acceptable to us. It was not the result of previous rounds of negotiations. We will present our own proposal to the other side via Oman after it is finalized. This proposal is reasonable, logical, and balanced,\u201d Baghaei said.",
      "\u201cWe must ensure before the lifting of sanctions that Iran will effectively benefit economically and that its banking and trade relations with other countries will return to normal.\u201d",
      "Reuters previously reported that Tehran was drafting a negative response to the U.S. proposal. An Iranian diplomat said the U.S. offer failed to resolve differences over uranium enrichment on Iranian soil, the shipment abroad of Iran\u2018s entire stockpile of highly enriched uranium and reliable steps to lift U.S. sanctions.",
      "Last week, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dismissed the U.S. proposal as against Iran\u2018s interests, pledging to continue enrichment on Iranian soil, which Western powers view as a potential pathway to building nuclear weapons. Iran says its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes.",
      "Trump said Iran was the main topic of a phone conversation he had Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu\u2019s office said the president had told him talks with Iran would continue at the end of the week.",
      "During his first term in 2018, Trump ditched a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran\u2018s economy. Iran responded by escalating enrichment far beyond that pact\u2019s limits.",

      "At least 10 people were killed and several others injured in a school shooting Tuesday in the southern Austrian city of Graz, local media reported.",
      "A spokesperson for the Graz police told NBC News that \u201cseveral people have been killed\u201d at the BORG Dreiersch\u00fctzengasse school, a secondary school located in the northwest of the city.",
      "In a post on X, police said that the perpetrator was among those dead, adding that they were working on the assumption that there was only one suspect involved in the shooting.",
      "Graz Mayor Elke Kahr told the Austrian Press Agency that at least one adult was among the 10 people to have died.",
      "\u201cThe shooting at a school in Graz is a national tragedy that has deeply shaken our entire country,\u201d Austrian Chancellor Christian Stocker said in a statement posted on X. \u201cMy thoughts are with the families and parents who lost their child.\u201d",
      "Austrian police confirmed the incident was no longer active after earlier saying in a series of posts on X that an operation was underway at the school and that several emergency services, tactical units and a helicopter had been deployed to the area.",
      "Police spokesman Fritz Grundnig told the Austrian public broadcaster ORF that police evacuated the school building after gunshots were heard.",
      "While police did not confirm the number of people injured, the Austrian newspaper Kronen Zeitung reported that at least 28 people had been wounded, including students and teachers.",
      "They were taken to the nearby Helmut List Hall events space for emergency care, before later being taken to hospital.",
      "While Graz is Austria's second largest city, it's still relatively small when compared with major U.S. cities, with a population of around 300,000. A meeting point was set up for the students\u2019 parents at the ASK\u00d6 football stadium, police said on X.",
      "In a press statement Tuesday, police asked the public to \u201cstay away from the area\u201d and to \u201cstrictly follow the instructions of the emergency services.\u201d They added that they had set up a platform for tips or other observations.",
      "The Austrian Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.",

      "Following an accounting fraud scandal that got the company delisted from the Nasdaq in 2020, Luckin has staged an unlikely comeback with quirky flavors and steep discounts \u2014 as low as $1.40 per cup during an earlier price war with rival Cotti Coffee.",
      "The Wall Street debacle hasn\u2019t dampened Luckin\u2019s ambitions in the U.S., where it still trades over the counter. After venturing into Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia, Luckin is set to take its biggest leap yet with plans to open a branch in Lower Manhattan.",

Founded in 2022 by former Luckin executives who were ousted over the scandal, Cotti has also grown rapidly in China and internationally, with stores in locations ranging from Southeast Asia to Dubai and California.",
      "\u201cNew York is probably culturally the best testing ground for an international brand to expand into, especially a Chinese one,\u201d said Bernstein Senior Analyst Danilo Gargiulo, citing the city\u2019s diversity and large base of young consumers. \u201cBut it\u2019s also the most saturated, one of the most competitive markets.\u201d",
      "Chinese chains combine budget pricing with unusual flavors that often blur the line between coffee and bubble tea \u2014 jarring to purists but extremely popular at home. Luckin said its alcohol-infused latte, developed with China\u2019s leading Moutai liquor maker, sold more than 5.4 million cups on its first day in 2023, generating over $13.7 million in sales. The company launched 119 different items in 2024 alone.",
      "Luckin has built its business around technology, allowing customers in China to order and get deliveries through the country\u2019s ubiquitous WeChat app, replacing the traditional cafe experience with hyper efficiency. The company also runs large coffee-bean roasting and processing operations in China to help drive down costs.",
      "The question is whether this will work in America.",
      "Luckin and Cotti did not respond to requests for comment from CNBC. On an earnings call in April, Luckin\u2019s co-founder Guo Jinyi said the company plans to \u201cadopt flexible, locally tailored models\u201d to steadily expand overseas. Slowing growth and intense competition in China has pushed companies to seek opportunities beyond its borders.",
      "Coffee price wars",
      "From electric car makers to food delivery platforms, large-scale Chinese companies often follow a familiar strategy: burn cash, grab market share, worry about profit later. This helps them grow fast, but can infuriate global competitors.",
      "In the latest sign of increasing competition in China, Starbucks on Monday said it will lower the prices of dozens of drinks in the country by an average of $0.70 this summer.",
      "In New York, Cotti is selling drinks for 99 cents to first-time customers who download its app. Over time, analysts estimate that Luckin and Cotti will still be cheaper than Starbucks in the U.S., but the gap will be narrower than it is in China.",
      "Manhattan may share major Chinese cities\u2019 love for efficiency, but businesses there face New York wages and may need to accept additional payment options, adding to costs, said Allison Malmsten, China strategy director at Daxue Consulting. Tariffs on Chinese businesses may further erode their supply-chain advantages, she added.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a long list of things that could potentially drive the price up,\u201d Malmsten said.",
      "If Luckin\u2019s New York debut proves successful, the company could venture further afield. HeyTea \u2014 a Chinese chain known for topping its teas with foamy cream cheese \u2014 landed in New York in late 2023 and has since spread to Boston, Seattle and Los Angeles.",
      "Despite tensions between Washington and Beijing, Gen Z and younger Americans tend to perceive China differently than older generations, who may associate Chinese products with lower quality, according to Malmsten. Bargain coffee from Chinese chains could also appeal to New Yorkers facing rising costs on everything from groceries to coffee beans.",
      "Still, coffee shops that run on thinner margins need volume, analysts say. This means appealing to a wider range of customers.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s perceived as being only a touristy or exotic adventure, then it\u2019s not going to become part of your day-to-day consumption, it\u2019s not going to become part of your morning routine,\u201d Bernstein\u2019s Gargiulo said."

      "Tuesday's attack comes as the Houthis have repeatedly launched missiles and drones targeting Israel during its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The Houthis announced the attack via their al-Masirah satellite news channel. They said the attack targeted docks there, without elaborating.",
      "Late Monday, Israel issued online warnings to Yemenis to evacuate from Ras Isa, Hodeida and al-Salif ports over the Houthis' alleged use of seaports for attacks.",
      "\u201cThe port is used to transfer weapons and is a further example of the Houthi terrorist regime\u2019s cynical exploitation of civilian infrastructure in order to advance terrorist activities,\u201d the Israeli military said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Hodeida also is the main entry point for food and other humanitarian aid for millions of Yemenis since the war began when the Houthis seized Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in 2014.",
      "The Houthis have been launching persistent missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group's leadership has described as an effort to end Israel's offensive in Gaza.",
      "From November 2023 until January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.",
      "The Houthis paused attacks in a self-imposed ceasefire until the U.S. launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March. President Donald Trump paused those attacks just before his trip to the Mideast, saying the rebels had \"capitulated\" to American demands.",
      "Early Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth wrote on the social platform X that U.S. Navy ships had traveled through the Red Sea and its Bab el-Mandeb Strait \"multiple times in recent days\" without facing Houthi attacks.",

      "It\u2019s unclear how the Houthis will respond now that an attack has come from the sea, rather than the air, from the Israelis.",

    "summary": "The Indiana Pacers aren't a destination for the NBA's free agents and rarely earn high draft picks. To reach the Finals, they had to buck convention and get creative.",
    "story": [
      "OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 Before the NBA Finals came the phone calls.",
      "In the winter of 2022, Sacramento Kings guard Tyrese Haliburton got three career-changing calls within 30 minutes. The first was from his agent informing him, to his shock, that the Kings might trade him. The second conveyed information that Indiana might be the destination. The third was from the Kings\u2019 top basketball executive, confirming the trade to the Pacers.",
      "\u201cI hung up, set my phone down, and started crying my eyes out,\u201d Haliburton recalled shortly afterward.",
      "Two years later, Haliburton picked up the phone and made his own call. Toronto was open to trading Pascal Siakam, an All-Star forward who had helped the Raptors win the NBA title in 2019. Before Indiana committed to dealing for a player who could be a free agent just five months later, it needed to gauge Siakam\u2019s interest in staying long-term in Indiana and with Haliburton as his co-star.",
      "Haliburton stepped away from a dinner in Atlanta and called Siakam, whom he knew only slightly.",
      "\u201c\u2018Do you want to be here?\u2019\u201d Haliburton asked Siakam. Over the next hour, he heard enough to believe Siakam did.",
      "\u201cWe just very much aligned on wanting to win and that being the emphasis,\u201d Haliburton said.",
      "Less than a week later, the deal was done \u2014 one in a string of trades that has unconventionally built a Pacers roster that is just three wins away from the franchise\u2019s first NBA championship, in a best-of-seven series against Oklahoma City that is tied at 1-1.",
      "Unlike the league\u2019s four most recent champions, Boston, Denver, Golden State and Milwaukee, who drafted and developed their franchise cornerstones, or the 2020 Los Angeles Lakers, who signed LeBron James as a free agent and whose glamour status made them the preferred trade destination for its other star, Anthony Davis, Indiana\u2019s front office has struck gold by trading its way up.",
      "Of the 10 players Indiana has typically leaned on during this postseason, half were acquired via trades, including three of the top four scorers in Siakam, Haliburton and Aaron Nesmith. Since the Miami Heat built a superteam through free agent signings and won consecutive championships in 2012 and 2013, the only NBA champion to have relied that much on trades were the 2019 Toronto Raptors, who traded for four of their top five leading scorers.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no one right way to do it,\u201d Pacers general manager Chad Buchanan told NBC News. \u201cThis has been successful for us with this group. That\u2019s not to say that it\u2019ll continue to be successful, and there\u2019s other ways that teams have built teams to get to this point. The NBA changes, the dynamic of teams, and how you build teams is always changing.",
      "\u201cA year or two from now, it may be a totally different approach. And I think your job as a front office has got to be to understand what works for you, because what works for us may not work for another market, another team or another owner.\u201d",
      "More from NBA Finals",
      "The Pacers won\u2019t win the NBA Finals unless Tyrese Haliburton can improve in this area\u2018Throw all the punches\u2019: The blueprint that helped the Thunder even the NBA FinalsNBA Finals Game 2: Thunder dominate Pacers to even series",

      "\u2018Throw all the punches\u2019: The blueprint that helped the Thunder even the NBA Finals",
      "NBA Finals Game 2: Thunder dominate Pacers to even series",
      "Success in the NBA is a product of drafting good players, signing them as free agents and trading for them. Teams ideally try to use as many avenues as possible. Take Oklahoma City, which although it is a small-market team like Indianapolis, shrewdly netted future MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and a future pick that became All-Star Jalen Williams in a 2019 trade, bottomed out in the standings to score a high draft pick to select Chet Holmgren and last year signed coveted free agent Isaiah Hartenstein.",
      "The Pacers are unique in that circumstances have forced their fortunes to be determined heavily by just one tool.",
      "Throughout the team\u2019s history, owner David Simon has never shown an appetite to be bad enough to \u201ctank\u201d his way to a high draft pick. The Midwest city has also never been an attractive enough locale to woo elite free agents or disgruntled stars demanding trades. That leaves making trades. And each follows a process of information-gathering.",
      "The Pacers, as all NBA teams do, study players\u2019 backgrounds to understand their motivations and interests. They look at who would fit coach Rick Carlisle\u2019s style of play. Both narrow the pool of candidates. So does identifying which of that group the team likes and can actually trade for under the restrictions of the league\u2019s collective bargaining agreement. Siakam fit the criteria, an impression that Haliburton\u2019s phone call confirmed.",
      "The Pacers couldn\u2019t rely on catching Siakam\u2019s eye during a brief free-agency pitch. So instead, they traded for him to give him a monthslong preview of what life would be like as a Pacer.",
      "\u201cObviously, some of these big markets built through free agency,\u201d Buchanan said. \u201cWe can\u2019t really do that. It\u2019s not a formula for us to succeed with. We\u2019ve had the trade market.\u201d",
      "Siakam \u201cdidn\u2019t want warm weather, he didn\u2019t want the beach or nightlife, he didn\u2019t want [a] big market,\u201d Buchanan added. \u201cHe didn\u2019t care about that. Ty is the same way.",
      "\u201cOne thing we value that I think OKC kind of certainly said this, too, is we value guys that maybe have been overlooked at some point in their career. They maybe weren\u2019t McDonald\u2019s All-Americans or five-star recruits or whatever it might be, and they have this kind of edge to them. Like \u2018I want to prove people wrong.\u2019 You put a group of guys like that together, there\u2019s a common kind of fiber with them, and they all kind of feed off of that.\u201d",
      "A key reason the trade-heavy route is the path least traveled is that although a top draft pick or a star free agent can turn a franchise around immediately, trades take time. And that requires patience from the owner, Simon. In a league in which executive turnover is frequent, Kevin Pritchard has been in place as Indiana\u2019s top basketball executive since 2012. By the time Buchanan joined in 2017, Indiana was in a run in which it didn\u2019t advance out of the postseason\u2019s first round for five straight seasons through 2020, then missed the playoffs entirely the next three seasons.",
      "But last year, its second season with Haliburton and months after it acquired Siakam, the team advanced to the Eastern Conference finals, which set the stage for this season\u2019s Finals run, the franchise\u2019s first in a quarter-century.",
      "\u201cWe started 10-15 this year, and [Simon] was like, \u2018It\u2019s OK, it\u2019s OK.\u2019\u201d Buchanan said. \u201cHe\u2019s never one to get panicky, and that\u2019s helpful for the team.\u201d",
      "A Western Conference executive said Indiana\u2019s dealmaking wouldn\u2019t have been possible without a well-respected college scouting department that has identified draft picks who have developed into solid players, whom the team has then been able to flip into more assets. Trading away All-Star wing Paul George brought Domantas Sabonis, who was later used to trade for Haliburton.",
      "Yet trades have also led to more trades. Three years after Indiana traded for guard Malcolm Brogdon in 2019, he was sent to Boston in exchange for Nesmith, a little-used player for the Celtics who has come up huge for the Pacers. Nesmith\u2019s shot-making keyed Indiana\u2019s wild Game 1 comeback in the conference finals against New York, and he has made a staggering 49% of his playoff 3-pointers.",
      "In the NBA, what is widely considered the least advantageous position a team can be in is \u201cthe middle\u201d between the elite contenders competing for titles and the bottom-dwellers fighting for top picks. Indiana\u2019s ownership has never shown an interest in enduring multiple rebuilding seasons full of losses in hope of landing high draft picks, however. Guard Bennedict Mathurin, who was selected sixth overall in 2022, was only Indiana\u2019s second top 10 pick since 1989. Along with Mathurin, the three other home-grown members of the Pacers\u2019 playoff rotation were selected 11th, 26th and 31st.",
      "Never bottoming out makes roster construction more difficult, but it also comes with advantages.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of value to trying to compete, to win every year, because you\u2019re setting a foundation for what your culture is, and that\u2019s to compete and fight every game,\u201d an Eastern Conference scout said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to tank for those teams that do lose and end up with a high pick and get a great player. But there is some expense in terms of development, because players need to learn not just how to play, but how to win.\u201d",
      "And Indiana has won by doing it differently from most."

      "New Jersey voters are heading to the polls on Tuesday to pick nominees for this year\u2019s race for governor, in the first high-profile primaries for both parties since the 2024 election.",
      "New Jersey is one of two states with a gubernatorial race this year, along with Virginia. And both contests will be closely watched as early indicators of how voters are responding to President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Democratic New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy cannot run for re-election due to term limits, so there are contested races for both parties\u2019 nominations. Candidates and groups have spent $85 million on ads this year in both primaries, according to to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact, with more than $75 million spent in the Democratic primary alone.",
      "As Democrats nationally have tried to regroup following Trump\u2019s 2024 victory, where he also narrowed his margin of victory in bluer states like New Jersey, the six Democratic candidates have presented different paths forward for their party. And the race is still unsettled heading into the primary.",
      "On the Republican side, five candidates are on the ballot \u2014 but former state Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, whom Trump endorsed in mid-May, is viewed as the front-runner.",
      "Polls close at 8 p.m. ET. Here are three things to watch as voters make their choices.",
      "Which path will Democrats choose?",
      "The crowded Democratic primary remains the most unpredictable race New Jersey has seen in decades, in part because county parties can no longer give advantageous ballot positions to their preferred candidates, following a lawsuit from Democrat Andy Kim during his Senate run last year. The suit weakened the state's party machines and contributed to a wide-open contest.",
      "As Democratic voters in New Jersey have evaluated the candidates, some have prioritized electability, raising concerns that Ciattarelli will be tough to beat in November. The former state legislator lost to Murphy in 2021 by 3 percentage points. And Trump also made gains in the state last year, losing by 6, a 10-point improvement on his 2020 margin, which was the second-largest swing toward Trump in the country. Democratic voters also say they are looking for a candidate to take on Trump.",
      "Against that backdrop, each Democrat has been pitching a different path forward for their party, and Tuesday\u2019s primary will be Democratic voters\u2019 first major opportunity to weigh in on which path they should take.",
      "Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill has been viewed as the relative front-runner after leading in limited public polling, although candidates are often clustered together within the margin of error.",
      "Sherrill has leveraged the party\u2019s successful playbook from the 2018 midterm elections, when she and other Democrats flipped Republican-held House seats. She has emphasized her background as a Navy helicopter pilot and a federal prosecutor in her pitch as someone who can effectively govern and take on Trump.",
      "Sherrill has faced recent attacks for her House campaign accepting donations from a corporate PAC tied to Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, and for being late to disclose two stock trades related to her husband\u2019s work. Sherrill\u2019s House campaign donated the PAC money to charity. She also paid a fine for the late disclosure and supports a stock trading ban for members of Congress.",
      "Newark Mayor Ras Baraka has been pitching himself as the true progressive in the race who's willing to take on the president. He garnered national attention when he was arrested last month at a federal immigration detention facility. (The charges were later dropped, and Baraka is now suing New Jersey U.S. Attorney Alina Habba in response.)",
      "The attention has given Baraka\u2019s campaign a last-minute boost, with recent fundraising reports showing that his campaign raised $962,000 in the 17 days following the arrest, more than twice as much as his next closest Democratic competitor.",
      "Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop is also appealing to the party\u2019s liberal voters, describing his supporters as \u201cpragmatic progressive\u201d voters. Fulop has been running an anti-establishment campaign, criticizing the state\u2019s Democratic political machine and Murphy, whom he described at a recent campaign stop as a \u201csub-average\u201d governor.",
      "Teachers\u2019 union president Sean Spiller has said he also considers himself a progressive and has criticized those in his party who he says are backed by wealthy corporate interests. Spiller himself has been boosted by Working New Jersey, a super PAC funded by the New Jersey Education Association, which Spiller leads.",
      "Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer, one of the more moderate members of Congress, has been pitching an economic-focused message, saying he will work to bring down the state\u2019s high cost of living.",
      "And former state Senate President Steve Sweeney, who lost re-election in 2021 to an underfunded GOP challenger, has argued that he is best equipped to lead the state government given his legislative experience. Sweeney, who is also stressing his blue-collar roots as a former ironworker, could have a geographic advantage as the only candidate from South Jersey.",
      "How influential is Trump\u2019s endorsement?",
      "The GOP primary will be a key test for Trump\u2019s endorsement and determine whether the president has helped consolidate his supporters around Ciattarelli, his preferred candidate in the race.",
      "Ciattarelli sharply criticized then-candidate Trump in 2015, calling him a \u201ccharlatan\u201d and unfit to be president, and he notably did not campaign with Trump when he ran for governor in 2021. Trump knocked Ciattarelli for failing to do so in a radio appearance last year with Ciattarelli\u2019s chief competitor in the GOP primary, Bill Spadea.",
      "\u201cThis guy never came to ask for my support,\u201d Trump said then of Ciattarelli. \u201cAnd you know what, when MAGA sees that, they don\u2019t like it and they didn\u2019t vote for him. He would have won easily if he did.\u201d",
      "Spadea also asked for Trump\u2019s endorsement in the race, and the possibility that Trump would take sides in the primary loomed over the contest for months.",
      "The president ultimately endorsed Ciattarelli on May 12, writing on Truth Social that Ciattarelli is now \u201c100%\u201d MAGA and is best positioned to win in November.",
      "Ciattarelli, for his part, now says he fully supports Trump and dismissed his past comments in an April interview with NBC News, noting other Republicans (including Vice President JD Vance) have criticized Trump in the past.",
      "The primary could also shed light on the size of the anti-Trump wing of the GOP in New Jersey, with state Sen. Jon Bramnick in the race. Bramnick, a longtime state legislator who is also a standup comedian, has called for a return to civility, and he has sharply criticized Trump in the past.",
      "Two other candidates are also on the Republican primary ballot: former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac, a a self-described \u201cforever Trumper\u201d who has been endorsed by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and contractor Justin Barbera.",
      "Will the millions of dollars matter?",
      "Tuesday\u2019s primaries in New Jersey will also test outside groups' influence as they've spent millions of dollars in the pricey New York and Philadelphia media markets to reach Garden State voters.",
      "The pro-Spiller super PAC Working New Jersey, which is tied to the state\u2019s teachers\u2019 union, had spent a whopping $35 million on the race as of May 27, according to the latest campaign finance reports, while Spiller\u2019s campaign itself had spent $342,000. The group has spent $12.1 million on ads this year, according to AdImpact.",
      "That ad-spending sum was surpassed only by Affordable New Jersey, a super PAC supporting Gottheimer, which was funded largely by transfers from Gottheimer\u2019s congressional campaign. That group has spent $14.8 million on the airwaves.",
      "Fulop has also gotten a boost by a super PAC called Coalition for Progress, which has spent $8.1 million on ads this year. Sherrill\u2019s aligned super PAC, One Giant Leap PAC, has dropped nearly $5.9 million on the airwaves, largely over the last month of the race.",
      "Ciattarelli has had a financial advantage in the GOP primary, spending $6 million on ads, compared to Spadea\u2019s $1.7 million and Bramnick\u2019s $1.2 million, according to AdImpact. Both Ciattarelli and Spadea have also gotten boosts from super PACs, but both groups have spent less than $1 million on ads in the race."

    "story": [
      "Rep. Mikie Sherrill heads into Tuesday\u2019s primary as the favorite to win the Democratic nomination for governor of New Jersey. She has blanketed the pricey New York and Philadelphia metro airwaves with television ads, she enjoys the backing of much of the party\u2019s establishment, and she had opened double-digit leads in two polls that were released several weeks ago.",
      "There is uncertainty, though. Credible public polling has, overall, been limited and infrequent. And court-imposed changes to the layout of the primary ballot could dramatically dilute the power of the endorsements Sherrill has received from key county Democratic organizations.",
      "Sherrill\u2019s opponents have each made inroads. But, at least so far, that seems to have had the effect of keeping them in one another\u2019s way, preventing one from emerging as the clear alternative to Sherrill. Consider the state\u2019s political geography.",
      "You can draw a line south of Mercer and Monmouth counties, roughly where Route 195 would be on a map. Below that is South Jersey. Democratic politics here are dominated by an old-fashioned political machine that is backing the lone South Jersey candidate in the field: former state Sen. Steve Sweeney.",
      "The trouble for Sweeney is that only about 30% of all primary votes will come from tis region. And because South Jersey is part of the Philadelphia media market, he\u2019s not well-known in the rest of the state, which is served heavily by the New York market.",
      "And to the extent he is known, Sweeney\u2019s connection to the South Jersey machine is a liability. According to a May Insider NJ poll, conducted by StimSight Research, more Democratic voters said the term \u201ctypical machine politician\u201d applies to him than any other candidate. No wonder he has lagged far behind in polling.",
      "Then there\u2019s vote-rich North Jersey, where the other candidates can all claim some advantage. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka is likely to win his city \u2014 the state\u2019s largest \u2014 overwhelmingly. Newark is also the seat of Essex County, which has more registered Democrats than any other county. More than 40% of Essex\u2019s population is Black, which should further boost Baraka, the lone Black candidate in the race. Nearby Union County, which has the second-highest share of Black residents, could offer another trove of votes.",
      "Baraka has also made a wider play for the party\u2019s progressive base. He has run hard to the left, and he burnished his anti-Trump credentials when he was arrested at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility last month. Coupled with deep Black support, that could be the makings of a potent coalition in a statewide primary.",
      "But Baraka has encountered traffic in the progressive lane thanks to the presence of Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, who is also embracing left-wing themes and has framed his candidacy as a war on the Democratic establishment. Insider NJ's poll asked Democrats whether any of the candidates stood out to them as being \u201ca true progressive.\u201d Baraka and Fulop were cited more than anyone else \u2014 by far. In other words, they are each garnering support the other could badly use.",
      "Another candidate, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, has pitched his message more toward the middle, promising tax cuts and emphasizing cost-of-living issues. Gottheimer won his House seat by flipping what had been a reliably Republican district, and he has amassed an enviable campaign bankroll. He figures to perform strongly in suburban Bergen County, his political base, and he has been endorsed by Bergen\u2019s official Democratic organization.",
      "But when he entered the race, Gottheimer was counting on his perceived electability to gain the support of multiple major county organizations in North Jersey \u2014 not just his home county. Those organizations retain the feeling of old political machines, with their own formidable turnout operations and the ability to spend on their preferred candidates\u2019 behalf. Last year, Gottheimer seemed to notch a big one, when leaders from Hudson County (which includes Fulop\u2019s Jersey City) gave him their support. It was, he hoped, the first of many big dominoes to fall. But that deal crumbled apart over the winter, and the Hudson organization instead endorsed Sherrill.",
      "And Gottheimer kept missing out, too. Besides Bergen\u2019s, his only other party endorsement comes from tiny rural Warren County in the northwest corner of the state.",
      "Instead, it was Sherrill and her perceived electability that those county machines decided to go in with. Like Gottheimer, she also flipped a longtime GOP seat en route to Congress and has been a potent fundraiser. Her background as a Navy fighter pilot has also been a key selling point. Outside of Bergen\u2019s, Sherrill has won the endorsement of every major county machine in North Jersey \u2014 which as a region will produce about 70% of all votes in the primary.",
      "The near-unanimous show of establishment support has created a sense of momentum around Sherrill\u2019s campaign and sent a signal to donors and other influencers to get on board. And that's on top of the practical get-out-the-vote advantage it provides her.",
      "That having been said, there\u2019s a major ingredient missing this year: \u201cthe line.\u201d In the past, county parties would have been able to provide Sherrill with a highly preferential spot on primary ballots. But a court ruling undid that power last year. To what extent that dulls the power of the machines in primary elections is something everyone will be watching for in Tuesday\u2019s results.",
      "Still, Sherrill has managed to avoid the downsides of being associated with establishment politics. Only 20% of Democrats say the term \u201ctypical machine politician\u201d fits her \u2014 half the percentage who said the same about Sweeney in the same Insider NJ poll. That poll also found that an outright majority of Democrats said she could win the November election, far more than anyone else.",
      "Each major candidate will have pockets of deep support Tuesday. In polls and endorsements, though, Sherrill has shown the potential to perform well across the board, even in counties where she isn\u2019t the top vote-getter. If she can realize that potential Tuesday, victory will be hers.",
      "But it has to be said that we are flying blind here. If the dynamics of the race have shifted in the last few weeks, there has been almost no public polling that would catch it. And the demise of \u201cthe line\u201d has pushed the primary further into uncharted territory. The history of New Jersey Democratic primaries says Sherrill should win \u2014 but is history still worth anything in 2025?"

      "With more than 1 in 3 American households owning dogs, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, danger abounds for mail carriers.",
      "\u201c[It\u2019s] a real problem,\u201d David Coleman, a spokesperson for the Postal Service, said in an email. \u201cDogs are animals, they act instinctively and can bite for any number of reasons. All it takes is just one wrong interaction/movement for our carriers to be injured.\u201d",
      "The Postal Services releases its dog attack figures every year as part of its Dog Bite Awareness campaign. The incidents, mostly self-reported by employees, include chases, bites, assaults and deaths, like that of a 61-year-old mail carrier in Florida who died in 2022 after she was mauled by five dogs.",

      "For the 300,000-plus mail carriers in the United States, many of whom deliver to hundreds of addresses every day, the risk adds up. If a dog attack does occur, the financial and emotional impacts can be significant: In 2024, the average cost per insurance claim for a dog bite was nearly $70,000, according to the Insurance Information Institute.",
      "To help minimize the risk of attacks, the Postal Service has instituted guidelines for interacting with dogs on routes and ways to protect against harm, including carrying dog repellant and using mail satchels to create distance from dogs.",
      "Coleman had advice for dog owners: \u201cThe best way to keep safe from dog bites and attacks is to recognize and promote responsible pet ownership,\u201d he said. \u201cTeach your dog appropriate behavior and commands and don\u2019t allow a dog to roam freely.\u201d"

      "\"That would have scared the hell out of me,\" del Toro quips.",

But when you get Wes Anderson calling you and offering you any part \u2014 but in this case, a hell of a part, it\u2019s like getting a motivational pill. You\u2019re just motivated.\"",

      "\"When you work with Wes, you trust him,\" he added.",
      "\u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\" is not the only movie that del Toro and Anderson have done together. In 2021, the pair teamed up for Anderson's film \"The French Dispatch,\" where del Toro played Moses Rosenthaler, a renowned artist serving life in prison for murder.",
      "\"How do you describe being inside the world of Wes Anderson?\" Geist asked.",
      "\"I got to be in the moment. Wes wants you to be as honest as you can be, like any other director,\" he said. \"I think Wes Anderson movies, when I see them \u2014 and I\u2019ve been in two \u2014 they feel like they\u2019re 3D, like they\u2019re almost tactile media. You almost can touch it, like a pop-up book in some ways. And also the humor and the heart.\"",
      "\u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d which hit theaters on May 30, featured a star-studded cast including Michael Cera, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks, among others. It also starred Threapleton, who is the daughter of Academy Award winner Kate Winslet.",
      "Del Toro talked about how he auditioned Threapleton for the role of his nun daughter.",
      "\"She was the top contender. We were doin\u2019 the scene, and then we finished, and I locked eyes with her, and she locked eyes with me, and she didn\u2019t blink,\" he recalled. \"And then we went on. And then I remember telling Wes, you know, 'I think that\u2019s exactly what Zsa-zsa needs.'\""

    "story": [
      "A Burmese American woman was eager to bring her siblings over to the U.S. from Myanmar amid a more than 15-year wait for visas. She\u2019d been hoping to reunite with them since the 1990s, during military rule in her home country, so her brother\u2019s family could start a life in the U.S. But a day after she bought the plane tickets, President Donald Trump ordered a travel ban that included Myanmar.",
      "The woman, 51, and her husband, who were granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation, had sponsored her brother and sister-in-law to immigrate to the U.S. The siblings were then were hoping to bring their own adult kids, too, so that they wouldn\u2019t have to fulfill mandatory military service in the country\u2019s active civil war.",
      "With the travel ban in effect Monday, they said the policy has a heightened impact on people from war-torn countries like Myanmar who had hopes of finding sanctuary in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating because we were on the cusp of securing their safety to leave that situation,\u201d said her husband, 57, adding he felt like a \u201crug got pulled out from under us in an instant.\u201d",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump\u2019s policy is in the \u201cbest interest of the American people and their safety.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis commonsense, country-specific travel restrictions include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe restrictions fulfill the President\u2019s day one promise to protect American citizens from dangerous foreign actors who may come to the United States and cause us harm.\u201d",
      "The travel restrictions, announced on Wednesday, completely bar entry to the U.S. for people from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, in addition to those from Afghanistan, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Other countries, including Cuba, Laos and Venezuela, are under partial travel restrictions.",
      "According to Trump\u2019s proclamation, several of the countries on the list had declined to accept the repatriation of their nationals while others had visa overstay rates that the administration deemed \u201cunacceptable.\u201d A few countries lacked \u201cthe competence of the central authority\u201d for issuing passports, the proclamation said.",
      "Jackson also pointed out a section in the proclamation that allows for applications for refugee status.",
      "\u201cNothing in this proclamation shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the [international Convention Against Torture], consistent with the laws of the United States,\u201d the proclamation said.",
      "However, after he took office, Trump limited refugee admissions for almost all countries including Myanmar. And in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke the temporary legal status of more than 500,000 immigrants that was granted by the Biden administration. Those immigrants came from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and are now subject to deportation.",
      "Myanmar was among the nine countries in the latest proclamation that Trump also targeted during his first term. In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. issued 13,284 visas to the country, with business and tourism permits making up the most common types of visas. Myanmar recorded 1,384 overstays that fiscal year, equating to an overstay rate of almost 30%.",
      "The new travel ban comes as Myanmar\u2019s violent military regime fights to hold on to power after it seized control from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in a 2021 coup. Since then, violence has escalated across the region as the military clashes with ethnic minority rebel groups and pro-democracy militias.",
      "\u201cJunta forces have slaughtered thousands of civilians, bombed and burned villages, and displaced millions of people,\u201d Tom Andrews, United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, said in a press release earlier this year. \u201cMore than 20,000 political prisoners remain behind bars. The economy and public services have collapsed. Famine and starvation loom over large parts of the population.\u201d",
      "Under the new travel ban, anyone who obtained a visa prior to the policy is still able to come to the U.S. But there\u2019s confusion over how the restrictions will be implemented and enforced. The Burmese American woman and her husband are among those with concerns, particularly as there have been several cases of lawful permanent residents and citizens being swept up in the dragnet of Trump\u2019s immigration policies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to think that they could be randomly picked up because somebody had a bad day at the office, or somebody didn\u2019t do their job or didn\u2019t believe that their visa was true,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite frankly terrifying.\u201d",
      "For the woman, reunification with her brother has been a long time coming. She became a citizen in the late 1990s and began the process to help bring her sibling over a few years later. At the time, Myanmar had been under the control of a strict military junta that held power from the 1960s until 2011, and for decades had kept the country in a state of extreme isolation and deprivation. She said her brother, whose children were just a few years old then, hoped to come over and root his family in more stability.",
      "\u201cTheir circumstances in Myanmar at that time were very, very bad. That was the system that I grew up in. There was no future for them, no prosperity,\u201d the woman said. \u201cMy brother was concerned for his children\u2019s future and education.\u201d",
      "Amid moves and address changes, the couple said they never received the standard letter notifying them that the woman's brother had been able to progress in his visa process. They assumed the wait was a product of notorious immigration backlogs. It wasn\u2019t until the situation in Myanmar intensified again in recent years that the couple found out that the brother was close to finally being able to immigrate. But by then, the woman said, her brother\u2019s kids had aged out of the system.",
      "According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, those who turn 21 before being approved for legal permanent resident status are no longer considered a child for immigration purposes and need to file an entirely new application, prolonging the green card process.",
      "At this point, the woman said, her brother and sister-in-law said they were willing to risk possible detention to come to the U.S., particularly if it meant easier access to the American immigration system that would enable them to fight to get their children to come over as well. However, with Myanmar\u2019s military draft in effect, the family is particularly concerned for their safety now that the travel ban adds another barrier to leaving.",
      "\u201cThe reason they wanted to come here was for their kids,\u201d the woman said of her brother and sister-in-law. \u201cNow, it\u2019s really hard to bring my nephews here to save their lives.\u201d",
      "Quyen Dinh, executive director of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, said the bans are ultimately another part of \u201cthe engine of Trump\u2019s mass deportation machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s focused on demonizing immigrant families and communities by denying them family reunification, that we all rightfully deserve to be whole \u2014 especially now, when the world is more dangerous than ever,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "Rather than protecting individuals\u2019 safety, Dinh said, she believes Trump\u2019s policy punishes those who need an escape from dangerous conditions.",
      "\u201cIt perpetuates the violence that is happening across the world, as opposed to creating conditions for peace or humanitarian relief, and for these families who\u2019ve been separated,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "She also said she views the ban as evidence that the U.S. is misunderstanding its role as a humanitarian leader.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got people who are legitimately trying to escape a civil war,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cNow, because of some arbitrary decision by the Trump administration to pick a certain number of countries \u2026 without consideration of the actual cases, without an exception policy, it hurts them. They\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d"

      "The vessel departed as Israel allowed a trickle of aid into Gaza after lifting a widely-condemned blockade that had barred the entry of food, medicine and other vital supplies for more than two months.",
      "In a post on X, an account run by Israel\u2019s foreign affairs ministry said that more than 1,200 aid trucks had entered Gaza from Israel \u201cwithin the past two weeks,\u201d with just over 10 million meals distributed from aid sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the group tasked with distributing food in the enclave under a controversial new system.",
      "Gaza has a population of around 2.1 million people, so those meals over the course of two weeks would equate to roughly a third of a meal per day for each member of the population.",
      "Before the war, more than 500 trucks had been entering Gaza daily, according to the British Red Cross and other humanitarian groups.",
      "Thunberg, a climate activist, said the mission was essential amid global silence on Israel's actions in Gaza.",

      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said he had instructed the military to \u201cscreen the October 7 massacre video to the flotilla passengers upon their arrival at Ashdod Port.\u201d",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7 terror attacks, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage in a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 54,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian health ministry in Gaza."

      "Tuesday's attack comes as the Houthis have repeatedly launched missiles and drones targeting Israel during its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The Houthis announced the attack via their al-Masirah satellite news channel. They said the attack targeted docks there, without elaborating.",
      "Late Monday, Israel issued online warnings to Yemenis to evacuate from Ras Isa, Hodeida and al-Salif ports over the Houthis' alleged use of seaports for attacks.",
      "\u201cThe port is used to transfer weapons and is a further example of the Houthi terrorist regime\u2019s cynical exploitation of civilian infrastructure in order to advance terrorist activities,\u201d the Israeli military said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Hodeida also is the main entry point for food and other humanitarian aid for millions of Yemenis since the war began when the Houthis seized Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in 2014.",
      "The Houthis have been launching persistent missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group's leadership has described as an effort to end Israel's offensive in Gaza.",
      "From November 2023 until January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.",
      "The Houthis paused attacks in a self-imposed ceasefire until the U.S. launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March. President Donald Trump paused those attacks just before his trip to the Mideast, saying the rebels had \"capitulated\" to American demands.",
      "Early Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth wrote on the social platform X that U.S. Navy ships had traveled through the Red Sea and its Bab el-Mandeb Strait \"multiple times in recent days\" without facing Houthi attacks.",

    "story": [
      "Leaders of an aid organization that has sent more than 100 Haitian children with serious cardiac conditions to the U.S. for heart surgery said President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on travelers from 19 countries will stall or cancel lifesaving procedures for at least a dozen children or young adults.",
      "The ban, which goes into effect Monday, has led to widespread uncertainty for many and drawn condemnation from international leaders. The proclamation issued Tuesday offered exceptions for those who are lawful permanent U.S. residents and those traveling to the U.S. for the World Cup and the Olympics, among other examples. No such mention was made for cases of medical necessity, such as those who are seeking treatment in the U.S. through the International Cardiac Alliance.",
      "The International Cardiac Alliance\u2019s total waitlist for Haitians, ranging from infants to young adults, totals at least 316 people who need heart surgery, said Executive Director Owen Robinson. Some are placed in hospitals in the Dominican Republic and occasionally the Cayman Islands. But there are currently five open surgical slots in the U.S.",
      "\u201cSome of them might be able to wait a few months, and others, if they don\u2019t go now, they\u2019re going to pass away very quickly,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "The president\u2019s executive order adds that the secretary of state can issue exemptions for visas in cases that \u201cserve a United States national interest.\u201d It is unclear if clients of the International Cardiac Alliance with medical needs would fit into that description. Neither the White House nor the State Department responded to a request for comment on the matter.",
      "\u201cWe do have kids die every week waiting because there\u2019s not a lot of international slots for these kids,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "Some of the children in the program travel directly from their home country to the U.S., undergo surgery, and then return to Haiti. But for many Haitians, international travel requires multiple levels of logistical wrangling, Robinson said. Some patients and their parents who can secure surgeries in other countries must apply for a visa to the U.S., travel here, and then head to their eventual destination. The United States\u2019 travel ban now throws a wrench in that process.",
      "Fabienne Rene, 16, was diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in February. Because of her condition, Fabienne, who lives in Port-au-Prince, cannot even attend school since she experiences shortness of breath, said her father, Fignole Rene. The \u201cbad news\u201d he received about the travel ban causing the postponement or potential cancellation of his daughter\u2019s travel through the U.S. to the Dominican Republic is \u201creally disturbing and breaking my heart,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI was not waiting to hear something like that,\u201d Rene, 53, said in Creole through a translator. \u201cWe know for sure that there is nowhere in Haiti we can have this possibility. The only option that we have was just waiting to have an open door from the Cardiac Alliance.\u201d",
      "He also said the news will be troubling for his family to hear and that they don\u2019t know \u201cwhere they will find another open door that can give her a chance.\u201d",
      "Robinson said the U.S. Embassy in Haiti recently informed him that it most likely wouldn\u2019t be able to issue any visas due to the travel ban. In the past, the embassy has repeatedly issued visas for Haitian children to travel to the U.S. for care. The office of Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., has offered to reach out to the State Department to see if the children can receive exceptions, he added.",
      "Dr. John Clark, a pediatric cardiologist at Akron Children\u2019s Hospital in Ohio who has worked with the ICA, said many children in impoverished countries like Haiti suffer from Fabienne\u2019s condition because they are not seen by a doctor and treated for the common illness strep throat. Untreated, recurring strep infections can lead to rheumatic heart disease.",
      "St. Damien Pediatric Hospital in Port-au-Prince received visiting pediatric surgical teams from 2015 to 2019, Robinson said. Now, dangerous conditions in Haiti prevent doctors from other countries from entering or providing care. Meanwhile, Haiti does not have enough doctors practicing there, and the loss of opportunities for a medical education in Haiti only perpetuates the problem, Clark said.",
      "Clark participated in a surgical mission there in 2019, when visiting U.S. doctors were performing two heart surgeries per day, he said. A drastic rise in gang violence \u2014 including an attack on one of the hospital\u2019s ambulances and a worker being stoned to death \u2014 ended most medical missions to Haiti.",
      "Gang violence has only escalated since then, United Nations figures show, particularly after the assassination of Haiti\u2019s President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in 2021. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world, and more than half of Haitians live below the poverty line. The country is also plagued with government corruption, gang violence and food insecurity, as well as vulnerability to natural disasters, including a devastating 2010 earthquake that killed at least 220,000 people. Lack of adequate health care also fuels diseases like cholera, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\u201cI hope things can calm down one day enough that we can get back there [to Haiti],\u201d Clark said. \u201cBut right now, there\u2019s no way for us to go back down.\u201d",
      "Andrice Boncoeur of Port-au-Prince received free open-heart surgery at CEDIMAT Cardiovascular Center in the Dominican Republic to repair a valve when he was 9 years old. That procedure, however, was only meant to be a temporary solution. Now, plans for Andrice, 16, to travel through the U.S. for more permanent surgery have been disrupted.",
      "On Thursday, Andrice\u2019s father, Andre Boncoeur, said he had not yet told his son about the travel ban preventing him from passing through the U.S. Boncoeur said he knows \u201csomething can change at any time.\u201d",
      "Still, children like Andrice do not have much time to wait. In April, Andrice was once again hospitalized for three days at Haiti\u2019s Centre Hospitalier Eben-Ezer for heart failure. Boncoeur said his family has spent \u201ceverything that we had\u201d and that their funds are \u201calmost gone.\u201d He said he hopes the situation will change so that his son, who aspires to become a pastor, \u201ccan have a chance to live his life as a normal kid.\u201d",
      "Clark, Robinson and the patient\u2019s parents all agree it comes down to the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to accommodate the sick children.",
      "\u201cThese children are somebody\u2019s child and somebody\u2019s grandchild  and they don\u2019t have access to lifesaving care,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIs there any room for compassion?\u201d"

      "Earlier, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said Tehran was preparing a counter-offer to the U.S. proposal that was presented in late May. He said there was no detail about the timing of a sixth round of talks.",
      "While Trump said the next round of talks would take place Thursday, a senior Iranian official and a U.S. official said Thursday was unlikely.",

      "The U.S. official said the talks, led by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, could be Friday or Sunday, possibly in Oman or Oslo.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. proposal is not acceptable to us. It was not the result of previous rounds of negotiations. We will present our own proposal to the other side via Oman after it is finalized. This proposal is reasonable, logical, and balanced,\u201d Baghaei said.",
      "\u201cWe must ensure before the lifting of sanctions that Iran will effectively benefit economically and that its banking and trade relations with other countries will return to normal.\u201d",
      "Reuters previously reported that Tehran was drafting a negative response to the U.S. proposal. An Iranian diplomat said the U.S. offer failed to resolve differences over uranium enrichment on Iranian soil, the shipment abroad of Iran\u2018s entire stockpile of highly enriched uranium and reliable steps to lift U.S. sanctions.",

      "\u201cNew York is probably culturally the best testing ground for an international brand to expand into, especially a Chinese one,\u201d said Bernstein Senior Analyst Danilo Gargiulo, citing the city\u2019s diversity and large base of young consumers. \u201cBut it\u2019s also the most saturated, one of the most competitive markets.\u201d",
      "Chinese chains combine budget pricing with unusual flavors that often blur the line between coffee and bubble tea \u2014 jarring to purists but extremely popular at home. Luckin said its alcohol-infused latte, developed with China\u2019s leading Moutai liquor maker, sold more than 5.4 million cups on its first day in 2023, generating over $13.7 million in sales. The company launched 119 different items in 2024 alone.",
      "Luckin has built its business around technology, allowing customers in China to order and get deliveries through the country\u2019s ubiquitous WeChat app, replacing the traditional cafe experience with hyper efficiency. The company also runs large coffee-bean roasting and processing operations in China to help drive down costs.",
      "The question is whether this will work in America.",
      "Luckin and Cotti did not respond to requests for comment from CNBC. On an earnings call in April, Luckin\u2019s co-founder Guo Jinyi said the company plans to \u201cadopt flexible, locally tailored models\u201d to steadily expand overseas. Slowing growth and intense competition in China has pushed companies to seek opportunities beyond its borders.",
      "Coffee price wars",
      "From electric car makers to food delivery platforms, large-scale Chinese companies often follow a familiar strategy: burn cash, grab market share, worry about profit later. This helps them grow fast, but can infuriate global competitors.",
      "In the latest sign of increasing competition in China, Starbucks on Monday said it will lower the prices of dozens of drinks in the country by an average of $0.70 this summer.",
      "In New York, Cotti is selling drinks for 99 cents to first-time customers who download its app. Over time, analysts estimate that Luckin and Cotti will still be cheaper than Starbucks in the U.S., but the gap will be narrower than it is in China.",
      "Manhattan may share major Chinese cities\u2019 love for efficiency, but businesses there face New York wages and may need to accept additional payment options, adding to costs, said Allison Malmsten, China strategy director at Daxue Consulting. Tariffs on Chinese businesses may further erode their supply-chain advantages, she added.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a long list of things that could potentially drive the price up,\u201d Malmsten said.",
      "If Luckin\u2019s New York debut proves successful, the company could venture further afield. HeyTea \u2014 a Chinese chain known for topping its teas with foamy cream cheese \u2014 landed in New York in late 2023 and has since spread to Boston, Seattle and Los Angeles.",
      "Despite tensions between Washington and Beijing, Gen Z and younger Americans tend to perceive China differently than older generations, who may associate Chinese products with lower quality, according to Malmsten. Bargain coffee from Chinese chains could also appeal to New Yorkers facing rising costs on everything from groceries to coffee beans.",
      "Still, coffee shops that run on thinner margins need volume, analysts say. This means appealing to a wider range of customers.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s perceived as being only a touristy or exotic adventure, then it\u2019s not going to become part of your day-to-day consumption, it\u2019s not going to become part of your morning routine,\u201d Bernstein\u2019s Gargiulo said."

      "\u201cStill, entering this stage in life at a later age brought many tough moments,\u201d he added.",
      "Two other BTS members, J-Hope, 31, and Jin, 32, finished their military service last year and have been performing solo shows since. With RM and V also having wrapped up, only three BTS members remain in service: Jimin, 29, Suga, 32, and Jung Kook, 27. They are expected to be discharged later this month, according to a spokesperson for the South Korean entertainment group HYBE, which manages BTS.",
      "\u201cI worry a lot about the juniors still serving,\u201d RM said. \u201cI hope they undergo the remaining training safely and come back to society healthy so we can meet again.\u201d",

      "The oldest member of the group, Jin, enlisted in 2022, followed by J-Hope and Suga. RM, V, Jimin and Jung Kook began their service in December 2023.",
      "South Korea, which remains technically at war with nuclear-armed North Korea, allows only a few exemptions from military service, including for those who enhance the country\u2019s prestige such as classical musicians and athletes. The members of BTS were able to postpone their service until age 30 after lawmakers revised the Military Service Act in 2020.",
      "While legislation was introduced at the time BTS members began enlisting that could potentially exempt them, the group said its members would fulfill their military service requirement.",
      "\u201cNow that I\u2019m back, I will do my best as RM of BTS and return to my place in society with style,\u201d RM said.",
      "V, too, promised his return.",

      "U.S. authorities said Monday that they had arrested a Chinese researcher accused of smuggling biological material into the country, the second such case in days.",
      "The FBI said in a criminal complaint that the researcher, identified as Chengxuan Han, a Chinese doctoral student at the College of Life Science and Technology at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, was arrested Sunday at the airport in Detroit.",
      "According to the complaint, since September, Han has sent four shipments from China containing concealed biological material to staff members at a laboratory at the University of Michigan, where she planned to spend a year completing a project. Officials said Han made false statements about the shipments when federal agents questioned her about them when she arrived in the United States from Shanghai.",
      "Two Chinese nationals were charged last week after the FBI said it had been determined that one tried to smuggle a toxic fungus into the United States, also for research at the University of Michigan, it alleged. One, a researcher at the university, was arrested and remains in custody, while the other was denied entry to the United States last year and remains at large.",
      "According to the complaint, the biological material Han is accused of smuggling \u2014 sometimes hidden between pages of a book \u2014 is related to roundworms and requires a government permit.",
      "The complaint also alleges that Han deleted the contents of her electronic device three days before she arrived in Detroit.",
      "\u201cHan stated she deleted the content to \u2018start fresh\u2019 while she was in the United States,\u201d it says.",
      "Han is in custody ahead of a bond hearing Wednesday.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment outside business hours.",
      "With regard to the two Chinese nationals who were previously charged, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry said last week that he was not aware of the situation but that the Chinese government \u201chas always required Chinese citizens overseas to strictly abide by local laws and regulations, while also safeguarding their legitimate rights and interests in accordance with the law.\u201d",
      "The University of Michigan also did not immediately reply to a request for comment Monday outside business hours.",
      "In a statement in response to the case last week, the university said it was cooperating with federal law enforcement and that it strongly condemned \u201cany actions that seek to cause harm, threaten national security or undermine the university\u2019s critical public mission.\u201d",
      "Victor Galea, a professor of plant pathology at the University of Queensland in Australia, said that while the fungus, known as Fusarium graminearum, is found in every part of the world where wheat is grown, a genetic variant from a different country \u201ccan be more aggressive or virulent, and so this is why we have biosecurity regulations to prevent people from moving fungal pathogens from one part of the world to the other.\u201d",
      "Similarly, while research material such as what Han is accused of smuggling can be moved between countries, it should be done \u201cthrough all the appropriate agreements and controls,\u201d Galea said.",
      "The roundworms \u201ccould be damaging to crops or the environment, or it may be that they\u2019re benign and they don\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t determine that unless this is thoroughly investigated.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Washington\u2019s European allies must make a \u201cquantum leap\u201d in military spending to deter Russia, the head of NATO said Monday, calling for a 400% increase in the continent\u2019s air and missile defense budget.",
      "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte\u2019s comments are among the organization\u2019s strongest yet as it tries to improve Europe\u2019s insufficient defenses against Russia while also avoiding the political ire of President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cThe fact is, we need a quantum leap in our collective defense,\u201d Rutte said at the London-based think tank Chatham House. \u201cThe fact is, we must have more forces and capabilities to implement our defense plans in full. The fact is, danger will not disappear even when the war in Ukraine ends.\u201d",
      "Trump's clear signaling that he would like to at least significantly reduce decades of American military support for Europe has sent its nations scrambling to beef up their own arms industries.",
      "Trump's call for NATO allies to up their minimum defense spending from 2% to 5% of GDP was once seen as outlandish; but last month Rutte too backed this idea and said he expected it to be adopted at NATO's June 24-25 summit.",
      "On Monday he made a similarly ambitious call. He asked for a \u201c400% increase in air and missile defense\u201d and added that \u201cmilitaries also need thousands more armored vehicles and tanks, millions more artillery shells, and we must double our enabling capabilities, such as logistics, supply, transportation, and medical support.\u201d",
      "\u201cWishful thinking will not keep us safe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot dream away the danger. Hope is not a strategy. So NATO has to become a stronger, fairer and more lethal alliance.\u201d",
      "Rutte's speech comes against the backdrop of European powers vowing to spend more on their military budgets, having relied for decades upon America's protection first against the Soviet Union and now Putin's revanchist Kremlin.",
      "NATO's constituents must also maintain a balancing act when it comes to Ukraine, which is not a member. Kyiv's allies want to support a neighbor it sees as a bulwark against Russian aggression while keeping a White House increasingly sympathetic to Moscow's worldview onside.",
      "Trump has described his \u201cvery, very good relationship\u201d with Putin, a man considered a pariah by former President Joe Biden and other Western leaders.",
      "Many officials and analysts in Europe acknowledge that Trump is right to demand that wealthy nations such as Germany be able to look after themselves without Washington's help.",
      "However, many of these same commentators have expressed their horror at the tactics used by Trump, who has suggested that the United States would not protect underpaying allies and openly invited Russia to \u201cdo whatever the hell\u201d it wants to them.",
      "That risks shattering the central premise of NATO: Article 5 of its founding charter \u2014 an \u201call-for-one and one-for-all\u201d mutual defense promise suggesting that if one ally is attacked, the rest would come to its aid.",
      "The scenario the founders had in mind was that the U.S. would join the fight if Russia decided to launch an act of aggression against a smaller European country. In practice, however, the only time it has been used in the real world was the other way round, when the alliance lent Washington symbolic defensive help after 9/11.",
      "Previous American presidents have always seen this as a good trade off: America underwrites European security, and in return has a huge influence over political, diplomatic and even cultural happenings on the continent and beyond. The soft power return on investment was always seen as a profitable one.",
      "However, Trump has repeatedly questioned this logic, not only undermining the promise behind Article 5 but using hostile language against those historically considered Western brethren.",
      "The realization among European allies that Washington is no longer committed to its mutual defense has sparked a drive to push up defense budgets and revive the long-since dormant arms industry on the continent."

      "The third U.N. Ocean Conference opens Monday, with Britain's Prince William among those raising the pressure on nations to turn decades of promises into real protection for the sea.",
      "The summit comes as just 2.7% of the ocean is effectively protected from destructive extractive activities, according to the nonprofit Marine Conservation Institute. That is far below the target agreed under the \u201c30x30\u201d pledge to conserve 30% of land and sea by 2030.",
      "Atop this year\u2019s agenda is ratification of the High Seas Treaty. Adopted in 2023, the treaty would for the first time allow nations to establish marine protected areas in international waters, which cover nearly two-thirds of the ocean and are largely ungoverned.",
      "Speaking ahead of the conference, Britain's Prince William said Sunday that rising sea temperatures, plastic pollution and overfishing were putting pressure on fragile ecosystems and the people who depend on them.",
      "\u201cWhat once seemed an abundant resource is diminishing before our eyes,\u201d William, heir to the British throne, told the Blue Economy and Finance Forum in Monaco. He described the challenge as being \u201clike none we have faced before\u201d.",
      "\u201cPut simply: the ocean is under enormous threat, but it can revive itself. But, only if together, we act now,\u201d he told the meeting of investors and policymakers.",
      "Mauro Randone, regional projects manager at the World Wildlife Fund\u2019s Mediterranean Marine Initiative, said that \u201cit\u2019s the Wild West out there with countries just fishing anywhere without any sort of regulation, and that needs to change.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe high seas belong to everyone and no one practically at the same time, and countries are finally committing to establish some rules,\u201d he added.",
      "The ocean is critical in stabilizing Earth\u2019s climate and sustaining life. It generates 50% of the oxygen we breathe, absorbs around 30% of carbon dioxide emissions and captures more than 90% of the excess heat caused by those emissions. Without a healthy ocean, experts warn, climate goals will remain out of reach.",
      "The treaty will only come into force once 60 countries ratify it. As of Monday, just 32 countries had. Advocates hope UNOC can build enough momentum to cross the threshold, which would allow for the first official Oceans Conference of Parties.",
      "\u201cTwo-thirds of the ocean is areas beyond national jurisdiction \u2014 that\u2019s half our planet,\u201d said Minna Epps, director of global ocean policy at the International Union for Conservation of Nature. \u201cWe cannot possibly protect 30% of the ocean if it doesn\u2019t include the high seas.\u201d",
      "South Korea, France and the European Union have championed the treaty, but most large ocean nations have yet to ratify it, including the rest of the G20. Thousands of attendees are expected in Nice, from delegates and heads of state to scientists and industry leaders. The United States has yet to confirm a formal delegation.",
      "Beyond new commitments, the conference highlights the growing gap between marine protection declarations and real-world conservation.",
      "France, the conference co-host, claims to have surpassed the 30% target for marine protection. But environmental groups say only 3% of French waters are fully protected from harmful activities such as bottom trawling and industrial fishing.",
      "\u201cThe government declares these as protected areas, but this is a lie,\u201d said Enric Sala, founder of the National Geographic Pristine Seas marine reserve project. \u201cMost of it is political box-ticking. It\u2019s all paper parks.\u201d",
      "That criticism is echoed across the continent. A new World Wildlife Fund report found that although more than 11% of Europe\u2019s marine area is designated for protection, just 2% of E.U. waters have management plans in place.",
      "Fabien Boileau, director of marine protected areas at France\u2019s Office for Biodiversity, acknowledged the presence of bottom trawling in French protected areas, but said it was part of a phased strategy.",
      "\u201cIn France, we made the choice to designate large marine protected areas with relatively low levels of regulation at first, betting that stronger protections would be developed over time through local governance,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, we\u2019re gradually increasing the number of zones with stricter protections within those areas.\u201d",
      "Advocates say industrial fishing lobbies continue to resist stricter protections, despite evidence that well-managed reserves boost long-term fisheries through the \u201cspillover effect,\u201d whereby marine life flourishes in nearby waters.",
      "\u201cProtection is not the problem \u2014 overfishing is the problem,\u201d Sala said. \u201cThe worst enemy of the fishing industry is themselves.\u201d",
      "The conference will feature 10 panels on topics such as blue finance, sustainable fisheries and plastic pollution. Deep sea mining is expected to feature in broader discussions, while small island states are likely to use the platform to advocate for increased climate adaptation funding.",
      "The outcome of these discussions will form the basis of the Nice Ocean Action Plan, a declaration of voluntary commitments to be adopted by consensus and presented at the United Nations in New York this July.",
      "\u201cThere cannot be a healthy planet without a healthy ocean,\u201d said Peter Thomson, U.N. special envoy for the ocean. \u201cIt\u2019s urgent business for us all.\u201d"

      "A previous attempt by the Freedom Flotilla to reach Gaza failed last month after one of its ships was struck by two drones in international waters off Malta. The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the vessel\u2019s bow.",
      "The Israeli government says the blockade is an attempt to pressure Hamas to release hostages it took during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terror attacks, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 54,000 people, including thousands of children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in the enclave, which has been run by Hamas since 2007."

      "Israel says it has retrieved the body of a 35-year-old Thai hostage who was abducted into Gaza during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the war.",
      "Nattapong Pinta was among 31 Thais taken by the Hamas militant group. Thailand\u2019s foreign ministry in a statement Saturday confirmed that Pinta, the last Thai hostage in Gaza, was confirmed dead. It said the bodies of two others have yet to be retrieved.",
      "The ministry has said 46 Thais have been killed during the war. Thais were the largest group of foreigners held captive by Hamas. They were among tens of thousands of Thai workers in Israel. Here\u2019s a look at what they were doing.",
      "Why are there so many Thais in Israel?",
      "Israel once relied heavily on Palestinian workers, but it started bringing in large numbers of migrant workers after the 1987-93 Palestinian revolt, known as the first Intifada.",
      "Most came from Thailand, and Thais remain the largest group of foreign agricultural laborers in Israel today, earning considerably more than they can at home.",
      "Thailand and Israel implemented a bilateral agreement a decade ago to ease the way for workers in the agriculture sector.",
      "Israel has come under criticism for the conditions under which the Thai farm laborers work. A Human Rights Watch report in 2015 said they often were housed in makeshift and inadequate accommodation and \u201cwere paid salaries significantly below the legal minimum wage, forced to work long hours in excess of the legal maximum, subjected to unsafe working conditions and denied their right to change employers.\u201d",
      "A watchdog group found more recently that most were still paid below the legal minimum wage.",
      "How many Thai nationals work in Israel?",
      "There were about 30,000 Thai workers, primarily working on farms, in Israel prior to the attack by Hamas.",
      "In the wake of the attack, some 7,000 returned home, primarily on government evacuation flights, but higher wages than those available at home have continued to attract new arrivals.",
      "The Thai ambassador to Israel, Pannabha Chandraramya, recently said there are now more than 38,000 Thai workers in the country.",
      "What happened after some left?",
      "Faced with a labor shortage in the wake of the exodus, Israel\u2019s Agriculture Ministry announced incentives to try to attract foreign workers back to evacuated areas.",
      "Among other things, it offered to extend work visas and to pay bonuses of about $500 a month.",
      "Thailand\u2019s Labor Ministry granted 3,966 Thai workers permission to work in Israel in 2024, keeping Israel in the top four destinations for Thais working abroad last year.",
      "Thai migrant workers generally come from poorer regions of the country, especially the northeast, and even before the bonuses, the jobs in Israel paid many times what they could make at home."

      "The tattoos covering Iranian rapper Tataloo\u2019s face stand out against the gray prison uniform the 37-year-old now wears as he awaits execution, his own rise and fall tracing the chaos of the last decade of Iranian politics.",
      "Tataloo, whose full name is Amir Hossein Maghsoudloo, faces a death sentence after being convicted on charges of \u201cinsulting Islamic sanctities.\u201d It\u2019s a far cry from when he once supported a hard-line Iranian presidential candidate.",
      "Tataloo\u2019s music became popular among the Islamic Republic\u2019s youth, as it challenged Iran\u2019s theocracy at a time when opposition to the country\u2019s government was splintered and largely leaderless.",
      "The rapper\u2019s lyrics became increasingly political after the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini and the subsequent wave of nationwide protests. He also appeared in music videos which criticized the authorities.",
      "\u201cWhen you show your face in a music video, you are saying, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m here, and I don\u2019t care about your restrictions,\u2019\u201d said Ali Hamedani, a former BBC journalist who interviewed the rapper in 2005. \u201cThat was brave.\u201d",
      "The Iranian Supreme Court last month upheld his death sentence.",
      "\u201cThis ruling has now been confirmed and is ready for execution,\u201d judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir told reporters at a press conference last month.",
      "Activists have decried his looming execution and expressed concern for his safety after he reportedly tried to kill himself in prison.",
      "Tataloo began his music career in 2003 as part of an underground genre of Iranian music that combines Western styles of rap, rhythm-and-blues and rock with Farsi lyrics. His first album, released in 2011, polarized audiences, though he never played publicly in Iran, where its Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance controls all concerts.",
      "Tataloo appeared in a 2015 music video backing Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and Tehran\u2019s nuclear program, which long has been targeted by the West over fears it could allow the Islamic Republic to develop an atomic bomb. While he never discussed the motivation behind this, it appeared that the rapper had hoped to win favor with the theocracy or perhaps have a travel ban against him lifted.",
      "In the video for \u201cEnergy Hasteei,\u201d or \u201cNuclear Energy,\u201d Tataloo sings a power ballad in front of rifle-wielding guardsmen and later aboard the Iranian frigate Damavand in the Caspian Sea. The ship later sank during a storm in 2018.",
      "\u201cThis is our absolute right: To have an armed Persian Gulf,\u201d Tataloo sang.",
      "Tataloo even issued an endorsement for hard-liner Ebrahim Raisi in 2017. That year, the two sat for a televised appearance as part of Raisi\u2019s failed presidential campaign against the relative moderate Hassan Rouhani. Raisi later won the presidency in 2021, but was killed in a helicopter crash in 2024.",
      "Fame in Turkey, prison back in Iran",
      "In 2018, Tataloo \u2014 who faced legal problems in Iran \u2014 was allowed to leave the country for Turkey, where many Persian singers and performers stage lucrative concerts.",
      "Tataloo hosted live video sessions as he rose to fame on social media, where he became well-known for his tattoos covering his face and body. Among them are an Iranian flag and an image of his mother next to a key and heart.",
      "Instagram deactivated his account in 2020 after he called for underage girls to join his \u201cteam\u201d for sex. He also acknowledged taking drugs.",
      "\u201cDespite being a controversial rapper, Tataloo has quite the fanbase in Iran, known as \u2018Tatalities,\u2019\u201d said Holly Dagres, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near-East Policy. \u201cOver the years, they\u2019ve flooded social media with messages of solidarity for him and even campaigned for the rapper\u2019s release in the past when he was detained on separate charges.\u201d",
      "Tataloo\u2019s rebellious music struck a chord with disenfranchised young people in Iran as they struggled to find work, get married and start their adult lives. He also increasingly challenged Iran\u2019s theocracy in his lyrics, particularly after the death of Amini following her arrest over allegedly not wearing the hijab to the liking of authorities.",
      "His collaboration \u201cEnghelab Solh\u201d \u2014 \u201cPeace Revolution\u201d in Farsi \u2014 called out Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei by name.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want tear gas, because there are tears in everyone\u2019s eyes,\u201d he rapped.",
      "But the music stopped for Tataloo in late 2023. He was deported from Turkey after his passport had expired, and was immediately taken into custody upon arrival to Iran.",
      "Death sentence draws protests",
      "Tehran\u2019s Criminal Court initially handed Tataloo a five-year sentence for blasphemy. Iran\u2019s Supreme Court threw out the decision and sent his case to another court, which sentenced him to death in January. The rapper already faced ten years in prison for a string of separate convictions, including promoting prostitution and moral corruption.",
      "\u201cTataloo is at serious risk of execution,\u201d Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, the director of advocacy group Iran Human Rights, said in a statement. \u201cThe international community, artists and the public must act to stop his execution.\u201d",
      "Tataloo earlier expressed remorse at a trial.",
      "\u201cI have certainly made mistakes, and many of my actions were wrong,\u201d he said, according to the state-owned Jam-e Jam daily newspaper. \u201cI apologize for the mistakes I made.\u201d",
      "Tataloo married while on death row, his uncle said. Last month, Tataloo reportedly attempted to kill himself, but survived.",
      "His death sentence comes at a politically fraught moment for Iran as the country is at it\u2019s \u201cmost isolated,\u201d said Abbas Milani, an Iran expert at Stanford University.",
      "The Islamic Republic is \u201cdesperately trying to see whether it can arrive at a deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program and have the sanctions lifted,\u201d he said. Drawing the ire of Tataloo\u2019s fans is \u201cone headache they don\u2019t need,\u201d he added."
