    "story": [
      "Jury selection is set to start in Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs' sex trafficking trial in New York",
      "NEW YORK -- Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, the hip-hop entrepreneur whose wildly successful career has been dotted by allegations of violence, will be brought to a New York courthouse Monday to be tried on charges that he used the influence and resources of his business empire to sexually abuse women. Jury selection is scheduled to begin in the morning and potentially take several days. Opening statements by the lawyers and the start of testimony is expected next week.",
      "The 17-page indictment against Combs reads like a charging document filed against a Mafia leader or the head of a drug gang, accusing him of engaging in sex trafficking and presiding over a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "The indictment says that with the help of people in his entourage and employees from his network of businesses, Combs engaged in a two-decade pattern of abusive behavior against women and others.",
      "Women were manipulated into participating in drug-fueled sexual performances with male sex workers that Combs called \u201cFreak Offs,\u201d prosecutors say.",
      "To keep women in line, prosecutors say Combs used a mix of influence and violence: He offered to boost their entertainment careers if they did what he asked \u2014 or cut them off if they didn't.",
      "And when he wasn't getting what he wanted, the indictment says Combs and his associates resorted to violent acts including beatings, kidnapping and arson. Once, the indictment alleges, he even dangled someone from a balcony.",
      "Combs and his lawyers say he is innocent.",
      "Any group sex was consensual, they say. There was no effort to coerce people into things they didn't want to do, and nothing that happened amounted to a criminal racket, they said.",
      "The trial is expected to take at least eight weeks.",
      "Combs, 55, has acknowledged one episode of violence that is likely to be featured in the trial. In 2016, a security camera recorded him beating up his former girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie, in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel. Cassie filed a lawsuit in late 2023 saying Combs had subjected her to years of abuse, including beatings and rape.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, did.",
      "Combs\u2019 attorney, Marc Agnifilo has said Combs was \u201cnot a perfect person\u201d and that there had been drug use and toxic relationships, but said that all sexual activity between Combs, Cassie and other people was consensual.",
      "The trial is the latest and most serious in a long string of legal problems for Combs.",
      "In 1999 he was charged with bursting into the offices of an Interscope Records executive with his bodyguards and beating him with a champagne bottle and a chair. The executive, Steve Stoute, later asked prosecutors to go easy on Combs, who pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and took an anger management class.",
      "Later that same year, Combs was stopped by police after he and his then-girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez, fled a nightclub where three people were wounded by gunfire. Combs was acquitted of all charges related to the incident at a 2001 trial, but a rapper in his entourage, Jamal \u201cShyne\u201d Barrow, was convicted in the shooting and served nearly nine years in prison.",
      "Then in 2015, Combs was charged with assaulting someone with a weight-room kettlebell at the the University of California, Los Angeles, where one of his sons played football. Combs said he was defending himself and prosecutors dropped the case.",
      "Now, Combs faces his most serious case yet.",
      "If convicted, he faces the possibility of decades in prison.",

    "summary": "Jacques Agbobly has only been in the fashion business for five years",
    "story": [
      "Jacques Agbobly has only been in the fashion business for five years",
      "NEW YORK -- When the email came from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Jacques Agbobly at first didn\u2019t quite believe it.",
      "The Brooklyn-based fashion designer had only been in the business for five years. Now, one of the world\u2019s top museums was asking for two of his designs to be shown in \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,\u201d the exhibit launched by the starry Met Gala.",
      "\u201cI was just floored with excitement,\u201d Agbobly said in an interview. \u201cI had to check to make sure it was from an official email. And then the excitement came, and I was like \u2026 am I allowed to say anything to anyone about it?\u201d",
      "Agbobly grew up in Togo, watching seamstresses and tailors create beautiful garments in part of the family home that they rented out. Studying fashion later in New York, the aspiring designer watched the Met Gala carpet from afar and dreamed of one day somehow being part of it.",
      "\u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\u201d is the first Costume Institute exhibit to focus exclusively on Black designers, and the first in more than 20 years devoted to menswear. Unlike past shows that highlighted the work of very famous designers like Karl Lagerfeld or Charles James, this exhibit includes a number of up-and-coming designers like Agbobly.",
      "\u201cThe range is phenomenal,\u201d says guest curator Monica L. Miller, a Barnard College professor whose book, \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,\u201d is a foundation for the show.",
      "\u201cIt's super exciting to showcase the designs of these younger and emerging designers,\u201d says Miller, who took The Associated Press through the show over the weekend before its unveiling at Monday\u2019s Met Gala, \u201cand to see the way they've been thinking about Black representation across time and across geography.\u201d",
      "The exhibit covers Black style over several centuries, but the unifying theme is dandyism, and how designers have expressed that ethos through history.",
      "For Agbobly, dandyism is \u201cabout taking space. As a Black designer, as a queer person, a lot of it is rooted in people telling us who we should be or how we should act \u2026 dandyism really goes against that. It\u2019s about showing up and looking your best self and taking up space and announcing that you're here.\u201d",
      "The exhibit, which opens to the public May 10, begins with its own definition: someone who \u201cstudies above everything else to dress elegantly and fashionably.\u201d",
      "Miller has organized it into 12 conceptual sections: Ownership, presence, distinction, disguise, freedom, champion, respectability, jook, heritage, beauty, cool and cosmopolitanism.",
      "The \u201cownership\u201d section begins with two livery coats worn by enslaved people.",
      "One of them, from Maryland, looks lavish and elaborate, in purple velvet trimmed with gold metallic threading. The garments were intended to show the wealth of their owners. In other words, Miller says, the enslaved themselves were items of conspicuous consumption.",
      "The other is a livery coat of tan broadcloth, likely manufactured by Brooks Brothers and worn by an enslaved child or adolescent boy in Louisiana just before the Civil War.",
      "Elsewhere, there's a contemporary, glittering ensemble by British designer Grace Wales Bonner, made of crushed silk velvet and embroidered with crystals and the cowrie shells historically used as currency in Africa.",
      "There's also a so-called \u201cdollar bill suit\u201d by the label 3.Paradis \u2014 the jacket sporting a laminated one-dollar bill stitched to the breast pocket, meant to suggest the absence of wealth.",
      "The \u201cdisguise\u201d section includes a collection of 19th-century newspaper ads announcing rewards for catching runaway enslaved people.",
      "The ads, Miller notes, would often describe someone who was \u201cparticularly fond of dress\u201d \u2014 or note that the person had taken large wardrobes. The reason was twofold: The fancy clothes made it possible for an enslaved person to cloak their identity. But also, when they finally made it to freedom, they could sell the clothing to help fund their new lives, Miller says.",
      "\u201cSo dressing above one\u2019s station sometimes was a matter of life and death,\u201d the curator says, \u201cand also enabled people to transition from being enslaved to being liberated.\u201d",
      "The contemporary part of this section includes striking embroidered jackets by the label Off-White that purposely play with gender roles \u2014 like displaying an ostensibly \u201cmale\u201d jacket on a female mannequin.",
      "Stopping by a set of portraits from the early 19th century, as abolitionism was happening in the North, Miller explains that the subjects are Black men who were successful, well off enough to commission or sit for portraits, and dressed \u201cin the finest fashions of the day.\u201d Like William Whipper, an abolitionist and wealthy lumber merchant who also founded a literary society.",
      "They represent the beginnings of a Black middle and upper middle class in America, Miller says. But she points out a group of racist caricatures in a case right across from the portraits.",
      "\u201cAlmost as soon as they are able to do this,\u201d she says, referring to the portraits, \u201cthey are stereotyped and degraded.\u201d",
      "W.E.B. Du Bois, Miller points out, was not only a civil rights activist but also one of the best-dressed men in turn-of-the-century America. He traveled extensively overseas, which meant he needed \u201cclothing befitting his status as a representative of Black America to the world.\u201d",
      "Objects in the display include receipts for tailors in London, and suit orders from Brooks Brothers or his Harlem tailor. There is also a laundry receipt from 1933 for cleaning of shirts, collars, and handkerchiefs.",
      "Also highlighted in this section: Frederick Douglass, the abolitionist, writer, and statesman and also \u201cthe most photographed man of the 19th century.\u201d",
      "The show includes his tailcoat of brushed wool, as well as a shirt embroidered with a \u201cD\u201d monogram, a top hat, a cane and a pair of sunglasses.",
      "One of Miller\u2019s favorite items in the heritage section is Agbobly\u2019s bright-colored ensemble based on the hues of bags that West African migrants used to transport their belongings.",
      "Also displayed is Agbobly\u2019s denim suit embellished with crystals and beads. It's a tribute not only to the hairbraiding salons where the designer spent time as a child, but also the earrings his grandmother or aunts would wear when they went to church.",
      "Speaking of family, Agbobly says that he ultimately did tell them \u2014 and everyone \u2014 about his \u201cpinch-me moment.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone knows about it,\u201d the designer says. \u201cI keep screaming. If I can scream on top of a hill, I will.\u201d",

      "Buzzi died Thursday at her home in Texas, says her agent Mike Eisenstadt. She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and was in hospice care. Shortly before her death, her husband, Kent Perkins, had posted a statement on Buzzi's Facebook page, thanking her many fans and telling them: \u201cShe wants you to know she probably had more fun doing those shows than you had watching them.\u201d",

My favorite Gladys line was when she announced that the day of the office Christmas party, they sent her home early.\u201d",
      "The Gladys character used her purse as a weapon against anyone who bothered her, striking people over the head. On \u201cLaugh-In,\u201d her most frequent target was Arte Johnson\u2019s dirty old man character Tyrone F. Horneigh.",
      "\u201cGladys embodies the overlooked, the downtrodden, the taken for granted, the struggler,\u201d Buzzi told The Connecticut Post in 2018. \u201cSo when she fights back, she speaks for everyone who\u2019s been marginalized, reduced to a sex object or otherwise abused.

    "story": [
      "A slab of Brooklyn wall that the artist Banksy emblazoned with a bandaged, heart-shaped balloon is emerging after more than a decade in storage",
      "NEW YORK -- When the enigmatic street artist Banksy spray-painted a heart-shaped balloon covered with a Band-Aid on the wall of a Brooklyn warehouse, the nondescript brick building was instantly transformed into an art destination and the canvas of an unlikely graffiti battle.",
      "Almost as soon as Banksy revealed the piece back in 2013, an anonymous tagger brazenly walked up and spray painted the words \u201cOmar NYC\u201d in red beside the balloon, to the dismay of onlookers.",
      "Days later, someone stenciled \u201cis a little girl\u201d in white and pink beside Omar\u2019s tag, followed by a seemingly sarcastic phrase in black: \u201cI remember MY first tag.\u201d Some think it was Banksy himself who secretly returned to the scene to add the rejoinder.",
      "The apparent graffiti battle didn\u2019t end there. Another tagger also attempted to leave his mark but was stymied by security guards. Today the phrase \u201cSHAN\u201d is still visible in light purple paint.",
      "Maria Georgiadis, whose family owned the now-demolished warehouse and ultimately removed the section of wall to preserve the artwork, says the graffiti pastiche is quintessentially New York.",
      "\u201cIt looks like a war going on,\u201d she said recently. \u201cThey\u2019re literally going at it on the wall.\u201d",
      "The preserved wall, dubbed \u201cBattle to Survive a Broken Heart,\u201d will be going up for sale May 21 at Guernsey\u2019s, the New York auction house.",
      "Georgiadis, a Brooklyn schoolteacher, says the sale is bittersweet. Her father, Vassilios Georgiadis, ran his roofing and asbestos abatement company from the warehouse adorned with the balloon.",
      "He died four years ago at age 67 from a heart attack, which is why some of the proceeds from the sale will be donated to the American Heart Association.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just very significant to us because he loved it and he was just so full of love,\u201d Maria Georgiadis said on a recent visit to the art warehouse where the piece was stored for more than a decade. \u201cIt\u2019s like the bandage heart. We all have love, but we\u2019ve all went through things and we just put a little Band-Aid over and just keep on moving, right? That\u2019s how I take it.\u201d",
      "The nearly 4-ton, 6-foot-tall (3.6-metric ton, 1.8-meter-tall) wall section is one of a number of guerrilla works the famously secretive British artist made during a New York residency in 2013.",
      "At the time, Banksy heralded the work by posting on his website photos and an audio track recorded partly in a squeaky, helium-induced voice.",
      "Guernsey auction house President Arlan Ettinger said it is impossible to know for certain because Banksy works clandestinely. But he said the neat stenciling and wording \u201cstrongly suggest that this was a gentle way for Banksy to put the other artist in his place.\u201d",
      "Ulrich Blanch\u00e9, an art history lecturer at Heidelberg University in Germany, called the piece a \u201cvery well executed\u201d stencil notable partly because of Banksy's decision to place it in Brooklyn\u2019s port area of Red Hook.",
      "\u201cThis part of NYC was not easy to reach at that time,\u201d he said by email. \u201cBanksy wanted people to go to places in NYC they never have seen and love them as well.\u201d",
      "But Blanche questioned whether the additional stenciled text was truly the work of Banksy, saying the word choice and design don\u2019t appear to comport with the artist\u2019s style at the time.",
      "\u201cTo call a graffiti guy a \u2018girl\u2019 is not something Banksy would do in 2013. This is misogynic and immature in a sexist way,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThree different fonts that do not match and three colors \u2014 why should he do that? Too unnecessarily elaborated without reasons. So I think this was added by someone else.\u201d",
      "Blanch\u00e9 also said he is ambivalent about the pending sale, noting Banksy usually doesn't authorize his street pieces for sale. At the same time, he understands the burden placed on property owners to protect and maintain them.",
      "\u201cBanksy\u2019s works should be preserved, but for the community they were made for,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should not be turned into goods. They are made and thought for a specific location. Not portable. Not sellable.\u201d",
      "Spokespersons for Banksy didn't respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Maria Georgiadis\u2019 brother, Anastasios, said his father had also hoped to keep the piece in Red Hook after having cut it out of the wall and framed in thick steel for safekeeping.",
      "The elder Georgiadis, he said, envisioned the work as the centerpiece of a retail and housing development on the property, a dream he didn't realize. The property has since been sold off by the family.",
      "Ettinger said it is difficult to say what the piece might fetch. There is little precedent for a sale of a Banksy piece of this size, he said.",
      "In 2018, a canvas that was part of Banksy's \u201cGirl With Balloon\u201d series sold in London for 1.04 million pounds ($1.4 million), only to famously self-destruct in front of a stunned auction crowd.",
      "Maria Georgiadis said she hopes whoever buys the \u201dBroken Heart\u201d finds the same beauty and meaning her father drew from the piece.",
      "When Banksy painted it, the family business had been recovering from destructive floods caused by Hurricane Sandy the prior year. Georgiadis recalls her father had no idea who Banksy was but was moved by the simple image.",
      "\u201cMy dad had it in his head that Banksy knew what we went through,\u201d she said. \u201cHe goes, \u2018Can you believe it Maria? It\u2019s a heart.\u2019\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aiming to slash public subsidies to PBS and NPR as he alleged \u201cbias\u201d in the broadcasters\u2019 reporting",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aiming to slash public subsidies to PBS and NPR as he alleged \u201cbias\u201d in the broadcasters\u2019 reporting.",
      "The order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal agencies \u201cto cease Federal funding for NPR and PBS\" and further requires that that they work to root out indirect sources of public financing for the news organizations. The White House, in a social media posting announcing the signing, said the outlets \u201creceive millions from taxpayers to spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\u201d",
      "It's the latest move by Trump and his administration to utilize federal powers to control or hamstring institutions whose actions or viewpoints he disagrees with. Since taking office, Trump has ousted leaders, placed staff on administrative leave and cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to artists, libraries, museums, theaters and others, through takeovers of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Trump has also pushed to withhold federal research and education funds from universities and punish law firms unless they agreed to eliminate diversity programs and other measures Trump has found objectionable.",
      "The broadcasters get roughly half a billion dollars in public money through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and have been preparing for the possibility of stiff cuts since Trump's election, as Republicans have long complained about them.",
      "Paula Kerger, PBS\u2019 CEO and president, said in a statement last month that the Trump administration\u2019s effort to rescind funding for public media would \u201cdisrupt the essential service PBS and local member stations provide to the American people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more American than PBS, and our work is only possible because of the bipartisan support we have always received from Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cThis public-private partnership allows us to help prepare millions of children for success in school and in life and also supports enriching and inspiring programs of the highest quality.\u201d",
      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting sued Trump earlier this week over his move to fire three members of its five-person board, contending that the president was exceeding his authority and that the move would deprive the board of a quorum needed to conduct business.",
      "Just two weeks ago, the White House said it would be asking Congress to rescind funding for the CPB as part of a $9.1 billion package of cuts. That package, however, which budget director Russell Vought said would likely be the first of several, has not yet been sent to Capitol Hill.",
      "The move against PBS and NPR comes as his administration has been working to dismantle the U.S. Agency for Global Media, including Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which were designed to model independent news gathering globally in societies that restrict the press. Those efforts have faced pushback from federal courts, who have ruled in some cases that the Trump administration may have overstepped its authority in holding back funds appropriated to the outlets by Congress.",

      "John Hauldren has been a Chicago Cubs fan all his life",
      "CHICAGO -- John Hauldren has been a Chicago Cubs fan all his life. During the team\u2019s last homestand, he got a text message from a high school friend. It was the first text he had received from him.",
      "Cubs center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong had just used \u201cFront to Back\u201d \u2014 a song from Hauldren's electronic music group, Levity \u2014 as his walkup music in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "\u201cI was like \u2018What? Like, no way,'\" Hauldren recalled. \u201cI, like, had to do my research for myself.\u201d",
      "Sure enough, it was true. Hauldren confirmed the authenticity of the moment through a tangential connection to the emerging star.",
      "Crow-Armstrong's girlfriend has a cousin who is friends with the girlfriend of PJ Carberry, another member of Levity.",
      "\u201cMy girlfriend, her cousin and her sister actually all just went to go watch them in Arizona,\u201d Crow-Armstrong said. \u201cI had already been talking about making one of their songs my walkout, so I just decided to do it.\u201d",
      "Crow-Armstrong, a 23-year-old Southern California native, also uses Larry June's \u201cStill Boomin\u201d for his walkup song. He said he isn't a big fan of dubstep \u2014 the subset of electronic dance music where Levity lands most of the time \u2014 but he likes Levity's stuff.",
      "Music is a prominent part of Crow-Armstrong's daily routine, and he enjoys the process of picking a walkup song.",
      "\u201cMusic\u2019s the best thing ever. I mean, literally, universally, it is the best thing ever,\u201d he said.",
      "Hauldren, 26, has a similar opinion when it comes to Crow-Armstrong\u2019s baseball team. Hauldren is the youngest of four siblings in a White Sox family from suburban Chicago. He grew up going to White Sox games on the South Side.",
      "But he was always a Cubs fan.",
      "\u201cIt just kind of stuck, and a lot of my friends were Cubs fans, too,\u201d he said. \u201cSo thankfully my dad would suck up his pride or whatever you would call it and take me to a Cubs game every once in a while.\u201d",
      "The beginning of Levity goes back to Hauldren and Carberry connecting at the University of Iowa in 2017. They met Josh Tarum through mutual friends, and they started making music together.",
      "Hauldren and Carberry live in Chicago, and Hauldren worked on much of \u201cFront to Back\u201d at their place in Bucktown \u2014 not far from Wrigley Field.",
      "\u201cMy window is the skyline of Chicago and stuff,\u201d Hauldren said. \u201cAnd so seeing that song get played at Wrigley Field when it was made watching the skyline of Chicago and being very close to Wrigley Field was just insane to me.\u201d",
      "After Crow-Armstrong used the song as his walkup music, Hauldren posted on Instagram about how much it meant to him. He tagged Crow-Armstrong in the post, and the two talked. They are hoping to meet up at some point.",
      "Levity played Coachella this year, and it is going to Lollapalooza this summer in Chicago's Grant Park. But Hauldren said his connection with Crow-Armstrong ranks right up there when it comes to his most memorable experiences with his group.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just very happy that if someone ever plays a walkout song for us, that it was the Cubs,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I couldn\u2019t be happier that, you know, of all the teams that it was my team.\u201d",

      "This time, Italian American comedians Ray Romano and Sebastian Maniscalco will make their debut during a comical promotion, the network said on Wednesday. The commercial will air during NBC\u2019s Kentucky Derby coverage on Saturday.",
      "In the spot, Romano and Maniscalco stand atop the Italian Alps with snowboards in hand, attempting to discuss thrilling winter sports like skiing, snowboarding and luge. But their discussion is repeatedly sidetracked by their shared obsession with Italian food.",
      "\u201cRay and I teamed up for the Olympics, two Italian guys trying to figure out winter sports,\u201d Maniscalco said in a statement. \u201cLet\u2019s just say, we thought \u2018luge\u2019 was a type of pasta.\u201d",

      "Black style will have its moment as the biggest night in fashion gets underway",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Fashion icons like Dapper Dan, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and the late Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley are known for their distinctive approaches to sartorial style \u2014 bold splashes of color, luxurious fabrics, playful construction, capes \u2014 but fashion savants and historians agree that a common thread weaves their tailored looks together: dandyism.",
      "The history-laden style movement will be front and center as part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute spring exhibit, \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,\u201d kicking off with the biggest night in fashion, Monday's Met Gala.",
      "Inspired by Monica Miller\u2019s book \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,\u201d the exhibit focuses on Black style and specifically menswear from the 18th century to present day, with dandyism as a unifying theme.",
      "Once used to describe the aristocratic style and leisurely pursuits of figures like Regency England's Beau Brummell, dandyism has been recontextualized over the years to embody liberation and resistance through exuberant self-expression.",
      "This evolution of the term began with the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Miller, guest curator of the Met exhibit, writes how, in the 18th century, young, dandified Black servants in England were forced to wear gold, brass or silver collars with padlocks and fine livery \u2014 uniforms for slaves and servants \u2014 that signaled their owners' wealth.",
      "\u201cThey wanted the enslaved person to stand out almost as if they were a luxury item,\u201d said Jonathan Square, Parsons School of Design assistant professor and one of the advisers on the Met exhibit.",
      "Slaves arrived in America with few or no belongings. What they had left, they treasured, be it beads or small precious objects, Miller writes.",
      "\u201cThis is as true for those who were deliberately dressed in silks and turbans, whose challenge was to inhabit the clothing in their own way, as for those who were more humbly attired, who used clothing as a process of remembrance and mode of distinction (and symbolic and sometimes actual escape from bondage) in their new environment,\u201d Miller explains in her book.",
      "Stripped of their identities, enslaved people often added their own flair to their tailored Sunday best looks for church or on holidays.",
      "Post-Emancipation, Black Americans had the chance to reclaim their autonomy and carve out new lives for themselves, paving the way for the Harlem Renaissance.",
      "Black Americans fled the South for cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and New York in a period dubbed the Great Migration. From the 1920s to the 1930s, New York's Harlem neighborhood became an influential and fertile landscape for Black cultural expression. From Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston to Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong, its prominent minds reshaped the fabric of American culture and challenged prejudiced beliefs.",
      "The Harlem Renaissance gave fashion a soul, said Brandice Daniel, founder of Harlem's Fashion Row, an agency that connects designers of color with retailers and brand opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt was this birthplace of this visual identity that spoke to what we now call Black excellence,\u201d she said.",
      "The renaissance meant living and dressing boldly for Black Americans, pushing past societal confines and making themselves visible. Adding their own twist on mainstream looks, women donned furs and beaded dresses while men experimented with tailored fabrics, pristine fedora hats, two-toned oxfords and billowing silhouettes.",
      "\u201cMany of us have a photo of our grandfather decked out with the suiting, but it\u2019s also the stance and the kind of posture and the assertion of presence,\u201d said Tara Donaldson, co-author of \u201cBlack In Fashion: 100 Years Of Style, Influence, and Culture.\u201d",
      "W.E.B. Du Bois, a pivotal figure of the era who often appeared in a three-piece suit, a frock coat and top hat, understood the power of self-fashioning, said Valerie Steele, director of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. At the 1900 Paris Exposition, Du Bois mounted a photographic exhibit centered on showcasing Black Americans\u2019 economic, social and cultural contributions to combat stereotypes.",
      "\u201cThat kind of self-fashioning is very much a way of reclaiming a sense of self-respect that had been denied by a society that aggressively was saying, \u2018No, no you can\u2019t have that,\u2019\u201d Steele said.",
      "One style that arose out of the Harlem Renaissance, directly linked to dandyism, was the zoot suit. The suit, defined by high-waisted draped pants and oversized jackets with exaggerated shoulders and large lapels, was subversive simply by taking up space. Because of fabric rations during World War II, owning a zoot suit, with its excessive use of fabric, was an act of protest, Square said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s meant to be a provocation,\u201d Square said. \u201cBut also, it\u2019s a form of protection, covering a part of your body, sort of saying, \u2018You don\u2019t have access to this.\u2019\u201d",
      "The style was quickly adopted by Mexican American and Filipino American men in Los Angeles. In 1943, servicemen and police officers attacked Black, Mexican and Filipino men in what was labeled the Zoot Suit Riots. The zoot suit lives on today in the gender-fluid designs of Willy Chavarria.",
      "Dandyism was not limited to men. Following World War I, women began breaking down fashion's gender norms. With her tuxedo and top hat, blues singer and entertainer Gladys Bentley epitomized how women in the Harlem Renaissance blurred gender lines and adopted more masculine styles of dress.",
      "Singer and actor Mon\u00e1e, who sits on this year\u2019s Met Gala\u2019s host committee, is not shy about standing out on a red carpet in her tailored, playful looks. Mon\u00e1e's distinct style and flourishes with oversized hats, whimsically tailored suits and ornate bow ties personify the dandy style.",
      "As Mon\u00e1e and the rest of the starry guest list arrive in their glamorous \u201cTailored for You\u201d looks, Monday will be a night to remember all the dandies who styled out before.",
      "\u201cBlack people, Black men are finally getting their flowers for being true style icons,\u201d said designer Ev Bravado, co-founder of Who Decides War. \u201cIt is amazing to see the ancestral work being put on display.\u201d",

      "In a career that has spanned Shakespeare and \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d T",
      "NEW YORK -- One of the toughest things about appearing on Broadway might not be the acting or the hours. It's squeezing your resume to under 100 words for your bio in Playbill. T.R. Knight tried to include all of it, initially.",
      "\u201cI was getting angry at myself for getting precious about what to include and what not to include,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, 'You are being ridiculous.'\u201d",
      "So instead of trying to fit in a career that has spanned Shakespeare and \u201cGrey's Anatomy,\u201d a David Mamet play and \u201c The Flight Attendant, \u201d Knight changed direction.",
      "\u201cThere once was an actor named Knight,\u201d his Playbill blurb now reads. \u201cWho knew his stage-left from stage-right/He went to do some TV/But now he's happy to be/Back in front of the glowing footlights.\u201d",
      "What has lured him back on Broadway is the jaw-dropping prequel to the Netflix hit show \u201cStranger Things,\u201d a play with levitating cats, shattered mirrors and Vegas showgirls.",
      "Set in Hawkins, Indiana, 20 years before the events of the first season, \u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow\u201d focuses on the creation of a monster, the villainous Vecna, played by \u2014 Louis McCartney. Knight portrays his father.",
      "We are introduced to a shy, awkward teen Henry Creel \u2014 who later will be Vecna \u2014 as he moves to Hawkins and goes to high school. He has strange powers and worries a lot.",
      "His father is not in a great place, suffering from PTSD and drinking too much. \u201cI think he desperately wants to be a good husband and a good father, and I think he knows that he is failing at both,\u201d says Knight. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the tools to stop it.\u201d",
      "Knight was a \u201cStranger Things\u201d fan even before he joined the play, looking forward to every season. He was asked to audition for a different character but was drawn to the father after reading the script.",
      "\u201cAlthough our damage is different, I felt that I understood that damage in a way that I did not understand this other character,\u201d he says. \u201cI just felt it strong enough in my gut that it felt like it could be a better match.\u201d",
      "\u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow\u201d co-director Justin Martin says Knight is constantly changing his approach and always surprising, calling him a \u201cRenaissance man in terms of his acting\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always about the work. He\u2019s very much interested in very, very different characters and different styles of acting. And so he constantly is pushing himself. Every time he does the scene it\u2019s slightly different,\u201d says Martin. \u201cHe\u2019s going, \u2018What else can I find? What else could I mine?\u2019 which I love in an actor.\u201d",
      "The \u201cStranger Things\u201d play was also attractive to Knight because of its director: Stephen Daldry, the three-time Tony Award-winner who helmed \u201cBilly Elliot: The Musical.\u201d",
      "Knight recalls being blown away by the way Daldry told the story without sentimentality of an 11-year-old boy who just wants to dance.",
      "\u201cThe way he was able to distill that down in such a brutally beautiful, honest way left me \u2014 when I left that theater \u2014 I remember being both empty and filled up at the same time if that\u2019s possible.\u201d",
      "Knight and his husband have moved back to the New York area after years in Los Angeles, wanting to do more theater, something he calls \u201chome.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still so challenging, still immensely challenging, maddeningly challenging to me \u2014 theater \u2014 but I love it,\u201d he says. \u201cI just missed it.\u201d",
      "Knight grew up in Minneapolis and spent two years at the city\u2019s storied Guthrie Theater before moving to New York at 25. He became a household name in the hit ABC medical drama \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d which he left after five seasons.",
      "He feels like a new chapter is opening, one with confidence and maturity. The move coincides with a change in his creative work and life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time and maybe it\u2019s a time where I can let go of a lot of the nonsense that I have maybe worried about \u2014 maybe? Do you like the way I said, maybe worried about in the past? The nonsense has kind of plagued me.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In 2019, David Corenswet gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly where he said his \u201cpie in the sky ambition\u201d was to play Superman",
      "In true Clark Kent form, the new Superman would like to correct the record.",
      "David Corenswet gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly in 2019 where he said his \u201cpie in the sky ambition\u201d was to play Superman.",
      "At that point, the role was not on the market. And Corenswet, a Julliard graduate and Philadelphia native, was just making a name for himself in the industry, with plum breakout roles in two Ryan Murphy Netflix series: \u201cThe Politician\u201d and \u201cHollywood.\u201d Tall, dark, and you know, handsome, people had told him that he looked like Superman for a long time. He did not, he told The Associated Press in a recent interview, think that he was going to get the chance to play him.",
      "But a few years later he was actually cast to lead James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d which will begin a new, hopefully high-flying, era for the DC universe of films when it hits theaters on July 11. And that once innocent quote took on a life of its own. Many headlines and stories misinterpreted the phrase and wrote that he said it was his dream role, as though he'd manifested it into existence.",
      "\u201cI said it was my pie in the sky ambition, which I meant to mean that there was no (expletive) way it was ever going to happen,\u201d Corenswet, 31, said. \u201cI sort of was thinking of it as, \u2018Oh, who wouldn\u2019t love to get to play an iconic role like that? Wouldn\u2019t it be amazing and impossible if we lived in a universe where that could even be considered?\u2019\u201d",
      "Right around the time when Gunn was starting to think about casting his new Superman movie, he decided to watch his friend Ti West\u2019s movie \u201cPearl.\u201d In that darkly comedic horror, Corenswet stood out to him as an interesting and charismatic presence. He played a projectionist at a local movie theater who catches Pearl\u2019s attention (and, later, faces her wrath). West had nice things to say about him too.",
      "\u201cDavid was one of the very first auditions that I got,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cInstantly, it was a relief because he had a playful charm about him that was not evident in \u2018Pearl.' He had a sense of humor. That made me go, \u2018Ooh, this might be a really good match.\u2019\u201d",
      "That was just the beginning of the long casting process. Even Nicholas Hoult, who was ultimately cast as Lex Luthor, was up for the part. And though it was \u201cextensive,\u201d Corenswet said it was one of the most \u201csatisfying audition processes\u201d he\u2019s ever gone through \u2014 not because he booked the role, but because he felt he got the opportunity to show them what he had to offer.",
      "Gunn laughed that Corenswet actually has a lot of Superman in him.",
      "\u201cSuperman is a square and David is a square,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cHe listens to American Songbook. Like Dean Martin and Cole Porter. That\u2019s what he listens to on his iPad. That\u2019s weird. But oh, so Superman.\u201d",
      "When Gunn called him with the good news, the first person he told was his wife. The second was his sister, who couldn\u2019t pick up the phone because she was on a golf course.",
      "\u201cShe texted, \u2018Is it possible that was a phone call with super good news?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018Yes. Super good news.\u2019\u201d",
      "It may be something of a Superman tradition to try on your predecessor\u2019s costume during a screen test. Henry Cavill did it with Christopher Reeve\u2019s, and Corenswet did it with Cavill\u2019s, which he called a \u201cmarvel of engineering.\u201d",
      "But the first time Corenswet put on his own Superman costume was not some magical, transportive moment. In fact, he said, it was \u201cwonderfully mundane.\u201d The suit was still in its beginning stages, not totally put together and even a little small, as he\u2019d already started putting on weight for the role.",
      "\u201cI remember the feeling of kind of growing into the suit and the suit growing around me fitting by fitting,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cWe had such an amazing costume team and they built the suit around me over the course of many weeks and months and it started to feel just a little bit like home for me.\u201d",
      "The first time he felt the impact of it was through the eyes of other people. To him, it was old hat, but when he walked onto set the first time in the suit he noticed something different from the cast and crew.",
      "\u201cI saw their faces sort of light up and I went, \u2018Wait a minute, these people aren\u2019t that fond of me,\u2019\u201d he laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s when it hits you.\u201d",
      "There are almost three roles involved in playing Superman. There\u2019s the person he is with his parents and the people he grew up with. There\u2019s Clark Kent of the Daily Planet. And then there\u2019s Superman.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a public facing character, he\u2019s a symbol,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cThere\u2019s a presentational element to it, because he does want to present an image of calm and authority. While he doesn\u2019t always feel that way, he always wants to make other people feel that way as Superman.\u201d",
      "To prepare for Clark Kent, Corenswet looked at the All-Star Superman comic and how Christopher Reeve changed his posture when Lois left the room, but he also drew inspiration for the voice and demeanor way outside of the canon: His brother-in-law, who is 6\u20198\u201d and 270 pounds, but is the \u201cquietest, most wonderful man.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s where I sort of took the spirit of Clark,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cHe\u2019s this big presence, but he\u2019s desperately trying to be as small as possible and as quiet as possible.\u201d",
      "Gunn has promised that the film is \u201ca personal journey for Superman that\u2019s entirely new.\u201d He\u2019s a character who is \u201cpretty damn good, but flawed.\u201d And anyone who has seen the trailer knows there will be romance with Rachel Brosnahan\u2019s Lois Lane \u2014 but there\u2019s even a different spin on that.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s in love with her,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cShe\u2019s the one that needs the convincing in the relationship. It\u2019s not him. You really see where he needs her in his life.\u201d",
      "Corenswet said that in addition to the action and thrills, the movie also has a Preston Sturges quality to it with \u201clonging romance and witty comedy.\u201d Fitting for their reporter characters, \u201cHis Girl Friday\u201d was also a big reference with \u201cthe rhythm, the patter and the feeling of two people in love who really are an equal match for the other.\u201d",
      "The movie is the start of a new era for DC films, and will raise Corenswet\u2019s profile immeasurably. He\u2019s been in big movies before, including \u201cTwisters.\u201d But being Superman is different.",
      "\u201cThe thing that it changed about my life immediately was that I had this amazing mission that I got to go on of playing the part and getting to be a piece of making this awesome film,\u201d he said. \"I have so many new friends now. James brings together such a familial cast and crew. And shooting the film is sort of like an extended summer camp.\u201d",
      "Adding to the summer camp vibes: On the last day they even gathered to watch a little blooper reel that Gunn had put together. But what will happen come release is not really something he can fathom at this point.",
      "\u201cI expect some things will change when the film comes out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know, one still has to wake up and eat breakfast.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Think \u201cThe Bear,\u201d translated to Napoleonic-era France",
      "He\u2019s a dream in the kitchen \u2014 and elsewhere in the house. He makes a mean cream-puff tower. And he\u2019s got moves like Jagger.",
      "Alas, Antonin Car\u00eame has been dead since the 1830s, but nobody\u2019s perfect, right?",
      "Most people have heard of Napoleon, but not many are familiar \u2014 even in France \u2014 with the story of this chef who cooked for him and his contemporaries, rising from a poor kitchen boy to become a standard-bearer of French cuisine. Now a new Apple TV+ period drama, \u201cCar\u00eame,\u201d argues that he was the very first celebrity chef. There's even a \u201cTop Chef\u201d style cooking contest in front of a panel of judges.",
      "But for the vibe, think \u201cThe Bear,\u201d set in post-revolutionary Paris. Car\u00eame even directs his staff at one point to say \u201cOui, chef.\u201d (And we could totally imagine him, like Jeremy Allen White, in a Calvin Klein underwear ad, if those had existed back then.)",
      "The series, which drops its first two episodes Wednesday, also shows how Car\u00eame wasn\u2019t just a cook, or master pastry maker, or, well, sex god. We watch as he's pulled into political intrigue by his boss, the cunning diplomat Talleyrand, and used as a spy.",
      "Still, his goal was to be the best chef in the world. The show\u2019s first season ends with an extraordinary outdoor coronation banquet that Car\u00eame creates for thousands of people. When he places, in triumph, a tall white chef\u2019s hat on his head for the first time, it's as if he's crowning himself \u2014 and marking his ascent to celebrity.",
      "Benjamin Voisin, who's in virtually every scene, plays Car\u00eame with a scruffy head of hair, a gold earring and a bad-boy swagger that's consciously based on Mick Jagger, circa \u201970s.",
      "Director Martin Bourboulon says the choice for the role was obvious once Voisin walked into the audition room.",
      "\u201cWhen you find the right actor for the right part, 80% of the job is done,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were very impressed with his youthful attitude but also his rock \u2018n\u2019 roll attitude. He is absolutely Car\u00eame in real life \u2014 very attractive for everyone, a young man who is maybe sometimes a bit insouciant, or careless. \u201c",
      "Perhaps not surprisingly, the show plays up the sex factor. The first scene sets the tone with Car\u00eame and his lover, Henriette, in a food-tasting session that morphs immediately into sex, but then duty calls: Napoleon\u2019s soldiers are coming for dinner.",
      "Bourboulon says that first scene was very intentional, establishing in a few minutes the three main themes of the series: food, sex and politics. Did we mention sex?",
      "Of course, he wasn\u2019t an accomplished chef, so Voisin was given intensive lessons.",
      "\u201cI spent two months in the kitchen to learn the customs of the great French tradition,\u201d the actor says. He focused on learning how to realistically convey what Car\u00eame did best: invent dishes of wild whimsy, especially flamboyant dessert creations like a huge pyramid, or the \u201ccroquembouche\u201d tower \u2014 a cascade of cream puffs. Car\u00eame is also known for inventing the vol-au-vent, an airy French pastry shell.",
      "But even so, this master pastry maker can't even chop an onion correctly when he arrives for work at his first big kitchen job. The job of teaching him falls to the talented sous-chef in Talleyrand's kitchen, Agathe (Alice Da Luz).",
      "Da Luz trained alongside Voisin on the kitchen brigade at the Ferrandi culinary school in Paris \u2014 and vastly improved her skill set. \u201cWe really learned the choreography of a kitchen, we really learned technique,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd today I can boast that I cut onions at a crazy speed.\u201d",
      "The actors had a dream workspace: The production spent six weeks building a huge, airy kitchen where they work for Talleyrand \u2014 unlike the cramped, smoky kitchens that would be more historically accurate.",
      "Viewers may feel the need to brush up on their history. The show takes place shortly after Napoleon seized political power in 1799 and became first consul, on his way to later declaring himself emperor.",
      "The actors had to brush up, too.",
      "Voisin says he knew about \u201cthe victories and defeats of Bonaparte,\u201d but had to learn from scratch the story of Car\u00eame.",
      "Lyna Khoudri, who plays mysterious Henriette \u2014 who may or may not be on her lover\u2019s side \u2014 notes: \u201cWe\u2019re making a series about the heritage of French culinary art, a story I didn\u2019t know. I found out why we\u2019re so famous for our cuisine in France.\u201d",
      "Da Luz had studied the period at school but dove into it more deeply once she was cast. There was not a lot to read about Agathe, but she read everything she could find. And then, she says, \u201cI let my imagination go,\u201d inspired to bring a woman out of the shadows of history.",
      "J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier, who plays Talleyrand (actual name Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord), also engaged in extensive research. \u201cIt\u2019s a character who has led a thousand lives,\u201d he said, \u201cwho lived through almost a century of history, at a time when people were guillotined for not much. So ... he must have been very clever.\u201d",
      "The show, for Renier, is in large part about ambition. \u201cAll these characters have a goal, a dream to achieve,\u201d he says. \u201cThe question is, what are we ready to win or lose to achieve this dream?\u201d",
      "The production is lush throughout the whole season, beginning with the gorgeous country homes \u2014 filmmakers scouted 60 of them, and chose 12. They created new dinner services to dress the tables, and made 3,000 candles to light all the candelabras \u2014 different hues for different rooms. There were 96 vases of fresh flowers at all times in Talleyrand\u2019s home, according to production notes.",
      "As for costumes, some 1,000 of them were made from scratch, because the filmmakers had a specific vision of clothing that was not period-accurate but also not completely modern.",
      "Then there was that crazy banquet that ends the season. Filming at the Parc de Saint-Cloud, which boasts dramatic fountains, the production created a giant tent covered with \u201can extraordinary amount of velvet,\u201d and loaded down the tables with food, including a 60 kilo (132 pound) leg of lamb and a 50 kilo (110-pound) tuna.",
      "They also made 5,000 cream puffs, which were assembled into grand, towering structures \u2014 befitting not only a new emperor but the world\u2019s first celebrity chef.",

      "Tardy photographers",
      "NEW YORK -- Like all brides, Elana Goldin had high hopes for her wedding photos and video.",
      "\u201cI loved their images,\u201d she said of the company picked by her dad and future mother-in-law. \u201cThey were award-winning. They were in a ton of magazines. I really liked the vibe of the owner.\u201d",
      "The feeling didn't last.",
      "The photographer, who showed up 45 minutes late with a team of two, wasn't the owner, as the company had promised. She was someone Goldin had never spoken to. The fill-in had a bad attitude from the start, said Goldin, who lives in Chicago and got married last May in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.",
      "Among other things, the photographer criticized Goldin's bridal shoes, jewelry and perfume as second rate for traditional close-up shots, and she picked apart the bouquets without permission to get images before the ceremony.",
      "\u201cShe and the florist got into a fight. There was friction from the moment she walked in,\u201d Goldin said.",
      "Looking back, Goldin said she would have done a few things differently.",
      "We asked wedding planners and photographers to also weigh in on how they think photo disaster can be averted.",
      "Goldin wishes she had been more assertive. She had provided a shotlist ahead of time, but the photographer assigned to the bride and bridesmaids started making demands on where she wanted Goldin to pose.",
      "\u201cI'm in my dress and she said let\u2019s take a picture in the shower, because it was a very big, glamorous shower. My sister was like, absolutely not. Not happening,\u201d Goldin recalled.",
      "At the venue, the photographer insisted on taking photos outside. The weather was rainy and windy, and the lighting was dreary.",
      "\u201cIt was disgusting outside. My dress got all dirty at the bottom. My hair starts frizzing. The bridesmaids came out and our hair was blowing everywhere. The pictures were awful,\u201d Goldin said.",
      "You love them dearly. But New Jersey-based wedding planner Danielle Rothweiler of Rothweiler Event Design advises against it.",
      "\u201cI always tell my couples, stop hiring your friends and family because if something goes wrong, think of that conversation that you\u2019re going to have. No one wants that,\u201d she said.",
      "One client took up an uncle on his offer to shoot her wedding as his gift. He missed half the shots and didn't understand the importance of timing. He also spent a good amount of time just being a guest and not taking pictures at all.",
      "\u201cShe never said anything. The pictures weren't great,\u201d Rothweiler said. \u201cI have a wedding coming up this year and half the vendor list is friends and family and I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m so scared about it.\u201d",
      "Michelle Jackson, who owns the photo vendor Bambino International based in Cincinnati, Ohio, said some basic questions about equipment can go a long way.",
      "Make sure your photographers have back up camera bodies and other crucial equipment of the same quality as their primary gear, she said. Cameras with dual slots for SD cards or XQD cards are optimal.",
      "\u201cEverything's being copied onto two cards,\u201d she said. \u201cThe worst disaster for a photographer is you have no pictures at all because of equipment failure. Couples don't think about that.\u201d",
      "In the same vein, San Francisco wedding photographer Oscar Urizar, the proprietor of Red Eye Collection in San Francisco, said couples should ensure they have the rights to personal use of their photos. That allows them to print, share and display them for non-commercial purposes.",
      "\u201cI started in the film industry. If you didn\u2019t get your negatives, you couldn\u2019t print your photos. It's kind of that same thinking,\u201d he said.",
      "There's nothing more chaotic than organizing group shots at weddings. The larger the wedding, the more chaotic it can be.",
      "Wedding planner Tirusha Dave, founder of the luxury market Bravura Brides, serves South Asian couples around the world with guest lists up to 300 or more.",
      "She puts together a shareable document and asks couples to list every person expected in each group shot, but she doesn't stop there. She has them designate one person to serve as wrangler. The wrangler must know every person in the group by sight so they can be chased down if necessary.",
      "\u201cI tell my couples, I\u2019m really great at what I do but I don't know your second cousins, your extended aunts and uncles,\u201d Dave said.",
      "Each group is assigned a number that's announced when it's time to gather.",
      "Dallas-area photographer April Pinto, founder and co-owner of April Pinto Photography, has a stable of shooters. They can juggle up to four weddings a week.",
      "They sink or swim by how well the timeline is observed. Not an easy task, Pinto said, \u201cwhen you have a coordinator timing you and the mother of the groom who wasn\u2019t on the Zoom call making her own agenda and stressing out the bride. We're in the middle of all of that.\u201d",
      "But that's just part of the challenge. The other part?",
      "The rowdy bridesmaid, Pinto said. She's somebody who might have had a bit too much Champagne and feels like she should be in charge.",
      "\u201cIf a bridesmaid is feeling a little too spicy, we try to give her tasks,\u201d Pinto said. \u201cI find that keeping people in general engaged and involved can go a long way. You can turn all that stress into a happy time.\u201d",

      "Attorneys general in 19 states and Washington, D",
      "Attorneys general in 19 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging cuts to the U.S. Health and Human Services agency, saying the Trump administration's massive restructuring has destroyed life-saving programs and left states to pick up the bill for mounting health crises.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Rhode Island on Monday, New York Attorney General Letitia James said. The attorneys general from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia signed onto the complaint.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. restructured the agency in March, eliminating more than 10,000 employees and collapsing 28 agencies under the sprawling HHS umbrella into 15, the attorneys general said. An additional 10,000 employees had already been let go by President Donald Trump's administration, according to the lawsuit, and combined the cuts stripped 25% of the HHS workforce.",
      "\u201cIn its first three months, Secretary Kennedy and this administration deprived HHS of the resources necessary to do its job,\u201d the attorneys general wrote.",
      "Kennedy has said he is seeking to streamline the nation's public health agencies and reduce redundancies across them with the layoffs. The cuts were made as part of a directive the administration has dubbed, \u201c Make America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "HHS is one of the government's costliest federal agencies, with an annual budget of about $1.7 trillion that is mostly spent on health care coverage for millions of people enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "James, who is leading the lawsuit, called the restructuring a \u201csweeping and unlawful assault\u201d that would endanger lives.",
      "\u201cThis is not government reform. This is not efficiency,\u201d James said during a press conference Monday.",
      "The cuts have resulted in laboratories having limited testing for some infectious diseases, the federal government not tracking cancer risks among U.S. firefighters, early childhood learning programs left unsure of future funds and programs aimed at monitoring cancer and maternal health closing, the attorneys general say. Cuts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also have hampered states' ability to respond to one of the largest measles outbreaks in recent years, the lawsuit says.",
      "\u201cThis chaos and abandonment of the Department\u2019s core functions was not an unintended side effect, but rather the intended result,\u201d of the \u201cMAHA Directive,\u201d they said. They want a judge to vacate the directive because they say the administration can't unilaterally eliminate programs and funding that have been created by Congress.",
      "The restructuring eliminated the entire team of people who maintain the federal poverty guidelines used by states to determine whether residents are eligible for Medicaid, nutrition assistance and other programs. A tobacco prevention agency was gutted. Staff losses also were significant at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",
      "The Trump administration is already facing other legal challenges over cuts to public health agencies and research organizations. A coalition of 23 states filed a federal lawsuit in Rhode Island last month over the administration's decision to cut $11 billion in federal funds for COVID-19 initiatives and various public health projects across the country.",

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s motto is \u201c Make America Healthy Again,\u201d but government cuts could make it harder to know if that's happening.",
      "More than a dozen data-gathering programs that track deaths and disease appear to have been eliminated in the tornado of layoffs and proposed budget cuts rolled out in the Trump administration's first 100 days.",
      "The Associated Press examined draft and final budget proposals and spoke to more than a dozen current and former federal employees to determine the scope of the cuts to programs tracking basic facts about Americans' health.",
      "Among those terminated at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were experts tracking abortions, pregnancies, job-related injuries, lead poisonings, sexual violence and youth smoking, the AP found.",
      "\"If you don\u2019t have staff, the program is gone,\u201d said Patrick Breysse, who used to oversee the CDC\u2019s environmental health programs.",
      "Federal officials have not given a public accounting of specific surveillance programs that are being eliminated.",
      "Instead, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman pointed the AP to a Trump administration budget proposal released Friday. It lacked specifics, but proposes to cut the CDC's core budget by more than half and vows to focus CDC surveillance only on emerging and infectious diseases.",
      "Kennedy has said some of the CDC's other work will be moved to a yet-to-be-created agency, the Administration for a Healthy America. He also has said that the cuts are designed to get rid of waste at a department that has seen its budget grow in recent years.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, this extra spending and staff has not improved our nation\u2019s health as a country,\" Kennedy wrote last month in The New York Post. \"Instead, it has only created more waste, administrative bloat and duplication.\"",
      "Yet some health experts say the eliminated programs are not duplicative, and erasing them will leave Americans in the dark.",
      "\u201cIf the U.S. is interested in making itself healthier again, how is it going to know, if it cancels the programs that helps us understand these diseases?\u201d said Graham Mooney, a Johns Hopkins University public health historian.",
      "The core of the nation\u2019s health surveillance is done by the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics. Relying on birth and death certificates, it generates information on birth rates, death trends and life expectancy. It also operates longstanding health surveys that provide basic data on obesity, asthma and other health issues.",
      "The center has been barely touched in layoffs, and seems intact under current budget plans.",
      "But many other efforts were targeted by the cuts, the AP found. Some examples:",
      "The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, which surveys women across the country, lost its entire staff \u2014 about 20 people.",
      "It\u2019s the most comprehensive collection of data on the health behaviors and outcomes before, during and after childbirth. Researchers have been using its data to investigate the nation's maternal mortality problem.",
      "Recent layoffs also wiped out the staffs collecting data on in vitro fertilizations and abortions.",
      "Those cuts are especially surprising given that President Donald Trump said he wants to expand IVF access and that the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 playbook for his administration called for more abortion surveillance.",
      "The CDC eliminated its program on lead poisoning in children, which helped local health departments \u2014 through funding and expertise \u2014 investigate lead poisoning clusters and find where risk is greatest.",
      "Lead poisoning in kids typically stems from exposure to bits of old paint, contaminated dust or drinking water that passes through lead pipes. But the program's staff also played an important role in the investigation of lead-tainted applesauce that affected 500 kids.",
      "Last year, Milwaukee health officials became aware that peeling paint in aging local elementary schools was endangering kids. The city health department began working with CDC to test tens of thousands of students. That assistance stopped last month when the CDC\u2019s lead program staff was terminated.",
      "City officials are particularly concerned about losing expertise to help them track the long-term effects.",
      "\"We don't know what we don't know,\" said Mike Totoraitis, the city\u2019s health commissioner.",
      "Also gone is the staff for the 23-year-old Environmental Public Health Tracking Program, which had information on concerns including possible cancer clusters and weather-related illnesses.",
      "\u201cThe loss of that program is going to greatly diminish the ability to make linkages between what might be in the environment and what health might be affected by that,\u201d Breysse said.",
      "In some cases, it\u2019s not a matter of staffers leaving, but rather the end of specific types of data collection.",
      "Transgender status is no longer being recorded in health-tracking systems, including ones focused on violent deaths and on risky behaviors by kids.",
      "Experts know transgender people are more likely to be victims of violence, but now \u201cit\u2019s going to be much more challenging to quantify the extent to which they are at higher risk,\u201d said Thomas Simon, the recently retired senior director for scientific programs at the CDC's Division of Violence Prevention.",
      "The staff and funding seems to have remained intact for a CDC data collection that provides insights into homicides, suicides and accidental deaths involving weapons.",
      "But CDC violence-prevention programs that acted on that information were halted. So, too, was work on a system that collects hospital data on nonfatal injuries from causes such as shootings, crashes and drownings.",
      "Also going away, apparently, is the CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey. The system is designed to pick up information that's not found in law enforcement statistics. Health officials see that work as important, because not all sexual violence victims go to police.",
      "The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which tracks job-related illnesses and deaths and makes recommendations on how to prevent them, was gutted by the cuts.",
      "Kennedy has said that 20% of the people laid off might be reinstated as the agency tries to correct mistakes.",
      "That appeared to happen last month, when the American Federation of Government Employees said that NIOSH workers involved in a black lung disease program for coal miners had been temporarily called back.",
      "But HHS officials did not answer questions about the reinstatement. The AFGE's Micah Niemeier-Walsh later said the workers continued to have June termination dates and \u201cwe are concerned this is to give the appearance that the programs are still functioning, when effectively they are not.\u201d",
      "There's been no talk of salvaging some other NIOSH programs, including one focused on workplace deaths in the oil and gas industries or a research project into how common hearing loss is in that industry.",
      "The HHS cuts eliminated the 17-member team responsible for the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, one of the main ways the government measures drug use.",
      "Also axed were the CDC staff working on the National Youth Tobacco Survey.",
      "There are other surveys that look at youth smoking and drug use, including the University of Michigan's federally funded \u201cMonitoring the Future\u201d survey of schoolkids.",
      "But the federal studies looked at both adults and adolescents, and provided insights into drug use by high school dropouts. The CDC also delved into specific vaping and tobacco products in the ways that other surveys don't, and was a driver in the federal push to better regulate electronic cigarettes.",
      "\"There was overlap among the surveys, but each one had its own specific focus that the other ones didn\u2019t cover,\u201c said Richard Miech, who leads the Michigan study.",
      "Work to modernize data collection has been derailed. That includes an upgrade to a 22-year-old system that helps local public health departments track diseases and allows CDC to put together a national picture.",
      "Another casualty was the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which tries to predict disease trends.",
      "The center, created during the COVID-19 pandemic, was working on forecasting the current multi-state measles outbreak. That forecast hasn't been published partly because of the layoffs, according to two CDC officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss it and fear retribution for speaking to the press.",
      "Trump hasn't always supported widespread testing of health problems.",
      "In the spring of 2020, when COVID-19 diagnoses were exploding, the president groused that the nation\u2019s ability to do more testing was making the U.S. look like it had a worse problem than other countries. He called testing \u201ca double-edged sword.\u201d",
      "Mooney, the Johns Hopkins historian, wonders how interested the new administration is in reporting on health problems.",
      "\u201cYou could think it\u2019s deliberate,\" he said. \u201cIf you keep people from knowing, they\u2019re less likely to be concerned.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Some Denver parents got texts during this winter\u2019s brutal flu season with videos sharing why people in their neighborhoods chose flu shots for their kids, an unusual study about trust and vaccines in a historically Black community.",
      "But no one will know how it worked out: The Trump administration canceled the project before the data could be analyzed -- and researchers aren\u2019t the only ones upset.",
      "\u201cFor someone like me, from the Black community who income-wise is on the lower end, we don\u2019t often have a voice,\u201d said Denver mom Chantyl Busby, one of the study\u2019s community advisers. \u201cHaving this funding taken away from this project sends a horrible, horrible message. It\u2019s almost like telling us all over again that our opinions don\u2019t matter.\u201d",
      "How to talk about vaccines with parents \u2013 or anyone \u2013 is taking on new urgency: At least 216 U.S. children died of flu this season, the worst pediatric toll in 15 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Unvaccinated children are fueling one of the country's largest measles outbreaks in decades, and another vaccine-preventable disease \u2014 whooping cough \u2014 is soaring, too.",
      "At the same time Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. questions vaccines long proven to be safe and effective. Moves by the Trump administration are making it increasingly uncertain that COVID-19 vaccines will be available this fall. And the administration has slashed funding for public health and medical research, including abruptly stopping studies of vaccine hesitancy.",
      "\u201cWe need to understand what it is that is creating this challenge to vaccines and why,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, who directs the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy and worries the country is entering \u201cscientific dark ages.\"",
      "At Denver Health, Dr. Joshua Williams is a pediatrician who every day has vaccine conversations with confused or worried parents. Some even ask if they\u2019ll get kicked out of his practice for refusing immunizations.",
      "Nope, Williams says: Building trust takes time.",
      "\u201cThe most satisfying vaccine-related encounters I have are the ones in families who had significant concerns for a long time, came to trust me over the years as I cared for broken arms and ear infections \u2013 and ultimately vaccinated their child,\u201d he said.",
      "But in the TikTok age, Williams wondered if digital storytelling \u2013 seeing and hearing what led other families to choose vaccination \u2013 might help those decisions. He chose flu shots as the test case \u2014 just under half of U.S. children got one this season. And Black children are among those most at risk of getting seriously ill from influenza.",
      "With a grant from the National Institutes of Health, Williams partnered with Denver\u2019s nonprofit Center for African American Health to host workshops bringing volunteers together to discuss how influenza and the flu vaccine had impacted their lives. Professionals helped those who wanted to go the extra step turn them into 2- to 3-minute polished videos.",
      "After two years of community engagement, five of those videos were part of the pilot study sending text messages to 200 families who get care at two Denver Health clinics.",
      "In one video, a mother described getting her first flu vaccination along with her young daughter, making her own health decisions after leaving a controlling relationship.",
      "In another, a grandmother explained how she\u2019ll never again miss a vaccine appointment after her grandson spent his 4th birthday hospitalized with the flu.",
      "Seeing \u201cpeople that they look like, that they sound like, who have experiences they\u2019ve been through that can go, \u2018Hey, I felt like you felt but this changed my life,\u2019\u201d is powerful, said Busby, who OK'd her kids' flu vaccinations after questioning Williams during multiple family checkups.",
      "The study's sudden cancellation means Williams can\u2019t assess if the texted videos influenced families' vaccine decisions \u2013 lost data from more than two years of work and already-spent NIH dollars. It also jeopardizes the researchers' careers. While considering next steps, Williams has asked permission of community members to use some of the videos in his own practice as he discusses vaccination.",
      "Williams gets personal, too, telling families that his kids are vaccinated and how his 95-year-old grandmother reminisces about the terror of polio during her own childhood before those vaccinations were developed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve lost the collective memory about what it\u2019s like to have these diseases in our community,\u201d Williams said, ruefully noting the ongoing measles outbreak. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to take a collective voice from the community saying this is important, to remind those in power that we need to be allocating resources to infection prevention and vaccine hesitancy research.\u201d",

      "Many young people in Nigeria have attempted to break the Guinness World Record in recent years. At least seven Nigerians have broken world records in the past three years, including Hilda Baci, who won the longest cooking marathon and Tunde Onakoya, who played the longest chess marathon.",
      "Kanyeyachukwu\u2019s world record attempt also sought to raise funds for the Zeebah Foundation, a nonprofit focusing on providing support to those on the spectrum and their families.",
      "While there are no official records from within Nigeria, about 1 in 100 children worldwide is autistic, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "Like in many other countries, autism is often not diagnosed in Nigeria until in older years.",
      "The lack of reliable data on autism, adequate awareness and government support for the spectrum disorder are some of the biggest challenges autistic people face in Nigeria, said Stanley Effah, founder of the Ferdinand Effah Music Heritage Foundation.",
      "Effah, whose child is autistic, said his foundation is planning to launch an annual musical concert featuring major artists as part of efforts to raise awareness about autism in Nigeria.",
      "Access to stem cell therapy for autistic children should also be included under the Nigerian National Health Insurance plan as a way to improve their care, Effah said.",
      "Kanyeyachukwu's mother said more government support was key to provide those on the spectrum the care they need early on in life.",
      "Kanyeyachukwu was only diagnosed in Canada after years of failed attempts in Nigeria, the father said. The diagnosis paved the way to properly support him, including his love for drawing, discovered at the age of 4.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of work with him,\u201d he said. \"Kanye can tidy his room, he can wash his clothes \u2014 all of this is because of early intervention. If left alone, he definitely would not be able to do these things.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Kentucky is reporting a 30.2% drop in drug overdose deaths in 2024",
      "The number of overdose deaths in Kentucky last year dropped by 30.2% \u2014 down to 1,410 lives lost \u2014 giving state leaders a surge of confidence that prevention and treatment efforts are making progress against an addiction epidemic they say is shattering families across the state.",
      "This was the third straight yearly decrease in drug overdose deaths for the state, although prior declines were substantially smaller. Kentucky has long been plagued by high rates of addiction to opioid painkillers, and fatal overdoses surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when treatment was hard to get and people were socially isolated.",
      "Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who announced the latest overdose statistics on Thursday, called the results a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d reflecting years of painstaking work to combat the spread and use of drugs.",
      "\u201cThis is what we have been hoping for and praying for,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here ought to give everyone who\u2019s worked so hard to get to this point ... hope that we can do even more.\"",
      "State Attorney General Russell Coleman, a Republican, said Kentuckians should \u201crejoice in every life saved from this scourge,\u201d but warned that powerful illicit drugs like fentanyl continue to pose a threat.",
      "\"As little as one pill can and is killing our sons and daughters,\u201d Coleman said in a statement.",
      "Fentanyl and methamphetamine continued to be the most prevalent drugs contributing to overdose deaths in Kentucky.",
      "Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who has steered huge sums of federal funding to his home state to combat its addiction woes, said he was encouraged by the gains in combating the drug crisis, from stemming the flow of illicit drugs to offering treatment services in communities.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always worked to keep Kentucky at the forefront of our national response to the drug crisis,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. \"We are finally making progress in restoring the Southern Border, but there\u2019s still a lot of work left to do in the commonwealth to help those struggling with addiction.\u201d",
      "Kentucky's drop reflected broader gains achieved in the U.S. There were about 97,000 U.S. overdose deaths in the 12 months that ended last June 30, according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was down 14% from the estimated 113,000 for the prior 12-month period.",
      "Overdose death rates nationwide began steadily climbing in the 1990s because of opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths led by other opioids like heroin and more recently fentanyl.",
      "Beshear, seen as a potential candidate for the White House in 2028, said plenty of groups were deserving of credit for Kentucky's big decline in overdose deaths. He praised law enforcement efforts to remove dangerous drugs from circulation and the work of addiction treatment centers and other recovery services. And he credited those Kentuckians battling addiction who reached out for help.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s your first, fifth or 10th attempt, we want to stand behind you,\" the governor said. \"We want to provide you the best help that we can.\u201d",
      "Other factors, he said, include the distribution of Narcan, which can reverse overdoses of opioids, as well as the availability of addiction services through Medicaid and the work of syringe exchange programs.",
      "\u201cRegardless of what the politics say, syringe exchange programs work,\" Beshear said. \"They help us get to know people and they help us to save lives.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Coleman has rolled out a youth-focused initiative aimed at keeping young people away from deadly substances.",
      "With all those efforts, the challenge now is to continue driving down fatal overdoses, Beshear said.",
      "\u201cIt ought to tell us that an epidemic that arose in our time, we should be able to defeat in our time,\u201d the governor said.",

      "The medical team at the DF Star Hospital in Brasilia said that he left intensive care on Wednesday and there is no set discharge date from the facility. His health condition is stable and he has begun receiving a liquid diet.",
      "Bolsonaro underwent a 12-hour surgery on April 13 to remove intestinal adhesions and reconstruct the abdominal wall. It was the sixth procedure related to long-term effects of being stabbed in the abdomen during a campaign rally in September 2018.",
      "He has been in and out of hospitals since the attack and underwent multiple surgeries during his presidency from 2019-2022.",
      "Doctors described the latest surgery as the \u201cmost complex\u201d since the stabbing, requiring a \u201cvery delicate and prolonged post-surgery.\u201d",
      "Bolsonaro was admitted with severe abdominal pain to a hospital in Santa Cruz, a small city in Rio Grande do Norte, on April 11 and then transferred to a hospital in the state\u2019s capital, Natal. His family later requested his transfer to Brasilia.",
      "He had been preparing for a trip across northeast Brazil to promote his Liberal Party\u2019s right-wing agenda, eyeing next year\u2019s presidential election, though he himself is barred from running. The region traditionally has been a political bastion of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",

      "The apparent reversals are the latest examples of the haphazard approach to agency cuts that have shrunk FDA\u2019s workforce by an estimated 20%, or about 3,500 jobs, in addition to an unspecified number of retirements, voluntary buyouts and resignations.",
      "In February, the FDA laid off about 700 provisional employees, including food and medical device reviewers, only to rehire many of them within days after pushback from industry, Congress and other parties.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services hasn't detailed exactly which positions or programs were cut in the mass layoffs.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has repeatedly said that no FDA scientists were fired as part of the reductions. But at least two dozen food scientists who worked in a San Francisco testing laboratory and a Chicago research center were let go in March.",
      "An HHS spokesperson suggested the apparent mix-up was due to \u201cthe fractured, outdated HR infrastructure we inherited from the Biden administration and are now actively overhauling.\u201d The spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about which employees are being reinstated but said the administration will \u201cstreamline operations and fix the broken systems left to us.\u201d",
      "About 15 scientists working in FDA\u2019s Division of Food Processing Science and Technology in Chicago were told last week they be will reinstated, according to a staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters. But a week later there has been no written confirmation and the scientists have not returned to the office. The group\u2019s research includes studying ways to prevent harmful bacteria from growing on produce and preventing the spread of microplastics and other particles from food packaging.",
      "\u201cI hope Commissioner Makary continues to assess these ill-informed cuts and works to bring back impacted employees expeditiously,\u201d said Susan Mayne of Yale University, the FDA\u2019s former food director. \u201cHis legacy as commissioner is on the line.\u201d",
      "With more than 15,000 employees remaining across various U.S. and foreign offices, the FDA\u2019s core responsibilities are reviewing new drugs, medical products and food ingredients as well as inspecting thousands of factories.",
      "Makary has said no inspectors or medical reviewers were fired as part of the recent reductions. But current and former FDA officials note that those frontline employees are often supported by teams of administrative staff.",
      "FDA inspectors, for example, have long relied on travel bookers to coordinate trips to India and other countries that often involve visa permissions, security measures, ground transportation, tech support, translation services and other logistics. Inspectors can spend up to half the year traveling, a grueling workload that makes recruiting and retaining staff a challenge.",
      "For a brief period last month, inspectors were told they would be booking their own travel. The FDA set up a hotline to assist with making the arrangements. Then, agency leaders developed a plan to hire an outside contractor to perform the work.",
      "On Monday, staffers were informed that about a third of the fired staff who performed the work would be returning.",

      "NEW YORK -- More U.S. women died around the time of childbirth last year, reversing two years of decline, according to provisional data posted Wednesday.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 688 people died last year during pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. That\u2019s up from 669 deaths in 2023, but down from 2022 and 2021, when it was the highest level in more than 50 years.",
      "The maternal mortality rate rose to 19 deaths per 100,000 live births, up from 18.6 the year before.",
      "The CDC counts women who die while pregnant, during childbirth and up to 42 days after birth from conditions related to pregnancy. Excessive bleeding, blood vessel blockages and infections are leading causes.",
      "Such deaths spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the coronavirus was particularly dangerous to pregnant women. And, in the worst days of the pandemic, burned out physicians may have added to the risk by ignoring pregnant women\u2019s worries, experts say.",
      "The waning of COVID-19 is considered a major reason for the declines in maternal deaths in 2022 and 2023, experts say.",
      "But those improvements are now being offset by other factors that may reduce access to medical care, experts say. They say the list includes the closure of rural hospitals and the U.S. Supreme Court decision that did away with the federally established right to abortion, which caused some doctors to feel constrained about providing care during pregnancy-related medical emergencies.",
      "The U.S. has one of the highest maternal mortality rate among wealthy nations. Past research has found wide racial disparities in such deaths, with Black women dying at a far higher rate than white women.",

      "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- El Salvador President Nayib Bukele ordered police via social media on Monday to arrest five heads of bus companies in the Central American country after they defied his order to offer free transport for a week following a major highway closure.",
      "The order was another example of Bukele's heavy-handed tactics. The second-term leader has been accused of undermining democratic institutions, punishing dissenters and denying access to due process under a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d that he declared in 2022 to battle the country's powerful street gangs. Despite the crackdown, the government has denied the country is a police state.",
      "On Sunday, Bukele had announced via X that all bus fares for a week would be completely free due to construction the government was carrying out on one of the main highways running through San Salvador.",
      "The order resulted in widespread chaos on Monday, fueling long bus lines in the Salvadoran capital and overcrowded buses that skipped stops on a number of routes.",
      "In response, Bukele ordered the capture of five heads of bus companies Monday, accusing them of \u201csabotaging the country.\u201d He claimed that the government was covering \u201c100% of the income they normally receive per day,\u201d but The Associated Press was not immediately able to verify the information with bus drivers.",
      "\u201cThe National Civil Police should proceed with the arrest of the owners of the routes involved,\u201d Bukele wrote on a social media post. \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d",
      "Later Monday, the country's federal police department posted photos of the handcuffed men surrounded by heavily armed officers, saying they had been detained for \u201cbreach of duty, denial of assistance, and extortion,\u201d providing few details on their arrests.",
      "The National Transportation Committee, which represents the companies involved, said in a statement that they were surprised by the arrests. They blamed confusion on some routes on the fact that the free rides had been announced just a day earlier and they weren\u2019t able to notify everyone.",
      "Luis Regalado, a member of the trade group, said that many of the drivers are paid daily and were unclear on how they would be paid or by whom.",
      "Lucio V\u00e1zquez, the group\u2019s secretary, appealed to Bukele, saying they had been partners with his administration. \u201cWe are not saying that we\u2019re not going to continue giving free service,\u201d he said.",
      "It comes as Bukele has gained an international spotlight for detaining more than 200 Venezuelan deportees from the U.S. in a \u201cmega-prison\u201d for gangs despite objections by American judges and human rights groups.",
      "Bukele, who has soaring popularity in El Salvador because of his harsh crackdown on the country's gangs, has faced sharp criticism for years by global leaders, lawyers and human rights groups, which accuse him of denying citizens due process, violating the country's constitution by seeking reelection and consolidating power.",

      "LOME, Togo -- A coalition of political parties and civil society groups in Togo vowed Monday to step up domestic and international pressure on President Faure Gnassingbe following his controversial appointment over the weekend as head of a powerful new executive body.",
      "Opposition politicians in the West African country denounced the move as a \u201cconstitutional coup\" that could signal further democratic backsliding in a region marred by military coups.",
      "Gnassingbe, who has ruled since 2005 after the death of his father, on Saturday was given by lawmakers the powerful new title of President of the Council of Ministers. In this role, he has more power and can be re-elected indefinitely for 6-year terms by Parliament.",
      "Two main opposition parties, the Democratic Forces for the Republic and the National Alliance for Change, called the move a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d in a joint statement on Sunday.",

      "The opposition organized a rally in Lom\u00e9, the capital, on Sunday, but the turnout was modest.",
      "Speaking to The Associated Press, Professor David Dosseh, spokesperson for the coalition, said the swearing-in of Gnassingbe as President of the Council of Ministers marks \u201ca new phase in the seizure of power,\u201d one that entrenches the president\u2019s rule after 20 years in office.",
      "Togo, a nation of around 8 million people, has been ruled by same family for 57 years, initially by Eyadema Gnassingbe and subsequently by his son. Faure Gnassingbe has been in office since 2005 after winning elections that the opposition described as a sham.",
      "Last year, Gnassingbe signed off on a new constitution, which eliminates presidential elections and granted Parliament the power to choose the president.",
      "\u201cThis is not a transition. It\u2019s the continuity of the same authoritarian system under another name after 58 years of rule,\u201d Dosseh said, referring to Gnassingbe's new title.",
      "A purely symbolic presidency has been created, now led by 86-year-old Jean-Lucien Savi de Tov\u00e9, a figure largely unknown to the younger generation, while real power was handed to a Council led by Gnassingbe, without term limits.",
      "The ruling party did not respond to a request for comment. Government media outlets have portrayed the constitutional reform as a modernizing step that prepares Togo for a parliamentary government.",

      "Hotin defended the closures in a statement, saying he cannot renew essential public contracts of state employees without a delegation.",
      "On Monday, Guadeloupe\u2019s prefect, Xavier Lefort, said he would file an appeal before an administrative court to suspend Hotin\u2019s order. Guadeloupe is an administrative department of France, and the prefect is the top departmental official on the island.",
      "Lefort also urged Hotin to take emergency measures to reopen the town and meet immediately with the council so it could authorize Hotin to renew or award public contracts absent a delegation.",

      "The 38-year-old leader of the hard-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, will face a pro-Western reformist in a May 18 runoff that could reshape the European Union and NATO member country\u2019s geopolitical direction.",
      "Romania\u2019s political landscape was upended last year when a top court voided the previous election in which the far-right outsider Calin Georgescu topped first round. The decision followed allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, which Moscow has denied.",
      "\u201cFor 35 years, the Romanian people lived the lie that we are a democratic country,\u201d Simion, who came fourth in last year\u2019s race and later backed Georgescu, told The Associated Press last week. \u201cAnd now the people are awakening.\u201d",
      "Born in 1986 in Romania's eastern city of Focsani, Simion took a bachelor\u2019s degree in business and administration in Bucharest, and later a master\u2019s degree at a university in the northeastern city of Iasi researching communist-era crimes. He also became involved in soccer ultra groups.",
      "He took part in civic activism, including joining a protest movement against a controversial gold mining project by a Canadian company in a mountainous western region of Romania that contains some of Europe\u2019s largest gold deposits. He also campaigned for reunification with neighboring Moldova.",
      "In 2019, Simion founded the AUR party, which rose to prominence in a 2020 parliamentary election by proclaiming to stand for \u201cfamily, nation, faith, and freedom,\u201d and has since doubled its support to become Romania\u2019s second largest party in the legislature. It opposes same-sex marriage and has close ties to the Romanian Orthodox Church.",
      "Simion supports Trump and told AP last week that the AUR party is \u201cperfectly aligned with the MAGA movement,\u201d referring to the U.S. president's Make America Great Again movement.",
      "Simion\u2019s political platform has been built on a fiercely anti-establishment agenda and populist rhetoric. During the COVID-19 pandemic, his party staged multiple protests against vaccination and lockdowns, capitalizing on a widespread distrust of the authorities.",
      "He labelled the canceled election last year a \u201ccoup d'etat,\u201d and adopted stronger populist rhetoric and religious messaging to tap into Georgescu\u2019s electorate.

      "A Simion presidency would pose unique foreign policy conundrums. His activities in Moldova led to an expulsion and multiple entry bans on allegations of trying to destabilize the country. He is also banned from entering neighboring Ukraine for \u201csystemic anti-Ukrainian\u201d activities. \u201cIt is in their interest to have good relations with us,\u201d he said of the two countries.",
      "In March, Simion sparked controversy after remarking during a protest that those responsible for barring Georgescu's second bid for presidency should be \u201cskinned in a public square,\u201d prompting prosecutors to launch a criminal probe for inciting violence. He denied the accusation saying it was a political metaphor.",
      "Observers have long viewed him of being pro-Russian and warn that his presidency would undermine both Brussels and NATO as the war rages on in Ukraine. He refuted the accusations as a \u201csmear campaign\u201d by leftists and said Russia has been the \u201cmain threat\u201d to Romania in the last 200 years and remains so today.",
      "\u201cThis is why we need a strong NATO and we need troops on the ground in Romania, in Poland and in the Baltic states,\u201d he said, although he was against sending further military aid to Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThe danger is not who will be the next president of Romania but \u2026 those who want to create a distance and to form two different opposing geopolitical blocs\" between the European Union and the U.S., he said.",
      "On the EU, Simion said, \u201cWe want more power to the 27 states, not toward the European institutions,\u201d and that he is \u201ctotally aligned\u201d with the position of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who was the only EU head of government to attend Trump's inauguration in January.",
      "Siegfried Muresan, a Romanian member of the European Parliament, said Monday that a Simion presidency would be \u201cbad news\u201d for Romania and Europe, and accused the AUR leader of having \u201ddisdain for democratic processes.\u201d",
      "\u201cGeorge Simion is not a conservative politician. He is an anti-European extremist. His election would endanger Romania, threaten European stability, and serve as a strategic victory for Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cHe offers no viable solutions to Romania\u2019s challenges.\u201d",
      "For Claudiu Tufis, an associate professor of political science at the University of Bucharest, accusations that Simion is extremist or pro-Russian are overblown. He says a Simion presidency could look similar to Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who has long been a thorn in the side of Brussels.",
      "\u201cMy main criticism has to do first with his values. He\u2019s a strong opponent of any sort of what people are considering to be identity politics, so he\u2019s going to push back very hard on LGBT issues and gender issues,\u201d Tufis told AP.",
      "He added that Simion lacks a strong team to deal with major crises. \u201cWhen it comes to dealing with geopolitical crisis, they are completely and utterly unprepared,\u201d he said.",

      "Sister Mary Barron, president of the umbrella group of leaders of women\u2019s religious orders, urged the superiors and the over 650,000 nuns worldwide to pray that the cardinals make the right choice and reflect on how to carry forward Francis\u2032 vision.",

      "In a social media post responding to Rubio, the Foreign Ministry wrote \u201cthis is democracy\u201d and said the decision was \"the result of a thorough & independent investigation to protect our Constitution & the rule of law.\u201d",
      "The ministry said independent courts will have the final say, adding that \"we have learnt from our history that rightwing extremism needs to be stopped.\u201d",

      "Sculptures of two giant eagles from the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d films will be removed from New Zealand's Wellington Airport this month after looming over travelers for 12 years",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- For more than a decade, passengers at New Zealand \u2019s Wellington Airport have boarded flights below the figures of two giant, hovering eagles from the Hobbit films, one bearing a bellowing wizard Gandalf.",
      "With 50-foot (15-meter) wingspans and weighing 2,600 pounds (1.1 ton) each, the sculptures that hover in the terminal have delighted tourists and scared children since 2013. Their tenure was eventful \u2014 one became unmoored from its fixings during a severe earthquake in 2016, and plummeted onto the terminal floor below. No one was hurt.",
      "But this month the majestic creatures, which underscore the capital city\u2019s connection to Peter Jackson \u2019s \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d and Hobbit films, will depart the terminal for good, Wellington Airport announced Monday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been quite a Lord of the Rings-heavy storytelling theme in here,\u201d said airport chief executive Matt Clarke. \u201cNow we\u2019re looking to change that to something new.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt breaks my heart,\u201d said one traveler, Verity Johnson, who sat beneath a grasping eagle claw in the food court on Monday. The sculptures had impressed her since she was young. \u201cPlease, please reconsider.\u201d",
      "\u201cTaking them away is un-New Zealand,\u201d joked another airport visitor, Michael Parks.",
      "The eagles were crafted by the film props and effects company W\u0113t\u0101 Workshop, which created tens of thousands of props for the Oscar-winning fantasy films directed by Jackson -- one of Wellington\u2019s best-known residents, who lives on an isthmus near the airport. The movies based on J.R.R. Tolkien \u2019s beloved novels generated billions of dollars in tourism revenue for New Zealand and employed thousands of people in Wellington over the 15 years of the movies\u2019 production.",
      "But during the years the eagles have hovered in the terminal, Tolkien tourism has waned in Wellington \u2014 although the city will perhaps always be synonymous with Jackson\u2019s films. Guided tours still convey fans to the settings of famous scenes from the films and to visit production companies such as W\u0113t\u0101, which will create a new display for the airport, to be unveiled later this year, Clarke said.",
      "Travelers have until Friday to admire the birds, which will then be put into storage, Clarke said. He hopes the creatures \u2013 which each feature 1,000 3D printed feathers \u2013 will find a home at a museum.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a spectacular thing for little kids to see,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cEven your old, grizzled businessmen, they still pull out their phones and take a quick cheeky photo too.\u201d",
      "Wellington Airport isn\u2019t losing its quirky side. An enormous sculpture of The Hobbit\u2019s gold-hoarding dragon, Smaug, will remain overlooking the check-in counters.",

      "The ship-sinking exercise was planned in an offshore area facing the hotly disputed Scarborough Shoal, which has been closely guarded by the Chinese coast guard, navy and suspected militia ships.",
      "The Philippines also claims the fishing atoll, which lies about 220 kilometers (137 miles) west of Zambales. Chinese and the Philippine forces have had increasingly hostile confrontations in the waters and airspace of Scarborough in recent years.",
      "The cancelled ship-sinking drill would have been the third to be staged by the treaty allies in recent years. It was supposed to be one of the highlights of largescale annual military exercises by the United States and the Philippines from April 21 to May 9 with about 14,000 U.S. and Filipino forces participants.",
      "Called Balikatan, Tagalog for shoulder-to-shoulder, the combat drills have increasingly focused on the defense of Philippine sovereignty in the face of China\u2019s growing aggression in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims virtually in its entirety.",
      "Mock battle scenes which have been staged so far, including the retaking of an island from hostile forces, have reflected assurances by the Trump administration, including by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, that the U.S. would abide by its treaty commitment to defend the Philippines in case Filipino forces come under an armed attack, including in the South China Sea.",
      "On Sunday, U.S., Australian and Philippine forces practiced retaking an island from hostile forces in the coastal town of Balabac in western Palawan province, which faces the South China Sea.",
      "Japanese forces and British marines joined as observers of the combat exercise, which \u201cshowcased the growing interoperability and cohesion among partner nations in maintaining regional security,\u201d Salgado said.",
      "\"What we have seen since Trump returned to the White House is a remarkable level of continuity in the US-Philippines alliance not only in joint military drills, but also on American statements that the alliance is \u2018ironclad,\u2019 said Derek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at RAND Corporation.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is trying to keep the pressure on China through its support to the Philippines,\" Grossman said, but added that it\u2019s unclear \u201cjust how sustainable this commitment will be given that the Trump administration seems less hawkish on China than its predecessors.\u201d",
      "China has vehemently opposed such exercises involving U.S. forces in or near the South China Sea or Taiwan, the island democracy, which Beijing claims as a province and has threatened to annex by force if necessary.",
      "U.S. and Philippine military officials, however, have insisted that the combat exercises were not designed with China in mind but serve as a deterrence to acts of aggression in the region.",

      "Many Indigenous Catholics saw an ally in Pope Francis who championed their causes, asked forgiveness for the church\u2019s historical wrongs and allowed them to incorporate aspects of their Native cultures into practicing their faith",
      "SIMOJOVEL, Mexico -- At a recent service in the remote southern Mexican community of Simojovel, Catholic and Mayan symbolism mingled at the altar as the deacon \u2014 his wife beside him \u2014 read the gospel in his native Tsotsil and recalled Pope Francis' teachings: work together for human rights, justice and Mother Earth.",
      "The scene in the small church in Mexico's poorest state, Chiapas, conveyed much of the message Francis delivered during his 2016 trip to the region and his other visits to far-flung locales, including the Amazon, Congo and the jungles of Papua New Guinea.",
      "It also illustrated what the world's Indigenous Catholics don\u2019t want to lose with the death of the first pontiff from the Southern Hemisphere: their relatively newfound voice in an institution that once debated whether \u201cIndians\u201d had souls while backing European powers as they plundered the Americas and Africa.",
      "\u201cWe ask God that the work (Francis) did for us not be in vain,\u201d Deacon Juan P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez told his small congregation. \u201cWe ask you to choose a new pope, a new servant, who hopefully Lord thinks the same way.\u201d",
      "Francis was the first Latin American pope and the first from the order of the Jesuits, who are known for, among other things, their frontline work with society's most marginalized groups. Although some feel Francis could have done more for their people during his 12 years as pontiff, Indigenous Catholics widely praise him for championing their causes, asking forgiveness for the church's historical wrongs, and allowing them to incorporate aspects of their Native cultures into practicing their faith.",
      "Among the places where his death has hit particularly hard are the lowlands of the Bolivian Amazon, which was home to Jesuit missions centuries ago that Francis praised for bringing Christianity and European-style education and economic organization to Indigenous people in a more humane way.",
      "Marcial Fabricano, a 73-year-old leader of the Indigenous Moje\u00f1o people, remembers crying during Francis\u2019 2015 visit to Bolivia when the pope sought forgiveness for crimes the church committed against Indigenous people during the colonial-era conquest of the Americas. Before the visit, his and other Indigenous groups sent Francis a message asking him to push the authorities to respect them.",
      "\u201cI believe that Pope Francis read our message and it moved him,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the last bastion of the missions. \u2026 We can\u2019t be ignored.\u201d",
      "That South American tour came shortly after the publication of one of Francis\u2019 most important encyclicals in which he called for a revolution to fix a \u201cstructurally perverse\u201d global economic system that allows the rich to exploit the poor and turns the Earth into \u201cimmense pile of filth.\u201d He also encouraged the church to support movements defending the territory of marginalized people and financing their initiatives.",
      "\u201cFor the first time, (a pope) felt like us, thought like us and was our great ally,\u201d said Anitalia Pijachi Kuyuedo, a Colombian member of the Okaira-Muina Murui people who participated in the 2019 Amazon Synod in Rome, where Francis showed interest in everything related to the Amazon, including the roles of women.",
      "Pijachi Kuyuendo, 45, said she hopes the next pope also works closely with Native people. \u201cWith his death, we face huge challenges.\u201d",
      "P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez, 57, is able to help tend to his small Tsotsil Catholic community in Mexico because the church restarted a deaconship program under Francis.",
      "Facing a priest shortage in the 1960s, the church pushed the idea of deacons \u2014 married men who can perform some priestly rituals, such as baptisms, but not others, such as conducting Mass and hearing confession.",
      "Samuel Ruiz, who spent four decades as bishop of San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas trying to improve the lives of Chiapas' Indigenous people, saw deaconships as a way to promote the faith among them and form what he called a \u201cNative church.\u201d The deaconship initiative was such a hit in Ruiz's diocese, though, that the Vatican halted it there in 2002, worried that Ruiz was using it as a step toward allowing married priests and female deacons. The halt was lifted in 2014.",
      "P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez, who waited 20 years before he was finally ordained a deacon in 2022, said he was inspired by Ruiz's vision for a \u201cNative church.\u201d He said Francis reminded him of Ruiz, who died in 2011 and whom he credits with explaining the church's true purpose to him as \"liberator and evangelizer.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrancis also talked about liberation,\u201d P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez said, adding that he hopes the next pope shares that view.",
      "It had been a half-century since the Vatican allowed Mass to be held in languages other than Latin when Francis visited Chiapas in 2016 and went a step further.",
      "During a Mass that was the highlight of his visit, the Lord's Prayer was sung in Tsotsil, readings were conducted in two other Mayan languages, Tseltal and Ch'ol, congregants danced while praying and Indigenous women stood at the altar.",
      "Chiapas was a politically sensitive choice for the Pope\u2019s visit, which wasn\u2019t easily negotiated with the Vatican or Mexican government, according to Cardinal Felipe Arizmendi, who was then bishop of San Cristobal. In 1994, it saw an armed uprising by the Zapatistas, who demanded rights for Indigenous peoples.",
      "Getting the Vatican to allow Mayan rituals in the Mass was also tricky, but Arizmendi recalled that there was a helpful precedent: Congo.",
      "In 1988, the Vatican approved the first cultural innovation in a Mass, the so-called Zaire rite, which is a source of national pride and continental inclusion, said the Rev. Abb\u00e9 Paul Agustin Madimba, a priest in Kinshasa. \u201cIt shows the value the church gives Africans.\"",
      "Francis cited the Zaire rite, which allowed some local music and dance to be incorporated into Mass, to argue for such accommodations with other Indigenous Catholics around the world.",
      "The decision was made not only to expand Catholicism, which is in retreat in many places, \u201cbut also a theological act of deep listening and conversion, where the church recognizes that it is not the owner of cultural truth, but rather servant of the gospel for each people,\" said Arturo Lomel\u00ed, a Mexican social anthropologist.",
      "It was the Vatican's way to see Indigenous rituals not as \u201cthreats, but rather as legitimate ways to express and live the faith,\u201d he said.",
      "On the Saturday after Francis' death, P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez stopped by a church in the town near his village to pick up the Communion wafers he would give out during his service the next day. Because he's a deacon, he needs a priest to consecrate them for him ahead of time.",
      "He and his wife, Crecencia L\u00f3pez, don't know who the next pope will be, but they hope he's someone who shares Francis' respect for Indigenous people. And they smile at the thought that perhaps one day, he could become a priest and she a deacon.",
      "\u201cWe are no longer objects, but rather people\u201d and that is thanks to God and his envoys, \u201cjtatik Samuel (Ruiz)\" and \u201cjtatik Francis,\u201d P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez said, using a paternal term of great respect in Tseltal.",

      "Pakistan has denied any role in the attack, and offered to have a credible international probe. New Delhi has so far not accepted the offer and several world leaders, including officials from the United States, have urged both sides to exercise restraint and avoid further escalation.",
      "Kashmir is split between India and Pakistan and claimed by both in its entirety. The two countries have fought two of their three wars over the Himalayan region and their ties have been shaped by conflict, aggressive diplomacy and mutual suspicion, mostly due to their competing claims over Kashmir.",

      "A coalition of state attorneys general has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to stop the development of wind energy",
      "A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.",
      "Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states\u2019 economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.",
      "They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.",
      "\u201cThis arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.",
      "White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are \u201cusing lawfare to stop the president\u2019s popular energy agenda,\u201d instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.",
      "\u201cThe American people voted for the president to restore America\u2019s energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats\u2019 radical climate agenda,\u201d Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were \u201calleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government\u2019s leasing and permitting\u201d of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.",
      "The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.",
      "The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.",
      "Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes.

      "The Trump administration is swiftly remaking housing policy as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development retreats from long-established fair-housing protections for transgender people.",
      "In recent months, HUD has been targeting the Obama-era Equal Access Rule that expanded protections to include sexual orientation and gender identity. Also in the bull's-eye are fair-housing complaint investigations and federally funded homeless shelters.",
      "\u201cThis administration wants to pretend trans people don\u2019t exist,\u201d said Hannah Adams, a senior staff attorney at the National Housing Law Project. \u201cWhatever they\u2019re doing is not in line with HUD\u2019s supposed mission to provide a safety net for families that are struggling in this country.\u201d",
      "HUD said in a statement that it is upholding the landmark Fair Housing Act that guarantees equal access to housing for all Americans, as well as implementing what it called Trump\u2019s executive order \u201crestoring biological truth to the federal government.\u201d",
      "Here are key takeaways about how HUD is taking on the battle over transgender rights.",
      "The Fair Housing Act identifies sex as one of seven protected classes for housing discrimination. But it wasn\u2019t until the Obama administration established the Equal Access Rule in 2012 that those protections were extended to cover sexual orientation, gender identity and marital status.",
      "In 2016, the rule was expanded to include transgender people seeking help at federally funded emergency shelters.",
      "Four years later, a 2020 Supreme Court ruling established that a landmark civil rights law protects gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination in employment. Housing advocates and HUD in 2021 under the Biden administration interpreted that as broader affirmation that LGBTQ+ people were also protected in the fair housing law.",
      "Kim Johnson, public policy manager at the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said transgender people experience homelessness at a disproportionately higher rate despite being less than 1% of the general population. The spirit of the Fair Housing Act is to protect everyone who is vulnerable to discrimination, she said, even if the text of the law does not explicitly include gender identity as a protected class.",
      "\u201cWe really need to ensure we\u2019re upholding what the law means, and the fact is that transgender people are some of the most marginalized people in this country,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Since President Donald Trump appointed Scott Turner to take the helm at HUD, the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity has instructed staff to pause investigations of all gender identity discrimination cases, according to two HUD attorneys who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs or benefits.",
      "One said letters were then issued closing the cases for lack of jurisdiction.",
      "HUD has not disclosed how many cases have been dropped. A National Fair Housing Alliance report identified at least 195 discrimination complaints involving gender identity in 2023, though HUD has not specified how many cases are still outstanding.",
      "With changes to the Equal Access rule and other guidance still unclear, what happens now often depends on where a case is filed. In blue states with laws offering protections beyond federal law, HUD can direct tenants facing LGBTQ+ discrimination to state-run offices still taking cases, said a HUD employee who spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss the hot-button topic.",
      "To Sasha Samberg-Champion, HUD deputy general counsel in the Biden administration and now special counsel for civil rights at the National Fair Housing Alliance, \u201cThere is no public policy justification for permitting discrimination in the housing market against people because they are transgender. None.\u201d",
      "Community leaders say they\u2019re facing seemingly contradictory requirements in new HUD contracts with nonprofits that find permanent housing for the homeless and run shelters.",
      "One section stipulates that nonprofits can\u2019t promote \u201cgender ideology\u201d while at the same time another requires compliance with anti-discrimination law, according to a copy provided to the AP.",
      "In Memphis, Tennessee, a nonprofit that provides emergency shelter for transgender people is looking to increase capacity because of the uncertainty.",
      "Kayla Gore, executive director of My Sistah\u2019s House, said it can do that because it doesn\u2019t take federal funding. But other shelters are removing information from their websites about serving the LGBTQ+ community, fearful that federal funding will be stripped if they don\u2019t, she said.",
      "\u201cPeople are confused,\u201d Gore said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what to do because they want to protect their bottom line.\u201d",
      "Soon after being sworn in as HUD secretary in February, Turner announced he was halting enforcement of the Equal Access Rule and quietly filed a proposal to revise the policy. HUD officials have declined to say what the proposed changes are.",
      "In 2020, the first Trump administration unsuccessfully moved to relieve shelters of any obligation to accommodate transgender people.",
      "With Trump back for a second term, advocates fear his administration will feel even more emboldened to go further and forbid shelters from accommodating gender identity altogether.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s making an already vulnerable class of people more vulnerable,\" said Seran Gee, an attorney for Advocates for Trans Equality.",
      "\"Our protections can\u2019t be a pingpong ball that changes every four years.\u201d",

      "In six decades at the helm, Buffett turned a Massachusetts textile company into a sprawling but nimble conglomerate that owns everything from Daily Queen and See\u2019s Candies to BNSF Railway and giant insurers. As the company grew, Warren's reputation grew with it as shares of Berkshire Hathaway climbed steadily, exceeding major indexes by wide margins and returning an average 19.9% each year versus 10.4% for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500.",
      "The decision to continue with the so-called Sage of Omaha as head of the board came amid speculation that Howard Buffett, the second-born of the investor\u2019s three children, would move into that spot. The older Buffett has said that after he dies he would like Howard to take over as chairman.",
      "A current vice-chairman, Abel, will take over as CEO as big questions hover over the company. Buffett himself has said President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs were a big mistake. There are also worries that Berkshire might not able to avoid the fate of most conglomerates\u2014forced to break up to recapture focus.",
      "Then there is Berkshire\u2019s $348 billion in cash.",
      "Buffett says he doesn\u2019t see many bargains to invest that money in now, not even Berkshire\u2019s own stock, but assured some of the estimated 40,000 attendees of the company\u2019s celebratory weekend annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, that one day the company would be \u201cbombarded with opportunities.\u201d",
      "Abel, a low-key Canadian with a love a hockey, has been overseeing many of Berkshire\u2019s non-insurance businesses for years, but has not been deciding where to invest the company\u2019s cash.",
      "Buffett said his trust in Abel can seen in where he is putting his money.",
      "\u201cI have no intention \u2014 zero \u2014 of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. I will give it away eventually,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cThe decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg\u2019s management than mine.\u201d",
      "What to do with that personal fortune, nearly $170 billion, will eventually be in the hands of Buffett\u2019s three children, including would-be Berkshire chairman, Howard Buffett.",
      "Howard was designated in June along with his siblings as manager of Buffett\u2019s trust when he dies and he said that they will decide where to donate that money. Buffett has already given away billions, most notable more than $40 billion to the Gates Foundation started by Bill and Melinda French Gates.",
      "Howard, 70, has his own foundation through which he has donated billions to humanitarian and food security causes, including helping coffee farms in El Salvador and clearing landmines in Ukraine.",
      "Tributes to Buffett came tumbling in over the weekend praising his investment savvy and folksy management style.",

      "New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said he was awaiting more details of Trump\u2019s measures before commenting on them but would continue to pitch to filmmakers abroad, including in India\u2019s Bollywood. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an absolutely world class industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the best place to make movies, period, in the world.\u201d",
      "The Motion Picture Association, which represents major U.S. film studios and streaming services, didn\u2019t immediately respond to messages Sunday evening.",
      "The MPA\u2019s data shows how much Hollywood exports have dominated cinemas. According to the MPA, the American movies produced $22.6 billion in exports and $15.3 billion in trade surplus in 2023.",
      "Trump, a Republican, has made good on the \u201ctariff man\" label he gave himself years ago, slapping new taxes on goods made in countries around the globe. That includes a 145% tariff on Chinese goods and a 10% baseline tariff on goods from other countries, with even higher levies threatened.",
      "By unilaterally imposing tariffs, Trump has exerted extraordinary influence over the flow of commerce, creating political risks and pulling the market in different directions. There are tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum, with more imports, including pharmaceutical drugs, set to be subject to new tariffs in the weeks ahead.",
      "Trump has long voiced concern about movie production moving overseas.",
      "Shortly before he took office, he announced that he had tapped actors Mel Gibson, Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone to serve as \u201cspecial ambassadors\" to Hollywood to bring it \"BACK \u2014 BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE!\u201d",
      "U.S. film and television production has been hampered in recent years, with setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hollywood guild strikes of 2023 and the recent wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Overall production in the U.S. was down 26% last year compared with 2021, according to data from ProdPro, which tracks production.",
      "The group's annual survey of executives, which asked about preferred filming locations, found no location in the U.S. made the top five, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Toronto, the U.K., Vancouver, Central Europe and Australia came out on top, with California placing sixth, Georgia seventh, New Jersey eighth and New York ninth.",
      "The problem is especially acute in California. In the greater Los Angeles area, production last year was down 5.6% from 2023 according to FilmLA, second only to 2020, during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic. Last, October, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, proposed expanding California\u2019s Film & Television Tax Credit program to $750 million annually, up from $330 million.",
      "Other U.S. cities like Atlanta, New York, Chicago and San Francisco have also used aggressive tax incentives to lure film and TV productions. Those programs can take the form of cash grants, as in Texas, or tax credits, which Georgia and New Mexico offer.",
      "\u201cOther nations have been stealing the movie-making capabilities from the United States,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House on Sunday night after returning from a weekend in Florida. \u201cIf they\u2019re not willing to make a movie inside the United States we should have a tariff on movies that come in.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- Marvel Studios\u2019 \u201cThunderbolts\" opened with $76 million in domestic ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday, kicking off the summer box office with a solid No. 1 debut that fell shy of Marvel\u2019s more spectacular launches.",
      "All eyes had been on whether \u201cThunderbolts\u201d \u2014 a team-up of antihero rejects similar to \u201cAvengers\u201d \u2013 could restore the Walt Disney Co. superhero factory to the kind of box office performance the studio once enjoyed so regularly. The results \u2013 similar to the debuts of \u201cThe Eternals\u201d ($71 million) and \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp\u201d ($75 million) \u2014 suggested Marvel\u2019s malaise won\u2019t be so easy to snap out of.",
      "Some had expected a bigger opening for \u201cThunderbolts\u201d because of the film's good word-of-mouth. Unlike most recent MCU entries, reviews (88% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) have been excellent for \u201cThunderbolts,\u201d directed by Jake Schreier and starring Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Sebastian Stan. Audiences gave it an \u201cA-\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "That kind of response should power the movie to strong business in the coming weeks. Though bigger MCU films \u2014 including 2024\u2019s \u201cDeadpool vs. Wolverine\u201d (with a $211 million opening on the way to $1.34 billion worldwide) \u2014 have monopolized movie screens immediately, \u201cThunderbolts\u201d could gather steam more steadily. Or, it could go down as another example of Marvel struggling to rekindle its golden touch.",
      "Marvel spent about $180 million to produced the movie, which added $86.1 million in overseas sales. The film also teases the next MCU chapter, \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps,\u201d due out July 25.",
      "\u201cMarvel set the bar so high for so many years that a $76 million opening may seem to some like it should have done $100 million or something like that,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cThis is a great reset. They're hitting the reset with \u2018Thunderbolts.\" The great reviews and the word-of-mouth should hold it (in) good stead.\u201d",
      "The Walt Disney Co. also might not have expected such stout competition from Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners.\u201d The Warner Bros. release, which had led the box office the last two weeks, continued to hold remarkably well. In its third week, it grossed $33 million, a dip of only 28%.",
      "\u201cSinners,\u201d a 1932-set vampire movie about bootlegging brothers (both played by Michael B. Jordan) who open a juke joint in their Mississippi hometown, has proven a spring sensation in theaters. It has collected $179.7 million domestically and $236.7 million globally thus far.",
      "Warner Bros. also nabbed third place with \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d the smash-hit video game adaptation. In its fifth weekend, it rung up another $13.7 million to bring its North American gross to nearly $400 million. Worldwide, it has totaled $873.4 million. Warner Bros. added \u201cBlock Party Edition\u201d screenings over the weekend for a sing-along and \u201cmeme-along\u201d experience.

      "When Warren Buffett announced at his annual shareholder meeting that he is stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year, he elevated a 62-year-old Canadian executive named Greg Abel who has long been one of his top lieutenants",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- When Warren Buffett announced at his annual shareholder meeting Saturday that he is stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year, he elevated a low-key 62-year-old Canadian executive named Greg Abel who has long been one of his top lieutenants.",
      "For the past seven years, Abel has been overseeing Berkshire\u2019s BNSF railroad and its treat makers See\u2019s Candies and Dairy Queen along with dozens of other manufacturing and retail businesses that Buffett acquired over the years.",
      "He grew up in Canada as a hockey player and learned the value of hard work as he redeemed discarded bottles and worked for a small company filling fire extinguishers. Now he finds himself at the top of the food chain in the investment world.",
      "Berkshire confirmed Abel as Buffett\u2019s successor in 2021 after former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger let it slip at the annual meeting. Since then, Abel has largely remained in Buffett\u2019s shadow although shareholders have had a chance to get to know him a bit when he appeared alongside Buffett at the annual meetings and in interviews.",
      "Berkshire's board will now vote on whether to formally approve Abel as the new CEO to take over at the end of 2025. At the annual meeting in Omaha, Buffett said he expects that to occur by a unanimous vote.",
      "Abel will step forward to take responsibility for all of Berkshire\u2019s eclectic assortment of businesses with their nearly 400,000 employees and the conglomerate\u2019s massive stock portfolio. Buffett and members of Berkshire\u2019s board who for years have devoted much of their time to finding Buffett\u2019s successor have praised Abel\u2019s brilliance and knack for understanding all kinds of businesses.",
      "Buffett once said Berkshire is \u201cso damn lucky\u201d to have Abel ready to take over, but he will have trouble coming close to Buffett\u2019s remarkable track record of outpacing the market. Whereas Buffett grew Berkshire over the decades by making well-timed deals and stock investments at attractive prices, Berkshire\u2019s massive size has made it that much harder lately to find anything big enough to change the conglomerate\u2019s bottom line.",
      "Abel has big shoes to fill, but no one expects him to match the accomplishments of Buffett that made him a billionaire many times over and one of the wealthiest investors of the past century. Longtime Berkshire board member Ron Olson said two days before the announcement that he believed Abel was ready to take over.",
      "\u201cIs he another Warren Buffett? No, there is no other Warren Buffett that I know. But he has so many of the fundamentals of Warren,\u201d Olson said. \u201cHe is for sure high integrity. He is a hard worker. He is a strategic thinker.\"",
      "Buffett has said for years that Abel\u2019s main job when he becomes CEO will be to preserve Berkshire\u2019s unique decentralized culture built on independence, integrity and trust. In fact, Munger\u2019s comment that gave away Abel\u2019s future role was that \u201cGreg will keep the culture.\u201d",
      "Executives at a diverse mix of Berkshire subsidiaries, including sneaker maker Brooks Running, flooring giant Shaw and Borsheims jewelry have said they all turn to Abel whenever they face tough questions in their businesses related to strategy or operating details, and he\u2019s always available when they need him though he will challenge them.",
      "\u201cWhen I think about Greg, he not only has high business acumen, but he has really high business instincts,\u201d Dairy Queen CEO Troy Bader said Friday. \u201cThe intuition is really important. And, you know, Warren has that intuition, but Greg has a lot of it as well.\"",
      "Abel has never done many interviews, though he put his detailed business knowledge on display at the Berkshire meetings when discussing utilities and the railroad. But he did offer a glimpse into his background to the Horatio Alger Association when that group honored him in 2018.",
      "Abel's family-oriented upbringing in Edmonton, Alberta, and lessons in hard work and perseverance were similar to what Buffett learned while working in his grandfather\u2019s Omaha grocery store as a kid.",
      "\u201cI think hard work leads to good outcomes. In my schooling, in sports, and in my business positions, I learned that if I put in a lot of work and was well-prepared, then success would be more likely,\u201d Abel said in 2018.",
      "Abel lives about two hours from Buffett\u2019s hometown in Des Moines, Iowa, where he has led Berkshire Hathaway Energy since 2011 and helped coach his kids\u2019 hockey and soccer teams. He is expected to continue living there because Berkshire is so decentralized that there is little reason to move to its Omaha headquarters. Buffett only had a couple dozen people working in his office as he spent his days reading business reports and making the occasional phone call.",

      "Flights at Newark Liberty International Airport face long delays, cancellations.",
      "NEW YORK -- Passengers with flights to or from Newark Liberty International Airport encountered long delays and cancellations Saturday due to an air traffic controller shortage, a nationwide problem the Trump administration has pledged to fix.",
      "The busy airport outside New York City experienced disruptions all week. Faulting the Federal Aviation Administration's alleged failure to address \u201clong-simmering\u201d challenges related to the air-traffic control system, United Airlines cut 35 daily flights from its Newark schedule starting Saturday.",
      "United CEO Scott Kirby said the technology used to manage planes at the New Jersey airport failed more than once in recent days. The flight delays, cancellations and diversions the equipment problems caused were compounded when more than one-fifth of Newark's traffic controllers \u201cwalked off the job,\u201d he said.",
      "\"This particular air traffic control facility has been chronically understaffed for years and without these controllers, it\u2019s now clear \u2014 and the FAA tells us \u2014 that Newark airport cannot handle the number of planes that are scheduled to operate there in the weeks and months ahead,\" Kirby wrote in a letter to customers.",
      "Airport status reports from the FAA data said staffing issues were causing average delays of nearly two hours for some arriving flights at Newark, and average delays of 45 minutes for departures.",
      "Two days earlier, Newark Liberty International Airport pointed to both staffing issues and \u201cconstruction\u201d when warning travelers about delays.",
      "The Trump administration says it\u2019s been trying to \u201csupercharge\u201d  the air traffic controller workforce and make moves to address the nation's shortage of controllers. The U.S. transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, on Thursday announced a program to recruit new controllers and give existing ones incentives not to retire.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, a workers\u2019 union, said at the time that those moves could help address staffing shortages, but it also said the system is \u201c long overdue for technology and infrastructure upgrades.\u201d",
      "Duffy said on Friday that he visited with \u201cour hard working air traffic controllers as we work to fix these equipment outages caused by outdated technology.\u201d",
      "United's decision to pare back its flight schedule in Newark come at an already uncertain time for U.S. airlines. Potential customers across the industry are reconsidering whether to fly for work or for vacation given all the unknowns about what President Donald Trump's trade war will do to the economy.",
      "Uncertainty is so high that United recently made the unusual move to offer two separate forecasts for how it could perform financially this year: one if there were a recession, and one if not.",
      "From Newark, United flies to 76 U.S. cities and 81 international destinations.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Billionaire Warren Buffett shocked an arena full of shareholders Saturday by announcing that he will retire at the end of the year, bringing the curtain down on a six-decade run leading Berkshire Hathaway that made him the most influential investor in the world.",
      "Buffett said he will recommend to Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s board on Sunday that Vice Chairman Greg Abel should replace him.",
      "\u201cI think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end,\u201d Buffett said.",
      "Abel has been Buffett's designated successor for years, and he already manages all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses. But it was always assumed that he would not take over until after Buffett's death. Previously the 94-year-old Buffett always said he had no plans to retire.",
      "Buffett announced the news at the end of a five-hour question and answer period without taking any questions about it. He said the only board members who knew this was coming were his two children, Howard and Susie Buffett. Abel, who was sitting next to Buffett on stage, had no warning.",
      "Abel returned an hour later without Buffett to conduct the company's formal business meeting, and he responded to the news.",
      "\u201cI just want to say I couldn\u2019t be more humbled and honored to be part of Berkshire as we go forward,\u201d Abel said.",
      "Many investors have said they believe Abel will do a good job running Berkshire, but it remains to be seen how good he will be at investing Berkshire's cash. Buffett endorsed him Saturday by pledging to keep his fortune invested in the company.",
      "\u201cI have no intention \u2014 zero \u2014 of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. I will give it away eventually,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cThe decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg\u2019s management than mine.\u201d",
      "Thousands of investors in the Omaha arena gave Buffett a prolonged standing ovation after his announcement in recognition of his 60 years leading the company.",
      "During that period Berkshire nearly doubled the returns of the S&P 500, with a 19.9% compounded annual growth rate compared with the index\u2019s 10.4% gain.",
      "Buffett had such a devoted following among investors that markets would move when his investments were disclosed because so many people copied him.",
      "CFRA research analyst Cathy Seifert said it had to be hard for Buffett to decide to step down.",
      "\u201cThis was probably a very tough decision for him, but better to leave on your own terms,\u201d Seifert said. \u201cI think there will be an effort at maintaining a \u2018business as usual\u2019 environment at Berkshire. That is still to be determined.\u201d",
      "In many respects, Abel has already been running much of the company for years. But he hasn't been managing Berkshire's insurance operations or deciding where to invest all of its cash. He will now take those tasks on, but Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will remain to help oversee the insurance companies.",
      "Investment manager Omar Malik of Hosking Partners in London said before Buffett\u2019s announcement that he wasn\u2019t worried about Berkshire\u2019s future under Abel.",
      "\u201cNot really (worried). He\u2019s had such a long time alongside Warren and a chance to know the businesses,\u201d Malik said about Abel. \"The question is will he allocate capital as dynamically as Warren? And the answer is no. But I think he\u2019ll do a fine job with the support of the others.\u201d",
      "Cole Smead of Smead Capital Management said he wasn't surprised Buffett is stepping down after watching him Saturday because the 94-year-old wasn't as sharp as in past years. At one point, he made a basic math mistake in one of his answers. At other points, he got off track while telling stories about Berkshire and his investing without answering the question he was asked.",
      "Abel is well regarded by Berkshire's managers and Buffett has praised his business acumen for years. But he will have a hard time matching Buffett's legendary performance, and since he doesn't control 30% of Berkshire's stock like Buffett does, he won't have as much leeway.",
      "\u201cI think the challenge he\u2019s going to have is if anyone is going to give him Buffett or (former Vice Chairman Charlie) Munger\u2019s pass card? Not a chance in God\u2019s name,\" Smead said. Buffett always enjoyed a devoted following among shareholders.",
      "Buffett has said that Abel might even be a more hands-on manager than he is and get more out of Berkshire\u2019s companies. Managers within the company say they have to be well prepared before talking to Abel because they know he will ask tough questions.",
      "Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management, said he never thought he would see Buffett retire.",
      "\u201cI didn't think he would retire while his mind is still working so well, nor did I think it'd happen at the annual meeting,\u201d Check said. \u201cBut overall I'm very happy for him.\u201d",
      "Earlier Saturday, Buffett warned of dire global consequences from President Donald Trump's tariffs while telling the thousands of investors gathered at his annual meeting that \u201ctrade should not be a weapon\u201d but \"there's no question that trade can be an act of war.\u201d",
      "Buffett said Trump's trade policies have raised the risk of global instability by angering the rest of the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don\u2019t like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done,\u201d Buffett said as he addressed the topic on everyone's mind at the start of the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting.",
      "While Buffett said it is best for trade to be balanced between countries, he doesn't think Trump is going about it the right way with his widespread tariffs. He said the world will be safer if more countries are prosperous.",
      "Buffett said he just doesn't see many attractively priced investments that he understands these days, so Berkshire is sitting on $347.7 billion in cash, but he predicted that one day Berkshire will be \u201cbombarded with opportunities that we will be glad we have the cash for.\u201d",
      "Buffett said the recent turmoil in the markets that generated headlines after Trump's tariff announcement last month \u201cis really nothing.\u201d He dismissed the recent drop as relatively small. He cited when the Dow Jones industrial average went from 240 on the day he was born in 1930 down to 41 during the Great Depression as a truly significant drop in the markets. Currently the Dow Jones Industrial Average sits at 41,317.43.",
      "\u201cThis has not been a dramatic bear market or anything of the sort,\" he said.",
      "Buffett said he hasn't bought back any of Berkshire's shares this year either because they don't seem to be a bargain either.",
      "Investor Chris Bloomstran, who is president of Semper Augustus Investments Group, told the Gabelli investment conference Friday that a financial crisis might be the best thing for Berkshire because it would create opportunities to invest at attractive prices.",
      "\u201cBerkshire needs a crisis. I mean Berkshire thrives in crisis,\u201d Bloomstran said.",
      "The meeting attracts some 40,000 people every year who want to hear from Buffett, including some celebrities and well-known investors. This year, Hillary Rodham Clinton also attended. Clinton was the last candidate Buffett backed publicly because he has shied away from politics and any controversial topic in recent years for fear of hurting Berkshire\u2019s businesses.",
      "One investor even camped outside the arena overnight to be first in line.",
      "Devan Bisher, 72, said he has faith in Berkshire's future and does not plan to sell the stock he started buying in the 1980s.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a good train to ride,\u201d Bisher said, \u201cand I\u2019m going to stay with it.\u201d",

      "Steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs will indefinitely idle three steel plants this summer",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs will indefinitely idle three steel plants this summer, saying Friday that it is being buffeted by sluggish demand and pricing for some products, including high carbon steel sheets.",
      "The company said the idling of two Pennsylvania plants, one in Steelton and one in Conshohocken, and one in Riverdale, Illinois, is due to \u201cinsufficient demand and pricing\u201d and nothing to do with President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "\u201cThese temporary, indefinite idles are a necessary response to insufficient demand and pricing for the products the affected facilities produce, including rail, specialty plate, and high-carbon sheet; all of which fall outside of Cliffs\u2019 core business focus,\u201d the company said.",
      "The idlings will be indefinite, and start around June 30, at the end of a 60-day notice period required by federal law. About 950 workers will be out of work during the shutdowns, Cleveland Cliffs said.",
      "It said its flat-rolled steel production levels will not be affected.",
      "Cleveland Cliffs in recent weeks had announced that it will idle or partially idle two iron ore mines in Minnesota, affecting 630 workers. It also said in March that it will idle a steel plant in Dearborn, Michigan, affecting about 600 workers, citing \u201cweak automotive production in the United States.\"",
      "\u201cWe believe that, once President Trump\u2019s policies take full effect and automotive production is re-shored, we should be able to resume steel production at Dearborn,\u201d it said.",
      "Cleveland Cliffs did say, however, that it plans to resume operation at its blast furnace in Cleveland, which was idled last year.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve will likely keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, despite harsh criticism from President Donald Trump and his demand that the Fed reduce borrowing costs",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve will likely keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, despite weeks of harsh criticism and demands from President Donald Trump that the Fed reduce borrowing costs.",
      "After causing a sharp drop in financial markets two weeks ago by saying he could fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Trump subsequently backed off and said he had no intention of doing so. Still, he and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have said the Fed should cut rates.",
      "They argue that inflation has steadily cooled and high borrowing costs are no longer needed to restrain price increases. The Fed sharply ramped up its short-term rate in 2022 and 2023 as pandemic-era inflation spiked.",
      "Separately, Elon Musk, the head of Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, last Wednesday suggested that DOGE should look more closely at the Fed's spending on its facilities.",
      "The heightened scrutiny shows that even as the Trump administration backs off its threats to fire Powell, the Fed is still subject to unusually sharp political pressures, despite its status as an independent agency.",
      "Even so, the Fed will almost certainly leave its key rate unchanged at about 4.3% when it meets Tuesday and Wednesday. Powell and many of the other 18 officials that sit on the Fed's rate-setting committee have said they want to see how Trump's tariffs affect the economy before making any moves.",
      "Trump, however, on Friday said on the social media platform Truth Social that there is \u201cNO INFLATION\u201d and claimed that grocery and egg prices have fallen, and that gas has dropped to $1.98 a gallon.",
      "That's not entirely true: Grocery prices have jumped 0.5% in two of the past three months and are up 2.4% from a year ago. Gas and oil prices have declined \u2014 gas costs are down 10% from a year ago \u2014 continuing a longer-running trend that has continued in part because of fears the economy will weaken. Still, AAA says gas prices nationwide average $3.18 a gallon.",
      "Inflation did drop noticeably in March, an encouraging sign, though in the first three months of the year it was 3.6%, according to the Fed's preferred gauge, well above its 2% target.",
      "Without tariffs, economists say it's possible the Fed would soon reduce its benchmark rate, because it is currently at a level intended to slow borrowing and spending and cool inflation. Yet the Fed can't now cut rates with Trump's broad tariffs likely to raise prices in the coming months.",
      "Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY, said that the Fed is \u201cscarred\u201d by what happened in 2021, when prices rose amid supply snarls and Powell and other Fed officials said the increase would likely be \u201ctransitory.\u201d Instead, inflation soared to a peak of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "This time they will be more cautious, he said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a Fed that is going to have to wait for evidence and be slow to adjust on that evidence,\u201d Reinhart said.",
      "Plus, Trump's badgering of Powell makes it harder for the Fed chair to cut rates because doing so anytime soon would be seen as knuckling under to the White House, said Preston Mui, an economist at Employ America.",
      "\u201cYou could imagine a world where there isn\u2019t pressure from the Trump administration and they cut rates ... sooner, because they feel comfortable making the argument that they're doing so because of the data,\u201d he said.",
      "For his part, Powell said last month that tariffs would likely push up inflation and slow the economy, a tricky combination for the Fed. The central bank would typically raise rates \u2014 or at least keep them elevated \u2014 to fight inflation, while it would cut them to spur the economy if unemployment rose.",
      "Powell has said that the impact of the tariffs on inflation could be temporary \u2014 a one-time price increase \u2014 but most recently said it \u201ccould also be more persistent.\u201d That suggests that Powell will want to wait, potentially for months, to ensure tariffs don't sustainably raise inflation before considering a rate cut.",
      "Some economists forecast the Fed won't cut rates until its September meeting, or even later.",
      "Yet Fed officials could move sooner if the tariffs hit the economy hard enough to cause layoffs and push up unemployment. Wall Street investors appear to expect such an outcome \u2014 they project that the first cut will occur in July, according to futures pricing.",
      "Separately, Musk criticized the Fed Wednesday for spending $2.5 billion on an extensive renovation of two of its buildings in Washington, D.C.",
      "\u201cSince at the end of the day, this is all taxpayer money, we should certainly look to see if indeed the Federal Reserve is spending $2.5 billion on their interior designer,\u201d Musk said. \u201cThat\u2019s an eyebrow raiser.\u201d",
      "Fed officials acknowledge that the cost of the renovations have risen as prices for building materials and labor have spiked amid the post-pandemic inflation. And former Fed officials, speaking on background, say that local regulations forced the Fed to do more of the expansion underground, rather than making the buildings taller, which added to the cost.",
      "Meanwhile, Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and a potential candidate to replace Powell as chair when Powell's term expires next year, said recently that the Fed has attracted greater scrutiny because of its failure to keep prices in check.",
      "\u201cThe Fed's current wounds are largely self-inflicted,\u201d he said in a speech during an International Monetary Fund conference in late April, in which he also slammed the Fed for participating in a global forum on climate change. \u201cA strategic reset is necessary to mitigate losses of credibility, changes in standing, and most important, worse economic outcomes for our fellow citizens.\u201d",
      "Powell, for his part, said last month that \u201cFed independence is very widely understood and supported in Washington, in Congress, where it really matters.\u201d",

      "Tesla sales plunged by more than half last month in several European countries in a sign that Elon Musk could struggle to revive the company after he shifts from his Washington work to running the automaker again",
      "NEW YORK -- Tesla sales plunged by more than half last month in several European countries in a sign that Elon Musk could struggle to revive the company after he shifts from his Washington work to running the automaker again.",
      "Tesla sales collapsed in April by more than two-thirds from a year earlier in Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark, according to auto groups and government agencies Friday. Sales at the Austin, Texas, company dropped by 59% in France and 38% in Norway.",
      "The countries are not major drivers of sales overall, but they are the first to report April results and thus a foretaste of possible trouble elsewhere as Tesla reels from protests and boycotts over Musk wading into politics.",
      "In Germany, where he told voters their country was lost if they didn't vote for a candidate widely derided for her extreme views, sales plunged 62% in the first three months this year. German sales for April are not out yet.",
      "Financial analysts covering Tesla are worried about the Musk backlash but caution it's not clear exactly how much to blame politics for the hit. Other factors suppressing sales include Tesla's aging model lineup and new offerings from rival electric vehicles makers, such as China BYD.",
      "Tesla also had to shut down factories for several weeks this year while upgrading its best selling Model Y sport utility vehicle, pinching supply. And the company is still waiting for European regulators to approve its partial self-driving features in its cars, a big selling point in the U.S. and China.",
      "\u201cWe could see sales come back once they get it,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein, though he added about the April figures, \u201cIt's never a good thing when you have large sales declines like this.\u201d",
      "The disappointing numbers come a little over a week since Musk told investors on a first-quarter conference call that he would be stepping back from his work in Washington as President Donald Trump's chain-saw wielding cost-cutting czar. Musk has shut down whole government departments as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and thrown tens of thousands of public workers out of their jobs.",
      "On the call, Musk said he would be spending only one or two days a week on DOGE work starting in May, acceding to demands that he refocus on his job as Tesla's chief executive officer.",
      "The stock has been rising since that announcement despite crumbling financial figures. Profits in the first quarter fell 71%.",
      "The sales hit in April was the worst in Sweden, where Mobility Sweden said they fell 81%. That was followed by a 74% plunge in the Netherlands and a 67% drop in Denmark, according to the Dutch trade association BOVAG and Mobility Denmark respectively.",
      "The Norwegian Road Traffic Information Council reported a 38% drop in that country.",
      "One bright spot: Tesla was able to sell more cars in Italy, according to an Italian Ministry of Infrastructure and Transportation report, registering a 3% gain for the month.",

    "story": [
      "Guacamole has been spared from tariffs for now",
      "Guacamole has been spared from tariffs for now. But salsa may not be so lucky.",
      "While threatened tariffs on Mexican avocados have been put on pause, the U.S. government plans to put a nearly 21% duty on fresh Mexican tomatoes starting July 14. A duty \u2014 like a tariff \u2014 is a tax on imports, and this one will impact the 4 billion pounds of tomatoes the U.S. imports from Mexico each year.",
      "Proponents say the duty will help rebuild the shrinking U.S. tomato industry and ensure that produce eaten in the U.S. is also grown there. Mexico currently supplies around 70% of U.S. tomato market, up from 30% two decades ago, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange, a trade group.",
      "\u201cUnless we even the playing field in terms of fair pricing, you\u2019re not going to have a domestic industry for fresh tomatoes in the very near future,\u201d said Robert Guenther, the executive vice president of the Florida Tomato Exchange. Florida and California are the top U.S. producers of tomatoes, but most of California\u2019s crop is turned into sauces and other products.",
      "Opponents say the duty will make fresh tomatoes more expensive for U.S. buyers. NatureSweet, a San Antonio-based company that grows tomatoes in Mexico as well as the U.S., said it will be paying millions of dollars each month in duties if the decision isn\u2019t reversed.",
      "\u201cWe will look for ways to adapt or streamline our operations, but the truth is, we are always doing that so we run an efficient business already,\u201d said Skip Hulett, NatureSweet\u2019s chief legal officer. \u201cProduce is not a large-margin business. We\u2019re determining what portion of the cost we could absorb, but these added costs will most certainly need to be passed on to the consumer.\u201d",
      "Tim Richards, a professor at the Morrison School of Agribusiness at Arizona State University, expects U.S. retail prices for tomatoes to rise by around 10.5% if the tariffs go through.",
      "Mexico\u2019s government said last month it was convinced it could negotiate over the issue. But if the duty goes into effect, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum hinted that Mexico could take similar action against imported chicken and pork legs from the U.S.",
      "The tug-of-war over tomatoes has a long history. In 1996, shortly after the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect, the U.S. Department of Commerce investigated allegations that Mexico was exporting tomatoes to the U.S. at artificially low prices, a practice known as dumping.",
      "The U.S. government agreed to suspend the investigation if Mexico met certain rules, including selling its tomatoes at a minimum price. Since then, the agreement has been subject to periodic reviews, but the two sides have always reached an agreement that avoided duties.",
      "But last month, the Commerce Department announced its withdrawal from the latest agreement, saying it has been \u201cflooded with comments\u201d from U.S. tomato growers who want better protection from Mexican imports.",
      "Guenther, of the Florida Tomato Exchange, said even though Mexican exporters are required to charge a minimum price, shipments are only spot-checked, so exporters can get around that. But more generally, Mexico hurts the U.S. industry because it costs 40% to 50% less to grow tomatoes there, Guenther said. Land is cheaper, labor is cheaper and inputs like seeds and fertilizer cost less, he said.",
      "Tomatoes are a labor-intensive crop, Guenther said, and the U.S. industry typically relies on immigrant workers through the H-2A visa program. That program required farmers to pay workers an average of $16.98 per hour last year, an amount that has jumped as labor has become harder to find. Richards estimates that workers on Mexican tomato farms earn about one-tenth that rate.",
      "NatureSweet acknowledges that it\u2019s more cost-effective to grow tomatoes in Mexico, but says climate is one of the biggest reasons. The company\u2019s Mexican greenhouses don\u2019t need lighting, heating or cooling systems because of the year-round weather conditions.",
      "\u201cYou can relocate some industries, but you can\u2019t relocate climate agriculture,\u201d Hulett said.",
      "Lance Jungmeyer, the president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, which represents importers of Mexican tomatoes, said Florida doesn\u2019t produce the vine-ripened tomatoes that U.S. consumers increasingly favor. Florida tomatoes are picked when they\u2019re green and shipped to warehouses to ripen, he said.",
      "\u201cFlorida doesn\u2019t grow the kinds of specialty tomatoes that have taken off, but they want to get protection,\u201d Jungmeyer said. \u201cTheir market share is dropping for reasons of their own choice.\u201d",
      "Guenther disagrees. \u201cIf you put a Florida tomato up against a Mexican tomato, I think it would do very well in taste test,\u201d he said.",
      "Adrian Burciaga, co-owner of Don Artemio, an upscale Mexican restaurant in Fort Worth, Texas, wouldn\u2019t want to switch to a U.S. producer. He compares it to fine wine; if he wants a good cabernet sauvignon, he gets it from Napa, California, but if he wants a good tomato that remind him of his childhood, he gets it from Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe know the flavors they are going to bring to the salsas and moles. We don\u2019t want to compromise flavors,\u201d Burciaga said.",
      "Burciaga said his restaurant uses 300 to 400 pounds of Roma tomatoes from Mexico every week. He currently pays $19 for a 25-pound crate of tomatoes. He doesn\u2019t relish paying the additional cost, but he feels he has no choice.",
      "Burciaga said the tomato duty and the threat of other tariffs against Mexico \u2013 which were put in place in February but then paused \u2013 are making it difficult to run his business.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty part concerns us. A small or medium restaurant budgets things out. We know in advance that in six months things will increase, so we\u2019re able to adjust,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know these things in advance.

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday to clear the way for Elon Musk \u2019s Department of Government Efficiency to access Social Security systems containing personal data on millions of Americans.",
      "The emergency appeal is the first in a string of applications to the high court involving DOGE's swift-moving work across the federal government.",
      "It comes after a judge in Maryland restricted the team's access to Social Security under federal privacy laws. The agency holds personal records on nearly everyone in the country, including school records, bank details, salary information and medical and mental health records for disability recipients, according to court documents.",
      "The government says the team needs access to target waste in the federal government. Musk, now preparing to step back from his work with DOGE, has been focused on Social Security as an alleged hotbed of fraud. The billionaire entrepreneur has described it as a \u201c Ponzi scheme \u201d and insisted that reducing waste in the program is an important way to cut government spending.",
      "Solicitor General John Sauer argued Friday that the judge\u2019s restrictions disrupt DOGE\u2019s important work and inappropriately interfere with executive-branch decisions. \u201cLeft undisturbed, this preliminary injunction will only invite further judicial incursions into internal agency decision-making,\u201d he wrote.",
      "He asked the justices to block the order from U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander in Maryland as the lawsuit plays out.",
      "An appeals court previously refused to immediately to lift the block on DOGE access, though it split along ideological lines. Conservative judges in the minority said there\u2019s no evidence that the team has done any \u201ctargeted snooping\u201d or exposed personal information.",
      "The lawsuit was originally filed by a group of labor unions and retirees represented by the group Democracy Forward. The Supreme Court asked them for a response to the administration's appeal by May 12.",
      "More than two dozen lawsuits have been filed over DOGE's work, which has included deep cuts at federal agencies and large-scale layoffs.",
      "Hollander found that DOGE's efforts at Social Security amounted to a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d based on \u201clittle more than suspicion\u201d of fraud.",
      "Her order does allow staffers to access data that has been made anonymous, but the Trump administration has said DOGE can't work effectively with those restrictions.",
      "Elizabeth Laird with the nonprofit group Center for Democracy and Technology said wide-ranging access to sensitive personal data poses a serious threat. \u201cIf DOGE gets a hold of this information, it opens the floodgates on a host of potential harms. It also normalizes a very dangerous practice for other federal agencies,\u201d she said.",
      "The nation's court system has been ground zero for pushback to President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping conservative agenda, with about 200 lawsuits filed challenging policies on everything from immigration to education to mass layoffs of federal workers.",
      "Among those that have reached the Supreme Court so far, the justices have handed down some largely procedural rulings siding with the administration but have rejected the government\u2019s broad arguments in other cases.",

      "Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty is among the U.S. government-funded media services that deliver news in overseas markets. President Donald Trump's administration, claiming they are wasteful and promote a liberal point of view, is trying to choke off their funding.",

    "story": [
      "The White House plans to unveil President Donald Trump\u2019s 2026 budget, his first since returning to power",
      "WASHINGTON -- The White House is planning on Friday to unveil President Donald Trump's 2026 budget, a sweeping framework that is expected to propose steep reductions, if not a wholesale zeroing out, of various federal programs as part of his administration's priorities.",
      "Budgets do not become law but serve as a touchstone for the upcoming fiscal year debates. Often considered a statement of values, this first budget since Trump's return to the White House carries the added weight of defining the Republican president's second-term pursuits, alongside his party in Congress.",
      "The White House's Office of Management and Budget, headed by Russell Vought, a chief architect of Project 2025, confirmed Friday's planned release. It is expected to be the so-called \u201cskinny\u201d version of topline numbers, with more details to come.",
      "\u201cDetails soon,\u201d Vought said during a Cabinet meeting this week at the White House.",
      "The nation's estimated $7 trillion-plus federal budget has been growing steadily, with annual deficits fast approaching $2 trillion and the annual interest on the debt almost $1 trillion. That's thanks mostly to the spike in emergency COVID-19 pandemic spending, changes in the tax code and climbing costs of Medicare, Medicaid and other programs, largely to cover the nation's health needs as people age. The nation's debt load, at $36 trillion, is ballooning.",
      "This year's presidential budget request is expected to show deep reductions in spending, some reflective of the cuts already made by Trump's actions and adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, including the slashing of the government workforce. It also could point to potential new revenue streams, possibly from Trump's tariffs program.",
      "Democrats are prepared to lambast Trump's budget as further evidence that the Republican administration is intent on gutting government programs that Americans depend on.",
      "It comes as Congress is already deep into the slog of drafting of Trump's big bill of tax breaks, spending cuts and bolstered funds for the administration's mass deportation effort \u2014 a package that, unlike the budget, would actually carry the force of law.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, who spoke with Trump multiple times this week, is racing to have the president's \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d approved by the House by Memorial Day and sent on to the Senate.",
      "\u201cWe had a very productive and encouraging meeting at the White House this morning, and the remaining pieces of \u2018The One, Big Beautiful Bill!\u2019 are coming together very well,\" Johnson, R-La., said in a statement after Thursday's meeting with Trump and various committee chairmen.",
      "But there remain deep differences among the Republicans, who are trying to pass that big bill over the objections of Democrats.",
      "\"We are awaiting some final calculations on a few of the tax components, and we expect to be able to complete that work on a very aggressive schedule,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Meantime, Cabinet officials are expected to start making the trek to Capitol Hill to testify about their various requests in the president's budget.",
      "It's Congress, under its constitutional powers, that decides the spending plans, approves the bills that authorize federal programs and funds them through the appropriations process. Often, that system breaks down, forcing lawmakers to pass stopgap spending bills to keep the government funded and avoid federal shutdowns.",
      "Vought is also expected on Capitol Hill in the weeks ahead as the Trump administration presses its case to Congress for funds.",
      "Among the more skilled conservative budget hands in Washington, Vought has charted a career toward this moment. He served during the first Trump administration in the same role and, for Project 2025, wrote an extensive chapter about the remaking of the federal government.",
      "Vought has separately been preparing a $9 billion package that would gut current 2025 funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which involves Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. Trump signed an executive order late Thursday that instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal agencies to cease funding for PBS and NPR.",
      "Vought has said that package of so-called budget rescissions would be a first of potentially more, as the Trump administration tests the appetite in Congress for lawmakers to go on record and vote to roll back the money.",

      "European Union privacy watchdogs have fined TikTok 530 million euros",
      "LONDON -- European Union privacy watchdogs fined TikTok 530 million euros ($600 million) on Friday after a four-year investigation found that the video sharing app's data transfers to China breached the EU's strict data privacy rules.",
      "Ireland's Data Protection Commission also sanctioned TikTok for not being transparent with users about where their personal data was being sent and ordered the company to comply with the rules within six months.",
      "The Irish national watchdog serves as TikTok's lead data privacy regulator in the 27-nation EU because the company's European headquarters is based in Dublin.",
      "\u201cTikTok failed to verify, guarantee and demonstrate that the personal data of (European) users, remotely accessed by staff in China, was afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the EU,\u201d Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said in a statement.",
      "TikTok said it disagreed with the decision and plans to appeal.",
      "The company said in a blog post that the decision focuses on a \u201cselect period\u201d ending in May 2023, before it embarked on a data localization project called Project Clover that involved building three data centers in Europe.",
      "\u201cThe facts are that Project Clover has some of the most stringent data protections anywhere in the industry, including unprecedented independent oversight by NCC Group, a leading European cybersecurity firm,\" said Christine Grahn, TikTok's European head of public policy and government relations. \u201cThe decision fails to fully consider these considerable data security measures.\u201d",
      "TikTok, whose parent company ByteDance is based in China, has been under scrutiny in Europe over how it handles personal information of its users amid concerns from Western officials that it poses a security risk over user data sent to China. In 2023, the watchdog fined the company hundreds of millions of euros in a separate child privacy investigation.",
      "The Irish watchdog said its investigation found that TikTok failed to address \u201cpotential access by Chinese authorities\u201d to European users' personal data under Chinese laws on anti-terrorism, counter-espionage, cybersecurity and national intelligence that were identified as \u2018materially diverging\u2019 from EU standards.\u201d",
      "Grahn said TikTok has \u201chas never received a request for European user data from the Chinese authorities, and has never provided European user data to them.\u201d",
      "Under the EU rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, European user data can only be transferred outside of the bloc if there are safeguards in place to ensure the same level of protection.",
      "The investigation, which opened in September 2021, also found that TikTok's privacy policy at the time did not name third countries, including China, where user data was transferred. The watchdog said the policy, which has since been updated, failed to explain that data processing involved \u201cremote access to personal data stored in Singapore and the United States by personnel based in China.\u201d",
      "TikTok faces further scrutiny from the Irish regulator, which said that the company had provided inaccurate information to throughout the inquiry by saying that it didn't store European user data on Chinese servers. It wasn't until April that it informed the regulator that it discovered in February that some data had in fact been stored on Chinese servers.",
      "Doyle said that the watchdog is taking the recent developments \u201cvery seriously\" and \u201cconsidering what further regulatory action may be warranted.\u201d",

      "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s massive holdings of U.S. Treasurys can be \u201ca card on the table\u201d in negotiations over tariffs with the Trump administration, Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said Friday.",
      "\u201cIt does exist as a card, but I think whether we choose to use it or not would be a separate decision,\u201d Kato said during a news show on national broadcaster TV Tokyo.",
      "Kato did not elaborate and he did not say Japan would step up sales of its holdings of U.S. government bonds as part of its talks over President Donald Trump's tariffs on exports from Japan.",
      "Earlier, Japanese officials including Kato had ruled out such an option.",
      "Japan is the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt, at $1.13 trillion as of late February. China, also at odds with the Trump administration over trade and tariffs, is the second largest foreign investor in Treasurys.",
      "Kato stressed that various factors would be on the negotiating table with Trump, implying that a promise not to sell Treasurys could help coax Washington into an agreement favorable for Japan.",
      "Trump has disrupted decades of American trade policies, including with key security allies like Japan, by i mposing big import taxes, or tariffs, on a wide range of products.",
      "A team of Japanese officials was in Washington this week for talks on the tariffs.",
      "The U.S. is due to soon begin imposing a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts, as well as an overall 10% baseline tariff. The bigger tariffs will hurt at a time when Japanese economic growth is weakening.",
      "Asian holdings of Treasurys have remained relatively steady in recent years, according to the most recent figures.",
      "But some analysts worry China or other governments could liquidate their U.S. Treasury holdings as trade tensions escalate.",

      "An attorney in the $2.8 billion legal case reshaping college sports said Monday he thinks \u201cthe agreement we will reach with the NCAA will solve the judge's concerns\u201d over roster limits that have delayed final approval.",
      "Steve Berman, co-lead counsel for the defendants, told The Associated Press that all is on track to file paperwork by Wednesday, which is U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken's deadline for addressing concerns that prevented her from granting approval to the deal last month.",
      "Berman said he created a chart listing the several dozen athletes who lodged objections to the agreement based on roster limits. He said he thinks almost every one will be offered a solution.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still negotiating, and I\u2019m confident that everyone who lost a roster spot will have a chance to get a spot back,\u201d he said.",
      "He did not go into detail about whether those spots would be on their previous teams or new ones.",
      "NCAA vice president of external affairs Tim Buckley said the NCAA would not comment on the litigation while negotiations are ongoing.",
      "Wilken looked favorably on other key components of the settlement \u2014 namely, the up to $20.5 million some schools can pay their athletes for name, image likeness (NIL) deals and the nearly $2.8 billion in back pay that will go to players who said the NCAA and five biggest conferences wrongly kept them from earning NIL money.",
      "But she asked lawyers to rework the part of the deal that will replace scholarship limits with roster limits. It's a proposal that could make more overall scholarship money available but could cost thousands of athletes their spots on rosters in moves that began shortly after Wilken gave preliminary approval to the deal last fall.",
      "The NCAA's first response to Wilken's request \u2014 which included the idea of \u201cgrandfathering in\u201d current players to their roster spots \u2014 was to change nothing, arguing that undoing roster moves already in play would create more turmoil in an already chaotic process.",
      "Wilken wasn't moved, saying in her April 24 order that \u201cany disruption that may occur is a problem of Defendants\u2019 and NCAA members schools\u2019 own making.\u201d",
      "Berman acknowledged that the objectors likely wouldn't approve of the new deal being worked on.",
      "\u201cBut I don't think it's going to be a big deal,\u201d he said, because it is designed to find roster spots for virtually all the individual athletes who objected.",
      "Berman also criticized Nick Saban after reports emerged that the retired Alabama football coach was urging President Donald Trump to undo damage he says has been caused by all the money flowing into college sports.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported Trump is considering an executive order that would call for some sort of structure behind NIL compensation now going toward players who are now able to move more freely between schools.",
      "Berman said he believes an executive order would be subject to lawsuits \u201clike there are against so many of his other orders.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut here, the question is, \u2018Why does the president need to get involved?\u2019\" Berman said, while outlining the financial gains players have made in the NIL era. \u201cJust because Nick Saban thinks he knows better and resents change? This is a coach who made more money off college football than any other coach, did absolutely nothing to make it right for these student-athletes. Why should he drive the president's thinking?\u201d",
      "Saban, who made more than $11 million in his last year at Alabama and who some have said should become the commissioner of college football \u2014 a position that doesn't exist \u2014 has said he isn't completely against players making money.",
      "But he has argued for rules and laws to keep things from looking like the \u201cpay for play\u201d model that the NCAA hopes to avoid but that is often what NIL payments look like.",

      "Whatever the underlying reasons, the team is moving on from its star kicker.",
      "The Ravens announced Monday they've decided to release Tucker, months after reports that he was accused of inappropriate sexual behavior by massage therapists. A five-time All-Pro, the 35-year-old Tucker has played his entire 13-year career with Baltimore. He's considered one of the best kickers in NFL history, although 2024 was his worst season.",
      "The Baltimore Banner has reported that over a dozen massage therapists have accused Tucker of inappropriate sexual behavior. The NFL said it would investigate, and the Ravens drafted kicker Tyler Loop late last month.",
      "\u201cSometimes football decisions are incredibly difficult, and this is one of those instances,\u201d Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta said in a statement issued by the club. \u201cConsidering our current roster, we have made the tough decision to release Justin Tucker.\u201d",
      "That comment was consistent with what coach John Harbaugh said at rookie camp Sunday, when he indicated a decision on Tucker might come before the NFL completed its investigation.",
      "\u201cEvery decision we make has to be based on football,\u201d Harbaugh said. \"You\u2019ve got a rookie kicker in here. You took him in the sixth round, early in the sixth round. He\u2019s a talented guy. Just from a football standpoint \u2014 salary cap, all the different things that you just take into consideration \u2014 whatever we decide to do over the next few weeks will be based on football.\u201d",
      "Tucker has maintained he did not act inappropriately while receiving professional treatment. A message seeking comment was left with his publicist Monday.",
      "Tucker holds the record for the longest kick in NFL history at 66 yards, and his success rate of 89.1% on field goals is the best all-time among players with at least 100 attempts. He was the last remaining player on the Ravens from their most recent Super Bowl title, which occurred when he was a rookie.",
      "In 2022, he agreed to a four-year contract extension through the 2027 season. That deal included $17.5 million guaranteed.",
      "Tucker missed a career-high eight field goal attempts last season, although he rebounded a bit down the stretch. Then came the Banner's report in January that left his future in doubt.",
      "\u201cJustin created many significant and unforgettable moments in Ravens history,\u201d DeCosta said. \u201cHis reliability, focus, drive, resilience and extraordinary talent made him one of the league's best kickers for over a decade. We are grateful for Justin's many contributions while playing for the Ravens. We sincerely wish him and his family the very best in this next chapter of their lives.\u201d",

      "Gregg Popovich spoke publicly Monday for the first time since suffering a stroke six months ago, saying at the news conference where the San Antonio Spurs formally introduced Mitch Johnson as his replacement that the time was right to make that move",
      "SAN ANTONIO -- Gregg Popovich spoke publicly Monday for the first time since suffering a stroke six months ago, saying at the news conference where the San Antonio Spurs formally introduced Mitch Johnson as his replacement that the time was right to make that move.",
      "Flanked by Spurs greats Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili, the 76-year-old Popovich \u2014 speaking far more softly than he has in the past \u2014 said his health is improving and that he fully believes in Johnson.",
      "\u201cThings are getting better by the day, but it\u2019s not good enough for what we plan ahead,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s time to make this change.\u201d",
      "Popovich will remain with the Spurs as team president, and the leadership of the team \u2014 including CEO R.C. Buford and general manager Brian Wright \u2014 isn't changing. Nor will the team's ideals, Popovich said.",
      "\u201cThat's the goal, to make sure we keep it going,\u201d Popovich said, adding that he will do everything he can to help Johnson going forward.",
      "Popovich removed his jacket before bringing Johnson to the podium, revealing a T-shirt with his new title: \u201cEl jefe,\u201d it said, the Spanish phrase for \u201cthe boss.\u201d",
      "\u201cI'm no longer coach,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cI'm 'El Jefe.'\u201d",
      "Johnson took his seat at a microphone moments later, not before Popovich reminded those present that \u201che's going to do a great job.\u201d",
      "Johnson looked in Popovich's direction and took a deep breath. \u201cI am honored by this opportunity and even more humbled by the people that I'll be able to partner with and serve,\u201d the new coach of the Spurs said.",
      "Popovich\u2019s public appearance was a bit of a surprise. Surrounded by a slew of Spurs past and present \u2014 Victor Wembanyama leading the way \u2014 Popovich walked into the practice facility shortly before managing partner Peter J. Holt spoke to open the news conference.",
      "Holt struggled to get words out at times, the emotion of the day very clear.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t be him or \u2018El Jefe,\u2019\u201d Johnson said when asked what he\u2019ll take from Popovich. \u201cBut to be able to commit and invest in people and relationships \u2014 that can be having to yell and hold someone accountable, and that can be to put your arm around someone\u2019s shoulder and love them \u2014 and he did it better than anybody that\u2019s ever walked the sidelines. And I will attempt to do it my way, whatever that looks like going forward.\u201d",
      "Popovich \u2014 the NBA's all-time wins leader, someone who coached the Spurs from 1996 until now and won five NBA titles in that span \u2014 spoke for about seven minutes, starting by cracking a few jokes, not uncommon for him.",
      "He also turned reflective, at times even a bit emotional. He suffered the stroke on Nov. 2, hours before the Spurs were playing the Minnesota Timberwolves that night. Johnson took over as acting coach for the final 77 games of the season and his promotion was formally announced Friday.",
      "\u201cI can never express the gratitude that I have for so many people caring about the organization and sending me thoughts and prayers, that sort of thing, since I had this stroke,\u201d Popovich said.",
      "Popovich also thanked several of those involved in his rehabilitation, some of whom were at Monday's news conference at the team's The Rock at La Cantera training facility.",
      "\u201cTimmy and Manu have been here for all of my workouts here at the Rock,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cThey say it\u2019s because they love me and they want to be there in case I fall and they want to catch me, that sort of thing. I call it payback. They give the rehab people new ideas for things to do to me. They\u2019re not fooling anybody.\u201d",
      "Popovich thanked former players and coaches for being there, and noted that everyone in the Spurs organization \u2014 including the in-game time-out performers, those in the ticket office, custodians, window-washers and more \u2014 plays a role in the team\u2019s success. He also lauded the fans for their years of support, and vowed that the Spurs won\u2019t let them down.",
      "\u201cWe all have a part in this,\" Popovich said. \"It\u2019s not just the players and the coaches.\u201d",
      "The Spurs\u2019 core principles \u2014 doing things the right way, honoring continuity, always welcoming former players back into the fold \u2014 will remain in place, Johnson said.",
      "\u201cThe theme of the book isn\u2019t changing,\u201d Johnson said.",

      "The originals burned four months ago at his home in the Pacific Palisades area of the city that will host the next Summer Games in 2028.",
      "Replacing them by presenting 10 at the same time was \u201ca unique ceremony,\u201d said International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that it happened ever before and I hope it will never have to happen again,\u201d Bach told Hall Jr. \u201cWe hope also to give you a moment of relief and joy which will help you now in the further process to get over what you had to go through with this tragedy.\u201d",
      "Hall Jr. spoke with emotion about being supported by family, former teammates and old Olympic rivals like Australia stars Ian Thorpe and Michael Klim.",
      "\u201cHaving friends and family I am a very lucky man,\u201d he said. \u201cThe support that I was offered from the athletic community has buoyed me through the darkest of nights.\u201d",
      "He brought with him to Switzerland a deformed gold medal later recovered from the home he fled with his dog, Puddles, after grabbing his insulin medication.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s got some character,\u201d Hall Jr. said of the burned gold at the Olympic ceremony. \u201cThe value of friends outweighs the value of objects. We live in a time of capitalism, consumerism and you realize when you lose everything, how little of it you truly need.",
      "\u201cCharacter cannot be taken away, it cannot be burned and it cannot be lost.\u201d",

      "\u201cThat is what this (Olympic) family is about \u2014 rivals and friends. I am just so appreciative to all of them. I can\u2019t thank the Olympic movement enough for their support through this very difficult time.\"",

      "Will Hardy is being given more time to continue the rebuild of the Utah Jazz.",
      "The Jazz announced Monday that Hardy has signed a contract extension, one that could keep him as head coach through the 2030-31 season. He'll enter his fourth season with the Jazz next fall.",
      "\u201cWill\u2019s leadership has been invaluable to our program,\u201d Jazz CEO Danny Ainge said. \"He has established a vision for our players and a strong foundation of core values, competitive habits, and growth mindset. He is one of the brightest young coaches in our league, and we are incredibly fortunate to have him.\u201d",
      "Hardy has gone 85-161 in his first three seasons with the Jazz, missing the playoffs in each of those three years. Utah won 37 games in his first season, 31 in his second and just 17 this season \u2014 by far the worst record in franchise history and the worst record in the NBA this season.",
      "The Jazz \u2014 who didn't play anyone over the age of 27 in the final weeks of this season and finished the year with the youngest roster in the NBA \u2014 clearly understand why that was the case, and the extension shows they're happy with the way Hardy has handled the rebuild.",
      "\u201cI love Utah and the Jazz organization and am extremely grateful for the opportunity to continue to help guide our team,\u201d Hardy said in remarks distributed by the team. \u201cI believe in what we are building. We have a talented group of coaches and people all working to build a championship program for this incredible fan base.\"",

The Jazz currently have four picks in next month's draft, including two first-rounders, and have a 14% chance \u2014 as good as anyone \u2014 of winning the lottery and landing the No. 1 overall pick, which most expect will be Duke freshman Cooper Flagg.",
      "The Jazz also have more financial freedom than most teams this summer because of expiring contracts and only one player \u2014 Lauri Markkanen \u2014 making more than $30 million next season.",
      "\u201cWill is an incredible leader, great communicator \u2014 especially with our younger players \u2014 and a strong ambassador for this franchise,\" Jazz governor Ryan Smith said.",

      "Don't tell Natalie Nakase she doesn't have what it takes to do something. The coach of the San Francisco Bay Area's first WNBA team got to where she is by learning to block out those who underestimated her.",
      "\u201cIf I hear one negative thing about my goal, about my dream, it\u2019s out, we\u2019re done,\u201d Nakase told The Associated Press. \u201cIt made my circle really small, but it\u2019s made my circle really powerful and encouraging and supportive for me.\u201d",
      "That focus and grit is what led to Nakase, 45, to going from being a walk-on at UCLA to team captain as a 5-foot-2 freshman in 1998. It's what made her the first Asian American player to join the now-defunct National Women\u2019s Basketball League in 2003.",
      "Nakase is blazing a trail again as the WNBA's first Asian American head coach. That distinction adds to an already impressive rise to be the leader of the Golden State Valkyries, the league's first expansion franchise since 2008. Their inaugural roster also happens to include championship-winning UConn guard Kaitlyn Chen, who last month became the first Taiwanese American drafted.",
      "It's clear Nakase, who is of Japanese ancestry, isn't rattled ascending to a larger spotlight.",
      "The Golden State Warriors organization, of which the Valkyries are a part of, has prepared her for being more public and \u201cpreparation builds confidence,\u201d she said. Coaching is something Nakase expressed interest in as far back as 20 years when she was on the San Jose Spiders.",
      "For people who may not see Asian American women as leaders, Nakase hopes her new role will change minds.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s more like what\u2019s in your mind rather than like the exterior part of it,\" said Nakase, who at UCLA was often mistaken for a gymnast or tennis player. \u201cThe negative opinions fuel my fire, though.\u201d",
      "Nakase's leadership style is one of \u201ctough love.\u201d It's an approach she learned from her father. Compliments were not something given in her family. But candor was.",
      "Her father \u201cnot only (held) me accountable but, he set higher and higher standards because I think if you believe in yourself \u2014 in this \u2014 then I want to push you to this,\u201d Nakase said. \u201cIf your expectations are here, I want to push you even higher.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s not to say she won\u2019t be there for players off the court.",
      "Nakase said her \u201cresponsibility is to be with them every single day, every single moment, check in, \u2018Are we good today?\u2019\u201d",
      "Nakase will be one of four head coaches of color in the WNBA this season.",
      "The other three are Black, but that number is down from six in 2022. Within that subset, Seattle Storm coach Noelle Quinn is the only other female. In 2022, Latricia Trammell became the first Native American or Alaska Native head coach. The Dallas Wings, however, fired her after two seasons.",
      "Only one-fourth of the head coaches in the league are Black, which is a sharp contrast to the fact that roughly 64% of WNBA players are Black or African American, according to a 2023 report from The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport. Hispanic/Latina and Asian players each account for 1.4%. Those who identify as mixed race amount to nearly 11%.",
      "The WNBA is on track to expand to 16 teams by 2028. Toronto \u2014 the first outside the U.S. \u2014 and Portland, Oregon, will have franchises next year.",
      "This is all happening as women's sports at college and professional levels have seen a popularity surge in the last few years. Nakase was a Los Angeles Clippers assistant coach for 10 years before she joined the WNBA's Las Vegas Aces in a similar role. In 2023, after the Aces won back-to-back championships, Nakase noticed a shift in interest.",
      "She believes the opportunity to be part of the movement happening in women's sports as the coach of the Valkyries couldn't have come at a better time.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m exactly where I\u2019m supposed to be, especially going from the NBA, experiencing everything on a day to day on what it looks like, what they get and now coming here,\u201d Nakase said.",
      "Nakase's presence has electrified Bay Area Asian Americans who already were stoked to have a hometown WNBA team to support.",
      "Teresa and Nathan Chan, who are Chinese American, had bought Valkyries season tickets for themselves and their daughters Adelaide, 16, and Ashlyn, 15. Both girls play for the San Jose Zebras, one of several Asian American youth teams around the Bay Area.",
      "Adelaide said she was \u201cfreaking out\u201d when she found out an Asian American woman would be taking a lead in Dub Nation. She sees parallels with Nakase, who also grew up playing in an Asian American league.",
      "\u201cI thought that was just so cool and it felt more so like she was part of our community already,\u201d Adelaide said.",
      "Both Nakase and Chen\u2019s presence have intensified Ashlyn\u2019s interest.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really watch the WNBA like that much before,\" Ashlyn said, \"but now that I see a lot of Asian representation ... I\u2019m more like, \u2018Oh, this is my team now.\u2019\u201d",
      "Teresa Chan, whose father founded a local basketball club over 30 years ago, said it's \u201cthe most wonderful thing that we could ever ask for. I think also it challenges the stereotypes and expands their views of what\u2019s possible.\u201d",
      "It's \u201ca symbol to all girls and boys alike in the Asian community,\" Nathan Chan added.",
      "Nakase embraces what she feels is a responsibility and thinks about how to use her new platform to encourage more girls on a daily basis.",
      "\u201cWhat I feel like I\u2019m going to connect more to also is more coaches,\" Nakase said. \"Because I think that, like I said, the impact of coaches is going to be the reason why other females \u2014 younger kids that look like me \u2014 that they\u2019re going to be inspired.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Ted Williams is the last American Leaguer to hit",
      "Ted Williams is the last American Leaguer to hit .400, and there are actually plenty of similarities between him and Aaron Judge.",
      "The one major difference is in the strikeout column, and that's why Judge is highly unlikely to repeat Williams' famous feat.",
      "With a .423 batting average through 34 games, Judge leads the major leagues in hitting by a whopping 74 points over New York Yankees teammate Paul Goldschmidt. Judge's OPS of 1.287 is actually the same number Williams finished with when he hit .406 in 1941. Williams averaged a homer every 12.32 at-bats that year. Judge is hitting one every 11.82 so far this season.",
      "But Williams struck out only 27 times in all of 1941. Judge has already done so 31 times.",
      "Judge has struck out in 20.3% of his plate appearances. In the live ball era, only one player in the AL or NL has even hit .350 with a strikeout rate of at least 20%. That was Manny Ramirez at .351 in 2000.",
      "Still, Judge's strengths \u2014 and his one big weakness \u2014 can help us come up with a road map of sorts for aspiring .400 hitters.",
      "Step One: Shrink the sample size.",
      "It's no accident that all of baseball's .400 hitters played before the season expanded to 162 games. Smaller samples lead to more extreme stats, and when Williams hit .406 in 1941, he only played in 143 games. George Brett played in 117 games when he hit .390 in 1980. Tony Gwynn topped out at .394 in 1994 \u2014 the season that ended in mid-August because of a strike.",
      "No, that doesn't mean players should try to get injured or miss games for other reasons. But a high walk total is imperative if you want to qualify for the batting title while still keeping your at-bat total reasonably low. Williams had only 456 at-bats in 1941 because he drew 147 walks.",
      "Ichiro Suzuki was a prolific contact hitter who didn't walk much. He would routinely end up with around 700 at-bats in a season, and it's extremely hard to sustain a .400 average for that long.",
      "Step Two: Make contact.",
      "This is the problem for Judge and other power hitters of this era. A player who strikes out in 20% of his plate appearances has to hit .500 on the PAs he doesn't strike out in if he's going to bat .400 overall. Right now Judge is 55 for 99 when he doesn't strike out \u2014 an extraordinary mark but not one that is likely to last.",
      "Step Three: Ride a BABIP heater.",
      "There's a lot of luck involved in a player's batting average on balls in play (BABIP), but there are some ways a hitter can improve it. Hitting line drives is obviously preferable to hitting popups, and speedy players can turn grounders into infield hits, boosting their BABIP \u2014 and batting average \u2014 that way. George Sisler had a BABIP of .422 in 1922 when he hit .420.",
      "Step Four: Hit homers.",
      "Unfortunately, BABIP numbers like Sisler's don't happen much, especially now. The overall BABIP across the major leagues this year is .288. It was over .300 back in 1930 \u2014 which happened to be the year Bill Terry became the last National Leaguer to hit .400. Fielders have more success turning balls in play into outs than they did then, but one way to avoid that is to hit a lot of homers. When Rod Carew hit .388 in 1977, he was boosted by a BABIP of .408, but it was also the year he tied his career high with 14 home runs.",
      "Needless to say, there aren't many players who can combine high walk and home run rates with low strikeouts in a way that adds up to a .400 average. For example, Barry Bonds homered every 6.52 at-bats in 2001 and posted career-best walk (37.6%) and strikeout (6.6%) rates in 2004. His best BABIP was .330 in 2002.",
      "Now let's imagine he pulled off all those career-best rates in the same season, and let's give him 600 plate appearances. The rest of the numbers would shake out like this: 226 walks, 40 strikeouts, 374 at-bats, 57 home runs and 148 hits. But that would still only be an average of .396.",
      "One player who could have made a run at .400 but never really did was Wade Boggs, whose highest average was .368. Boggs had a BABIP of .396 in 1985, then posted his one big home run year in 1987 when he hit 24 \u2014 one every 22.96 at-bats. In 1988, he struck out in a minuscule 4.7% of his plate appearances while walking in 17.4%.",
      "If we combine those rates into one hypothetical season like we did with Bonds, we end up with: 600 PAs, 104 walks, 28 strikeouts, 496 at-bats, 22 homers and 199 hits. That's a .401 average.",
      "Jake Meyers went 4 for 4 with two homers and seven RBIs in Houston's 8-3 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Saturday. He tied a franchise record with 13 total bases.",
      "The Toronto Blue Jays rallied from a 6-0 deficit in the sixth inning to beat the Boston Red Sox 7-6 in 10 on Wednesday night. Toronto had a 1.6% chance to win in the sixth, according to Baseball Savant.",
      "The Blue Jays actually wiped out the deficit quickly. Daulton Varsho hit a two-run homer in the sixth and Alejandro Kirk followed with a solo shot. Then Anthony Santander tied it with a three-run homer the following inning. Kirk eventually won it with a bases-loaded single in extra innings.",

      "\u201cThese are the most important times of the year,\u201d Celtics forward and reigning NBA Finals MVP Jaylen Brown said. \u201cWe've just got to come out and perform.\u201d",
      "The star power has been whittled down from what it was at the start of the playoffs: LeBron James and Luka Doncic were ousted when the Los Angeles Lakers fell to Minnesota, James Harden and Kawhi Leonard saw their seasons end when the Los Angeles Clippers lost to Denver, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Milwaukee were eliminated by Indiana.",
      "But there's still plenty of big names \u2014 Curry, Edwards, the Celtics' duo of Brown and Jayson Tatum, the likely MVP in Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, a three-time MVP in Denver's Nikola Jokic, a scoring machine in Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell, an Olympic gold medalist in Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton and the league's best clutch player this season in New York's Jalen Brunson.",
      "The favorites, according to BetMGM Sportsbook, to win the NBA title, in order: Oklahoma City, then Boston, then Cleveland, then Minnesota. Indiana showed how much that mattered when it won Game 1 of an East semifinal matchup on the Cavs' home floor.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t heard many people that have gave us a chance in this series,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cSo, we've got to use that as some level of motivation. But we know what we're capable of.\u201d",
      "Curry and the Warriors making it to Round 2 will certainly help ratings, which the NBA and its broadcast partners raved about in Round 1. The Knicks, the Warriors and the Celtics still being in means the NBA has a team still playing in three of the nation's top seven television markets; losing both Los Angeles teams in Round 1 probably won't help on that front, however.",
      "\u201cThe numbers are fantastic,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said after the first weekend of the playoffs. None of the numbers that came out since would suggest his opinion has had to change on that front.",
      "Still, there is much for even the casual fan to like: A traditional rivalry in Knicks-Celtics, a matchup of Olympic backcourt teammates Curry and Edwards in the Golden State-Minnesota series, a Cavs-Pacers series that already has a No. 1 seed forced to dig out of a deficit, and a Thunder-Nuggets series with the 2024 MVP in Jokic vs. the probable 2025 MVP in Gilgeous-Alexander.",
      "The NBA hasn't said when it will announce the MVP voting results \u2014 ballots were cast last month by a global panel of 100 writers and broadcasters who cover the league \u2014 but it's reasonable to think that news could come during this series.",
      "\u201cThose guys are pros,\u201d Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \u201cNeither one of them \u2014 I know Shai a lot better than I know Jokic, but I think I know enough about him to know neither one of them are going to get distracted by that. Both of them are going to be fully invested in this series. It's a supplement to the series, but it's really not part of the series at all.\u201d",
      "And a little extra intrigue for that Warriors-Timberwolves matchup: Golden State's Jimmy Butler is heading back to Minnesota, a place that he didn't leave exactly on the best of terms after his brief stint as a player there.",
      "Butler said he's more worried about how to get his coffee machine and his kids to Minnesota for Game 1 than he is about any he's-going-back-there storyline. The Warriors earned their trip there by going into Houston and winning a Game 7 on Sunday night.",
      "\u201cWe never wavered. The confidence never went anywhere,\u201d Butler said. \u201cReally good group of hoopers. Really good group of people. That's what I'm going to take into this next round. We've got some guys who can play at an extremely high level.\u201d",
      "That seems to be the sentiment of all eight teams that are left in the playoffs.",

      "Sovereignty\u2019s Kentucky Derby victory in the muck at Churchill Downs sparked curiosity over whether the colt can build on his signature win over a possibly drier, faster surface on the Triple Crown trail",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Sovereignty's Kentucky Derby victory in the muck at Churchill Downs sparked curiosity over whether the colt can build on his signature win over a possibly drier, faster surface on the Triple Crown trail.",
      "The question now is whether that test will come sooner or later.",
      "Hall of Fame trainer Bill Mott didn\u2019t sound like someone preparing Sovereignty for a trip to Baltimore to run in the 150th Preakness Stakes on May 17 at Pimlico Race course, offering a cautious approach Sunday.",
      "\u201cThe great thing about the Triple Crown is that not many horses are able to do it,\u201d Mott said, referring to American Pharoah in 2015 and Justify in 2018. \u201cI believe that he\u2019s a big, strong horse and if you\u2019re ever going to look at one and say, OK, if that\u2019s your goal and the goal of the owner, it\u2019s still in the best interest of the horse. But we\u2019re going to look long term.\u201d",
      "The immediate futures for horses that finished just behind Sovereignty or skipped the Derby altogether remained muddy, as well.",
      "Two-time Triple Crown-winning trainer Bob Baffert returned to Churchill Downs after a four-year suspension with two entries but scratched Wood Memorial winner Rodriguez, pointing him toward the Preakness. Fellow Hall of Famer Todd Pletcher scratched his lone Derby entrant, Grande, on Friday. There's also a large group of hopefuls who earned Derby points during qualifying and could try other Triple Crown stops.",
      "The Preakness is the shortest race at 1 3/16 mile, but its quick two-week turnaround from the 1 1/4-mile Derby often gives pause for trainers and ownership groups. With the Belmont Stakes set for June 8, five weeks after the Derby and separated three weeks from the Preakness, that race is viewed by many as a preferred option.",
      "That final jewel of the Triple Crown, taking place at Saratoga Race Course in upstate New York for a second consecutive year, features the same distance as the Derby because of the shape of the track instead of its traditional 1 1/2-miles.",
      "Redemption might be in order for Derby runner-up Journalism, who fell short as the 3-1 favorite. Trainer Michael McCarthy was not available to talk to reporters Sunday but praised his colt's effort to rally into the lead briefly before Sovereignty, the 7-1 third choice, overtook him in the stretch and won by 1 1/2 lengths.",
      "\u201cHe made a nice middle move, then on the turn for home he opened up,\u201d McCarthy said after the race, \u201cbut I saw the blue silks coming at us and I knew that was the one we were going to have to be concerned about. He ran the best he could and ran a very good race. But the winner ran a better race.\u201d",
      "Final Gambit charged from last to finish fourth among 19 horses, and trainer Brad Cox said, \u201cThis gives us confidence to try a fast dirt surface in the future.\u201d",
      "Mott and Godolphin LLC ownership group representative Michael Banahan expressed the same faith in Sovereignty for his next step.",
      "The newest Derby champion emerged briefly on the shed row for media and onlookers, and his handlers felt good about the horse's initial condition. They plan to watch him the next few days before making a decision about the immediate part of his bright future.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just doing the right thing for the horse, what he needs to do,\" Banahan said. \u201cHe has a big year, hopefully to continue down the road here. There\u2019s an awful lot of nice races that you\u2019d like to put on his resume, as well. So, we\u2019re just doing the right thing for him.\u201d",

      "The Dallas Stars emerged from a seven-game series against Colorado, and the Edmonton Oilers rallied from down 2-0 to eliminate Los Angeles and move on in the NHL playoffs",
      "The second round of the NHL playoffs begins Monday night, after no sweeps and two series going the distance to get to this point.",
      "Dallas emerged from a seven-game series against Colorado, and Edmonton rallied from down 2-0 to eliminate Los Angeles and move on in the gauntlet that is the Western Conference. Neither will have an easy time coming up, with the Stars facing either league-best Winnipeg or red-hot St. Louis and Connor McDavid and the Oilers taking on Vegas, which has home-ice advantage.",
      "In the East, defending Stanley Cup champion Florida faces Toronto \u2014 trying to reach its first conference final since 2002 \u2014 while Alex Ovechkin and Washington play Carolina in a series that won't get the attention of Panthers-Maple Leafs but has the potential to be must-see entertainment.",
      "It just all might be a little different than the fast-and-furious, rough-hitting first round.",
      "\u201cI think it just settles down a little bit (after) everybody is so amped up at the beginning of the playoffs,\u201d Capitals coach Spencer Carbery said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be ultracompetitive, and it\u2019s going to be physical and it\u2019s playoff hockey. But I think it\u2019ll be teams that are settled in and very, very focused on what they need to do to gain the upper hand against their opponent.\u201d",
      "After dispatching cross-state rival Tampa Bay in five games, the Panthers are favorites to repeat at odds of just over 4-1 on BetMGM Sportsbook, followed by the Oilers, Hurricanes and Stars. Edmonton is favored to win the West and set up a Cup final rematch in June, but there's a lot of hockey to be played first.",
      "This one is expected to start Wednesday night, either in Texas or Manitoba, pending the result of Blues-Jets Game 7 later Sunday night. It's no surprise that the Central Division bracket produced the two longest series, given the depth of legitimate contenders.",
      "The Stars got a storybook, historic performance from former Avalanche standout Mikko Rantanen to defeat the Avalanche. Rantanen became the first player in league history with a third-period hat trick in a Game 7.",
      "\u201cWhen you go through a game like that, you\u2019re just numb,\u201d coach Peter DeBoer said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to process what really happened.\u201d",
      "Now they're poised to get their top defenseman, Miro Heiskanen, and leading goal-scorer, Jason Robertson, back at some point in the second round after not having either against Colorado. Heiskanen has been out since having surgery on his left knee in early February, while Robertson got injured in the final game of the regular season and was immediately considered week to week.",
      "Dallas also has goaltender Jake Oettinger in mid-playoff form. He stopped 25 of 27 shots in Game 7 and believes he and his teammates may have already survived perhaps their toughest test.",
      "\u201cI have a hard time believing that there\u2019s any team that\u2019s much better than Colorado out there,\u201d Oettinger said. \u201cMaybe try to win Game 1.\u201d",
      "Beginning Tuesday night at the \u201cFortress\u201d just off the Strip, the Oilers and Golden Knights meet in the playoffs for a second time in three years. Vegas won that series on the way to capturing the Stanley Cup in the franchise's seventh season of existence.",
      "Much has changed since, including Edmonton firing Jay Woodcroft and hiring Kris Knoblauch as coach and reaching Game 7 of the final before losing to Florida last year. The Oilers still have McDavid and MVP finalist Leon Draisaitl.",
      "\u201cThey changed their head coach, and they use their depth players more,\u201d Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy said. \u201cThey still rely on their two big guys, obviously, but they won games with depth against LA.\u201d",
      "The Golden Knights found great success in putting centers Jack Eichel and William Karlsson on the top line with captain Mark Stone in beating Minnesota 4-2 in the first round. They'll hope for more against Edmonton.",
      "\u201cBoth teams have some pretty high-end talent,\u201d Eichel said. \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to be a tough series.\u201d",
      "Going into their series beginning Monday night in Toronto, the Panthers and Leafs largely have the same cores as they did when they met in the second round in 2023, though neither really plays the same way. And Toronto has three players \u2014 defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson, forward Steven Lorentz and goaltender Anthony Stolarz \u2014 who were with Florida for its Cup run last year.",
      "The Leafs\u2019 strength is a daunting, five-forward power play unit of Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner, William Nylander, Matthew Knies and John Tavares. The Panthers emphasized getting stronger and deeper on the penalty kill at the trade deadline, one of many reasons why GM Bill Zito went out and got Brad Marchand and Nico Sturm.",
      "\u201cYou get the chance to play hockey in late April, May, hopefully June,\u201d Sturm said. \u201cI want to play meaningful games. And these are about as meaningful as it gets, against the best players in the world.\u201d",
      "The Capitals-Hurricanes game April 2 featured two fights, eight misconducts and a total of 142 penalty minutes. Jalen Chatfield's takedown of Connor McMichael at the end of their bout did not please Carbery and his players, and Brandon Duhaime fought Chatfield when they played nine nights later.",
      "These teams have not met in the playoffs since 2019, but playing twice in the final few weeks of the season built up plenty of animosity between division rivals who know each other well and don't particularly like each other all that much.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to dictate play and worry about our game and make sure we\u2019re really focused and dialed in, because there\u2019s not going to be a lot of time and space out there,\u201d Capitals winger Tom Wilson said. \"You\u2019re going to have two fast, big teams in the East going at it. I think it\u2019s going to be high-paced, physical, detailed hockey.\u201d",

      "ARLINGTON, Va. -- Alex Ovechkin is four months away from turning 40 and still was among the Washington Capitals' most consistent hitters in the first round of the NHL playoffs.",
      "Color his teammates unsurprised.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s one of a kind,\" Tom Wilson said. \u201cHe\u2019s a machine. He\u2019s built different.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin led the Capitals into the second round for the first time since captaining them to the Stanley Cup in 2018, scoring four goals and finishing with 19 hits to set up a showdown with the Carolina Hurricanes.",
      "The best-of-seven series starts Tuesday, exactly a month after Ovechkin broke Wayne Gretzky's career goals record, and he's expected to keep this up moving forward because he has been a physical force his entire career with a style that fits perfectly in playoff hockey.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s done it ever since I\u2019ve been here, so I don\u2019t see why he won\u2019t keep doing it,\u201d said Wilson, who has played with Ovechkin since 2013. \"He\u2019s definitely our energy. He\u2019s kind of our everything on any given night. He goes out there and leads the way, and that\u2019s what a captain does. He can be a guy that goes out and gets the momentum going for us early in a game or whenever we need it.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin's first act of his 16th trip to the postseason was a hit on Montreal's Mike Matheson 20 seconds into that series opener, which he finished with his first overtime playoff goal. He laid out Jake Evans with a (penalized) open-ice check late in the second period of a Game 4 comeback victory, then scored again in the Game 5 clincher.",
      "\u201cHe was outstanding the whole series,\u201d said Spencer Carbery, who's expected to win the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year for getting Washington to the top of the Eastern Conference above preseason expectations.",
      "\u201cHe scored some big goals, I felt like, through this series. And I\u2019m proud of him because it\u2019s a long time to sit on last year and last year\u2019s playoffs and have to run that through your mind.\u201d",
      "Last year's playoffs did not go well for Ovechkin and the Capitals. They were swept by the Presidents' Trophy-winning New York Rangers, and Ovechkin did not register a point in a series for the first time in his two decades in the NHL.",
      "Ovechkin looked like a motivated competitor this time, even though he brushed off the concept of redeeming himself for not scoring in the Rangers series.",
      "\u201cI mean, you just take it game by game,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cWhat happened in the past and what happened in the regular season is over.\u201d",
      "What happened in the regular season was Ovechkin taking over the spotlight in sports and beyond it by chasing Gretzky's record of 894 that was long thought to be unapproachable and becoming the league's all-time leading goal scorer by getting a flurry of six in five games.",
      "He also did it with enough time left in the regular season for Ovechkin and the Capitals to move past the record and set their sights on a second championship.",
      "\u201cFor him to break the record and then be able to reset and refocus, and now (say), \u2018OK, this is what means more to me than the record,\u2019 which is amazing in itself, to get himself to the spot where he played this playoffs comparatively to last year, it\u2019s night and day,\u201d Carbery said. \"He\u2019s a year older.

He just continues to do things that you just can\u2019t wrap your head around in this sport, in this league \u2014 and then at the most difficult time of the year, the Stanley Cup Playoffs.\u201d",
      "Linemate Dylan Strome, Washington's leading scorer in the first round with nine points, thinks Ovechkin is doing the same things he has been all season, with a little more physicality mixed in.",
      "\u201cStill getting his shots off, still has great chances to score, still finding ways to get open, and I thought he\u2019s done a really good job,\u201d said Strome, who this season assisted on 23 of Ovechkin's 44 goals to get him to 897 in his career. \"He kind of leads the way for our team in setting the tone and getting the first goal usually, so he kind of brings our team into it and we just follow behind.\u201d",
      "Wilson, Strome and John Carlson have lived that for a long time. Anthony Beauvillier has quickly since joining at the trade deadline in March found out what it's like to play alongside Ovechkin and watch up close as he drags the Capitals into the fight.",
      "\u201cHe wants to show the way, and everyone jumps on the boat with him,\" Beauvillier. \"To see him do that and score big goals and have some big hits, how can you not get fired up and follow him?\u201d",

      "SHEFFIELD, England -- Zhao Xintong dominated Mark Williams in the opening session of the world snooker championship final on Sunday, running up a 7-1 lead in his bid to become the first Chinese winner of the sport's biggest prize.",
      "Zhao, who thrashed seven-time champion Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan 17-7 in the semifinals, was in complete control at the Crucible Theatre against another great of the game, with Williams a three-time champion and playing the final at the age of 50.",

      "He is the firm favorite to become just the third player in history to win the worlds after coming through qualification.",

      "The only other Chinese player to have reached the final of the worlds is Ding Junhui, who in 2016 lost to Mark Selby 18-14. Ding is the trailblazer for a raft of Chinese players \u2014 one of them being Zhao \u2014 to have burst through, making the sport huge in their homeland.",

      "DALLAS -- Mikko Rantanen figures he would have left the room in disbelief had someone told him at the beginning of this season that he would score a hat track in a Game 7 against Colorado.",
      "After all, that was the organization with which he made his NHL debut just weeks before his 19th birthday. He was there for 9 1/2 years and went to the playoffs each of the past seven seasons with the Avalanche in a run that included their 2022 Stanley Cup title.",
      "But twice traded in a six-week span earlier this year, Rantanen did exactly that and more against his original team.",
      "Rantanen assisted on Wyatt Johnston's tiebreaking power-play goal in between his first career postseason hat trick \u2014 all coming in the third period of Game 7 for the Dallas Stars on Saturday night. They overcame a two-goal deficit for a 4-2 win over the Avs to wrap up the first-round Western Conference series.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s emotional for sure because everything happened so quick,\u201d Rantanen said. \u201cIt\u2019s only a couple of months since I was still with them, playing with them, and chasing a playoff spot and stuff. And all of a sudden, a couple of months later, playing against them in a Game 7.\u201d",
      "After a four-point second period in a loss at Colorado two nights earlier, Rantanen became only the second player in NHL history to have four points in the third period of a Game 7. He also is the only of the nine players with a Game 7 hat trick to score all his goals in the final period.",
      "\u201cWe also had the benefit of a motivated guy. You know, this was Colorado and the team that he had played for for a decade,\u201d Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know all the behind the scenes what went on there, but he was a motivated guy to make an impact in this series. And he just got better and better.\u201d",
      "Rantanen, who could have become a free agent after this season, was first traded from Colorado to Carolina on Jan. 24. He played only 13 games for the Hurricanes before they sent him to Dallas in a deadline deal March 7 that included a $96 million, eight-year contract extension.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know revenge,\u201d Rantanen said. \u201cI\u2019m just happy to win as a team in the playoffs. It doesn\u2019t matter who it is.\u201d",
      "In 81 career playoff games for the Avalanche, Rantanen had 101 points (34 goals, 67 assists). His last game with them was Jan. 22, but the regular season ended with him still as their third-leading scorer with 64 points (25 goals, 39 assists) in his 49 games behind Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar.",
      "Rantanen had five goals and seven assists in the seven-game series against the Avs.",
      "\u201cWhat he did in the second period the other night ... that\u2019s the thing with Mikko, is it\u2019s not about all his creating multiple chances every time he touches the puck, but big moments,\u201d Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. \"That\u2019s what he is, he\u2019s a pure goal scorer. He did that in the third.\u201d",
      "And sent the Avalanche home for the summer.",

      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus and neighboring Israel are seeking to swiftly establish an electricity linkup via an undersea cable that would eliminate their respective energy isolation, an official said Monday.",
      "Energy Minister George Papanastasiou said that Israel is particularly keen to ensure that it can rely on Cypriot energy reserves from both conventional and renewable sources to power the country if the need ever arises.",
      "Pananastasiou told The Associated Press that Cyprus would soon have the capacity to generate around four gigawatts of electricity from fossil fuels as well as solar and wind sources, while consuming only 0.5 GW.",
      "Wind turbines and photovoltaics generate 1 GW of electricity, but licenses have been issued for construction of new wind and solar energy parks with a capacity of 2.8 GW. Conventional fuels generate 1.4 GW.",
      "The shared commitment for an electricity cable link was affirmed Sunday when Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a daylong visit to Israel and Ramallah, West Bank.",
      "Both leaders said that the electricity link would showcase the two countries\u2019 geographical location as the natural gateways between Europe and the Middle East.",
      "Papanastasiou said given this geographical advantage, the two leaders agreed to pursue the potential benefits from the establishment of a trade, energy and digital connectivity corridor between India, the Middle East and Europe.",
      "The corridor, known as the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, or IMEC, was unveiled at the India-hosted Group of 20 summit of the world\u2019s leading rich and developing nations in 2023.",

      "Separately, an electricity cable project to link Greece with Cyprus is already underway. The 1.94 billion-euro ($2.19 billion) Great Seas Interconnector, or GSI, is partly funded by the European Union to the tune of 800 million euros ($903 million).",
      "Progress has been slowed because of Turkish objections over the cable\u2019s course. Turkey says the project can\u2019t proceed without its consent because the cable would pass through waters it claims are under its jurisdiction.",

      "ATHENS, Greece -- In a country celebrated for its ancient wisdom, Greece is offering a modern solution to a pressing household challenge: empowering parents to oversee their children\u2019s online activity.",
      "On Monday, the government launched a state-operated mobile app, marking one of Europe\u2019s most assertive steps toward digital age verification.",
      "Kids Wallet, now available on iOS and Android, gives parents tools to verify their children\u2019s ages on digital platforms and monitor their browsing activity, officials said.",
      "\u201cThis is an application that Greece \u2014 and Europe \u2014 needs to confirm children\u2019s ages when they use social media,\u201d said Digital Governance Minister Dimitris Papastergiou. \u201cIt will also serve as an identification tool for upcoming initiatives.\u201d",
      "Unlike stricter approaches adopted in some European countries, Greece has made the app\u2019s use voluntary, though officials argue it offers more powerful controls. The initiative aligns with broader EU-wide efforts to standardize age verification across member states.",
      "The app is integrated with Greece\u2019s government services platform, already widely used to pay taxes, navigate bureaucracy, and even buy soccer tickets, and works with existing digital ID systems for adults.",
      "Parents will log in using their online tax identification credentials.",
      "The general age of digital consent has been set at 15, and officials have invited major digital platforms to collaborate on the rollout.",
      "\u201cDear platforms, we ask for your cooperation so that together we can protect children at a vulnerable age,\u201d Papastergiou said.",
      "Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis voiced support for the initiative, expressing concern over technology\u2019s impact on family life. \u201cYou see families in restaurants where parents and children are all on their phones, and you wonder when they actually talk to each other,\u201d he said.",
      "A 2024 survey by Greek research organization KMOP found that 76.6% of children aged 9\u201312 have internet access via personal devices, 58.6% use social media daily, and 22.8% have encountered inappropriate content.",
      "The app\u2019s launch is part of a broader set of government measures aimed at curbing youth violence and aligns with EU plans to strengthen online protections for minors.",

      "Judges in several states may soon get a new tool to stop dangerous drivers from speeding again",
      "A teenager who admitted being \u201caddicted to speed\u201d behind the wheel had totaled two other cars in the year before he slammed into a minivan at 112 mph (180 kph) in a Seattle suburb, killing the driver and three of the five children she was transporting for a homeschool co-op.",
      "After sentencing Chase Daniel Jones last month to more than 17 years in prison, the judge tacked on a novel condition should he drive again: His vehicle must be equipped with a device that prevents accelerating far beyond the speed limit.",
      "Virginia this year became the first state to give its judges such a tool to deal with the most dangerous drivers on the road. Washington, D.C., already is using it and similar measures await governors' signatures in Washington state and Georgia. New York and California also could soon tap the GPS-based technology to help combat a recent national spike in traffic deaths.",
      "\u201cIt's a horror no one should have to experience,\u201d said Amy Cohen, who founded the victims' advocacy group Families for Safe Streets after her 12-year-old son, Sammy Cohen Eckstein, was killed by a speeding driver in front of their New York home more than a decade ago.",
      "Andrea Hudson, 38, the minivan driver who was killed when Jones ran a red light, was building a backyard greenhouse with her husband to help educate several kids who shuttle between homes during the school day, her father, Ted Smith, said.",
      "Also killed in the March 2024 crash near Hudson's home in Renton, Washington, were Boyd \u201cBuster\u201d Brown and Eloise Wilcoxson, both 12, and Matilda Wilcoxson, 13. Hudson's two children were sitting on the passenger side and survived, but they spent weeks in a hospital.",
      "\u201cYou always hear of these horrific accidents, and it\u2019s always far away, you don\u2019t know anybody. But all of a sudden, that\u2019s my daughter,\" Smith said. \u201cThis guy did not swerve or brake. And it was just a missile.\u201d",
      "Smith knew Washington state Rep. Mari Leavitt, who reached out to offer condolences and tell him she was sponsoring legislation to mandate intelligent speed assistance devices as a condition for habitual speeders to get back their suspended licenses.",
      "Leavitt predicts it will have an even more powerful impact than revoking driving privileges, citing studies showing around three-quarters of people who lose their licenses get behind a wheel anyway.",
      "Between 2019 and 2024, the state saw a 200% increase in drivers cited for going at least 50 mph (80 kph) over the speed limit, according to the Washington Traffic Safety Commission.",
      "\u201cI guess I don\u2019t understand why someone is compelled to want to drive that fast,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cBut if they choose to drive that fast with the speed limiter, they can\u2019t. It's going to stop them in their tracks.\u201d",
      "The measure, which Washington legislators passed last month and Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson is expected to soon sign, is called the BEAM Act, using the first letters of the names of the four victims: Buster, Eloise, Andrea and Matilda.",
      "Because Jones, 19, didn't receive a speeding ticket in his two previous crashes, he likely wouldn't have been required to use the speed-limiter ahead of the fatal one. And because it could be 2029 before the law takes effect, the judge's requirement at sentencing only applies to his time on probation after being released from prison, Smith said.",
      "Competing tech companies that joined forces to lobby for ignition interlock requirements for drunken drivers have been working in unison again the last few years to pitch intelligent speed assistance.",
      "Brandy Nannini, chief government affairs officer at one manufacturer, Grapevine, Texas-based Smart Start, said fleet vehicles including school buses in the nation's capital have been trying it out for years.",
      "But it took a lot of refinement before the GPS technology could instantly recognize speed limit changes and compel vehicles with the devices installed to adjust accordingly.",
      "\u201cWe've got a lot more satellites in the sky now,\u201d said Ken Denton, a retired police officer who is the chief compliance officer at Cincinnati-based LifeSafer, part of the coalition of companies.",
      "When court-mandated, the devices would prevent cars from exceeding speed limits or whatever threshold regulators set. An override button allows speeding in emergencies, but states can decide whether to activate it and authorities would be alerted any time the button is pushed.",
      "A more passive version, which beeps to alert drivers when they are going too fast, is required for new cars in the European Union. California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a similar proposal last year, explaining vehicle safety requirements are set by the federal government and he was concerned a patchwork of state laws could stir confusion.",
      "Before Del. Patrick Hope agreed to sponsor the proposal in the Virginia Legislature, he tried out the device in Nannini's car, which was calibrated to not go more than 9 mph (14 kph) over the speed limit.",
      "\u201cThat was my first question: Is it safe?\u201d Hope said.",
      "Not only did he come away convinced it was safe, Hope is now pondering whether to install it on the cars of his three children, all of whom are new drivers.",
      "For those mandated by a court, the price could be hefty: $4 per day and a $100 installation fee. The fee would be reduced for low-income offenders.",
      "Cohen with Families for Safe Streets, which provides support services to the loved ones of crash victims, knows firsthand the kind of impact slowing down speeders can make. A year after her son was struck and killed in front of their New York apartment, another boy was injured in the same spot.",
      "By then, the road's speed limit had been lowered.",
      "\u201cThat boy lived when he was hit, and mine did not,\u201d she said. \"When you are going a few miles slower, there's more time to stop. And when you hit somebody, it's much less likely to be deadly.\u201d",

      "In a post on X Friday, Rockstar Games said it delayed the launch of Grand Theft Auto VI until May 26, 2026. It apologized for the delay of a game, the release of which has been talked about for several years. It didn't provide any specifics on why the release date has been pushed back from fall of this year.",
      "\u201cWith every game we have released, the goal has been to try and exceed your expectations and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe hope you understand we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.\u201d",
      "Shares of Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar\u2019s parent company, fell Friday by nearly 7%.",
      "Strauss Zelnick, the chairman and CEO for Take-Two Interactive Software, stood by Rockstar in a statement and said it supports the company taking additional time to realize their creative vision. He said it still expects a \u201cgroundbreaking, blockbuster entertainment experience that exceeds audience expectations.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto VI, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence,\u201d Zelnick said in a statement. \"As we continue to release our phenomenal pipeline, we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders.\u201d",
      "Fans of the game reacted to the delay with disappointment but also a shrug -- since it has been suggested the game would be released in 2024 and then this year.",
      "On a Reddit discussion forum dedicated to the game, several fans noted they had seen this before and wouldn't be surprised if the release was delayed again. Others took a more optimistic tone, saying an exact release date means it will actually happen this time around.",
      "One of the last times the game garnered this much buzz was in 2023, when a trailer for the game was leaked online. At the time, Rockstar released the first look of the sixth game 15 hours earlier than planned, citing the leak.",
      "That 90-second trailer gave fans a taste of what comes next for the game. The trailer suggested the next installment would be set in the Miami-inspired Vice City and star a female protagonist, a first for the franchise, named Lucia.",
      "It is unclear whether the delay means any, or all, of these details will remain part of Grand Theft Auto VI.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Two major scientific societies on Friday said they will fill the void from the Trump administration's dismissal of scientists writing a cornerstone federal report on what climate change is doing to the United States.",
      "The American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union said they will work together to produce peer-reviewed research documents assessing the current and future national impacts of climate change because a science-based report required by law is suddenly in question and being reassessed by President Donald Trump's White House.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump's Republican administration told about 400 scientists working on the National Climate Assessment that they were no longer needed and that the report was being reevaluated. That report, coming once every four to five years, is required by a 1990 federal law and was due out around 2027. Preliminary budget documents show slashing funding or eliminating offices involved in coordinating that report, scientists and activists said.",
      "\u201cWe are filling in a gap in the scientific process,\u201d AGU President Brandon Jones said. \u201cIt's more about ensuring that science continues.\u201d",
      "Meteorological society past president Anjuli Bamzi, a retired federal atmospheric scientist who has worked on previous National Climate Assessments, said one of the most important parts of the federal report is that it projects 25 and 100 years into the future.",
      "With the assessment \u201cwe're better equipped to deal with the future,\u201d Bamzi said. \u201cWe can't be an ostrich and put our head in the sand and let it go.\u201d",
      "Texas Tech University climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, also chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy, said the two organizations joining to do this report \u201cis a testament to how important it is that the latest science be summarized and available.\u201d",
      "Hayhoe, who was a lead author of reports in 2009, 2018 and 2023, said \u201cpeople are not aware of how climate change is impacting the decisions that they are making today, whether it\u2019s the size of the storm sewer pipes they\u2019re installing, whether it is the expansion of the flood zone where people are building, whether it is the increases in extreme heat.\"",
      "They need that knowledge to figure out how to adapt to harms in the future and even the present, Hayhoe said.",
      "The national assessment, unlike global United Nations documents, highlights what\u2019s happening to weather not just in the nation but at regional and local levels.",
      "Jones said he hopes the societies' version of the assessment can be done in just one year.",
      "The last climate assessment report, released in 2023, said that climate change is \u201dharming physical, mental, spiritual, and community health and well-being through the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events, increasing cases of infectious and vector-borne diseases, and declines in food and water quality and security.\"",
      "In 2018, during Trump's first term, the assessment was just as blunt, saying: \"Climate change creates new risks and exacerbates existing vulnerabilities in communities across the United States, presenting growing challenges to human health and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic growth.\"",
      "But University of Illinois climate scientist Donald Wuebbles, who led one of 2018's two national reports, said he worries about what kind of document this new administration will try to issue, if any.",
      "\u201cI think they'll put out something that will, like, it'll be be scientifically based, but it will be pretty crappy,\u201d Wuebbles told The Associated Press.",
      "Watering down or killing the national assessment will not keep the message about the importance of climate change from getting out, Wuebbles said. The scientific societies' efforts to fill the void will have some value because it will be a statement of the scientific community, and, in the end, he said, science is about data and observations.",
      "\u201cWe know this is an extremely important problem. We know it is human activities driving it. So the question is: What do you do about it?\u201d Wuebbles said.",
      "Storms and wildfires don't care if it's a red state or a blue state, Hayhoe said.",

    "story": [
      "A Wisconsin man has been bitten by snakes hundreds of times, and scientists are studying his blood to treat snakebite",
      "NEW YORK -- Tim Friede has been bitten by snakes hundreds of times \u2014 often on purpose. Now scientists are studying his blood in hopes of creating a better treatment for snake bites.",
      "Friede has long had a fascination with reptiles and other venomous creatures. He used to milk scorpions' and spiders' venom as a hobby and kept dozens of snakes at his Wisconsin home.",
      "Hoping to protect himself from snake bites \u2014 and out of what he calls \u201csimple curiosity\u201d \u2014 he began injecting himself with small doses of snake venom and then slowly increased the amount to try to build up tolerance. He would then let snakes bite him.",
      "\u201cAt first, it was very scary,\" Friede said. \u201cBut the more you do it, the better you get at it, the more calm you become with it.\u201d",
      "While no doctor or emergency medical technician \u2014 or anyone, really \u2014 would ever suggest this is a remotely good idea, experts say his method tracks how the body works. When the immune system is exposed to the toxins in snake venom, it develops antibodies that can neutralize the poison. If it's a small amount of venom the body can react before it's overwhelmed. And if it's venom the body has seen before, it can react more quickly and handle larger exposures.",
      "Friede has withstood snakebites and injections for nearly two decades and still has a refrigerator full of venom. In videos posted to his YouTube channel, he shows off swollen fang marks on his arms from black mamba, taipan and water cobra bites.",
      "\u201cI wanted to push the limits as close to death as possible to where I\u2019m just basically teetering right there and then back off of it,\" he said.",
      "But Friede also wanted to help. He emailed every scientist he could find, asking them to study the tolerance he'd built up.",
      "And there is a need: Around 110,000 people die from snakebite every year, according to the World Health Organization. And making antivenom is expensive and difficult. It is often created by injecting large mammals like horses with venom and collecting the antibodies they produce. These antivenoms are usually only effective against specific snake species, and can sometimes produce bad reactions due to their nonhuman origins.",
      "When Columbia University's Peter Kwong heard of Friede, he said, \u201cOh, wow, this is very unusual. We had a very special individual with amazing antibodies that he created over 18 years.\u201d",
      "In a study published Friday in the journal Cell, Kwong and collaborators shared what they were able to do with Friede's unique blood: They identified two antibodies that neutralize venom from many different snake species with the aim of someday producing a treatment that could offer broad protection.",
      "It's very early research \u2014 the antivenom was only tested in mice, and researchers are still years away from human trials. And while their experimental treatment shows promise against the group of snakes that include mambas and cobras, it's not effective against vipers, which include snakes like rattlers.",
      "\u201cDespite the promise, there is much work to do,\u201d said Nicholas Casewell, a snakebite researcher at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in an email. Casewell was not involved with the new study.",
      "Friede's journey has not been without its missteps. Among them: He said after one bad snake bite he had to cut off part of his finger. And some particularly nasty cobra bites sent him to the hospital.",
      "Friede is now employed by Centivax, which is trying to develop the treatment, and he's excited that his 18-year odyssey could one day save lives from snakebite. But his message to those inspired to follow in his footsteps is quite simple: \u201cDon't do it,\" he said.",

      "British retailer Marks & Spencer says it's \u201cworking day and night\u201d to resolve a cyberattack nearly two weeks ago that has left it unable to process any online orders",
      "LONDON -- British retailer Marks & Spencer said Friday that it's \u201cworking day and night\u201d to resolve a cyberattack nearly two weeks ago that has left it unable to process any online orders, a day after luxury London department store Harrods confirmed it had become the latest target.",
      "With Co-op also having shut down some of its information technology systems as a precaution following a hack, there are growing concerns within the retail sector that hackers are taking calculated risks by trying to replicate the actions of others to cause as much disruption as they can.",
      "According to reports, a hacking group known as Scattered Spider is said to be behind the M&S attack, although this hasn't been confirmed. It remains unclear if the three attacks are linked.",
      "So far, M&S has been the most high-profile victim of the recent spate of attacks, and its chief executive Stuart Machin told customers that he is \u201creally sorry\u201d about the disruption.",
      "\u201cWe are working day and night to manage the current cyber incident and get things back to normal for you as quickly as possible,\" he said.",
      "M&S first reported the issue over the Easter weekend two weeks ago and has seen its operations impacted for more than a week. Initially, the company saw contactless payments and click and collect orders affected, though contactless has since been restored.",
      "Last Friday, it also said it would no longer be able to take orders through its website or app in order to deal with the problem. And the company, which has around 65,000 employees, has been unable to hire new workers after pulling job postings from its website.",
      "London's Metropolitan Police force has launched an investigation into the attack on M&S.",
      "M&S's latest update comes a day after Harrods said it had restricted internet access across its sites as a precautionary measure following an attempt to gain unauthorized access to its systems.",
      "\u201cWe are not asking our customers to do anything differently at this point, and we will continue to provide updates as necessary,\" Harrods said in a statement.",
      "\u201cComing on the heels of recent breaches at Co-op and M&S, it highlights an alarming trend,\" said Cody Barrow, chief executive of cybersecurity experts EclecticIQ. \u201cThe flurry of attacks showed cybercriminals are becoming bolder, exploiting weaknesses across complex, highly interconnected supply chains.\u201d",
      "Experts are saying that generative artificial intelligence is accelerating the threat landscape, and that firms and individuals have to stay on top of developments and shore up their defenses against cyberattacks.",
      "The U.K. National Cyber Security Centre said that it was working with organizations affected as well as providing expert advice to others in the sector.",
      "\u201cThese incidents should act as a wake-up call to all organizations,\" agency CEO Richard Horne said.",

      "A Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus in the 1970s is expected to soon plunge uncontrolled back to Earth",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus in the 1970s is expected to soon plunge uncontrolled back to Earth, possibly within the first two weeks of May.",
      "It\u2019s too early to know where the half-ton mass of metal might come down or how much of it will survive reentry, according to space debris-tracking experts.",
      "Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek predicts the failed spacecraft will reenter around May 10. He estimates it will come crashing in at 150 mph (242 kph), if it remains intact.",
      "\u201cWhile not without risk, we should not be too worried,\u201d Langbroek said in an email.",
      "The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn't break apart, \"the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. \"But it cannot be completely excluded.\u201d",
      "The Soviet Union launched the spacecraft known as Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth orbit because of a rocket malfunction.",
      "Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself \u2014 a spherical object about 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter \u2014 has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude.",
      "It's quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus (nearly 500-kilogram) spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.",
      "Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.",
      "It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics' Jonathan McDowell said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, \u201cit'll reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.\u201d",
      "The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America's Cape Horn. But since most of the planet is water, \u201cchances are good it will indeed end up in some ocean,\u201d Langbroek said.",

      "Ronan the sea lion can still keep a beat after all these years.",
      "She can groove to rock and electronica. But the 15-year-old California sea lion's talent shines most in bobbing to disco hits like \u201cBoogie Wonderland.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe just nails that one,\u201d swaying her head in time to the tempo changes, said Peter Cook, a behavioral neuroscientist at New College of Florida who has spent a decade studying Ronan\u2019s rhythmic abilities.",
      "Not many animals show a clear ability to identify and move to a beat aside from humans, parrots and some primates. But then there\u2019s Ronan, a bright-eyed sea lion that has scientists rethinking the meaning of music.",
      "A former rescue sea lion, she burst to fame around a decade ago after scientists reported her musical skills. From age 3, she has been a resident at the University of California, Santa Cruz\u2019s Long Marine Laboratory, where researchers including Cook have tested and honed her ability to recognize rhythms.",
      "Ronan joined a select group of animal movers and shakers -- which also includes Snowball the famed dancing cockatoo -- that together upended the long-held idea that the ability to respond to music and recognize a beat was distinctly human.",
      "What is particularly notable about Ronan is that she can learn to dance to a beat without learning to sing or talk musically.",
      "\u201cScientists once believed that only animals who were vocal learners \u2014 like humans and parrots \u2014 could learn to find a beat,\u201d said Hugo Merchant, a researcher at Mexico\u2019s Institute of Neurobiology, who was not involved in the Ronan research.",
      "But in the years since since Ronan came into the spotlight, questions emerged about whether she still had it. Was her past dancing a fluke? Was Ronan better than people at keeping a beat?",
      "To answer the challenge, Cook and colleagues devised a new study, published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.",
      "The result: Ronan still has it. She\u2019s back and she\u2019s better than ever.",
      "This time the researchers focused not on studio music but on percussion beats in a laboratory. They filmed Ronan bobbing her head as the drummer played three different tempos \u2014 112, 120, and 128 beats per minute. Two of those beats Ronan had never been exposed to, allowing scientists to test her flexibility in recognizing new rhythms.",
      "And the researchers asked 10 college students to do the same, waving their forearm to changing beats.",
      "Ronan was the top diva.",
      "\u201cNo human was better than Ronan at all the different ways we test quality of beat-keeping,\u201d said Cook, adding that \"she's much better than when she was a kid,\u201d indicating lifetime learning.",
      "The new study confirms Ronan's place as one of the \u201ctop ambassadors\u201d of animal musicality, said University of Amsterdam music cognition researcher Henkjan Honing, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Researchers plan to train and test other sea lions. Cook suspects other sea lions can also bob to a beat \u2014 but that Ronan will still stand out as a star performer.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Conservative activist Robby Starbuck has filed a defamation lawsuit against Meta alleging that the social media giant's artificial intelligence chatbot spread false statements about him, including that he participated in the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Starbuck, known for targeting corporate DEI programs, said he discovered the claims made by Meta's AI in August 2024, when he was going after \u201cwoke DEI\u201d policies at motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson.",
      "\u201cOne dealership was unhappy with me and they posted a screenshot from Meta\u2019s AI in an effort to attack me,\u201d he said in a post on X. \u201cThis screenshot was filled with lies. I couldn\u2019t believe it was real so I checked myself. It was even worse when I checked.\u201d",
      "Since then, he said he has \u201cfaced a steady stream of false accusations that are deeply damaging to my character and the safety of my family.\u201d",
      "The political commentator said he was in Tennessee during the Jan. 6 riot. The suit, filed in Delaware Superior Court on Tuesday, seeks more than $5 million in damages.",
      "In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Meta said that \u201cas part of our continuous effort to improve our models, we have already released updates and will continue to do so.\u201d",
      "Starbuck's lawsuit joins the ranks of several other similar cases in which people have sued AI platforms over information provided by chatbots. In 2023, a conservative radio host in Georgia filed a defamation suit against OpenAI alleging ChatGPT provided false information by saying he defrauded and embezzled funds from the Second Amendment Foundation, a gun-rights group.",
      "When Starbuck discovered the claims made by Meta's AI, he tried to alert the company about the error and enlist its help to address the problem. The complaint said Starbuck contacted Meta\u2019s managing executives and legal counsel, and even asked its AI about what should be done to address the allegedly false outputs.",
      "According to the lawsuit, he then asked Meta to \"retract the false information, investigate the cause of the error, implement safeguards and quality control processes to prevent similar harm in the future, and communicate transparently with all Meta AI users about what would be done.\u201d",
      "The filing alleges that Meta was unwilling to make those changes or \u201ctake meaningful responsibility for its conduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead, it allowed its AI to spread false information about Mr. Starbuck for months after being put on notice of the falsity, at which time it \u2018fixed\u2019 the problem by wiping Mr. Starbuck\u2019s name from its written responses altogether,\u201d the suit said.",
      "Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, responded to a video Starbuck posted to X outlining the lawsuit and called the situation \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is clearly not how our AI should operate,\" Kaplan said on X. \"We\u2019re sorry for the results it shared about you and that the fix we put in place didn\u2019t address the underlying problem.\u201d",
      "Kaplan said he is working with Meta's product team to \u201cunderstand how this happened and explore potential solutions.\u201d",
      "Starbuck said that in addition to falsely saying he participated in the the riot at the U.S. Capitol, Meta AI also falsely claimed he engaged in Holocaust denial, and said he pleaded guilty to a crime despite never having been \u201carrested or charged with a single crime in his life.\u201d",
      "Meta later \u201cblacklisted\u201d Starbuck's name, he said, adding that the move did not solve the problem because Meta includes his name in news stories, which allows users to then ask for more information about him.",
      "\u201cWhile I\u2019m the target today, a candidate you like could be the next target, and lies from Meta\u2019s AI could flip votes that decide the election,\u201d Starbuck said on X. \u201cYou could be the next target too.\u201d",

But it is expected to give the U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s valuable rare earth minerals while providing Kyiv a measure of assurance about continued American support in its grinding war with Russia.",
      "\u201cThis agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides\u2019 commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes at a critical moment in the three-year war as Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with both sides. The signing comes two months after a different but similar agreement was nearly signed before being derailed in a tense Oval Office meeting involving President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Trump has long criticized Zelenskyy, saying he didn\u2019t \u201chave the cards\u201d to win the war and blaming him for prolonging the killing by not giving up Crimea, but in recent days has rebuked Russian President Vladimir Putin as well, saying he was complicating negotiations with \u201cvery bad timing\u201d in launching deadly strikes on Kyiv.",
      "Trump said Wednesday night on NewsNation that the deal, \u201cin theory,\u201d means that the U.S. will get more from Ukraine than it contributed. \u201cI wanted to be protected,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t want to be looking \u201cfoolish\u201d by not getting money back for the investment.",
      "For Ukraine, the agreement is seen as key to ensuring its access to future U.S. military aid.",
      "\u201cTruly, this is a strategic deal for the creation of an investment partner fund,\u201d said Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. \u201cThis is truly an equal and good international deal on joint investment in the development and restoration of Ukraine between the governments of the United States and Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Ukraine\u2019s economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, flew to Washington on Wednesday to help finalize the deal.",
      "\u201cTogether with the United States, we are creating the Fund that will attract global investment to our country,\u201d she said in a post on X after the signing.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Bessent said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House \u2014 hours after Ukrainian officials indicated a deal was nearly finalized \u2014 that there was still work to do.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainians decided last night to make some last-minute changes,\" Bessent said when asked about reports that Ukraine was ready to agree to the pact. \"We\u2019re sure that they will reconsider that. And we are ready to sign this afternoon if they are.\u201d",
      "He didn't elaborate as to the late changes he said Ukraine made.",
      "The U.S. has been seeking access to more than 20 raw materials deemed strategically critical to its interests, including some non-minerals such as oil and natural gas. Among them are Ukraine's deposits of titanium, which is used for making aircraft wings and other aerospace manufacturing, and uranium, which is used for nuclear power, medical equipment and weapons. Ukraine also has lithium, graphite and manganese, which are used in electric vehicle batteries.",
      "After Kyiv felt the initial U.S. draft of the deal disproportionately favored American interests, it introduced new provisions aimed at addressing those concerns.",
      "According to Shmyhal, the latest version would establish an equal partnership between the two countries and last for 10 years. Financial contributions to a joint fund would be made in cash, and only new U.S. military aid would count toward the American share. Assistance provided before the agreement was signed would not be counted. Unlike an earlier draft, the deal would not conflict with Ukraine\u2019s path toward European Union membership \u2014 a key provision for Kyiv.",
      "The Ukrainian Cabinet approved the agreement Wednesday, empowering Svyrydenko to sign it in Washington. The deal still needs to be ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament before it can take effect.",
      "The negotiations come amid rocky progress in Washington's push to stop the war.",
      "Putin backs calls for a ceasefire before peace negotiations, \u201cbut before it\u2019s done, it\u2019s necessary to answer a few questions and sort out a few nuances,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Putin is also ready for direct talks with Ukraine without preconditions to seek a peace deal, he added.",
      "\u201cWe realize that Washington wants to achieve quick progress, but we hope for understanding that the Ukrainian crisis settlement is far too complex to be done quickly,\u201d Peskov said during his daily conference call with reporters.",
      "Trump has expressed frustration over the slow pace of progress in negotiations aimed at stopping the war. Western European leaders have accused Putin of stalling while his forces seek to grab more Ukrainian land. Russia has captured nearly a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory since Moscow's forces launched a full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Trump has long dismissed the war as a waste of lives and American taxpayer money \u2014 a complaint he repeated Wednesday during his Cabinet meeting. That could spell an end to crucial military help for Ukraine and heavier economic sanctions on Russia.",
      "The U.S. State Department on Tuesday tried again to push both sides to move more quickly and warned that the U.S. could pull out of the negotiations if there's no progress.",
      "\u201cWe are now at a time where concrete proposals need to be delivered by the two parties on how to end this conflict,\" department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce quoted Secretary of State Marco Rubio as telling her.",
      "Russia has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day ceasefire, making it conditional on a halt to Ukraine\u2019s mobilization effort and Western arms supplies to Kyiv.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed Wednesday that Ukraine had accepted an unconditional truce only because it was being pushed back on the battlefield, where the bigger Russian forces have the upper hand.",
      "Meanwhile, Ukrainian civilians have been killed or wounded in attacks every day this year, according to a U.N. report presented Tuesday in New York.",
      "The U.N. Human Rights Office said in the report that in the first three months of this year, it had verified 2,641 civilian casualties in Ukraine. That was almost 900 more than during the same period last year.",
      "Also, between April 1-24, civilian casualties in Ukraine were up 46% from the same weeks in 2024, it said.",
      "The daily grind of the war shows no sign of letting up. A nighttime Russian drone attack on Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, Kharkiv, wounded at least 45 civilians, Ukrainian officials said.",
      "Also Wednesday, the Ukrainian Security Service claimed its drones struck the Murom Instrument Engineering Plant in Russia\u2019s Vladimir region overnight, causing five explosions and a fire at the military facility. The claim could not be independently verified.",

      "Three Chinese astronauts have landed back on Earth after six months on China\u2019s space station",
      "BEIJING -- Three Chinese astronauts landed back on Earth on Wednesday after six months on China's space station.",
      "The crew\u2019s landing module came down slowly after separating from the return vehicle, descending on a red-and-white parachute, in Dongfeng, in China\u2019s northern Inner Mongolia region on the edge of the Gobi Desert. Their return had been delayed by a day due to strong winds and low visibility. The area is prone to sandstorms this time of year.",
      "The astronauts, Cai Xuzhe, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze, were launched to the Tiangong space station in October, and they turned over control of the station Tuesday to the new crew that recently arrived to replace them.",
      "The Shenzhou 20 that brought the new crew also carried equipment for space life sciences, microgravity physics and new technology for the space station.",
      "The Tiangong, or \u201cHeavenly Palace,\u201d space station has made China a major player in a new era of space exploration and the use of permanent stations to conduct experiments in space, especially since it was entirely Chinese-built after the country was excluded from the International Space Station over U.S. national security concerns.",
      "China\u2019s space program is controlled by the People\u2019s Liberation Army, the military branch of the ruling Communist Party.",
      "The three Chinese astronauts have carried out experiments and improvements to the space station during their time in space. Two of the astronauts, Cai and Song, conducted a nine-hour spacewalk, the world\u2019s longest, during their mission, China's space agency said.",
      "The country\u2019s space program has grown rapidly in recent years. The space agency has landed an explorer on Mars and a rover on the far side of the moon. It aims to put a person on the moon before 2030.",

    "summary": "Trump, months after taking the oath of office, questioned whether he had a duty to uphold the constitutional right to due process when it comes to mass deportations.",
    "story": [
      "Trump said he would have to consult with his \"brilliant\" lawyers.",
      "President Donald Trump, a little more than 100 days after taking the oath of office, questioned whether he had a duty to uphold the Constitution and the Fifth Amendment right to due process as he expressed frustration on judicial pushback to his mass deportation effort.",
      "During a wide-ranging interview with NBC News \"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker, Trump was asked if he agreed with Secretary of State Marco Rubio that citizens and noncitizens alike are entitled to due process.",
      "\"I don't know,\" Trump responded. \"I'm not a lawyer. I don't know.\"",
      "Welker noted that the Fifth Amendment, which states in part that \"no person\" shall be \"deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,\" says as much.",
      "\"I don't know,\" Trump repeated. \"It seems it might say that, but if you're talking about that, then we'd have to have a million or 2 million or 3 million trials. We have thousands of people that are some murders and some drug dealers and some of the worst people on earth, some of the worst most dangerous people on earth, and I was elected to get them the hell out of here and the courts are holding me from doing it.\"",
      "Asked a final time if, as president, he needed to uphold the Constitution, Trump again deflected.",
      "\"I don't know. I have to respond by saying, again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are obviously going to follow what the Supreme Court said,\" in what's become a new standard answer in interviews when confronted with similar questions about what the law requires him to do.",
      "Legal experts told ABC News that the Fifth Amendment does not make any distinction between citizens and noncitizens. The Supreme Court has held that illegal immigrants are afforded due process rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.",
      "\"Even Justice Scalia, for whom President Trump has expressed great admiration, acknowledged that the plain language of the Fifth Amendment clearly provides every 'person,' not just American citizens, are entitled to the protections of due process,\" Michael Gerhardt, a constitutional law expert at the University of North Carolina, told ABC News.",
      "Scalia's 1993 ruling in which he wrote it was well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings\" was referenced in a recent Supreme Court order mandating detained migrants be given \"reasonable time\" to challenge their removal.",
      "\"President Trump\u2019s failure to acknowledge that he swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution is unprecedented in American history,\" Gerhardt said. \"Most presidents have not been lawyers, but every president, other than Trump, has acknowledged that every federal official, including the president, has the duty to uphold the Constitution.\"",
      "Trump, with his right hand raised, took the oath of office on Jan. 20 as prescribed by Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution.",
      "\"I Donald John Trump do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,\" Trump said during his inauguration.",
      "In another escalation of his standoff with the courts, Trump later on Sunday told reporters that he would seek to appoint judges who won't challenge his deportation plan.",
      "\"I mean, we need judges that are not going to be demanding trials for every single illegal immigrant,\" Trump said while taking questions on Air Force One. \"We have millions of people that have come in here illegally, and we can't have a trial for every single person. That would be millions of trials.\"",
      "Immigration matters are routinely dealt with in a limited hearing or other court proceedings before an immigration judge, not a full-blown trial as Trump suggests, experts say. Those administrative judges are employees of the Department of Justice.",
      "\"It's a minimal due process hearing, but it does provide due process,\" said David Leopold, an attorney and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.",
      "Trump's comments on Sunday were quickly criticized by Democrats and other critics, who pointed to it as what they said was another example of Trump's disregard for constitutional boundaries.",
      "\"This is as un-American as it gets,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer wrote on X.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul also pushed back that \"following the Constitution is not a suggestion.\"",
      "\"It is a guiding force for all of us who work on behalf of the American people. Do you agree?\u201d Paul wrote on X.",
      "\"It is shocking that a sitting president would treat the Constitution as if it's an inconvenience,\" said Leopold.",
      "\"We can't just assume that the government is judge, jury and executioner,\" said Leopold. \"That's not what this country was founded on. That's what an authoritarian country is. We are not an authoritarian country. We are a constitutional republic.\"",

      "Mark Zaid is one of more than a dozen individuals who had clearances revoked.",
      "After having his security clearance revoked by President Donald Trump, high-profile whistleblower attorney Mark Zaid on Monday filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking to have his security clearance restored -- saying that it was revoked for \"improper political retribution.\"",
      "\"The Trump Administration is seeking to neutralize someone viewed as an adversarial threat,\" the complaint, filed in Washington, D.C., stated.",
      "In March, Trump issued a presidential memorandum that revoked the security clearances of more than a dozen individuals, including Zaid, former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, and Hillary Clinton -- a move the complaint says is \"a dangerous, unconstitutional retaliation by the President of the United States against his perceived political enemies.\"",
      "In his memorandum, Trump wrote he had \"determined that it is no longer in the national interest\" for Zaid and others to have access to classified information.",
      "Zaid, according to his complaint, has represented \"whistleblowers in every administration\" dating back to Bill Clinton, doing so \"without regard to party politics\" -- and that the revocation of his clearance is now \"undermining\" his ability to fully represent his clients.",
      "According to the complaint, Zaid has had access to classified information in some capacity for about three decades, since approximately 1995. His first \"fully approved\" clearance, according to the complaint, came in 2002 as part of ongoing litigation. He was granted a \"secret\" clearance, which he maintained for years, until he was increased during the first Trump administration to Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS-SCI) as part of a case he was handling for a DHS whistleblower. He was last \"read out\" of his security in 2024, though it was not fully processed until 2025.",
      "\"In summary, Mr. Zaid has been a practicing attorney for over thirty years and for most of his professional career he has maintained authorized access to classified information,\" the complaint states. \"Indeed, far from being a security risk, he has established himself and has been recognized by legal and non-legal entities as a leader in the legal community and in the national security field specifically.\"",
      "Zaid's complaint says he has already suffered real-world harms as a result of Trump's memo after it was \"blindly implemented\" by a number of agencies. In one instance, the complaint says Zaid was notified in an email from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence's inspector general's office that he was \"denied access to a client's classified complaint\" because he no longer had a security clearance.",
      "\"In sum, Mr. Zaid currently represents multiple clients for whom he now cannot access relevant classified information as part of his effective and zealous representation,\" the complaint states.",
      "Attorneys for Zaid, including Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen, say in the complaint that they suspect Zaid \"came onto President Trump's radar\" when he represented a whistleblower in 2019 who filed a complaint about Trump's 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, leading to his first impeachment.",
      "The complaint says the revocation is a violation of First and Fifth amendments, and asks a judge to declare the presidential memorandum unconstitutional, block any further implementation, rescind the revocation, and \"Require the Defendants to conduct a name-clearing hearing.\"",
      "\"No American should lose their livelihood, or be blocked as a lawyer from representing clients, because a president carries a grudge toward them or who they represent,\" Zaid said in a statement. \"This isn't just about me. It's about using security clearances as political weapons.\"",

      "\"No American president has ever before issued executive orders like the one at issue in this lawsuit targeting a prominent law firm with adverse actions to be executed by all Executive branch agencies but, in purpose and effect, this action draws from a playbook as old as Shakespeare, who penned the phrase: 'The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers,'\" U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell said in a scathing opinion accompanying her ruling.",

      "The ruling from Howell is a rapid rebuke of the government's actions in a case that is just one challenge of several against Trump's efforts to target law firms that have either represented his political opponents or employed them.",
      "Trump's executive order, which cited Perkins Coie's former representation of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, sought to strip security clearances from the firm's lawyers, virtually halting any dealings with the federal government and restricting its attorneys from accessing most federal buildings.",
      "In March, Howell issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from implementing key parts of the executive order.",
      "During a court hearing on April 23, as Howell contemplated a longer lasting block, she again voiced concerns about the constitutionality of Trump's move and sharply questioned government lawyers.",
      "On the day of that hearing, Trump took to social media to criticize the judge by name over her assignment to the case.",
      "Trump has issued similar executive orders targeting four other law firms, while at least nine law firms have entered into controversial deals with the White House, offering millions of dollars in pro bono work on causes supported by conservatives to avoid being targeted.",

      "\"Prices are still going up,\" one expert said.",
      "President Donald Trump on Friday claimed grocery and gas prices are falling, an assertion he's made repeatedly since taking office.",
      "In a post on social media, Trump touted the price levels alongside job growth and tax revenue in a list of gains delivered by his tariff policy.",
      "\"We're only in a TRANSITION STAGE, just getting started!!!\" Trump said.",
      "The claim of a reduction in prices for those essential goods, however, is potentially misleading, economists told ABC News. Since Trump took office, price hikes for food have accelerated and gas prices have stood essentially flat, federal government data shows.",
      "To be sure, overall inflation has eased slightly during Trump's tenure. In January, the year-over-year inflation rate stood at 3%; as of March, the most recent month on record, that rate registered at 2.4%, government data showed. That figure comes in well below a peak attained in 2022.",
      "Even a relatively low level of inflation indicates an increase in price levels, however, since inflation measures the pace of change in prices, David Bieri, an economist at Virginia Tech University, told ABC News.",
      "\"Prices are still going up \u2013 they're just not going up as rapidly,\" Bieri told ABC News.",
      "On April 24, Trump told reporters at the Oval Office: \"Groceries are down.\" Trump repeated the claim on social media on Friday, saying, \"Groceries (and eggs!) down.\"",
      "Grocery prices, which make up a significant share of household budgets, are measured in government price data under the category of \"food at home,\" which sets such items apart from those purchased at restaurants or other dine-out venues.",
      "In January, food at home prices increased 1.9% compared to a year earlier. As of March, the year-over-year inflation rate for such products had accelerated to 2.4%, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed.",
      "When asked about Trump's claim that food prices are falling, Tucker Balch, a finance professor at Emory University, said: \"I'm not aware of any data that supports that.\"",
      "Egg prices -- another cost highlighted by Trump -- have climbed over the early months of Trump's term. In March, egg prices soared 60% higher than a year prior, BLS data showed.",
      "Bird flu has continued to decimate the egg supply, lifting prices, researchers at the University of Tennessee and Mississippi State University found in February.",
      "By contrast, wholesale egg prices -- the amount grocers pay to suppliers -- have dropped significantly since Trump took office, food economists previously told ABC News. It remains unclear when and to what extent that decline in wholesale egg prices will translate into relief for consumers, they said.",
      "While food prices are rising overall, costs for some food items are dropping. Staples like rice, pasta, potatoes, lettuce and tomatoes registered lower prices in March than they had a year prior, BLS data showed.",
      "\"You can always find particular food prices that are falling,\" Carola Binder, an economics professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies inflation, told ABC News. \"There are probably some people out there whose basket of prices is falling because of what they're buying.\"",
      "Trump claimed last month that gasoline prices had fallen as low as $1.98 in a couple of states. On Friday, Trump voiced a similar assertion on social media, saying, \"Gasoline just broke $1.98 a Gallon, lowest in years.\"",
      "The nationwide average price of a gallon of gasoline stands at $3.18, AAA data shows. No state boasts an average price close to $1.98, the data shows.",
      "In Mississippi, the state with the lowest average price, a gallon of gas costs $2.66, AAA says.",
      "Even more, government data shows average gas prices are little changed since Trump took office.",
      "Over the week ending on Jan. 20, the national average price of a gallon of gas stood at $3.10, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA. As of the week ending on April 28, the most recent on record, the average price landed at $3.13, EIA says.",
      "\"That puts gas prices right around where they were when Trump took office,\" Binder said.",
      "By contrast, oil prices have plummeted about 25% since Trump took office. In theory, the decline in the price of oil should eventually push down the price of gasoline, since oil makes up the key input in the refined product that ends up in vehicles, Binder said.",
      "The drop in oil prices is not necessarily a positive indicator, they added. Falling oil prices often suggest expectations of an economic slowdown that would diminish energy demand.",
      "Balch, of Emory University, said the decline in oil prices resulted from expectations of a slowdown in global trade in the aftermath of Trump's tariffs.",
      "\"It's a measure of the expected use of energy in our economy,\" Balch said. \"It is because of Trump's policies but it's not an endorsement of his policies.\"",

    "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/constitution-supreme-court-due-process-trump-deportees-analysis/story?id=121485100",
    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 17:30:57 -0400",
    "summary": "As President Trump tests what \"due process\" means under the law, the courts say his government must take steps to ensure fairness and safety of vulnerable individuals.",
    "story": [
      "The government must provide notice and a hearing in many, but not all, cases.",
      "The text of the Constitution is clear and so is the Supreme Court: All non-citizens on U.S. soil must be afforded \"due process of law.\"",
      "\"There are literally millions of aliens within the jurisdiction of the United States. The Fifth Amendment, as well as the Fourteenth Amendment, protects every one of these persons from deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law,\" the late Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in a unanimous 1976 opinion.",
      "So, what does that mean in practice? Not necessarily a lot.",
      "President Trump professes that he \"does not know\" the specifics but insists that it cannot mean \"a million or 2 million or 3 million trials\" for each person in the country unlawfully.",
      "Legal experts say Trump is right that the Constitution does not guarantee a \"trial\" for every migrant detained and ordered deported at the border or inside the country. In fact, migrants in the country illegally do not have extensive procedural protections from removal. (If they did, it wouldn't have been possible for ICE to deport more than 270,000 last year.)",
      "But in every case, the law does require that the government take certain steps to ensure fairness and the safety of vulnerable individuals.",
      "\"Detainees are entitled to notice and opportunity to be heard appropriate to the nature of the case,\" the Supreme Court unanimously stated last month in a per curiam (unsigned) opinion.",
      "The specifics, however, remain contested. Legal scholars say the type of \"notice\" and \"hearing\" historically afforded depends on an immigrant's status and circumstance, such as whether they had been lawfully admitted to the country in the first place, have deep ties to the community, or are seeking asylum.",
      "Anyone claiming refuge in the U.S. out of fear of persecution in their home country must be given a hearing before an Immigration judge and provided a chance to appeal an adverse decision.",
      "The Supreme Court also ruled last month that anyone detained under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 must be given a chance to seek habeas relief -- or, to challenge their detention -- \"within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to \u2026 before removal occurs.\"",
      "Similarly, immigrants that the U.S. plans to deport to third countries -- rather than their home countries -- must be given a \"meaningful opportunity\" to raise concerns about their safety, including at least 15 days to reopen their immigration proceedings, U.S. District Court Judge Brian Murphy, a Trump appointee, ruled last month.",
      "The administration revealed last month in a federal district court filing that it was providing detainees a one-page form in English that informed them of a right to make a phone call and that they had \"no less than 12 hours\" to \"express an intent\" to challenge their detention by asking for a hearing. The ACLU says that's far too unreasonable a timeline.",
      "In many cases, however, due process does not mean any opportunity to appear before a judge.",
      "Under the \"expedited removal\" program, which Congress created in 1996, the government is authorized to swiftly deport any migrants in the country illegally for less than two years and detained within 100 miles of the border without a hearing.",
      "Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, anyone arriving at a U.S. port of entry without valid legal documents (i.e. a passport or visa) may be summarily removed without a hearing or review.",
      "The Trump administration has not been invoking the expedited removal program in the recent high-profile cases of Venezuelan migrants. Many of those deportations, including that of Kilmar Abrego Garcia sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador, occurred much farther than 100 miles from the border and involved migrants living in the U.S. for two years or longer.",
      "Immigrants who are afforded a hearing before an administrative law judge typically do not enjoy the same procedural guarantees as they might receive in state or federal court.",
      "\"[A]n alien in civil removal proceedings is not entitled to the same bundle of constitutional rights afforded defendants in criminal proceedings,\" explained Circuit Judge Lawrence Van Dyke in a 2021 decision by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. \"Various protections that apply in the context of a criminal trial do not apply in a deportation hearing.\"",
      "The constitutional right to counsel, for example, does not apply to civil removal proceedings. The standards of evidence are much more lax, and most final rulings by immigration judges cannot be reviewed in federal court.",
      "The bottom line: Due process means some degree of notice and hearing in most cases, though the specifics vary widely and remain up for debate. With a number of legal challenges underway, the justices will very likely be weighing in in greater detail. And President Trump says administration lawyers are \"going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said.\"",

      "The image, which was shared on Trump's social media and the official White House account on Friday evening, shows an AI-generated image of the president wearing papal clothes and sitting on a throne.",
      "Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, was asked by reporters about the image after he had finished a service at a church in Rome on Sunday. In his response, Dolan used the Italian words, \"brutta figura,\" meaning the post was embarrassing.",
      "\"I hope he didn't have anything to do with it,\" Dolan said. \"It wasn't good. As Italians say, it was brutta figura.\"",

      "\"We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St. Peter. Do not mock us,\" the conference said on X on Saturday.",
      "Trump said on Monday that it was a joke, and claimed no Catholics were offended.",
      "\"They can't take a joke? You don't mean the Catholics, you mean the fake news media? No, the Catholics loved it,\" Trump said. \"I had nothing to do with it. Somebody made up a picture of me dressed like the pope and they put it out on the internet. That's not me that did it. I have no idea where it came from. Maybe it was AI, but I know nothing about it. I just saw it last evening. Actually, my wife thought it was cute. She said, 'Isn't that nice?'\"",
      "He added, \"Actually, I would not be able to be married, though. That would be a lot. ... To the best of my knowledge, popes aren't big on getting married, are they? Not that we know of.\"",
      "Father James Martin, a papal contributor for ABC, said on \"This Week\" Sunday, \"People were surprised by it and thought it was incredibly poor taste, but over here in Rome more people are concerned about the next pope than the current president.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance, who is Catholic, denied the post was offensive. When conservative commentator Bill Kristol wrote on X, \"Hey, @JDVance, you fine with this disrespect and mocking of the Holy Father?\" the vice president replied, \"As a general rule, I'm fine with people telling jokes and not fine with people starting stupid wars that kill thousands of my countrymen.\"",
      "When asked to respond to the criticism, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump \"flew to Italy to pay his respects for Pope Francis and attend his funeral, and he has been a staunch champion for Catholics and religious liberty,\" according to The Associated Press.",

Mike Lawler\u2019s suburban New York swing district unloaded a barrage of criticism on the Republican during a raucous town hall Sunday night, peppering him with questions around President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive agenda before devolving into a chaotic chorus of boos as attendees were removed by law enforcement.",
      "The town hall in Somers, a leafy section of Lawler\u2019s Hudson Valley district, began to teeter off the rails soon after it began.",

      "At one point, as Lawler was responding to a question about tariffs, security and law enforcement began to surround a woman in the upper stretch of the auditorium.

      "Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, in a letter to Congress alongside the proposal, said the cuts to discretionary funding would lead to \"significant savings.\"",
      "\"The President is proposing base non-defense discretionary budget authority $163 billion -- 22.6 percent below -- current-year spending, while still protecting funding for homeland security, veterans, seniors, law enforcement, and infrastructure,\" Vought wrote.",

Congress will soon have an opportunity to ensure that American power -- and the credibility of our commitments -- are appropriately resourced. I hope and expect that my colleagues will join me in placing America's national security first as we begin the FY26 appropriations process,\" McConnell said.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, expressed alarm the request could severely slash programs many Americans rely on.",
      "\"President Trump has made his priorities clear as day: he wants to outright defund programs that help working Americans while he shovels massive tax breaks at billionaires like himself and raises taxes on middle-class Americans with his reckless tariffs,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "\"This preliminary budget proposal is exceptionally light on details we desperately need -- but this much is clear: Trump wants to eviscerate programs that matter most to working families,\" Murray said.",
      "Where Trump's 2026 budget proposal would cut funding",
      "The budget proposal takes aim at programs that the administration has attacked in the past.",
      "It would cut funding at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which a senior White House official said had \"abusive regulatory decrees\" on gun owners. Cuts would also be in store for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which the official claimed is used to \"target conservative organizations.\"",
      "The budget also calls for huge cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services, including for programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). It also has many cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).",
      "The proposed budget also eliminates USAID's foreign aid, instead putting some foreign aid under the State Department's budget.",
      "There was one notable program that the administration is looking to gut: a benefit program called LIHEAP, which helps subsidize energy bills for low-income individuals across the U.S.",
      "The cutting of funds to this program also runs counter to one of President Trump's campaign promise that he will lower energy bills for Americans on Day 1. A senior White House official, when asked about the proposed cuts to LIHEAP, claimed there was abuse and fraud relating to the program.",
      "\"We don't need a benefit hammock that keeps people out of the workforce. So LIHEAP is actually a fairly critical one of our reductions for accomplishing a lot of trying to get people back to work and dealing with the excessiveness of that, of that benefit,\" the senior White House said.",

    "summary": "Trump announces plans to revive Alcatraz as a federal prison. Explore the infamous facility's history of escape attempts and its transformation from fortress to prison.",
    "story": [
      "Trump's directive has revived debate over the prison that once held Al Capone.",
      "President Donald Trump's surprise announcement over the weekend that he wanted to reopen and expand the notorious Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary in San Francisco Bay is drawing new attention to the infamous prison.",
      "Alcatraz closed its doors as a federal prison 60 years ago after housing some of America's most infamous criminals, including Al Capone and George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly. During its 29-year run as a federal penitentiary from 1934 to 1963, Alcatraz earned a reputation for being the final stop for inmates who couldn't be controlled at other facilities, according to the Bureau of Prisons.",
      "The island's enduring mystique has also attracted Hollywood, most notably for the 1962 film \"The Birdman of Alcatraz,\" starring Burt Lancaster, and the 1996 action thriller \"The Rock,\" starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage. The production team filmed significant portions of \"The Rock\" on location at the actual prison.",
      "Despite its fearsome reputation, Alcatraz was never the prison portrayed in Hollywood films. According to the Bureau of Prisons, the facility maintained a surprisingly small population, averaging between 260 and 275 inmates -- less than 1% of the federal prison population at the time. Some inmates even requested transfers to Alcatraz, attracted by conditions that included single-occupancy cells.",
      "What made Alcatraz unique was its strict regimen. Prisoners were granted just four basic rights: food, clothing, shelter and medical care. Everything else, from family visits to library access, had to be earned through good behavior.",
      "The system was designed to teach compliance, with inmates typically spending five years on the island before being transferred back to other facilities, according to the BOP.",
      "The prison's isolation in San Francisco Bay contributed to its mystique, particularly regarding escape attempts. Over its operational history, 36 men attempted to flee in 14 separate incidents, according to the Bureau of Prisons. While officially no one ever succeeded in escaping, five prisoners remain \"missing and presumed drowned\" to this day.",
      "Contrary to popular belief, the BOP said that man-eating sharks didn't patrol the waters around Alcatraz. The real challenges for would-be escapees were the bay's frigid temperatures (averaging 50 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit), powerful currents and the 1.25-mile distance to shore.",
      "According to the National Park Service, Alcatraz Island receives approximately 1.2 million visitors annually as a national park site, offering tours of the former prison and serving as a symbol that prompts visitors to contemplate issues of crime, punishment and justice -- themes that have resurged in the national conversation following Trump's announcement.",
      "The island's history extends beyond its prison years. Fortified initially as a military installation in the 1850s, Alcatraz formed part of San Francisco Bay's coastal defense system and housed the West Coast's first operational lighthouse, according to the BOP.",
      "The Spanish explorer Juan Manuel de Ayala first named the island \"Alcatraces\" in 1775, according to the BOP, meaning \"pelicans\" or \"strange bird\" -- a far cry from the ominous reputation it would later acquire as America's most notorious federal penitentiary.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has dispatched Vice President JD Vance all over the world in the opening months of the administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- When JD Vance was running for vice president, he walked across an airport tarmac in Wisconsin one August day when his campaign travels happened to intersect those of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and approached Air Force Two. Besides wanting to take a poke at Republican Donald Trump's rival for avoiding the press, Vance said, \"I just wanted to check out my future plane.\u201d",
      "It's an aircraft he now knows well.",
      "In the opening months of Trump's term, Vice President Vance has traveled all over the globe \u2014 family in tow \u2014 to conduct top-level diplomacy for the administration, in addition to taking a number of domestic trips. His international forays have featured a mix of meetings with world leaders, sharply crafted speeches advancing U.S. policy, \u201csoft power\u201d appearances to build goodwill and family time at tourist sites along the way.",
      "Vance's trips have included a five-day trip to Europe in February, a hastily reorganized trek to Greenland in March and a tour of Italy and India in April that was notable for the vice president's brief meeting with Pope Francis the day before the pontiff died.",
      "In his first big moment on the world stage in February, Vance pressed Trump's \u201cAmerica first\u201d message at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris and spoke of maintaining U.S. dominance in the surging industry. From there, he attended a security conference in Munich, where the vice president left his audience stunned with his lecturing remarks about democracy and scant focus on Russia's war against Ukraine.",
      "In March, Vance delivered pointed remarks while in Greenland, scolding Denmark for not investing more in the security of its territory and demanding a new approach. Trump has upset many Greenlanders with his aggressive claims that the U.S. needs to take control of the island away from Denmark.",
      "There's been dealmaking, too.",
      "In India last month, Vance announced after meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi that they had agreed on a negotiating framework for a U.S.-India trade deal. In Italy, he held talks with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, in addition to his separate audiences with the pope and a top Vatican official.",
      "Vance has been accompanied on his overseas trips by his wife, Usha, and their 7- and 5-year-old sons and 3-year-old daughter. The kids are usually in pajamas as they board Air Force Two for the overnight flights.",
      "The Vances have gazed aloft at the newly restored Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City and been photographed, with the children in traditional Indian dress, in front of the Taj Mahal in Agra. Without their children, the Vances also visited Dachau in Germany.",
      "Brad Blakeman, a former senior official in George W. Bush's administration who has provided planning advice to Vance\u2019s office for some of his foreign travel, said that, while some personal time is woven in, these are not vacations.",
      "\u201cYou try and balance the policy with the culture aspect of the trip so that you\u2019re honoring the customs and culture of the places that you are visiting,\u201d he said. Visiting iconic cultural sites while abroad shows respect and builds rapport with host nations that can enhance diplomacy.",
      "It\u2019s also important to be mindful that the president and vice president travel at the public\u2019s expense, he said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the balancing act that always has to be done because of the stewardship of the taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d he said.",
      "Joel Goldstein, a law professor at Saint Louis University who specializes in the U.S. vice presidency, said the journeys also could be intended to build Vance's foreign policy chops.",
      "\u201cPart of foreign travel for a vice president is establishing a national security and diplomatic credential,\u201d he said, noting that it's particularly important for Vance.",
      "At age 40, Vance served just two years in the Senate before ascending to the office.",
      "Vance is also the second-youngest person and the first of the millennial generation to hold the job.",
      "\u201cGenerations\u201d author Jean Twenge, a San Diego State University psychology professor who studies generational differences, said the ease with which Vance moves between work and leisure is emblematic of his generation.",
      "\u201cThe research suggests that, just with internet use and social media use, the lines between work time and family time blur, that you switch tasks much more quickly than, say, Gen Xers or boomers,\u201d she said.",
      "Vance frequently switches gears on the road. Last week, he wedged in a quick beer with service members in Germany \u2014 and autographed the \u201ckegerator\u201d built by one airman \u2014 after days of wall-to-wall official and cultural activities throughout Italy and India.",
      "Usha Vance was originally slated for a solo trip to Greenland with one of their sons to attend a dogsled race. But that plan was scrapped amid growing discontent from the governments of Greenland and Denmark over the visit and Trump\u2019s tough talk of the U.S. taking the territory away from a NATO ally. Instead, the vice president joined the trip, and their visit was limited to a U.S. military base there.",
      "On his Italy trip, Vance took heat on X for being photographed inside the Sistine Chapel. Photography there is usually forbidden, but the session turned out to have been sanctioned by the Vatican, as has happened on past visits by U.S. dignitaries.",
      "A decision during the same trip to close the Roman Colosseum to the public so Usha Vance and the children could take a tour drew some grumbling from tourists stranded outside. A consumer group has since filed a legal complaint.",
      "In India, the Taj Mahal, normally swarming with tourists, was also closed to visitors to accommodate the Vances, according to local media reports.",
      "American officials are often formally invited to make such cultural diversions, and it\u2019s not unusual for the U.S. Secret Service, which provides protection for top U.S. officials, to ask for the sites to be closed to the public for security reasons during presidential and vice presidential tours.",
      "The Vances appear to have tried on occasion to avoid such disruptions. In France, the family visited the Louvre on a Tuesday, a day when the museum is closed to the public.",
      "Other recent vice presidents also have taken family members along on trips. Presidents do, as well.",
      "As vice president, Democrat Joe Biden often took one of his older granddaughters on trips, a practice he continued as president. Presidents' children, including Malia and Sasha Obama and Chelsea Clinton, went along on some trips with their parents, too.",
      "Practices differ, but the idea is the same: Time in office is short, so make the most of it and expose your children to the world.",
      "Usha Vance said as much during the family visit to India, where her parents were born. She hadn't visited in decades, and her husband and children had never been there.",
      "In an interview with India's NDTV, she said she'd been anxious to make the \u201ctrip of a lifetime\u201d with them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been something that I\u2019ve wanted to share with my new nuclear family,\u201d the U.S. second lady said, adding that they knew Vance would have a chance to visit India as vice president. \"We always knew that, when that opportunity arose, we would all come with him.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe think of it as sort of a gateway, the first of many trips to come, I hope,\" she said.",
      "One aim of vice presidential travel abroad is often soft diplomacy, or the building of favorable attitudes toward the U.S. through imagery and symbolism.",
      "When Vance, with his wife of Indian descent and their children, is photographed at the Taj Mahal, it sends a message of solidarity with that nation. When he visits the Vatican and worships there, it emphasizes common ground with Catholics around the world.",
      "Likewise, when Vance appears in public with his children, it could help drive home his quest to encourage large families and build goodwill among American voters, said University of Dayton political scientist Christopher Devine, co-author of \u201cDo Running Mates Matter?\u201d",
      "\u201cI wonder, with JD Vance, if it's an effort to soften his image,\" Devine said. \u201cHe's someone who has not been particularly popular ever since he entered the national scene, and appearing with family tends to make people a little more likable, harder to hate.\u201d",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The U.S. Department of Justice has opened an investigation of the prosecutor\u2019s office in Minnesota\u2019s most populous county after its leader directed her staff to consider racial disparities as one factor when negotiating plea deals.",
      "Harmeet Dhillon, a Republican lawyer who's the new director of the agency's Civil Rights Division, announced the investigation in a social media post Saturday night.",
      "Dhillon posted a letter from Attorney General Pam Bondi to Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty, dated Friday. It said the investigation would focus on whether Moriarty's office \u201cengages in the illegal consideration of race in its prosecutorial decision-making.\u201d",
      "The letter, released to The Associated Press by the Justice Department on Monday, said the investigation was triggered by a new policy adopted by the county attorney that has come under conservative fire in recent weeks.",
      "That policy, which was leaked to local media last month, says racial disparities harm the community, so prosecutors should consider the \u201cwhole person, including their racial identity and age,\u201d as part of their overall analysis.",

      "The Justice Department had already asked the court to pause its decision on the Minneapolis agreement while Dhillon reviews the matter. U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson has given the agency until May 21. Louisville's consent decree is similarly on hold.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is directing the active duty military to shed 20% of its four-star general officers",
      "WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday directed the active duty military to shed 20% of its four-star general officers as the Trump administration moves forward with deep cuts that it says will promote efficiency but that critics worry could result in a more politicized force.",
      "Hegseth also told the National Guard to shed 20% of its top positions and directed the military to cut an additional 10% of its general and flag officers across the force, which could include any one-star or above or officer of equivalent Navy rank.",
      "The cuts are on top of more than a half-dozen top general officers that President Donald Trump or Hegseth have fired since January, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. CQ Brown Jr. They also have fired the only two women serving as four-star officers, as well as a disproportionate number of other senior female officers.",
      "In the earlier rounds of firing, Hegseth said the eliminations were \u201ca reflection of the president wanting the right people around him to execute the national security approach we want to take.\u201d",
      "As Pentagon chief, Hegseth has touted his efforts to root out any programming or leadership that endorses diversity in the ranks, tried to terminate transgender service members and begun sweeping changes to enforce a uniform fitness standard for combat positions.",
      "In a memo announcing the cuts Monday, Hegseth said they would remove \u201credundant force structure to optimize and streamline leadership.\u201d He said the aim was to free the military from \u201cunnecessary bureaucratic layers.\u201d",
      "Adding to the turmoil in the Pentagon, Hegseth in recent weeks has dismissed or transferred multiple close advisers, tightly narrowing his inner circle. He also has been facing questions from both Democrats and Republicans about his handling of sensitive information and use of the Signal messaging app.",
      "There are about 800 general officers in the military, but only 44 of those are four-star general or flag officers. The Army has the largest number of general officers, with 219, including eight four-star generals.",
      "The number of general officer positions in the military is set by law. Members of Congress were not provided with the advance notification they normally would receive on the cuts but were given a \u201cvery brief alert\u201d this afternoon, according to a congressional staffer, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details not made public.",

      "The Pentagon is under pressure to slash spending and personnel as part of the broader federal government cuts pushed by Trump and ally Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.",

      "Also last week the Army confirmed that there will be a military parade on Trump\u2019s birthday in June, as part of the celebration around the service\u2019s 250th birthday. Officials say it will cost tens of millions of dollars.",

      "NEWARK, N.J. -- Flight delays and cancellations persisted at Newark Liberty International Airport Monday, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer calling for an investigation into the \"chaos\u201d sparked by an air traffic controller shortage and thick cloud cover.",
      "Schumer, a Democrat from New York, said he wants an inspector general's investigation into the delays and cancellations to prevent them from getting worse or spreading. New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy called the delays \u201ccompletely and utterly unacceptable\" in a post on X, and said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is \u201ccommitted\u201d to hiring more air traffic controllers.",
      "The delays at the busy airport outside New York City made headlines over the weekend as United Airlines said it was cutting 35 daily flights from its schedule.",
      "As of Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration attributed arriving flight delays of nearly four hours to a combination of staffing and cloud cover.",
      "Here's a closer look at what to know about the delays.",
      "The airport faced disruptions last week as well.",
      "United CEO Scott Kirby said in a letter to customers over the weekend that the technology used to manage planes at the New Jersey airport failed more than once in recent days.",
      "The flight delays, cancellations and diversions that the equipment problems caused were compounded when more than one-fifth of Newark\u2019s traffic controllers \u201cwalked off the job,\u201d he said.",
      "Faulting the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s alleged failure to address \u201clong-simmering\u201d challenges related to the air-traffic control system, United Airlines cut 35 daily flights from its Newark schedule starting Saturday.",
      "Messages seeking comment were left with the air traffic controllers labor union and the federal Transportation Department, which oversees the FAA.",
      "The Trump administration has said an \u201cobsolete\u201d air traffic control system needs to be fixed.",
      "The administration says it\u2019s been trying to \u201csupercharge\u201d the air traffic controller workforce and address the nation\u2019s shortage of controllers. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy last week announced a program to recruit new controllers and give existing ones incentives not to retire.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, a workers\u2019 union, said at the time that those moves could help address staffing shortages, but it also said the system is \u201c long overdue for technology and infrastructure upgrades.\u201d",
      "United\u2019s decision to pare back its flight schedule in Newark comes at an already uncertain period for U.S. airlines. Potential customers across the industry are reconsidering whether to fly for work or for vacation given all the unknowns about what President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war will do to the economy.",
      "Uncertainty is so high that United recently made the unusual move of offering two separate forecasts for how it could perform financially this year: one if there were a recession and one if not.",
      "United flies to 76 U.S. cities and 81 international destinations from Newark.",

      "The family of a man who died after being restrained in an Ohio jail said Monday that the deputies who piled on him stood by for several minutes without trying to save his life after he became unresponsive.",
      "Attorneys for the family said the deputies and jail medical staff members who looked on as Christian Black sat slumped in a restraint chair should be criminally charged in his death.",
      "\u201cThere was no sense of urgency,\u201d said his father, Kenya Black. \u201cYou could clearly see he was unconscious.\u201d",
      "Black, 25, of Zanesville, died on March 26, two days after he was taken from the Montgomery County jail to a hospital in Dayton. He was in the jail after police said he crashed a stolen car.",
      "The county coroner\u2019s office said last week that Black likely died from positional asphyxia, which happens when the chest can\u2019t expand, starving the body of oxygen. His death, which is still under investigation, was ruled a homicide by the coroner.",
      "Montgomery County Sheriff Rob Streck said on Thursday after the coroner's report was released that 10 employees had been put on paid administrative leave. The sheriff called it a procedural step, adding it wasn't an indication of any wrongdoing.",
      "A message seeking comment Monday from the sheriff's office was not immediately returned.",
      "Video from inside the jail released Monday by the family and its attorneys showed Black inside a cell, yelling and repeatedly banging his fist and head against a glass door.",
      "Nine deputies gathered outside the cell, with some rushing in and bringing him to the ground. They pinned Black to the floor and put handcuffs on him before wrestling him into a restraint chair, the video showed.",
      "Black's head flopped and slumped while he was in the restraint chair, which law enforcement agencies sometimes use to secure combative people who are in custody.",
      "The video showed that jail staff checked Black's eyes, took his blood pressure and rubbed his chest while he was unresponsive in the chair. About nine minutes passed between the time he was put in the chair and when the jail staff started CPR, the family's attorneys said.",
      "\u201cHe's dead because of how they handled him,\u201d said Michael Wright, one of the attorneys. \u201cNo one did anything to help.\u201d",

Nearly a decade later, OpenAI has reported its market value as $300 billion and counts 400 million weekly users of ChatGPT, its flagship product.",

      "Jurors have begun deliberating over whether former Grand Rapids police officer Christopher Schurr was justified when he shot and killed Patrick Lyoya, a 26-year-old Congolese immigrant, in April 2022",
      "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- Jurors began deliberations Monday over whether a former Michigan police officer could have reasonably feared that he was at risk of great bodily injury or death when he shot and killed 26-year-old Patrick Lyoya, a Congolese immigrant, over three years ago.",
      "In closing statements Monday morning, prosecutors said videos of a traffic stop show that former Grand Rapids officer Christopher Schurr was not in danger at the time, while defense attorneys argued the same videos show Lyoya had control of Schurr's Taser, a weapon that discharges small amounts of electricity to incapacitate someone. Schurr, who is white, was charged with second-degree murder and faces up to life in prison if convicted.",
      "Jurors have the option to convict Schurr of the lesser charge of manslaughter, which carries a sentence of up to 15 years in prison and/or a fine of up to $7,500.",
      "\u201cI hope you're not getting callous,\u201d Kent County prosecutor Christopher Becker said to the jury in his closing statement. \u201cHow many times have you watched this video of another person \u2014 Patrick \u2014 dying over and over and over again?\"",
      "Jurors watched videos of the shooting \u2014 taken from multiple angles on a doorbell camera, body camera, dashboard camera and a bystander\u2019s cellphone \u2014 numerous times throughout the trial, sometimes side by side and sometimes frame by frame.",
      "Schurr pulled over a vehicle driven by Lyoya for improper license plates in April 2022 in a residential Grand Rapids neighborhood, roughly 150 miles (240 kilometers) west of Detroit. Video footage shows Schurr struggling to subdue Lyoya as they grappled over the officer\u2019s Taser. Schurr told Lyoya to stop resisting and drop the weapon multiple times throughout the encounter.",
      "While Lyoya was facedown on the ground with Schurr on top of him, the officer took out his gun and shot him once in the back of the head.",
      "Schurr testified last week that he thought Lyoya was going to use the Taser against him.",
      "Referencing photos of the encounter shown to the jury, Becker argued that Lyoya was trying to avoid being shot with the Taser and was attempting to get away from Schurr, rather than harm him. Lyoya never had a tactical advantage over Schurr, Becker said, and did not pose a threat.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t take a life without a darn good reason,\u201d Becker said.",
      "Lead defense attorney Matthew Borgula walked jurors through the traffic stop again during his closing, arguing that Schurr performed his duties as a police officer reasonably at each moment.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s doing his job,\" Borgula said.",
      "Borgula said Schurr was on Lyoya's back because he was trying to get the Taser back. He said officers do not have to wait to be injured to use deadly force, referencing testimony from several high-ranking Grand Rapids police officers last week. Schurr was fired from the department shortly after he was charged in 2022.",
      "\u201cChristopher Schurr was at work, and he was faced with the toughest decision of his life in half a second,\" Borgula said.",
      "The fatal shooting prompted weeks of protest in Grand Rapids, and demonstrators on both sides have protested outside of the Kent County courthouse during the trial. Civil rights groups decried the shooting as part of a pattern of aggression perpetuated against Black people in the U.S. by white officers.",

      "Trump says Alcatraz, now part of the National Park Service, suddenly is needed to house America\u2019s \u201cmost ruthless and violent\u201d criminals. It's where the government sent notorious gangsters Al Capone and George \u201cMachine Gun\u201d Kelly as well as lesser-known men who were considered too dangerous to lock up elsewhere.",

      "Alcatraz is in San Francisco Bay off the coast of San Francisco and visible from the Golden Gate Bridge. It is best known for its years as a federal prison, from 1934-63, but its history is much longer.",
      "President Millard Fillmore in 1850 declared the island for public purposes, according to the park service, and it soon became a military site. Confederates were housed there during the Civil War.",
      "By the 1930s, the government decided that it needed a place to hold the worst criminals, and Alcatraz became the choice for a prison.",
      "\u201cA remote site was sought, one that would prohibit constant communication with the outside world by those confined within its walls,\u201d the park service said. \u201cAlthough land in Alaska was being considered, the availability of Alcatraz Island conveniently coincided with the government\u2019s perceived need for a high security prison.\u201d",
      "The remoteness eventually made it impractical. Everything from food to fuel had to arrive by boat.",
      "\u201cThe island had no source of fresh water,\u201d according to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, \u201cso nearly one million gallons of water had to be barged to the island each week.\u201d",
      "The cost to house someone there in 1959 was $10.10 a day compared with $3 at a federal prison in Atlanta, the government said. It was cheaper to build a new prison from scratch.",
      "Despite the location, many prisoners tried to get out: 36 men attempted 14 separate escapes into the bay, according to the FBI. Nearly all were caught or didn\u2019t survive the cold water and swift current.",
      "\u201cEscape from Alcatraz,\u201d a 1979 movie starring Clint Eastwood, told the story of John Anglin, his brother Clarence and Frank Morris, who all escaped in 1962, leaving behind handmade plaster heads with real hair in their beds to fool guards.",
      "\u201cFor the 17 years we worked on the case, no credible evidence emerged to suggest the men were still alive, either in the U.S. or overseas,\u201d the FBI said.",
      "Alcatraz became part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and was opened to the public in 1973, a decade after it was closed as a prison.",
      "The park service says the island gets more than 1 million visitors a year who arrive by ferry. A ticket for an adult costs $47.95. Visitors can see the cells where prisoners were held.",

      "Department of Environmental Protection officials have been planning for years to temporarily shut down a section of the Delaware Aqueduct north of the city to address the leak of up to 35 million gallons per day, almost all of it beneath the Hudson River. The planned eight-month shutdown will allow workers to hook up a bypass tunnel that has been constructed under the river.",
      "City officials announced the shutdown of the aqueduct last fall, timing the cutoff of water from the Catskill region for when seasonal demands are lower. But the work was paused in November due to a drought warning and low levels in the city\u2019s other reservoirs.",
      "The delay means the environmental agency will have to enter into a new contract for the construction work. Officials also remain concerned about below-average precipitation and plan to upgrade the aqueduct\u2019s pumps. So they don\u2019t expect the project to be completed until after 2027.",

      "About 3,000 labor union members have gone on strike at jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney in Connecticut, as negotiations over wages, retirement benefits and job security broke down",
      "EAST HARTFORD, Conn. -- About 3,000 labor union members went on strike early Monday at jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney in Connecticut, as negotiations over wages, retirement benefits and job security broke down.",
      "Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers were picketing at manufacturing locations in East Hartford and Middletown, after about 77% of nearly 2,100 union members voted to approve their first strike since 2001, union officials said. Their contract expired late Sunday.",
      "\u201cPratt and Whitney is a powerhouse in military and commercial aerospace products because our membership makes it so,\u201d David Sullivan, the union's eastern territory vice president, said in a statement. \u201dThis offer does not address the membership concerns, and the membership made their decision \u2014 we will continue to fight for a fair contract.\u201d",
      "The company, a subsidiary of Arlington, Virginia-based RTX Corp., called its latest wage and retirement proposal competitive, and said its workforce is among the most highly compensated in the region and industry.",
      "\u201cOur message to union leaders throughout this thoughtful process has been simple: higher pay, better retirement savings, more days off and more flexibility,\u201d the company said in a statement. \"We have no immediate plans to resume negotiations at this time and we have contingency plans in place to maintain operations and to meet our customer commitments.\u201d",
      "The company said its latest contract proposal included an immediate 4% wage increase, followed by a 3.5% increase in 2026 and a 3% increase in 2027. It also included a $5,000 contract ratification bonus and enhanced pension and 401k plan benefits.",
      "Pratt & Whitney makes engines for commercial and military jets, including the GTF line for Airbus commercial jets and the F135 for the military's F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft fleet.",

      "Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff is among many Democrats looking to find the right path to challenge President Donald Trump and Republicans after the GOP won the White House and congressional majorities in 2024",
      "MARIETTA, Ga. -- There's the Jon Ossoff who built his political career around criticizing Donald Trump.",
      "There's also the Ossoff who works with Republicans, advancing the interests of Georgia's farmers and military bases.",
      "But they\u2019re the same guy \u2014 a 38-year-old first-term U.S. senator from Georgia who says his race will be the \u201cmain event\u201d in 2026. He's the only Democratic senator seeking reelection from a state Trump carried in winning last year's presidential election.",
      "Ossoff is among many Democrats looking for the right way to challenge Trump and Republicans after the GOP won the White House and congressional majorities in 2024. While some Democrats may be eyeing the presidency in 2028, Ossoff has a more immediate goal -- retaining his seat in Georgia, where Republicans hope to pad their narrow Senate majority.",
      "Still, midterm elections typically favor the party opposing the president. And Republicans in recent years have often nominated candidates seen by moderates as as too extreme, including in Georgia.",
      "Ossoff, meanwhile, picks his spots carefully, challenging Trump vigorously on some fronts while still professing a willingness to work with him. In recent weeks, he launched his reelection bid with a blistering critique of Trump's second term, weathered criticism from Democrats that he wasn't fighting hard enough, and touted patriotism and service to potential military academy students at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta.",
      "Ossoff says there\u2019s no clash between bipartisanship and fighting Trump, but in this still-early stage of the second Trump administration, he's clearly looking to strike the right balance. Georgia voters returned to Trump in 2024 after narrowly choosing Democrat Joe Biden in 2020 and giving Democrats control of the Senate by electing Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in twin runoffs.",
      "\u201cMy first and highest obligation is to deliver for the state of Georgia,\u201d Ossoff said in an interview with The Associated Press, vowing to pursue \u201copportunities to work with this administration or to continue to partner with Republicans in Congress.\u201d",
      "But Ossoff isn't new to criticizing Trump. He became a resistance hero in his unsuccessful 2017 run in the first special election of Trump's first term, setting a then-record for spending on a House seat.",
      "\u201cWe have never seen a president try to wield the federal government to crush his critics and political adversaries. That is something new in American history, and it is, in my view, un-American,\u201d Ossoff said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s something that should chill us to the bone, no matter our politics, no matter our policy preferences.\u201d",
      "At a recent town hall, some voters pressed Ossoff to more directly confront Trump.",
      "\u201cDo you think that there\u2019s nothing going to be done?\" asked Kate Denny, of Avondale Estates. \u201dNo. Do something more.\"",
      "While Ossoff told Denny that \u201cthere is no doubt that this president\u2019s conduct has already exceeded any prior standard for impeachment,\u201d he also said he has \u201cno magic button\u201d to stop Trump. The only reliable solution, he said, is reclaiming the House and the Senate.",
      "Ossoff said he won't change his approach.",
      "\u201cI am who I am, and I speak directly, I speak candidly,\" Ossoff said. \"I also think before I speak.\u201d",
      "Democrats had hoped 2021 victories by Ossoff and Warnock signaled the party's resurgence in Georgia. But Republican Gov. Brian Kemp cruised to reelection in 2022 over Democrat Stacey Abrams. Warnock needed a runoff to dispatch the flawed Senate campaign of former football star Herschel Walker.",
      "In 2024, Georgia voters favored Trump over then-Vice President Kamala Harris by 2 percentage points. Many Republicans bet Ossoff's election in 2020 was a fluke and aim to keep him from running to the center as Warnock did in 2022.",
      "\u201cOssoff's far-left politics only worked in specific moment of GOP chaos,\u201d Republican political consultant Dan McLagan said. \u201cNow it's like he's showing up at a Lee Greenwood Fourth of July concert with a \u2018Free Palestine\u2019 sign and a Che Guevara T-shirt. Everyone has already seen him, and it's too late to change his clothes.\u201d",
      "Even within his own party, Ossoff's course hasn't always been smooth. Some Black Democrats took offense at his effort to oust U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams of Atlanta as chair of the Democratic Party of Georgia. The party changed its rules to make the position paid and full time, with Williams stepping down before Democrats elected a new chair Saturday. Ossoff said he asked Williams to quit, saying that to progress \u201cGeorgia Democrats need a statewide party organization with nationally unparalleled professionalism, resources and capabilities.\u201d",
      "The first Jewish senator from Georgia, Ossoff also upset many Jewish voters when he supported a November resolution by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, to block the sale of some weapons to Israel.",
      "The vote earned Ossoff a public letter of rebuke from many Jewish institutions, including The Temple, the historic Atlanta synagogue where he had his bar mitzvah. A second letter, first reported by The New York Times, was sent privately by top Jewish donors to Kemp urging him to seek Ossoff's seat.",
      "In April, Ossoff voted against a new set of Sanders resolutions, and tensions have eased, said Alli Medof, a Democrat long active for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel group. \u201cThe temperature is lowered, but the trust level is not yet restored,\" she said.",
      "Ossoff touts his success in getting India to lower tariffs on Georgia-grown pecans and has cultivated voters in Republican areas beyond Atlanta. He enthusiastically backed Biden's incentives to build electric vehicles and has competed with Kemp to take credit for investments.",
      "Ossoff walks a finer line on immigration. He voted for the Laken Riley Act, which requires detention of immigrants who are in the U.S. illiegally and are accused of theft and violent crimes. The law is named after a slain Georgia nursing student whose case Republicans publicized. Ossoff said that Americans \u201cdeserve secure borders\u201d and that \u201cthe Biden administration failed in its border policies,\" but he also says immigration policy must be \"humane.\u201d",
      "Republicans have already launched ads attacking Ossoff's opposition to a bill barring schools from allowing transgender women to participate in women\u2019s sports. Ossoff calls that an obsession most voters don't share.",
      "One of Ossoff's trademark moves is to announce investigations \u2014 a callback to his job producing documentaries examining corruption before he ran for the Senate.",
      "\u201cI think that in some ways, Congress has neglected now for decades the vigorous use of our oversight authorities,\" Ossoff said at the town hall.",
      "One investigation led to the Federal Prison Oversight Act, which mandated prison inspections and created an ombudsman to investigate complaints. But not all reform moves have succeeded. After announcing a bipartisan agreement in July to ban congressional stock trading \u2014 a major theme of Ossoff's winning campaign against Republican Sen. David Perdue \u2014 the deal went nowhere.",
      "One question is who Ossoff's Republican opponent will be. Kemp, likely the strongest GOP candidate, may decline to run. If he opts out, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is one possible Republican candidate.",
      "Greene could be Ossoff's dream opponent, and he has seemed to invite her entry \u2014 betting the north Georgia firebrand would repel swing voters who couldn't stomach Walker.",
      "Either way, the race won't be cheap. Ossoff raised $11.2 million in 2025's first quarter and is already spending heavily.",
      "Ossoff declines to discuss possible opponents but says he's ready.",
      "\u201cI welcome any challenger,\" he said, \u201cand I am more than prepared for any challenger.\u201d",

      "GLENDALE, Ariz. -- A fight between groups of people with a history of \u201cbad blood\u201d escalated Sunday night into a shooting outside a concert and car show at a suburban Phoenix restaurant, leaving three dead including a teenager and five others injured, police said.",
      "The shooting outside El Camaron Gigante Mariscos & Steakhouse was an \u201cisolated incident,\" and authorities believe more than one person fired shots, said Glendale Police Department spokesperson Jose Santiago. Between 200 and 300 people were in attendance at the outdoor venue when the shooting broke out.",
      "Santiago said multiple people were being questioned Monday, but no arrests had been made and police are still searching for other possible suspects.",
      "\u201cOur detectives are trying to narrow down the scope of how many shooters we are dealing with,\" Santiago said.",
      "The police department identified the dead as brothers Damien Anthony Sproule, 17, and Christopher Juaquin Sproule, 21, as well as Milo Christopher Suniga, 21.",
      "The wounded included a 16-year-old boy who was critically injured and required surgery overnight, but Santiago said he was expected to survive. Other people between the ages of 20 and 23 were injured.",
      "In a statement Monday, the restaurant said it was cooperating with the police investigation while trying to make sense of a \u201cheartbreaking event.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur hearts go out to the victims, their families, and all affected by this senseless violence,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Social media videos shared by the restaurant earlier Sunday before the shooting showed people dancing near a stage with a DJ booth.",
      "Santiago said event organizers removed a group of people from the venue after they started fighting near the stage. They began shooting at each other just outside of the event, Santiago said.",
      "Bystander Lupe Rodriguez said he ran to safety when he heard the gunshots. He was shaken, but said he was grateful that he and his friends survived.",
      "\"There was a man on the ground, and it didn\u2019t look like he made it,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cHis father was yelling out his name.\u201d",

      "Students and faculty at Dakota State University are facing free speech concerns for the first time now that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is set to deliver the commencement speech May 10",
      "MADISON, S.D. -- Dakota State University hasn't experienced the student protests taking place at other U.S. colleges. Nestled in rural South Dakota, most of the nearly 4,000 students have been focused on their studies or job hunts, avoiding politics and partisan groups.",
      "Until now.",
      "The university administration decided to award an honorary doctorate to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and invited her to give a commencement speech May 10, bringing politics to the campus.",
      "In response, students have planned a rally on graduation day opposing the former South Dakota governor and the Trump administration and expect protestors from across southeast South Dakota to join them.",
      "They want to speak out against the federal government\u2019s immigration policies, which are being implemented with Noem's oversight, on behalf of peers who fear for their legal status. They also are expected to protest Noem's anti-LGBT actions during her time as governor.",
      "Some students and faculty also said they thought the honorary degree was too high an honor to bestow upon her.",
      "Among DSU students, many are unsure if they should join the objections or stay quiet to avoid the kind of punishments suffered by students at more outspoken colleges.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere is tense,\u201d humanities instructor Daniel Spencer said. \u201cStudents are afraid of making their voices heard.\u201d",
      "Students studying in its renowned cybersecurity program have traditionally been hesitant to take political stances because they fear potential blowback when they later seek government and private sector jobs.",
      "DSU\u2019s location in Madison, a small town about an hour\u2019s drive northwest of Sioux Falls, also is a factor.",
      "\u201cMany of our students are from rural South Dakota, and there's a bit of an unwillingness to confront authority,\u201d Professor Emeritus Dale Droge said. \u201cWe don't have very many students in the political sciences or history where they might be thinking about these more civil rights kind of actions.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of international students who attend DSU and haven't yet been affected by recent DHS actions are weighing their participation options. The agency had terminated the legal status of more than 1,000 international students before reversing course and outlining a new policy for those terminations.",
      "\u201cI have international students coming to me from outside of the senate, across campus, who expressed to me that they don\u2019t want to get involved in any of this because they have fears of getting their visas revoked,\u201d said Anden Wieseler, a DSU junior and student senate vice president.",
      "DSU selected Noem because she was an \u201cunwavering champion of Dakota State\u201d during her time as governor, university spokesperson Andrew Sogn said in a written statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Noem supported the university's cybersecurity initiatives and helped secure millions of dollars in funding, cementing the school's standing as a national cybersecurity leader, Sogn said.",
      "\u201cShe was asked to share remarks with DSU\u2019s graduates based on her distinguished and ground-breaking career in public service, and her many efforts to support the citizens of the state of South Dakota and the nation,\u201d Sogn said.",
      "Noem's office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "DSU President Jos\u00e9-Marie Griffiths nominated Noem to receive an honorary doctorate, though the university declined to provide details of the offer. The general faculty and student senate voted against the nomination, with only one of the 15 student senators voting in favor of the nomination, Wiesler said.",
      "\u201cThere is a fear among a lot of the international student body on speaking on this matter, just a result of the current political climate,\u201d said Tyler Sprik, a freshman and student senator. \u201cThat's part of the reason me and several other senators have become so involved \u2014 it's because a lot of our colleagues can't.\"",
      "Faculty members also are apprehensive to share their opinions publicly. Some said the administration discouraged them from speaking to media and joining student rallies. Some cited President Donald Trump's heightened scrutiny on higher education as reason for caution.",
      "Other students said they feared reprisal from the administration and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they didn\u2019t want to jeopardize their jobs.",
      "While faculty members are welcome to speak with the media, DSU faculty are afforded fewer protections than in other states due to a 2020 state law outlawing faculty unions at public colleges, Sogn said.",
      "Droge is troubled by the reluctance to speak out.",
      "\u201cIt is very concerning to me that we\u2019ve reached a point in not just Dakota State, but in so many institutions that people are afraid to speak freely even on issues like this of free speech and principles and ethics,\u201d Droge said. \u201cThese things aren\u2019t against the university in any way but it\u2019s about allowing people to speak their minds freely.\u201d",
      "Some faculty members also said having a high-profile figure at commencement may take attention away from the graduates.",
      "\u201cThe biggest chatter I've heard from students and other faculty is first and foremost concern that there will be a disruption to the commencement, which we all feel is so important to the students that are there,\u201d said Stephen Krebsbach, a computer science professor.",
      "Still, many students are preparing for the rally.",

      "If he is convicted, prosecutors will seek the death penalty. Cooksey has said the allegations against him are false and pleaded not guilty.",
      "In earlier years, two other serial shooting cases sparked fear in metro Phoenix, prompting some people to stay indoors after dark or stay off freeways where they occurred. Unlike those cases, the killings Cooksey is accused of did not occur over a matter of months and generated no publicity until his arrest.",

      "Cooksey knew some of the victims intimately, but others were strangers. Most of the shootings happened in the evening and overnight. Police never released a motive but said Cooksey was responsible.",
      "Parker Smith and Andrew Remillard were the first victims, shot while sitting inside a vehicle in a parking lot. Five days later security guard Salim Richards was fatally shot on the way to his girlfriend\u2019s apartment. Prosecutors say Cooksey and Richards fought physically and Cooksey walked away with Richards' gun and necklace.",
      "Latorrie Beckford and Kristopher Cameron were killed in separate shootings at apartment complexes in Glendale.",
      "Maria Villanueva was expected at her boyfriend\u2019s apartment in Glendale, but police say Cooksey drove away with her in her vehicle. The next day her body, naked from the waist down, was found in a Phoenix alley. Authorities say she had been sexually assaulted and Cooksey\u2019s DNA was found on her body.",
      "Finally, on Dec. 17, 2017, Cooksey answered the door when officers acting on a report of gunshots showed up at his mother's apartment. Officers noticed a lot of blood. Cooksey said he had cut his hand and was the only one home, according to police. Cooksey\u2019s mother, Rene Cooksey, and stepfather, Edward Nunn, were found dead. Before he was detained, police say, Cooksey threatened to slit an officer\u2019s throat.",
      "On the sofa in the living room, investigators found Richards\u2019 gun, which was later linked to the killings of Beckford, Cameron and Villanueva. The keys to Villanueva\u2019s vehicle also were found there, and police say Cooksey was wearing Richards' necklace when he was arrested.",
      "In a January 2020 handwritten letter to a judge over the impending postponement of his trial, Cooksey said he was in an \u201cupmost hurry\u201d to prove \u201cmy charges are no more than false accusations\u201d and \u201cwhat better way to do so than\u201d a not-guilty verdict. An aspiring musician, he said he was not a rapist or murderer: \u201cI am a music artist.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press left a phone message and email seeking comment from Robert Reinhardt, a lawyer representing Cooksey.",
      "Despite wanting to exercise his right to a speedy trial, Cooksey's case encountered postponements due to the pandemic, which interfered with preparation including the ability of experts to evaluate Cooksey.",
      "Earlier in the case, his lawyers raised questions about a claim police made around the time of his arrest that Cooksey was suspected of a ninth killing. But prosecutors ultimately declined to charge Cooksey in the December 2017 shooting death of Jesus Real at his home in Avondale.",
      "According to police, Real\u2019s sister and Cooksey had broken up the night before. Prosecutors said they had no reasonable likelihood of winning a conviction.",
      "Cooksey\u2019s arrest came after two serial shooting cases in recent years.",
      "From late August to early September 2015, a total of 11 shootings occurred on freeways. No one was seriously hurt when eight vehicles were hit with bullets and three others with projectiles such as BBs or pellets. But a 13-year-old was cut by glass.",
      "Charges were later dismissed against the only person charged in the shootings, who went on to win a rare court order declaring him officially cleared of the allegations.",
      "The next serial shooting case came over nearly a one-year period that ended in July 2016. Aaron Juan Saucedo, a bus driver, has been charged with first-degree murder and other charges in the attacks, which killed nine people. He was arrested in April 2017.",
      "Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Saucedo, who has pleaded not guilty. His trial is scheduled for December.",

      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- An ambitious project to restore a rapidly vanishing stretch of Louisiana coast that was devastated by the 2010 Gulf oil spill has been thrown deeper into disarray amid claims by Gov. Jeff Landry that his predecessor concealed an unfavorable study that it was feared could imperil the $3 billion effort.",
      "It's a controversy that was even predicted by the previous administration as it grappled with how to handle conflicting environmental analyses for the project, according to a confidential memo obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The nine-page document, prepared by five attorneys working for then-Gov. John Bel Edwards' administration, sheds new light on a study Landry says was improperly withheld from the public and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as it was approving a permit for the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion.",
      "The stakes were so high the attorneys even weighed whether state officials could face federal charges for withholding from the Corps a report that the diversion would generate significantly less land than another modeling projection used in a federal review.",
      "Prosecution seemed \u201cextremely unlikely,\u201d the lawyers wrote to the heads of the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, which oversees the diversion project, but they added that \u201cthe severe consequences and criminalization of the action warranted mention.\u201d",
      "The attorneys also warned that the Corps might suspend or revoke the permit if it discovered the study after the fact, the 2022 memo shows, foreshadowing actions taken last month when the Corps cited \u201cdeliberately withheld\u201d information among its reasons for suspending its permit for the project. The move halts construction despite more than half a billion dollars already spent.",
      "\u201cThey hid the bad stuff and only showed the (Corps) the version they liked,\u201d Landry wrote in a post on X. \u201cScience is easy when you just delete the inconvenient parts!\u201d",
      "Edwards denied his administration withheld information from the Corps and said \u201cGov. Landry\u2019s accusations are demonstrably false.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen all the facts are presented, the public will see that his administration has played political games and botched this important project,\u201d Edwards said in a statement to AP.",
      "Landry countered in his own statement that \u201cthe facts speak for themselves.\u201d",
      "Amid the finger-pointing, conservation proponents have called the report in question a red herring that Landry is using to tank the project. The diversion, funded mostly from a settlement arising from BP\u2019s 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, is the largest of its kind in Louisiana\u2019s history.",
      "The Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion would puncture levees in southeast Louisiana, diverting some of the river\u2019s sediment-rich flow to restore wetlands. The long-delayed project was intended to mitigate a disappearing coastline caused by a range of factors such as climate change-induced sea-level rise and the river\u2019s vast levee system. Ground was broken in 2023, but state and federal litigation has stalled it.",
      "Opponents have blasted its ballooning cost and crippling effects on the local fishing and oyster industries. Landry has said the project would \u201cbreak\u201d Louisiana\u2019s culture of shrimp and oyster harvesting, likening it to government efforts a century ago to punish schoolchildren for speaking Cajun French.",
      "Earlier this year, Landry's administration approached the Corps with a list of concerns about the project, including a 2022 study it said \u201cdoes not appear to have been disclosed to the public nor considered by all necessary persons within the Corps.\u201d",
      "Officials working for the state at the time defended their handling of the report in question, saying it had been focused on analyzing maintenance and operational costs related to the diversion and was not intended to be part of the federal environmental impact statement process.",
      "The report, prepared by AECOM Technical Services and a subcontractor, produced \u201cinconsistent\u201d results such as a significantly lower projected land creation \u2014 as few as 7 square miles (18 square kilometers) compared to the 21 square miles (54 square kilometers) estimated under the primary model, according to the confidential memo.",
      "Officials familiar with the study said its lower projection resulted from not properly accounting for sea level rise and underestimating the river's flow. The memo also pointed to the need for \u201csignificant dredging\u201d to maintain the diversion channel, which Landry's administration now says will cost tens of millions of dollars.",
      "In the memo, the attorneys outlined a series of \u201creputational concerns\u201d about withholding the study and warned it would be more difficult to keep \u201ccontrolling the narrative\u201d if the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority \u201cis on the defensive.\u201d",
      "The memo noted the Corps and other federal agencies could delay the project for years if they attempted to integrate the modeling results into their environmental impact analysis. Failing to formally disclose the modeling results to federal agencies like the Corps, the attorneys warned, also would leave the project vulnerable to litigation.",
      "They suggested the Edwards administration \u201cinformally discuss\u201d the issue with federal agencies and then strategize the best way to \u201cformally\u201d enter it into the public record for the agencies to review.",
      "The report's findings eventually were verbally communicated to at least one Corps official, who indicated it was insignificant, according to multiple former Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority officials familiar with the exchange. But the complete analysis itself was not submitted into the public record, nor was the official's response at the time, they said.",
      "The former state officials weren't authorized to discuss internal deliberations and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Col. Cullen Jones, head of the Corps\u2019 New Orleans District, told Landry\u2019s administration last month that the Corps recently conducted a \u201ctechnical review\u201d of the modeling analysis in question and concluded it \u201cwould not affect\u201d the permit.",
      "But Jones said the Corps suspended the project\u2019s permit in part because \u201cthe State deliberately withheld information \u2026 that the State knew it should provide.\u201d",
      "The Corps also pointed to actions taken by Landry\u2019s administration, including a 90-day work stoppage announced last month amid plans to study an alternative \u201csmaller diversion\u201d and claims the state can't afford the project.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how Landry intends to respond to the permit\u2019s suspension. The state has until Monday to take action to dispute the permit suspension. At that point, the Corps could revoke or modify the permit as it sees fit.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s coastal agency earmarked about $573 million in its 2025 budget for the project, an amount now being reviewed by the legislature. Last fall, federal agencies tasked with managing Deepwater Horizon settlement money warned that if Louisiana backs out of or alters the Mid-Barataria diversion, money allocated for it would need to be returned.",
      "Lauren Bourg, director of the National Audubon Society\u2019s Mississippi River Delta program, told lawmakers that ending or altering the project \u201csends the message that any infrastructure project in this state may be undone by a few stakeholders who engage in politics with the right people, distorting the scientific and engineering principles upon which all of these projects are grounded.\u201d",
      "But many in southeast Louisiana\u2019s fishing industry applauded the move to halt the project.",
      "\u201cIf all this water comes down, it\u2019s going to kill everything,\u201d said Mitch Jurisich, chairman of the Louisiana Oyster Task Force.",

      "Ono was recommended as the search committee's only finalist to be considered by the board of trustees on Sunday night.",
      "\u201cDr. Ono\u2019s proven record of academic excellence, innovation and collaborative leadership at world-class institutions made him our unanimous choice,\u201d said Rahul Patel, chair of the school's presidential search committee.",
      "The school's board selects the president and the appointment is subject to confirmation by the Florida Board of Governors, per state law.",
      "Ono is expected to be on campus Tuesday for a series of opportunities to connect with students, faculty, and administrators.",
      "\u201cFew moments in higher education are as exciting as this one at the University of Florida,\u201d Ono said. \u201cNo other public university combines UF\u2019s momentum, its role as the flagship of one of the nation\u2019s most important states, the extraordinary support from state leaders, and a shared vision across its entire community.\"",
      "Ono is set to replace Kent Fuchs, who became the school's interim president last summer after ex-U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse stepped down. Sasse left the U.S. Senate, where he represented Nebraska, to become the university\u2019s president in 2023.",
      "Sasse announced in July he was leaving the job to focus on his family after his wife was diagnosed with epilepsy.",
      "Soon thereafter, there were reports that Sasse gave six former staffers and two former Republican officials jobs with salaries that outstripped comparable positions and spent over $1.3 million on private catering for lavish dinners, football tailgates and extravagant social functions in his first year on the job.",
      "The amount was about double the spending of his predecessor, Fuchs, who was brought back to head the university on a temporary basis.",
      "\u201cIf I could select a dream candidate for the University\u2019s next president, it would be Santa Ono,\u201d Fuchs said. \u201dHis demonstrated record of success at the best universities, his leadership style, and caring personality have allowed him to work effectively with faculty, students, alumni, staff and other stakeholders everywhere he has been.\"",
      "Nearly three years ago, the University of Michigan hired Ono after he led the University of British Columbia. He previously served as president of the University of Cincinnati and senior vice provost and deputy to the provost at Emory University in Georgia.",
      "As U.S. colleges pull back on diversity, equity and inclusion practices as they respond to the Trump administration\u2019s orders against diversity practices, the University of Michigan was among the first schools to make major DEI rollbacks to avoid federal scrutiny. Ono had said the school will find other ways to support students, including an expansion of scholarships for low-income students.",

      "CLEVELAND -- Ohio authorities said they\u2019ve solved the more than decade-old fatal stabbing of a Cleveland Clinic nurse, announcing recent murder charges against her former divorce attorney who already served jail time for lying to police during the investigation.",
      "Friday's arrest of 51-year-old Gregory J. Moore marks the latest twist in a cold case that has eluded Ohio authorities since 2013. Aliza Sherman was stabbed more than 10 times, her body found on a downtown Cleveland sidewalk near where she was set to meet Moore to discuss her divorce.",
      "Moore was indicted on charges for murder, aggravated murder, kidnapping and conspiracy, according to documents unsealed Friday. He was arrested by U.S. Marshals in Texas, where he remained in custody Sunday, according to online records.",
      "\u201cThe Sherman family has waited over a decade for answers regarding their mother\u2019s homicide,\u201d said Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael O\u2019Malley in a statement Friday. \u201cThrough the tenacious work of multiple law enforcement agencies, evidence was accumulated that paints the unmistakable picture that Gregory Moore orchestrated and participated in the brutal murder of Aliza Sherman.\u201d",

      "Democrats are looking for the right message and messengers to lead the opposition to President Donald Trump in his second term",
      "ATLANTA -- The billionaire heir and the former bartender.",
      "Many Democrats have been in and out of the spotlight as the party looks for effective counters to President Donald Trump and his second administration. But two disparate figures, Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have seen their national profiles rise by delivering messages that excite a demoralized and fractured party.",
      "The governor, a 60-year-old heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune, and the congresswoman, the 35-year-old with working-class roots, both won their first elections in 2018. Both have urged mass resistance and accused their party of not fighting more. Each has stood out enough to draw sharp retorts from Trump loyalists.",
      "But as messengers, Pritzker and Ocasio-Cortez could not be more different. And their arguments, despite some overlap, are distinct enough to raise familiar questions for Democrats: Should they make their challenges to Trump about threats to democracy and national stability, as Pritzker has done, or portray him as a corrupt billionaire exacerbating an uneven economy, as Ocasio-Cortez does? And beyond the message itself, what qualities should the best messenger have?",
      "What links them, said one prominent Democrat, is \u201cassertiveness.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople want Trump and Trumpism to be met with equal passion and force,\u201d said National Urban League President Marc Morial, a former New Orleans mayor deeply connected in Democratic politics. On that front, he added, Pritzker and Ocasio-Cortez \u201care both effective national figures \u2013- but in very different ways.\u201d",
      "Pritzker was born at the bridge of the baby boomers and Generation X into a sprawling family now entrenched in Democratic politics. Like Trump, he inherited great wealth, but he lambastes the president as a poser on working-class issues.",
      "He chaired Illinois\u2019 Human Rights Commission before running for governor. In office, he has signed an Illinois minimum-wage increase and is an ally of unions. His family\u2019s hotels are unionized, making them regular options for official Democratic Party events.",
      "When Democratic President Joe Biden exited the 2024 campaign, Pritzker was floated as a replacement. He made no visible moves, quickly backed Vice President Kamala Harris and acted as the de facto host of her nominating convention in his home state.",
      "\u201cTake it from an actual billionaire, Trump is rich in only one thing: stupidity,\u201d Pritzker said in Chicago.",
      "Since Harris\u2019 defeat, Pritzker has behaved like a future candidate. One of the nation\u2019s highest-profile Jewish politicians, he fired up liberals by comparing the Trump administration to the Third Reich.",
      "\u201cIf you think I\u2019m overreacting and sounding the alarm too soon, consider this: It took the Nazis one month, three weeks, two days, eight hours and 40 minutes to dismantle a constitutional republic,\u201d the governor said his joint budget and State of the State address on Feb. 19. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is when the five-alarm fire starts to burn, every good person better be ready to man a post with a bucket of water if you want to stop it from raging out of control.\u201d",
      "Addressing party faithful in the traditional early nominating state of New Hampshire, Pritzker bemoaned \u201cdo-nothing\u201d Democrats, called for party honchos to set aside \u201cdecades of stale decorum\u201d and urged voters into the streets.",
      "\u201cNever before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption, but I am now,\u201d he said. Democrats, he added, \u201cmust castigate (Republicans) on the soapbox and then punish them at the ballot box.\u201d",
      "It was enough for senior Trump aide Stephen Miller to accuse Pritzker of inciting violence. Pritzker wasted no time returning the volley, calling it \u201cterrible hypocrisy\u201d for Trump allies to complain given the Capitol siege on Jan. 6, 2021, and Trump's pardons of the rioters.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez is a millennial progressive who earned degrees in international relations and economics and worked as a waiter and bartender before entering politics. With support from the progressive Working Families Party, she ousted a top House Democrat, Joe Crowley, in a 2018 primary.",
      "Like Trump, she leverages millions of social media followers. Also like Trump, she is an economic populist. But she comes from the left wing of U.S. politics and without the anti-immigration and cultural conservatism of Trump\u2019s right wing or the alliances with billionaire business and tech elites.",
      "She has recently headlined \u201cFighting Oligarchy\u201d tour with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a two-time presidential candidate. The tour has drawn tens of thousands of people across the country, notably including reliably Republican states, often with overflow crowds outside many stops.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s next political move seems less certain than Pritzker\u2019s. She is seen as a potential primary challenger to Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader from New York, and she only recently became old enough to be constitutionally eligible for the presidency. But she appears poised to inherit the mantle of the 83-year-old Sanders' movement.",
      "She freely criticizes Trump. But she leans more heavily into broader economic and social critiques that she\u2019s made since her first House bid and that Sanders has offered for decades.",
      "\u201cFor years we have known that our political system has slowly but surely become dominated by big money and billionaires and time after time we have seen how our government and laws are more responsive to corporations and lobbyists than everyday people and voters,\u201d she said in Folsom, California. She advocated for \u201cliving wages \u2026 stable housing \u2026 guaranteed health care,\u201d and blasted \u201cthe agenda of dark money to keep our wages low and to loot our public goods like Social Security and Medicare.\u201d",
      "She also played up her roots: \u201cFrom the waitress who is now speaking to you today, I can tell you: impossible is nothing.\u201d",
      "Ocasio-Cortez and Pritzker are allied against a common opponent, Trump, and not each other. Advisers to Ocasio-Cortez and Pritzker did not respond to questions.",

    "story": [
      "OpenAI, the parent of artificial intelligence service ChatGPT, has announced a new governance plan after a bitter power struggle over the business.",
      "Boss Sam Altman said OpenAI would remain under the control of its for-profit board, while becoming what is known in the US as a public benefit corporation.",
      "Mr Altman had put forward a similar plan in December - but without clarifying the control of the non-profit.",
      "The update follows widespread scrutiny of the startup, which began as a non-profit and faced criticism, including from co-founder Elon Musk, that its quest for growth is pushing it to stray from its original mission of creating technology for the benefit of humanity.",
      "Last month, a group of former open AI staff and outside experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, wrote to regulators in California and Delaware, which have power over non-profits, asking them to intervene to block the conversion.",
      "OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor said the start-up made the decision \"after hearing from civic leaders and engaging in constructive dialogue with the offices of the Attorney General of Delaware and the Attorney General of California\".",
      "In the update on Monday, Mr Altman said the non-profit would continue to control OpenAI, receiving a \"big\", yet-to-be determined stake in OpenAI's business arm, which would give it access to money to put towards its own goals.",
      "He said the new plan would still allow the organisation to stop operating under its current complex governance structure, which had capped its profits.",
      "That was seen as a sticking point for investors, including Microsoft, that hindered the firm's ability to raise money.",
      "\"We are moving to a normal capital structure where everyone has stock,\" he wrote in a letter to staff that was shared on the OpenAI website. \"This is not a sale, but a change of structure to something simpler.\"",
      "Unlike traditional for-profit companies, which are bound to act in service to shareholders, a public benefit corporation is also responsible for a public mission.",
      "In the update on Monday, Mr Altman said he believed that growth and extending access to AI, which would take money, was consistent with the firm's mission, because it would help people \"build incredible things for each other and continue to drive society and quality of life forward\".",
      "\"It will of course not be all used for good, but we trust humanity and think the good will outweigh the bad by orders of magnitude,\" he wrote.",
      "It is not clear to what extent the new plan will satisfy investors or critics.",
      "After the announcement Page Hedley, OpenAI's former policy and ethics adviser, who had spearheaded last month's letter, said the update did not resolve issues such as who would own the firm's technology and how its goals would be prioritised.",

      "Trump said in an announcement overnight that he would apply tariffs to foreign-made films to help America's movie industry, which he said was dying \"a very fast death\".",
      "In response, the UK government said trade negotiations with Washington were ongoing and it was taking a \"calm and steady approach\" to talks in a bid to \"ease pressure on UK businesses\".",
      "UK filmmakers warned freelancers in the industry risked being \"jobless\" if US productions were pulled, with one union saying the tariffs could be a \"knock-out blow\".",
      "The UK film sector is worth \u00a31.36 billion and employs more than 195,000 people, the government said in October.",
      "Much of the detail of the new tariff has yet to be confirmed.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said later on Monday: \"Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again.\"",
      "But there is worry that UK film companies, which often produce movies with US firms - including recent blockbusters like Barbie and Wicked - could be badly hit.",
      "\"If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are goig to be jobless,\" Kirsty Bell, chief executive of UK production company Goldfinch, said.",
      "Philippa Childs, head of media and entertainment trade union, Bectu, echoed those fears: \"These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.\"",
      "A parliamentary committee's report published last month noted the UK's film and high-end television industry is \"dominated\" by inward investment from US studios and that this \"brings significant economic and social benefits to the UK\".",

      "She urged ministers to \"urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way\".",
      "Shadow culture secretary Stuart Andrew said Labour must \"get a grip\" to secure a trade deal with the US and \"protect the UK film industry, otherwise we risk seeing long-term damage to a sector that is a global success\".",

      "Hollywood's big boom has gone bust",
      "It is still not entirely clear whether Trump's plans will affect only British films exported to the US or if it will also have an impact on co-productions, as referenced by Bell and others. The uncertainty itself is worrying for many.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Tim Richards, CEO and founder of Vue Entertainment, said: \"The devil will be in the details and we need to parcel through exactly what [Trump] means.",
      "\"A big part of this is what constitutes US film, is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot?",
      "\"Hollywood\u2026 has been in decline for some time,\" he said. \"A lot of films are being shot in other states and in other markets, principally Canada, the UK and Australia.\"",
      "He added: \"One of the reasons the UK has done so well is we have some of the most highly skilled and experienced filmmakers and production crews in the world.\"",
      "Bell concurred that \"the issue isn't that foreign films are taking precedence over domestic films, it's that, firstly, films are cheaper to make overseas, because of lack of tax credits in certain places\" and lower costs.",
      "\"People aren't going to the cinema as much and decline in subscription services and rise of social media platforms and content creators... the industry is entirely changed.\"",
      "She added: \"The answer is not tariffs if [Trump is] trying to kick-start the industry in Hollywood.\"",
      "According to the Hollywood Reporter, the Californian film commission offers a 20\u202f percent base credit to feature films and TV series - lower than most other US states and countries like the UK and has a $330m (\u00a3248m) cap on the programme, which can make countries like the UK more attractive.",
      "A government spokesperson said on Monday: \"The film sector is a key part of the UK's world-class creative industries, which employ millions of people, generate billions for our economy and showcase the best of our creativity and culture to the world.",
      "\"We are absolutely committed to ensuring these sectors can continue to thrive and create good jobs right across the country, and will set this out through a new Creative Industries Sector Plan to be published soon.",
      "\"Talks on an economic deal between the US and the UK are ongoing - but we are not going to provide a running commentary on the details of live discussions or set any timelines because it is not in the national interest.

      "The annual report by Savills suggests that 52% of first-time buyers received assistance from the bank of mum and dad last year, which could also include other donors from the family.",
      "This was a slightly lower proportion than the 57% of the previous year, but higher than every other year since 2013.",
      "Family assistance peaked in 2009 during the fallout from the financial crisis, when 70% of first-time buyers received help, the estate agency's figures suggest.",
      "It estimated 173,500 first-time buyers received assistance last year, receiving a total of \u00a39.6bn.",
      "The findings are based on first-time buyer and average loan-to-value data, as well as how this relates to responses from various surveys about family support.",
      "The average rate for all new two and five-year fixed mortgages last year was between 5% and 6%, figures from financial information service Moneyfacts show.",
      "That rate would be higher for many first-time buyers unable to offer a large deposit, and much higher than a few years earlier.",
      "Buyers facing that scenario \"took advantage of greater family support to try and secure a deal at a lower mortgage rate\", according to Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills.",
      "\"First-time buyers are still feeling the impact of higher mortgage rates and tougher lending criteria,\" he said.",

      "Many potential first-time buyers have also faced financial strain from the rising cost of living, and particularly from the greater expense of renting, although the latter may have encouraged more to get on to the ladder more quickly.",
      "The annual increase in rent paid to private landlords breached 9% last year, forcing many to live with their parents in their 20s and 30s.",
      "Financial assistance varies across the country, as do house prices and average incomes.",
      "And stamp duty, which was primarily levied on buyers in the south of England, changed in April.",
      "First-time buyers of homes bought for more than \u00a3300,000 in England and Northern Ireland must now pay stamp duty, compared with the previous threshold of \u00a3425,000.",
      "Data suggests that led to a surge in first-time buyer purchases ahead of the deadline.",
      "Analysis by the Yorkshire Building Society suggests the first three months of this year saw the highest number of first-time buyer applications since the 2022 post-Covid peak.",
      "Mr Cook, from Savills, added that the likelihood of regulators allowing lenders to loosen some of their lending criteria could also benefit first-time buyers and their families.",
      "\"[This means] lowering the barrier for entry and allowing first-time buyers to qualify for larger mortgages,\" he said.",
      "\"So, although more first-time buyer activity may mean more bank of mum and dad assistance, this is likely to be at a lower average cost per first-time buyer.\""

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjlqwxevd0o",
    "published": "Sun, 04 May 2025 00:25:01 GMT",
    "summary": "In his exclusive BBC interview, the Canadian Prime Minister indicates how he plans to tackle Trump.",
    "story": [
      "On Mark Carney's final day of a gruelling race to be elected PM of vast and sparsely populated Canada I was with him.",
      "It was his last push, not just to win, but also to get the majority he said he needed to stand up to the chaotic territorial and trade ambitions of his \"neighbour to the south\".",
      "For someone who had got to see Carney as a cerebral technocrat, a crisis-managing central bank governor a decade ago, the transformation into public orator was quite something.",
      "I recall endless interviews trying to get the then governor to say something newsworthy, or something that would make a good headline.",
      "While this was a very different Mark Carney, the lineage in crisis economics was also part of his sell.",
      "Carney told his audience in Edmonton, Alberta, sporting the local Oilers hockey shirt: \"President Trump has ruptured the global economy... America's leadership of the global economy is over. It's still in play, but it is a tragedy, and our new reality\u2026 in this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win\".",
      "His supporters shouted \"Elbows Up\" and put them up, a reference to a stand up and fight back posture in the occasionally rough game of ice hockey.",
      "\"What we are seeing around the country is Canadians acting on behalf of other Canadians, standing up for each other, buying from each other, travelling here...\"",
      "At his very final stop in the far West, in the isolation of Victoria, Vancouver Island, with only half an hour of campaigning allowed, Carney went \"unplugged\" among supporters.",
      "\"As the assembled media will tell you, I campaigned in prose,\" Carney joked. \"So I'm going to govern in econometrics,\" he said of the nerdy mathematical strain of economics.",
      "In normal circumstances, some of this might be interesting to the wider world. In current circumstances, the origins of his election win, his approach to policy making, and the nature of his mandate, could assume critical importance.",
      "When I caught up with him for the BBC exclusive interview, just as the polls were closing on Monday, he appeared confident but was taking nothing for granted.",
      "Fighting threats to sovereignty",
      "Mr Carney's central argument remained consistent. He said he was the leader to take on Donald Trump's \"betrayal\" and threats to Canada's economy and sovereignty.",
      "It was exemplified by his final large rally on the US-Canada border, with the Ambassador Bridge and a skyline of iconic Detroit motoring firms behind him.",
      "This bridge is the main artery of Canadian-US trade. A lot of effort went into this backdrop of the two-way trade of the most integrated economies in the world, now tariffed at unimaginable levels. An unsubtle message from the Liberal Party leader, about a changed continent.",
      "The election result was staggering.",
      "Entering 2025, the Liberal Party was as low as 16%, versus 45% for the opposition Conservatives, in opinion polls.",
      "Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives were not just heading for victory, but for a total landslide.",
      "But then following President Trump's imposition of national security tariffs on Canada, using the pretext of an alleged role in fentanyl traffic, and then his undiplomatic suggestion that Canada should join the USA, the polls tightened.",
      "Then after Mark Carney was elected Liberal leader, just eight weeks ago, the Liberals achieved a consistent poll lead, which they rode to victory last week.",
      "The election became a presidential-style verdict on who could cope with Trump.",
      "Poilievre was fundamentally weakened by previous overtures to the US president and his style of government.",
      "Carney incorporated voters on the left who were scared of a Conservative government amplified by Trump.",
      "And incredibly, in Quebec, the Liberals won back support from separatists, who were more concerned about Canada's independence from the US, than their own constitutional status within Canada. There is nothing more unifying than a credible external threat.",
      "Carney's strategy",
      "Carney gave some clues to his strategy during his interview with me. He talked of a \"win win\" partnership with the US, and reminded the president that Canada was the \"biggest client\" of 40 of the 50 US states, and a key energy and fertiliser supplier.",
      "He also told me he \"potentially could supply them with critical minerals\". This struck me as a negotiation tactic very targeted at what Trump has become fixated on elsewhere.",
      "Canada has ample resources of critical minerals, and would be a much more dependable supplier across the West than many other nations. Carney is implicitly suggesting, however, that his country has deep strategic choices to make here, on for example, developing them with Europe rather than the US.",
      "In any event, the PM will use the impetus of external threat to try to transform the Canadian economy. Even in the granting of an interview to BBC News, it was clear that he sees a critical need to diversify trade and strategic alliances. Defence partnerships are now on the cards.",
      "He seemed to acknowledge that a stalled Canada-UK trade deal could be expedited.",
      "On Friday he pulled off the historic announcement that King Charles would reopen the Canadian parliament in person at the end of the month. This has not happened since 1977. It is entirely in keeping with Canada's constitution, but it is also a stunning assertion of enduring independence from the White House.",
      "All roads now lead to the G7 Summit hosted by Carney in the middle of June in Alberta, bringing together the world's seven largest economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system.",
      "Assuming that Trump comes, it will occur within days of the expiry of the pause in massive so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on most of the world.",
      "It is often forgotten that if Canada and Mexico free themselves from the fentanyl tariffs, they will then, according to White House advisers, find themselves subject to this system, with a minimum of 10% tariffs.",
      "All of this occurs within days of some growing frustration from America's traditional allies with the entire \"trade deal\" process.",
      "Japan is increasingly frustrated, with its finance minister now openly pointing to Japan's unbeaten holding of US government debt as a \"card\" in negotiations.",
      "The EU has not got very far. Even the UK has hinted that a deal with Europe may be a more effective way of boosting the economy.",
      "It comes as tariffs are starting to have a visible and tangible negative impact on US businesses and consumers.",
      "There is no great incentive to offer much up, while the US itself starts to feel the inevitable inflationary consequences of its actions.",
      "The flotilla of empty Chinese cargo ships and empty docks on the US West Coast will soon be seen in the economic data of an already shrinking US economy.",
      "As a veteran of economic crises arising from the uncertain experiments of governments, Carney might be uniquely placed on how these situations pan out. Many in the markets have been thoroughly unimpressed with the White House advisers sent out to reassure investors in recent weeks.",
      "But Carney too has his own challenges. He just missed out on a majority in parliament, but has chosen to try to project this as a virtue.",
      "He will reach across the aisle for a \"Team Canada\" approach to talks with the US.",
      "The Premier of the oil-rich Alberta province, who is a regular visitor to Mar-a-Lago, immediately announced moves to make separation referendums easier.",
      "This is a very complicated, domestic, continental and global environment economically and politically. Few would predict exactly where it goes. Carney may have a very large part in it, and not just for his own country.",

      "But training AI systems like ChatGPT requires huge amounts of energy and, once trained, keeping them running is also energy intensive.",
      "While it's difficult to quantify the electricity used by AI, a report by Goldman Sachs estimated that a ChatGPT query uses nearly 10 times as much electricity as a Google search query.",
      "That makes some people uncomfortable.",

      "De minimis is a Latin term, which loosely translates to English as \"of the smallest\".",

      "The move is in line with Trump's policies of cracking down on goods from China.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on Chinese imports. His administration said in April that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.",
      "US authorities have also blamed the success of firms like Temu and Shein for putting strains on border authorities, as the number of packages entering the US under the loophole surged from about 140 million a decade ago to more than one billion last year.",
      "What does it mean for online shoppers?",
      "Packages sent to the US from mainland China and Hong Kong with a value of up to $800 now face a 120% tax rate or are subject to a flat fee. The fee started at $100 and is due to rise to $200 at the beginning of June.",
      "Even before these packages were subject to import taxes, US consumers were warned of potential price rises.",

      "Prices for treatments grew by 60% between 2015 and 2023, compared with inflation of 35% for other general services, according to CMA research.",
      "The regulator is also pushing for more transparency as part of the overhaul due to be finalised in the coming months.",

      "It said on Thursday that it would look into a ban on any policies that would curtail vets' \"clinical freedom\".",

      "In a list of potential remedies, the CMA said vets could be forced to create a clear online display of prices for medicines, surgeries, treatments and out-of-hours help. The working paper also suggested that the mark-up charged on pet cremations, sold to customers at a \"vulnerable moment\", might be capped.",
      "The watchdog has also suggested a comparison website making it compulsory for clinics to inform owners if cheaper options are available.",

      "The BBC spoke to vets working for IVC, which owns more than 900 surgeries, who all say they are monitored and set targets by the company.",

      "The competition body highlighted how the sector was increasingly being dominated by larger firms and how this might be reducing consumer choice.",
      "There are about 5,000 vet practices in the UK, it said, but since 2013, approximately 1,500 of these have been acquired by six large corporate groups.",
      "They are CVS, Independent Vetcare Ltd, Linnaeus, Medivet, Pets at Home and VetPartners.",
      "Four of these six tend to retain the name and branding of an independently-owned practice when they buy it, which the CMA said may create an \"illusion of competition\" for consumers if they are trying to shop around to find alternative practices.",
      "While most of the bigger groups own their practices outright, Pets at Home told the watchdog that the majority that it runs are 50-50 joint ventures with individual owners who are vets, nurses or practice managers."

    "summary": "The South American country is turning to wind power, but some local people are unhappy.",
    "story": [
      "When Jos\u00e9 Luis Iguar\u00e1n steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea.",
      "The Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguar\u00e1n belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing.",
      "With some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.",
      "But this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature.",
      "\"You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n says.",
      "His community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more.",
      "\"At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n adds.",
      "The Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family.",
      "Despite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguar\u00e1n says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones.",
      "Isagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions.",
      "Mr Iguar\u00e1n believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm.",
      "\"The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,\" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela.",
      "His community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption.",
      "\"Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,\" he adds.",
      "These concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits.",
      "\"There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,\" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu.",
      "\"In Colombia\u2026 there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable.\"",
      "In December 2024, Spanish company EDP Renov\u00e1veis shelved plans for two wind farms in La Guajira, saying the projects were no longer economically viable.",
      "One factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113.",
      "EDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to \"constant protests\" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023.",
      "Guajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard.",
      "And think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms.",
      "\"We call it the 'wind wars',\" says Ms Barney.",
      "For Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies.",
      "\"There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,\" he says.",
      "This gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects.",
      "\"For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected.\"",
      "By contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs.",
      "While Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix.",
      "For energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect.",
      "One such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms.",
      "The company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits.",
      "But it says good community relations are not enough.",
      "\"We cannot do these projects alone,\" says Federico Echavarr\u00eda, general manager of AES Colombia. \"The government must help resolve conflicts between communities.\"",
      "On the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state.",
      "Education and healthcare are poor, and most rural communities do not have running water.",
      "Some people still walk hours each day to collect water from jag\u00fceys \u2013 reservoirs filled with rainwater.",
      "His community has a small salt-water treatment plant that produces fresh water and it wants the company planning to build the nearby wind farm to expand it, so that more locals benefit.",
      "Despite the talk of progress, he points to a lingering paradox. \"The worst thing is we won't receive even a single kilowatt of the electricity produced here,\" he laments.",
      "The plan is for the wind farm's electricity to instead be sent elsewhere, and that the village will continue to rely on generators, at least in the medium term.",
      "While the future might look bright for clean energy, many Wayuu are still anxious they will be left in the dark."

      "As the skies unleashed six months of rain in February over North Queensland, Australia, many locals endured sleepless nights, unsure what level of flooding and damage they would wake up to.",
      "Perhaps none more so than Andrew Brown - a cybersecurity lecturer by day, with a side hustle as a self-made amateur weather forecaster.",
      "Few know that Mr Brown is the brains behind Wally's Weather - a Facebook page with 107,000 followers and 24 million monthly views, focusing on weather across the tropical state of Queensland.",
      "During the record-breaking flooding, when 400 people were forced to evacuate their homes, Mr Brown published round the clock posts, even waking in the night to share updates, out of a sense of duty and responsibility to his audience.",
      "He even left work early when he spotted on his weather radar that five hours of non-stop rain would be approaching, advising not just his Facebook followers, but his bosses, colleagues, wife and adult children to do the same.",
      "\"When there's a big weather event, you try and give people as much notice as possible.\"",
      "He is based in Townsville, the regional centre of an area known for a rain-drenched, hot, humid wet season from January to March.",
      "\"People want to know what's going on, because even if they lose power, they've probably still got an internet connection. These systems are notorious for happening at night time when you can't see what's going on, so you do feel like their eyes and ears,\" says Mr Brown.",
      "Mr Brown's active, highly engaged Facebook audience is indicative of how more members of the public are turning to social media for news and weather updates - in the US, it's how 20% of adults get this information, according to Pew Research Centre.",
      "People pay as much attention to influencers on Facebook as they do journalists and the mainstream media, and actually pay more attention to them than their mainstream counterparts on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, according to a study by the Reuters Institute and University of Oxford.",
      "Prof Daniel Angus is director of the Digital Media Research Centre at Queensland University of Technology.",
      "When Brisbane-based Prof Angus found himself caught up in the heavy rain and flooding brought on by Tropical Cyclone Alfred also in February, he preferred to follow official advice from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, as he believes they still provide the most accurate forecasts and warnings.",
      "Prof Angus recognises the rising popularity of weather influencers like Mr Brown's Wally's Weather as stemming from not just a broader trend of public mistrust towards mainstream media and government sources, but about filling gaps in coverage and relatability.",
      "\"Weather influencers have gained popularity, particularly in rural and regional areas, because they provide highly localised, real-time updates that mainstream media can often overlook,\" says Prof Angus.",
      "\"They engage directly with their audience, offering personalised analysis and responding to community concerns in a way that traditional news outlets typically don't.",
      "\"Their credibility has grown because they are seen as passionate, knowledgeable, and often deeply embedded in the communities they report on.\"",
      "Yet the issue with weather influencers, Prof Angus notes, is their tendency to scaremonger, as social media weather forecaster Higgins Storm Chasing, also based in Townsville, has been criticised for.",
      "In 2018, it was criticised for predicting historic levels of rainfall and flooding to its one million Facebook followers, which didn't materialise.",
      "Higgins Storm Chasing, which has hired professional meteorologist and amateur tornado chaser Thomas Hinterdorfer, didn't respond to the BBC's request for an interview.",
      "\"Weather influencers are often prone to hyperbolic and exaggerated claims, as they are not held to the same standards or consequences as their mainstream and official government counterparts, which has led to claims of scaremongering, and propagation of misinformation,\" explains Prof Angus.",
      "\"What we have to understand is that they are part of an attention economy. The more eyes they have, the more engagement they see on their metrics. The bureau and governments are very reserved in putting out alerts and evacuation orders, because it only takes a few non-events for people to lose their trust in them,\" says Professor Angus.",
      "\"They have to answer for that, whereas for Higgins or any of the others, there's ultimately zero accountability if they completely mess it up. \"",
      "It's a view shared by Alan Sealls, a former TV weatherman who now teaches meteorology at the University of South Alabama, and consults as a forensic meteorologist, providing weather analysis for legal cases.",
      "Prof Sealls is also now the president elect of the American Meteorological Society (AMS), which welcomes both professionally-trained meteorologists and weather influencers as members, so doesn't have an official position on the topic.",
      "But Prof Sealls' personal view is that trained meteorologists with an online platform add value, while those without formal training stand to discredit the profession.",
      "\"There are those who are not formally-trained and take more risks in showing and promoting long-range weather outlooks, as though they are as accurate as short-range forecasts, particularly when the outlook hints at extreme weather. That's considered hype that makes people click and share, increasing the popularity of the influencer,\" he says.",
      "\"Trained meteorologists avoid that because it causes confusion in implying something distant is likely, when in reality it is uncertain and unknown.",
      "\"On the other hand, there are weather influencers who have the equipment and expertise to track and forecast local weather when it is extreme, in times of crisis, often giving more focus to communities that don't get full coverage from traditional TV stations. \"",
      "While Andrew Brown of Wally's Weather is self taught in meteorology, he has a masters in IT and numerous other technology qualifications.",
      "His investment in forecasting equipment has been so big that he introduced paid subscriptions three years ago, but they mainly just cover his costs.",
      "The advancement of AI, he says, gives him more time to accurately analyse data and communicate it to his followers. It will also allow him to expand to an Australia-wide operation.",
      "Yet there is money to be made in the world of weather influencing. Colorado-based Andrew Markowitz has a meteorology degree and works full-time for an energy company, but also has 135,000 followers on a TikTok weather page.",
      "Through a combination of live stream donations, sponsorships, brand deals, and TikTok's Creativity Program which helps creators monetise their content, Mr Markowitz says he can earn up to thousands of dollars a month.",
      "\"It's definitely not enough to quit my job, nor would I want to. I just treat it as fun money on the side, which I usually spend on travels,\" says Mr Markowitz.",
      "Back in Australia, Mr Brown says he would like to retire from teaching, and have more time to focus on Wally's Weather, and to spend with his grandchildren, but acknowledges that this is a while away. But what he doesn't want is to be the face of the page - something he's so far avoided.",
      "\"I don't go out of my way to reveal who I am, because I like to be able to walk down the street and not be harassed. I've been interviewed on the radio before, and then walked past the person, and they had no idea it was me,\" says Mr Brown.",
      "\"Sometimes I can stand in line and hear people talking about the page, and they have no idea that I'm right there. It all adds to the fun.\"",

      "In fact, his language skills saved the 30-year-old from becoming destitute. Through a deportee support organisation, he heard that a local company \u2013 EZ Call Center \u2013 was looking for English-speakers.",
      "The work, as telephone sales agents, isn't well paid, but employees can earn commissions, and the regular pay cheque gave Alberto the stability he craved.",
      "\"I had to do something to get back on my feet. Thanks to the call centre, now I have,\" he tells me during a break between calls.",
      "Almost every agent at EZ Call Center is a deportee, including the company's owner, Daniel Ruiz.",
      "He was also born in Mexico and grew up in the US before being deported for low-level drug crime in his early 20s. Daniel says he can relate to his employees' initial sense of disorientation in Mexico.",
      "\"We are all dealing with culture shock,\" he says over a steady hum of telephone calls.",
      "\"We all have our life over there, went to school over there, were brought up on American culture, have family over there. We're from here but we're from over there too.\"",
      "In their booths, the agents work through long lists of US phone numbers, some making promotional calls or sales, others calling about debt collection and refinancing.",
      "All the agents speak fluent English, and the clients at the other end of the line are none the wiser that they're talking to people in Mexico rather than the US.",
      "Daniel says that agents like Alberto \u2013 who fell into gangs and crime at a vulnerable age in the US, but are willing to turn over a new leaf in Mexico \u2013 are among his most trusted employees.",
      "\"They almost never have another mark on their criminal record, and they possess the right discipline to hold down their jobs,\" he explains.",
      "Daniel Ruiz's own experiences after deportation have informed his business decisions.",
      "As well as the telesales company, he also co-founded a humanitarian organisation \u2013 called the Borderline Crisis Center \u2013 which provides deportees with food, shelter and support on their arrival back in Mexico.",
      "After his inauguration, President Trump said he would carry out what he calls \"the largest deportation in American history\".",
      "He has spoken of the removal of millions of undocumented people from US soil, and in the early days of his presidency Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents made workplace raids from Chicago to California.",
      "Mexican humanitarian organisations, including the Borderline Crisis Center, braced themselves for a huge influx of returnees.",
      "So far, though, one hasn't materialised. There are no major bottlenecks of migrants at the border, and the migrant shelters in Tijuana are not currently overflowing.",
      "The latest figures from the Mexican government actually show that the number of deportations from the US to Mexico were lower during the first three months of Trump's second administration than they were for the same period last year.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that Mexico received almost 39,000 deportees in February to April, of which 33,000 were Mexican. This compares with 52,000 for the same three months in 2024.",
      "However, the fall was in part due to a reduction in the number of people trying to get into the US in the first place. Migrant \"encounters\" on the US southern border by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents has dropped to their lowest level in years.",
      "The threat of mass deportation combined with other factors \u2013 from military deployments at the border, to the high-profile deportations of migrants to El Salvador \u2013 may have acted as an effective deterrent.",
      "The Trump Administration is also pushing the idea of self-deportation hard to undocumented immigrants through blunt warnings.",
      "Still, there are people being sent back to Tijuana on a near daily basis. Many face hostility as they try to resettle in the dusty and dangerous border city.",
      "The few companies which offer deportees gainful employment have become even more important to avoid a slide into criminality.",
      "Beyond a smaller venture like EZ Call Center, a larger company called the American Survey Company or ASC also relies on a deportee workforce.",
      "With its sister company, Voxcentrix, ASC has some 550 call centre stations in Tijuana, where agents make calls on everything from election polling to customer satisfaction surveys.",
      "\"What happened in the US stays in the US,\" laughs Nora Diaz, ASC's chief happiness officer. \"We don't really do background checks on that.\"",
      "Nora says her job is focussed on the employees' wellbeing, to help them reintegrate.",
      "\"We understand everyone has a past, and we don't judge based on that. We don't ask about it during our interview process. We just need people who speak good English and good Spanish and are willing to commit to a job,\" she explains.",
      "The \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy at ASC was invaluable to Luis Luna's new start.",
      "He grew up in Orange Country in California having been taken to the US when he was just a few months old.",

      "Young buyers faced relatively high mortgage rates in 2024, while also seeing the cost of renting increase.",
      "More recently, changes to stamp duty led to a rush of new buyers before the end of March, but greater costs for anyone who missed that deadline.",
      "More help, better deal",
      "The annual report by Savills suggests that 52% of first-time buyers received assistance from the bank of mum and dad last year, which could also include other donors from the family.",
      "This was a slightly lower proportion than the 57% of the previous year, but higher than every other year since 2013.",
      "Family assistance peaked in 2009 during the fallout from the financial crisis, when 70% of first-time buyers received help, the estate agency's figures suggest.",
      "It estimated 173,500 first-time buyers received assistance last year, receiving a total of \u00a39.6bn.",
      "The findings are based on first-time buyer and average loan-to-value data, as well as how this relates to responses from various surveys about family support.",
      "The average rate for all new two and five-year fixed mortgages last year was between 5% and 6%, figures from financial information service Moneyfacts show.",
      "That rate would be higher for many first-time buyers unable to offer a large deposit, and much higher than a few years earlier.",
      "Buyers facing that scenario \"took advantage of greater family support to try and secure a deal at a lower mortgage rate\", according to Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills.",
      "\"First-time buyers are still feeling the impact of higher mortgage rates and tougher lending criteria,\" he said.",

      "Five ways for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "Many potential first-time buyers have also faced financial strain from the rising cost of living, and particularly from the greater expense of renting, although the latter may have encouraged more to get on to the ladder more quickly.",
      "The annual increase in rent paid to private landlords breached 9% last year, forcing many to live with their parents in their 20s and 30s.",
      "Financial assistance varies across the country, as do house prices and average incomes.",
      "And stamp duty, which was primarily levied on buyers in the south of England, changed in April.",

      "Analysis by the Yorkshire Building Society suggests the first three months of this year saw the highest number of first-time buyer applications since the 2022 post-Covid peak.",
      "Mr Cook, from Savills, added that the likelihood of regulators allowing lenders to loosen some of their lending criteria could also benefit first-time buyers and their families.",
      "\"[This means] lowering the barrier for entry and allowing first-time buyers to qualify for larger mortgages,\" he said.",
      "\"So, although more first-time buyer activity may mean more bank of mum and dad assistance, this is likely to be at a lower average cost per first-time buyer.\""

      "But individual drivers can still opt out of accepting notes and coins, partly if they are worried about safety of carrying them in their vehicles.",
      "The move came as a major report suggested shops and services might need to be forced to accept cash in the future to protect those who rely on it.",
      "On Wednesday, the Treasury Committee of MPs stopped short of recommending mandated cash acceptance now, but said its report was \"a wake-up call\" to government on the issue.",

      "Uber has become a huge company and dominates the global ride-hailing market, as well as operating in a host of other transport sectors. Its rapid ascent has come with controversy and protests from other taxi providers.",
      "The taxi app's success has been based around new technology, but meant customers needed cashless payments to use its services.",
      "Following pilots in Birmingham, Stoke, Nottingham and Leicester, Uber said it has now extended the option of paying in cash to other UK cities, because some people preferred paying in cash or did not have a bank card.",
      "\"We believe that movement should be accessible to everyone, so following successful pilots in some UK cities over the last 18 months, we have decided to give passengers outside of London the option to pay for trips with cash,\" a spokesman said.",

      "If they do not have enough change, that is given as a credit to the passenger by Uber.",

      "Among those reliant on cash, and who gave evidence to the committee, were victim-survivors of domestic and economic abuse.",
      "Many face the dangers of being traced by their abuser via the payments they make. Buying a train ticket, for example, could only be done with cash in order to avoid an abusive partner becoming aware of their movements.",
      "\"It really is a matter of life and death,\" said Sam Smethers, chief executive of the charity Surviving Economic Abuse. \"Without it they find themselves monitored daily, with every transaction.\"",
      "Joint bank accounts and mortgages had also been used as a way to impose coercive control over somebody, she said.",

      "\"One victim-survivor said she hid pockets of cash around her house until she had enough to flee her abuser,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Listen to Laura read this article",
      "If you say the name Donald Trump in the halls of wholesale markets and trade fairs in China, you'll hear a faint chuckle.",
      "The US president and his 145% tariffs have not instilled fear in many Chinese traders.",
      "Instead, they have inspired an army of online Chinese nationalists to create mocking memes in a series of viral videos and reels \u2013 some of which include an AI-generated President Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and tech mogul Elon Musk toiling on footwear and iPhone assembly lines.",
      "China is not behaving like a nation facing the prospect of economic pain and President Xi Jinping has made it clear that Beijing will not back down.",
      "\"For more than 70 years, China has always relied on self-reliance and hard work for development\u2026 it has never relied on anyone's gifts and is unafraid of any unreasonable suppression,\" he said this month.",
      "His confidence may come in part because China is far less dependent than it was 10 years ago on exports to the US. But the truth is Trump's brinkmanship and tariff hikes are pushing on pressure points that already exist within China's own struggling economy. With a housing crisis, increasing job insecurity and an ageing population, Chinese people are simply not spending as much as their government would like.",
      "Xi came to power in 2012 with a dream of a rejuvenated China. That is now being severely tested \u2013 and not just by US tariffs. Now, the question is whether or not Trump's tariffs will dampen Xi's economic dreams, or can he turn the obstacles that exist into opportunities?",
      "Xi's domestic challenges",
      "With a population of 1.4 billion, China has, in theory, a huge domestic market. But there's a problem. They don't appear willing to spend money while the country's economic outlook is uncertain.",
      "This has not been prompted by the trade war \u2013 but by the collapse of the housing market. Many Chinese families invested their life savings in their homes, only to watch prices plummet in the last five years.",
      "Housing developers continued to build even as the property market crumbled. It's thought that China's entire population would not fill all the empty apartments across the country.",
      "The former deputy head of China's statistics bureau, He Keng, admitted two years ago that the most \"extreme estimate\" is that there are now enough vacant homes for 3 billion people.",
      "Travel round Chinese provinces and you see they are littered with empty projects \u2013 lines of towering concrete shells that have been labelled \"ghost cities\". Others have been fitted out, the gardens have been landscaped, curtains frame the windows, and they appear filled with the promise of a new home. But only at night, when you see no lights, can you tell that the apartments are empty. There just aren't enough buyers to match this level of construction.",
      "The government acted five years ago to restrict the amount of money developers could borrow. But the damage to house prices and, in turn, consumer confidence in China, has been done and analysts have projected a 2.5% decline in home prices this year, according to a Reuters poll in February.",
      "And it's not just house prices that worry middle-class Chinese families.",
      "They are concerned about whether the government can offer them a pension \u2013 over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. According to a 2019 estimate by the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government pension fund could run out of money by 2035.",
      "There are also fears about whether their sons, daughters and grandchildren can get a job as millions of college graduates are struggling to find work. More than one in five people between the ages of 16 and 24 in urban areas are jobless in China, according to official data published in August 2023. The government has not released youth unemployment figures since then.",
      "The problem is that China cannot simply flip a switch and move from selling goods to the US to selling them to local buyers.",
      "\"Given the downward pressure on the economy, it is unlikely domestic spending can be significantly expanded in the short term,\" says Prof Nie Huihua at Renmin University.",
      "\"Replacing exports with internal demand will take time.\"",
      "According to Prof Zhao Minghao, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, \"China does not have high expectations for talks with the Trump administration\u2026 The real battleground is in the adjustment of China's domestic policies, such as boosting domestic demand.\"",
      "To revive a slowing economy, the government has announced billions in childcare subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave. It has also introduced a $41bn programme offering discounts on items such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) to encourage more people to spend. But Prof Zhang Jun, the Dean of Economics at Fudan University, believes this is not \"sustainable\".",
      "\"We need a long-term mechanism,\" he says. \"We need to start increasing residents' disposable income.\"",
      "This is urgent for Xi. The dream of prosperity he sold when he took power 13 years ago has not become reality.",
      "A political test for Xi",
      "Xi is also aware that China has a disheartened younger generation worried about their future. That could spell bigger trouble for the Communist Party: protests or unrest.",
      "A report by Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor claims that protests driven by financial grievances saw a steep increase in the last few months.",
      "All protests are quickly subdued and censored on social media, so it is unlikely to pose a real threat to Xi for now.",
      "\"Only when the country does well and the nation does well can every person do well,\" Xi said in 2012.",
      "This promise was made when China's economic rise looked unstoppable. It now looks uncertain.",
      "Where the country has made huge strides over the past decade is in areas such as consumer electronics, batteries, EVs and artificial intelligence as part of a pivot to advanced manufacturing.",
      "It has rivalled US tech dominance with the chatbot DeepSeek and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest EV maker.",
      "Yet Trump's tariffs threaten to throw a spanner in the works.",
      "The restrictions on the sale of key chips to China, including the most recent move tightening exports from US chip giant Nvidia, for instance, are aimed at curbing Xi's ambitions for tech supremacy.",
      "Despite that, Xi knows that Chinese manufacturers are at a decades-long advantage, so that US manufacturers are struggling to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.",
      "Turning a challenge into an opportunity",
      "President Xi is also trying to use this crisis as a catalyst for further change and to find more new markets for China.",
      "\"In the short term, some Chinese exporters will be greatly impacted,\" says Prof Zhang. \"But Chinese companies will take the initiative to adjust the destination of exports to overcome difficulties. Exporters are waiting and looking for new customers.\"",
      "Donald Trump's first term in office was China's cue to look elsewhere for buyers. It has expanded its ties across South East Asia, Latin America and Africa \u2013 and a Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative shored up ties with the so-called Global South.",
      "China is reaping the rewards from that diversification. More than 145 countries do more trade with China than they do with the US, according to the Lowy Institute.",
      "In 2001, only 30 countries chose Beijing as their lead trade partner over Washington.",
      "Geopolitical gains",
      "As Trump targets both friend and foe, some believe Xi can further upend the current US-led world order and portray his country as a stable, alternative global trade partner and leader.",
      "The Chinese leader chose South East Asia for his first trip abroad after the tariff announcement, sensing his neighbours would be getting jittery about Trump's tariffs.",
      "Around a quarter of Chinese exports are now manufactured or shipped through a second country including Vietnam and Cambodia.",
      "Recent US actions may also present a chance for Xi to positively shape China's role in the world.",
      "\"Trump's coercive tariff policy is an opportunity for Chinese diplomacy,\" says Prof Zhang.",
      "China will have to tread carefully. Some countries will be nervous that products being manufactured for the US could end up flooding into their markets.",
      "Trump's tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers.",
      "According to Prof Huihua, \"about 20% of China's exports go to the US - if these exports were to flood any regional market or country, it could lead to dumping and vicious competition, thereby triggering new trade frictions\".",
      "There are barriers to Xi presenting himself as the arbiter of free trade in the world.",
      "China has subjected other nations to trade restrictions in recent years.",
      "In 2020, after the Australian government called for a global inquiry into the origins and early handling of the Covid pandemic, which Beijing argued was a political manoeuvre against them, China placed tariffs on Australian wine and barley and imposed biosecurity measures on some beef and timber and bans on coal, cotton and lobster. Some Australian exports of certain goods to China fell to nearly zero.",
      "Australia's Defence Minister Richard Marles said earlier this month that his nation will not be \"holding China's hand\" as Washington escalated its trade war with Beijing.",
      "China's past actions may impede Xi's current global outreach and many countries may be unwilling to choose between Beijing and Washington.",
      "Even with all the various difficulties, Xi is betting that Beijing will be able to withstand any economic pain longer than Washington in this great power competition.",
      "And it does appear that Trump has blinked first, last week hinting at a potential U-turn on tariffs, saying that the taxes he has so far imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese social media is back in action.",
      "\"Trump has chickened out,\" was one of the top trending search topics on the Chinese social media platform Weibo after the US president softened his approach to tariffs.",
      "Even if or when talks do happen, China is playing a longer game.",
      "The last trade war forced it to diversify its export market away from the US towards other markets \u2013 especially in the Global South.",
      "This trade war has China looking in the mirror to see its own flaws \u2013 and whether it can fix them will be up to policies made in Beijing, not Washington.",

      "Ofsted said supporting mental health was an important part of the proposals, and that the union's legal claims were \"plainly untenable\".",
      "The NAHT said it had issued a claim with the High Court for a judicial review on Friday, as school leaders gathered for its national conference in Harrogate.",
      "The decision comes after the sister of head teacher Ruth Perry, who took her own life after an Ofsted inspection, called for the new system to be delayed.",
      "A letter signed by Professor Julia Waters with more than 30 others last week, including the general secretaries of four teaching unions, warned the changes would \"continue to have a detrimental impact on the wellbeing of education staff and hence on students' school experience\".",

      "\"What we've been offered, if you scratch beneath the surface, is more of the same - another crude grading system to hang over the heads of leaders.\"",
      "Mr Whiteman said school leaders embraced accountability, but it was \"utter nonsense\" that Ofsted's proposed model was the only viable way to assess schools.",
      "He called on Ofsted boss Sir Martyn Oliver to \"scrap these proposals\" and \"think again\".",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has said he will hit movies made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs, as he ramps up trade disputes with nations around the world.",
      "Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he was authorising the US Department of Commerce and Trade Representative to start the process to impose the levy because America's movie industry was dying \"a very fast death\".",

      "Is Hollywood 'dying'?",
      "Announcing the new tariffs, Trump declared that Hollywood was \"dying\". So is it?",
      "It's true that the industry has been through a really rough time in recent years.",
      "The pandemic saw production close down and the impact is ongoing.",
      "Hollywood studios spent $11.3 billion on productions in the second quarter of 2024, a 20% drop from the same period in 2022, as studios continued to cut costs in an attempt to recover from Covid losses.",
      "Any shoots of recovery were then severely stifled by the 2023 actors and writers strikes.",
      "Then the wildfires struck earlier this year.",
      "And for several years now, more and more people - not just youngsters - have been turning to YouTube and other streaming platforms for content.",
      "The US remains a major film production hub and according to Variety, 2025 has seen a rebound in box office numbers since last year, with overall domestic revenues up 15.8% on 2024 so far.",
      "Is YouTube making Hollywood irrelevant?",
      "Is YouTube making Hollywood irrelevant?",
      "The latest Marvel superhero film, Thunderbolts*, topped the North American box office this weekend, raking in an estimated $76 million, marking a promising start to the summer season.",
      "But Hollywood is definitely still up against it.",
      "What is Trump proposing?",
      "The president says he wants to \"immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% tariff on any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands. We want movies made in America again!\"",
      "This has led to questions about whether the tariffs would also apply to American film companies producing films abroad.",
      "Several recent major movies produced by US studios were shot outside America, including Deadpool & Wolverine, Wicked and Gladiator II. Hit franchises like Mission Impossible also shoot overseas.",
      "We also don't yet know if the tariffs will be applied retrospectively.",
      "Trump later told reporters that \"other nations have been stealing the movies and movie-making capabilities from the United States\", which may suggest he was only referring to non-US films.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai told the BBC that \"no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made\", and added that the administration is \"exploring all options\".",
      "We will have to wait for more detail.",
      "What incentives do other countries offer?",
      "Many countries offer tax breaks to encourage film production such as New Zealand, Australia and the UK and that's something Trump wants to take on.",
      "But it's not the only reason a US film company might wish to film abroad.",
      "Some choose to do so for the specific location, exotic and exciting backdrops for example. Who could forget Tom Cruise's ascent of the Burj Khalifa, Dubai, in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol?",
      "What could it mean for the next James Bond movie, a franchise now owned by US giant Amazon, but based on an iconic British character who works for MI6, based in London?",
      "And it's not just other countries that offer incentives - other US states are luring film production away from Hollywood.",
      "Georgia, Illinois and Kentucky are among the many other US states which California are now competing with.",
      "Gavin Newsom, California's governor, who Trump described as \"grossly incompetent\" when speaking about the movie tariffs on Monday, is currently pushing for his plan to more than double the state's film and TV tax incentives to $750 million annually.",
      "While Newsom has made no comment yet on Trump's proposal, his senior communications advisor told Deadline: \"We believe he has no authority to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, since tariffs are not listed as a remedy under that law.\"",
      "How would any such tariffs actually work?",
      "There are more questions than answers at this stage.",
      "The World Trade Organization (WTO) has a moratorium on tariffs for digital goods until 2026. Presumably films count as digital goods.",
      "And what would they base the tariffs on? Box office revenue or production costs? Is streaming content included? That would have a huge impact on US companies like Netflix. What about post-production ie editing?",
      "Tim Richards, Vue Entertainment CEO and founder, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"A big part of this is what constitutes US film - is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot?\"",
      "And how do you even classify a foreign film when so many are co-productions and are often shot in several countries?",
      "Trump appeared to be talking about film and not TV but it's not 100% clear at this stage. Would tariffs apply to films made for streaming or just cinema releases? We'll have to wait for more detail. And of course, Trump may rollback on the proposals as he has done with some other tariffs.",
      "What could it mean for other countries?",
      "Obviously, putting a 100% tariff on foreign films means a huge cost increase for those production companies who want to sell to the US market.",
      "Commenting on Trump's announcement, the UK government's Culture Media and Sport Committee chair Dame Caroline Dinenage MP said: \"Last month the Culture, Media and Sport Committee warned against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe. President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real.",
      "\"Making it more difficult to make films in the UK is not in the interests of American businesses. Their investment in facilities and talent in the UK, based on US-owned IP, is showing fantastic returns on both sides of the Atlantic. Ministers must urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way.\"",
      "Head of media and entertainment trade union Bectu in the UK, Philippa Childs, said in a statement: \"These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.\"",

      "\"Nobody should be under any doubt that we will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry,\" Australia's home affairs minister Tony Burke said.",
      "New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told a news conference that his government was awaiting further details of the proposed tariffs.",
      "\"But we'll be obviously a great advocate, great champion of that sector and that industry,\" he added.",
      "And with the Cannes film festival just around the corner, uncertainty hangs in the air with many US film producers looking to sell foreign distribution rights.",
      "Could such tariffs work?",
      "Tariffs could incentivise US film companies to make more films on home soil but the risk is that if it's more expensive than to do so abroad, some films just won't get made.",
      "More incentives or rebates could help offset this but we just don't know at this stage if that's under discussion on a national scale.",
      "NPR Radio film critic Eric Deggans warned that the tariffs, should they be introduced, could further harm the industry.",
      "Other countries may respond by placing tariffs on American films, he told the BBC, making it \"harder for these films to make profits overseas\".",

      "He added: \"One of the reasons the UK has done so well is we have some of the most highly skilled and experienced filmmakers and production crews in the world.\"",
      "Bell concurred that \"the issue isn't that foreign films are taking precedence over domestic films, it's that, firstly, films are cheaper to make overseas, because of lack of tax credits in certain places\" and lower costs.",

      "Here's everything you need to know ahead of the Met Gala 2025.",

      "How can I watch the Met Gala?",

      "No, sorry hun.",
      "The Met Gala is an exclusive event, only open to a small number of invited guests - usually around 450.",

      "But that's not all the week has in store.",
      "BBC Three's I Kissed A Boy is back for series two, Sir David Attenborough's film Ocean is released on his 99th birthday, and PinkPantheress is dropping a new album.",
      "Read on for what's coming up this week...",
      "Molly-Mae, Tommy Fury and a 'media frenzy'",
      "Earlier this year, Molly-Mae Hague broke her silence after being photographed apparently kissing her ex, Tommy Fury, at a party.",
      "I was at the press event where she made the comments, ahead of her new TV series, Molly-Mae: Behind It All.",
      "She told me, and the other reporters, that she and Tommy - who announced their split last year - were \"figuring it out as adults, as parents\", adding that the situation was \"really complicated\".",
      "So what can we expect from part two of her documentary series, which launches on Prime Video on Friday?",
      "We're told that, after the \"media frenzy\" that surrounded the photograph, we will see the former Love Islander \"living her dreams\" at Paris Fashion Week.",
      "But the series will also reveal how hard she's finding life on her own at home.",

      "Dannii Minogue is heading back to the Masseria in her role as Cupid, while the series is voiced by Layton Williams.",
      "The format sees 10 singles matched up, and introduced for the first time - with a kiss to test out their chemistry.",
      "From then on, you can expect love triangles, budding romance, wandering eyes - and plenty of drama.",
      "Pop star Minogue has said she's excited to tell more \"diverse and important stories\", adding: \"I'll have the party started for a wonderful summer of love.\"",
      "The first series was praised by critics for its inclusive and positive treatment of gay love, and it was followed swiftly by I Kissed a Girl which aired last year.",
      "PinkPantheress album",
      "By Mark Savage, music correspondent",
      "Last August, PinkPantheress cancelled all her remaining tour dates \u2013 including lucrative support slots with Coldplay and Olivia Rodrigo \u2013 to concentrate on her health. \"I've reached a wall which I am struggling to penetrate through,\" she said in a statement to fans.",
      "But she's put the downtime to good use. The 23-year-old's new mixtape, Fancy That, is accessible, hypnotic and seductive alt-pop.",
      "She's been teasing the project since January, when she posted photos from her home studio, captioned: \"oh we are soooo back #2025.\" Speaking to Mixmag, she said listening to Fatboy Slim and Groove Armada had inspired \"the size of the music\".",
      "But it's another dance band whose DNA is sprinkled all over the EP. Basement Jaxx get writing credits on four of the five tracks, with PinkPantheress sampling classic 2000s dance hits like Romeo and Good Luck. Elsewhere, she chops in samples of the music she was raised on, from Sugababes to Underworld.",
      "In a recent Reddit thread, PinkPantheress said the mixtape represented a \"more fun\" side to her personality than the introspective, \"emo asf\" lyrics of her debut album Heaven Knows. She certainly seems to be having a blast on party-centric club cuts Tonight and Illegal (sample lyric: \"Is this illegal? It feels illegal\"); while Stateside giddily documents a transatlantic love affair.",

      "Using underwater footage, it will explore the major threats to our oceans, from destructive fishing techniques to mass coral reef bleaching.",
      "But it also carries a deeply personal message, with Sir David highlighting the opportunity we have to enable marine life to recover.",

    "summary": "The US singer says she feels \"bruised\" after weeks of online backlash - what's sparked the change?",
    "story": [
      "Earlier this week American singer Katy Perry, best known for her bubblegum pop, said she felt like a \"human Pi\u00f1ata\" after weeks of online backlash.",
      "The description felt suitably colourful - but the acknowledgement was serious. A decade on from headlining the Superbowl, Perry's part in a much-derided Blue Origin spaceflight has seen her star crash down to Earth.",
      "Mockery over the apparent worthiness of her reaction, including kissing the ground after landing and saying she felt \"so connected to love\", spread online. Fast food chain Wendy's even posted to ask: \"Can we send her back?\"",
      "Trolls have now taken aim at her world tour, which began in Mexico on 23 April, criticising her dance moves and performances.",
      "It seems the star who first broke through singing about a boyfriend's mood swings now faces an icy reception. Perry's blamed an \"unhinged and unhealed\" internet - but is toxic social media the only reason?",
      "'A pattern of failed reinvention'",
      "The music writer Michael Cragg, author of Reach for the Stars, believes Perry's problem is that she's stuck between pop cultures and feels increasingly out of touch.",
      "\"Her pop star persona was cemented in the 2010s as cartoon-y, fun and playful, all whipped cream bras and goofy videos where she wore oversized braces on her teeth,\" he says.",
      "For a period this worked. Her second album Teenage Dream, which doubled down on Perry's staple cheeky, sexualised girl-next-door image, scored five Billboard number one singles to match a record set by Michael Jackson. Its follow-up, 2013's Prism, bore transatlantic smash single Roar (her fourth solo UK number one), as well as Dark Horse in the US (her ninth domestically). Perry hasn't topped charts under her own steam since.",
      "\"That was a long time ago in pop terms and it feels like she hasn't evolved,\" adds Cragg.",
      "In the past year, her comeback single Woman's World, touted as a female empowerment anthem, struck critics as lyrically shallow.",
      "Some fans also seemed unimpressed that it was produced by Dr. Luke, who previously faced sexual assault allegations from the singer Kesha. The producer denied the claims and the pair reached an agreement to settle a defamation lawsuit in 2023, but Perry remained tainted by association.",
      "The track failed to land in the top 50 in the US and only just managed in the UK, at 47. \"Her sort of spiritual 'let love lead the way' messages she posts don't really hold sway with very online pop fans in the face of that decision,\" says Cragg.",
      "\"The regressive girl boss feel of Woman's World, and then the album not being great hasn't helped,\" he adds, pointing to rapper Doja Cat's success working with Dr. Luke without the same negative response.",
      "It followed a pattern of failed reinvention attempts stretching back to 2017's Witness, where Perry attempted to launch her socially conscious \"purposeful pop\" era.",
      "But its Sia-written lead single Chained to the Rhythm, which boldly attacked mindless pop culture, appeared to be undermined by Bon Appetit, a song openly objectifying Perry as a sexual meal.",
      "The 'pop girlie' has changed",
      "Female pop stardom has shifted. Last year's biggest breakout music stars \u2013 Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX \u2013 were women joined by a thread of fierce self-assurance, underpinned by relatability and authenticity.",
      "In contrast, Perry wanted distance from her pop persona - as the headline for Cragg's 2017 Guardian interview with her put it: \"I created this character called Katy Perry. I didn't want to be Katheryn Hudson. It was too scary.\"",
      "Perry's first hit I Kissed A Girl caused controversy for the fetishisation of lesbians even back in 2008 when it was released. But today Roan's had global success telling her genuine queer awakening.",
      "\"The flip flopping has jarred in an era where... very defined pop star personas are the ones cutting through,\" argues Cragg.",
      "Perry's 2021-2023 playground-styled Las Vegas residency embraced her surreal, fantastical image to commercial and critical success.",
      "But it's not translating to a new generation of fans. \"I think ultimately people see her as a bit cringeworthy now,\" Cragg adds. \"Being shot into space on a billionaire's jolly while everyone watches that on social media platforms interspersed with war and the climate crisis... just feels tonally not ideal,\" he says.",
      "Perry may have misjudged the public mood, but at the same time, the venom in the blowback points to deeper issues in pop culture beyond her control.",
      "There is no doubt that the social media landscape has become more frenzied in recent years, with stars like Roan speaking against toxic fandoms.",
      "Simon Diego, the creator of Brazil's Portal Katy Perry fan community, described the scale of the abuse towards the 40-year-old as \"unbelievable\".",
      "The group showed their support by clubbing together with other fan pages to pay for a digital billboard message in New York's Times Square for 24 hours.",
      "\"We're so proud of you and your magical journey and we love you to the moon and back,\" it read.",
      "\"Know that you are safe, seen and celebrated. We'll see you around the world, this is just the beginning.\"",
      "It was this that Perry replied to directly with her Pi\u00f1ata remark acknowledging the backlash.",
      "\"I think Katy and many other celebrities are feeling unsafe in the one space that used to connect them to fans,\" Diego tells BBC News.",
      "He believes that's why Perry has never posted photos of her daughter's face online.",
      "But even that boundary was ignored in the wake of the spaceflight criticism, as commenters began targeting her four-year-old child simply because \"it's cool now\", he says. \"They don't understand how bad it could affect her.\"",
      "Others, like Marie Claire Australia editor Georgie McCourt, think pervasive misogyny plays a part.",
      "\"There's a particular ire reserved for women like Perry: ambitious, unapologetic, hyper-visible,\" she wrote in a column, noting that male celebrities have already gone into space without such surveillant reaction.",
      "So where next for Perry? Cragg says a hit single would help.",

      "Marvel and Disney's newest release Thunderbolts* has proved a hit at the box office, after taking an estimated $162m (\u00a3122m) internationally.",
      "The film, which both production houses hope will kickstart a new franchise, is based around lesser-known superheroes who have to take on human and superhuman threats whilst fighting their own personal battles.",
      "It stars Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan in two of the main roles, alongside Julia Louis-Dreyfus and David Harbour.",
      "Whilst not all critic reviews have been favourable, the movie has been a hit with superhero fans - drawing in an impressive 95 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "It means the film receives the third highest audience score for a Marvel title, tying with Spider-Man: Far From Home and behind Shangi-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Spider-Man: No Way Home.",
      "Not all critics have not treated the film as favourably, with Empire's John Nugent noting that the film is \"missing a bit of colour - literally, in the washed-out palette and CG shadow-threat that dominates the latter half of the film \u2014 and figuratively, in its subject matter\".",
      "He adds that the topics covered, including suicide, depression and domestic violence are \"not always sensitively handled\".",
      "Radheyan Simonpillai at The Guardian gives the film three stars, citing that although the film is \"the best thing to come from the brand [Marvel] since WandaVision\", \"Thunderbolts often irritates because the depression and trauma the movie supposedly grapples with so often lives on the surface\".",
      "Simonpillai is full of praise for Pugh though, \"who can wrestle sincerity out of a screenplay (and a franchise) that has so little\".",
      "However, Clarisse Loughrey from The Independent looks on the film a little more favourably, giving it four stars and calling it \"the best Marvel movie in years\".",
      "\"Thunderbolts does feel different to what's come before.",
      "\"It's the first of its kind to seem genuinely self-aware - Thunderbolts might actually then be the ultimate Marvel film for now,\" she adds.",

      "The bestselling novelist Robert Harris says a conclave to select a new Pope has a similar dynamic to hit TV show The Traitors.",
      "The author of Conclave, which was last year turned into an Oscar-winning film adaptation, said the programme - in which \"faithful\" contestants are tasked with trying to work out the \"traitors\" among them - was \"the nearest analogy I can come to\".",
      "\"Suddenly everyone swings to one person - you can't see why, particularly, but it happens,\" he tells BBC News ahead of the election to replace Pope Francis, due to begin next week.",
      "\"And in a funny way, a similar dynamic does operate in a conclave, which is why often it produces a surprise.\"",
      "But Harris argues that it is a process UK political parties should learn from.",
      "The writer says his book and the subsequent film illustrates how the ancient, secretive ritual in the Sistine Chapel is a \"rather brilliant device\" for finding the right person to lead an organisation.",
      "Only male cardinals under the age of 80 are entitled to participate. The voting is conducted in total privacy, with the news of a decision announced by white smoke emerging from a chimney on the chapel's roof.",
      "Political parties throwing the election of their leaders open to the wider membership \"has not produced very good results\", Harris says.",
      "It would be better if a select number \"who have seen the candidates close up, day in, day out, choose who the leader should be\", he adds.",
      "He continues: \"To lock the door and say you're not going to come out until you've come up with a result concentrates the mind - and if you look back, the popes have been pretty good.",
      "\"I didn't come away from researching the novel thinking this is a terrible idea [and that] I must write a novel to expose how awful it is. In a way, the novel shows a conclave working.\"",
      "However, the Fatherland and Archangel author thinks it is strange that women are excluded from the Catholic priesthood and the election for a new Pope.",
      "\"Can any sophisticated religion, with such a huge following, really go on and on into the future with such a secondary, demeaning role for women?\" he asks.",
      "\"I mean, it just seems odd. Would Christ really have only wanted his word to be spread by men?\"",
      "Harris says the character of Sister Agnes - a nun who speaks out during a crucial moment in his fictitious conclave - was a \"vital\" creation.",
      "\"I wanted to find some way of getting the female voice in this process, and the only way is the women who serve the meals, clean the rooms and run the hostel when the cardinals are there,\" he explains. \"I really wanted to make them a part of the story.\"",
      "Harris says that, while researching his novel about conclave, Pope Francis's office gave him permission to visit parts of the Vatican generally off-limits to outsiders.",
      "\"They showed me the most extraordinary things and allowed me to walk along the corridor to the balcony where the new Pope shows himself to the huge crowd in St Peter's Square,\" he recounts. \"That was a breathtaking moment.\"",
      "Harris says that, when piecing together the process of the conclave, he realised he had \"stumbled on a treasure trove\".",
      "\"I think that the conclave is a rather brilliant device for finding the right sort of person who can command the respect of the church.\"",
      "\"It's spiritual and human and political drama all woven into one,\" he says. \"A conclave is as dramatic as the reading of a will. It's that level of natural drama.\"",
      "After the publication of Conclave in 2016, Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor - who had helped Harris with his research - asked for a copy in Italian to give to Pope Francis.",
      "\"I gave him the book and he said he thought the translation looked pretty good, but I don't know whether the Pope did read it. If he did, he didn't say anything to me.\"",

      "\"She must be one of the most self-disciplined 13-year-olds in America,\" Variety's Chris Willman wrote. On social media, fans said the child prodigy was the \"greatest nepo baby of all time\" as they marvelled at her flawless dance routines.",
      "Being a nepo baby - shorthand for the children of celebrities who often find themselves fast-tracked into industries such as film, fashion, and music - may have been scorned at in the past, but Blue Ivy's performance may have complicated the narrative.",
      "The teen had access to a stage that most could only dream of, but she also delivered a performance that fans and critics agreed was very impressive, which raises the question: Is this just another example of a celebrity child given an unearned spotlight, or could Blue Ivy be a genuine star in her own right?",

      "Gwyneth Paltrow, a nepo baby herself as the daughter of actress Blythe Danner and film director Bruce Paltrow, said the term was an \"ugly moniker\" and that children of famous people should not be judged negatively because \"there's nothing wrong with doing or wanting to do what your parents do\".",

If you do a bad job, the chances will stop\".",
      "Almost Famous star Kate Hudson, daughter of actors Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson, said in a 2022 interview with the Independent that \"people call it whatever they want\", but the idea that children will follow in the footsteps of their parents is \"not going to change\".",

    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 23:43:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The Bafta award-winning film gives viewers a window into a \"highly secret and a deeply private process\".",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 film Conclave - a box office hit and Oscar winner - tells the story of a papal election in which there are no obvious favourites. For many people, it was a glimpse into the rarefied world of the Vatican, and the highly secretive process of choosing a leader for the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "On Wednesday 7 May, life follows fiction when 134 cardinals begin the process of electing a successor to Pope Francis. As viewers of the film will know, the papal conclave will take place entirely behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel, beneath its world-famous Michelangelo frescoes.",
      "Nobody outside the confines of the Vatican will know the outcome until a plume of white smoke curls from its chimney, signifying that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.",
      "But what does the film tell us about how the conclave could unfold, and why do people find the process so fascinating?",
      "'Intense responsibility'",
      "Adapted from the bestselling novel by Robert Harris, Conclave shows the cardinal-electors isolating themselves within the confines of the Vatican during the process of the election.",
      "They are not allowed communication with anyone outside the conclave -  although given the practicalities, they are not entirely cut off.",
      "\"They all need feeding, they're not totally hermetically sealed off from the world,\" says Stephen Bullivant, professor of theology and the sociology of religion at St Mary's University, Twickenham.",
      "This self-imposed isolation is a tradition which stretches back hundreds of years.",
      "In part, it is aimed at preventing the electors from being influenced by external factors, although the idea of a process that happens behind closed doors may seem at odds with the modern world's \"focus on transparency, visibility and scrutiny\", according to Anna Rowlands, professor of Catholic social thought and practice at the University of Durham.",
      "The film invokes an \"incredible, introspective atmosphere\" and sense of withdrawal from the world, she says. \"I struggle to think of a more intense responsibility and feeling than being locked away in conclave.\"",
      "Conclave to elect new pope to begin on 7 May, Vatican says",
      "Who will be the next pope? Key candidates in an unpredictable process",
      "'Lots of politicking'",
      "On the screen, claustrophobic and intense deliberations, strategic huddles and tactical moves abound. One cardinal undermines a frontrunner to improve their own chances. Others with unlikely prospects urge their supporters to change their vote.",
      "This conflict of interests and competing ideologies provides much of the film's drama. \"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on,\" Nick Emerson, the film's editor, told the BBC earlier this year.",
      "While some cardinals will think the most important part is following divine guidance, others will have anxiety over making a quick decision, says Tina Beattie, professor emerita of Catholic studies at the University of Roehampton.",
      "Given that Pope Francis's health had been poor for a while, it is likely that, even before the conclave, \"there will have been lots of politicking and jostling for position already behind the scenes\", she adds.",
      "\"There will be all those tussles going on and [the cardinals] won't all be of one mind.\"",
      "Although in the film, some of the tensest scenes are focused on the act of voting, in reality, much of the drama may come in meetings in the days before conclave officially begins.",
      "During this time, the participants will be \"getting to know each other, working out what the priorities are and learning how to work together as a body so they can come up with a unified decision\", says Prof Rowlands, who is nearing the end of a two-year secondment to the Vatican.",
      "A complete unknown?",
      "In the film, an unknown cardinal - secretly appointed by the late pope - is catapulted into the fray.",
      "In real life, this would not be possible. Although any baptised Roman Catholic male is theoretically eligible to be made pope, all cardinals voting in the conclave would need to have been appointed publicly by a previous pope.",
      "Having said this, the imminent election may be one of the most unpredictable there has ever been. About 80% of the cardinals eligible to vote have been appointed in the past 12 years by Pope Francis. He consciously chose people from across the globe and with diverse political backgrounds.",
      "Many of Francis's appointees are from the developing world - \"places and contexts which are not normally given a red hat\", says Prof Rowlands.",
      "This adds a level of uncertainty as to their priorities and the ultimate decision.",
      "'A very human thing'",
      "The film presents the cardinals as fallible human beings jostling for power.",
      "Director Edward Berger told the BBC last year that while the conclave was thought of as \"an ancient spiritual ritual\", he wanted to bring the participants \"into modernity\".",
      "\"We put them on this pedestal, and when you look closer, they're going to have cell phones, they're going to smoke, they have the same problems and vices and secrets as we do.\"",
      "Prof Rowlands says the film provides a peek behind a process, with all elements of human nature and human life in it: \"Loss. grief, ambition, fear, temptation, courage.\"",
      "She adds: \"It's a very, very human thing, a conclave... It's got a divine purpose to it, but it's a very human thing.\"",

      "There are biological reasons too that make emotional health problems more likely, says Prof Andrea Danese, an expert in child and adolescent psychiatry at King's College London.",
      "\"Teenagers' brains don't develop all at once. The part that processes emotions matures earlier than the part responsible for self-control and good judgement. This means young people can feel things very intensely before they've fully developed the ability to manage those feelings, which helps explain some of the emotional ups and downs parents often see.\"",

      "\"It's important to avoid the trap of providing unnecessary reassurance,\" Prof Danese says. Instead, alongside teaching calming techniques, parents should discuss and test out feared situations. \"To reduce worries, it can help to write them down or talk about them at a special 'worry time' once a day.\"",

We get lots of calls from parents in that position. When they see their child struggling it can make them question themselves and they just don't know where to turn.",

      "The impact assessment says that the total number of assisted deaths is estimated to range from between 164 and 787 in the first (half) year of the service to between 1,042 and 4,559 in year 10, and assuming a start date to the policy of October 2029.",
      "The upper estimate  of just over 4,500 assisted deaths would still only represent less than 1% of all deaths, the document said.",
      "The impact assessment also provides a financial analysis of the costs and savings involved \u2013 it is not a document that gets into the ethical or philosophical arguments for and against the policy.",
      "It comes as the bill returns to the House of Commons later this month, with a crucial vote that will determine whether the bill becomes law expected to happen in mid June.",
      "Costs and savings",
      "In the first six months, savings for the NHS could range from around \u00a3919,000 to \u00a310.3m.",
      "This figure includes hospital care, primary and community care, hospice, medicines and other care costs that someone choosing an assisted death would not need.",
      "By the time the system has been running for ten years, savings could range from \u00a35.84m to \u00a359.6m.",
      "But there will be costs too. Staffing an assisted dying service could cost in excess of \u00a310m a year within a decade. And training costs in the first six months alone could be over \u00a311m.",
      "One assisted death would likely involve six health and care professionals working 32 hours.",
      "It said this could take staff away from existing services, but the overall impact of this was uncertain.",
      "And each panel that would review cases, comprising of a lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker, could cost \u00a32,000 a day.",
      "Overall, it said it was not possible to calculate whether the costs outweighed the savings or vice versa as there were too many uncertainties.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said the government was neutral on the issue. It said the document had been produce to help ensure any legislation that passes through parliament is \"workable, effective and enforceable\".",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, said she was grateful for the work that had been done on the impact assessment.",
      "She said she was still \"firmly of the view that the overall impact of this long overdue reform will be to make end of life care in England and Wales more compassionate and significantly safer\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: \"For me, assisted dying and giving people a choice at the end of their life when they are facing a terminal illness is about the human cost, it's not about pounds and pence.\"",
      "But Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, a former Paralympian and member of the House of Lords, who opposes assisted dying, said: \"This assessment highlights how assisted dying would put disabled and other vulnerable people at grave risk by providing financial incentives to an already overburdened and under-resourced NHS to offer assisted dying as a 'treatment option'.\"",
      "Leadbeater told Today the eligibility criteria under the bill was \"extremely strict\".",
      "She said: \"You have to be terminally ill. There are multiple layers of safeguarding built into the bill, including a multi-disciplinary panel of experts.",
      "\"So we are assessing mental capacity, we are checking for coercion at every level of this process to make sure that this is the clear and settled informed wish of the person who is terminally ill.\"",
      "She said that the bill was \"only about terminally ill adults who have less than six months to live\". \"The bill does not cover people with disabilities,\" she added.",
      "Prof Katherine Sleeman, professor of palliative care at King's College London, said the cost of end of life care was \"very, very high\", adding \"obviously if someone is not living those last months of life then it's lower\".",
      "However, she cautioned that the figures in the assessment were estimates."

    "published": "Sat, 03 May 2025 01:19:44 GMT",
    "summary": "Why is the number of autism diagnoses changing? And what does it mean for autistic people?",
    "story": [
      "You might have seen the social media videos: the \"five signs you're autistic\". You may have heard about long waiting lists for autism diagnosis. You might know, or sense, that the numbers of people deemed autistic are going up, fast.",
      "There's a lot at stake. These numbers mean fiercely different things to different people. To some, autism is a fear (what if this happens to my child?); to others it's an identity, maybe even a superpower.",
      "So what's the truth about the number of autistic people - and what does it mean?",
      "To count something, you first need to say what it is you're counting.",
      "For someone to be diagnosed with autism, they need to have \"persistent difficulties in social life and in social communication,\" says Ginny Russell, an associate professor in psychiatry at University College London (UCL) and the author of The Rise of Autism. She's using the criteria for autism from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, known as the DSM.",
      "She says examples of this behaviour can range from a lack of turn-taking in conversation to being completely non-verbal.",
      "Restricted interests and repetitive behaviours are part of a second group of traits required to meet the criteria, she says. So things like \"hand flapping or rocking or skin picking, but also sticking to repeated routines, like eating the same food every day.\"",
      "The data",
      "But what evidence is there that the number of people meeting those criteria has risen?",
      "Ms Russell led a study that looked at changes in rates of autism diagnosis in the UK over 20 years. It drew on a big sample of data from about nine million patients who were registered at GP surgeries.",
      "They found eight times as many new autism diagnoses in 2018 as in 1998. \"It was an enormous increase,\" she says, \"best described as exponential.\"",
      "And it's not just happening in the UK. Though data is lacking in much of the world, Ms Russell says that \"in the Anglophone and European countries where we do have data, there is compelling evidence to suggest that other countries have seen a similar sort of rise in diagnosis as in the UK\".",
      "But - and this is a crucial point - a rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism is not the same thing as a rise in the number of people who are autistic.",
      "Ms Russell's study and others like it show there has been a huge rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism, so in that sense there is more autism around than there used to be. But could that rise in diagnosis be explained by changes to who we count as autistic rather than an increase in the number of autistic people?",
      "Why are diagnoses rising?",
      "The definition of autism has not been static. The first studies to describe autism appeared in the 1930s and 1940s, says Francesca Happ\u00e9, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at King's College London, who's been researching autism since 1988.",
      "\"The original descriptions of autism are of children who have pretty high support needs, typically are very late to talk,\" she says. \"Some don't talk at all. And the focus really was on children, of course, and largely on males.\"",
      "But the definition was broadened, Professor Happ\u00e9 says, when in the 1990s Asperger's syndrome was added to diagnostic manuals. People with Asperger's were seen as on the autistic spectrum because of social difficulties and repetitive behaviour, but had fluent language and good intelligence, she says.",
      "The eightfold increase in new diagnoses that Ginny Russell found included Asperger's syndrome, which was seen as a particular type of autism.",
      "Another subset of autism added to the manuals was a \"safety net diagnosis\" called \"pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified\" (PDD-NOS) and that increased the numbers too.",
      "Today, diagnostic manuals refer simply to autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, which includes people previously diagnosed with Asperger's or PDD-NOS.",
      "The autism net has been cast wider.",
      "Autism in women and girls",
      "One group of people now falling under this net more often is women and girls.",
      "Studies looking at the huge rise in autism diagnoses show that the rise has been considerably faster for females than for males.",
      "It's something Sarah Hendrickx has seen in her job as part of a team that diagnoses autism.",
      "\"I've been doing this maybe 15, 20 years or so,\" she says. \"In the early days, they were virtually all males that were coming forward for diagnosis. And now they're nearly all females who I see.\"",
      "Ms Hendrickx was herself diagnosed with autism as an adult and is also the author of a book called Women and Girls on the Autism Spectrum.",
      "She says the big growth in the number of people diagnosed with autism is because we're\u202f\"playing catch-up for decades and decades of people like myself\".",
      "Because autism was originally seen as something that affected mainly boys, she says autistic girls would instead be diagnosed with mental health conditions like social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD).",
      "Now we have a better understanding of how autism can present in girls and women, thanks to an increase in research and books like Ms Hendrickx's, which was first published in 2014.",
      "She says that one important gender difference is that girls may be better at masking, which means hiding their autistic traits so that they fit in socially, perhaps by copying others' behaviour.",
      "More adults diagnosed",
      "The rise in diagnosis has also been much faster among adults than children. Ms Hendrickx says this shows another way the autism net has been cast wider: it now includes more people with lower support needs.",
      "\"We are talking, I think, more about individuals with no intellectual disability,\" she says. \"I think people with delays in their development, in their speech, are much more likely to have been diagnosed much, much earlier because the signs were much clearer at a very young age.\"",
      "There's data to back this up. One study shows that between 2000 and 2018, new autism diagnoses of those with intellectual disability rose about 20%, while autism diagnoses in those without intellectual disability rose 700%. Autism's centre of gravity has shifted.",
      "For Ellie Middleton, an autistic and ADHD content creator and author, that's a good thing.",
      "The 27-year-old says that sceptics questioning the increase in diagnoses should instead be asking: \"how did all of these people spend so much of their life undiagnosed, unsupported and let down?\"",
      "She says she became very mentally unwell before being diagnosed with autism. \"I was on the maximum dose of antidepressants that any fully grown adult could be on at the age of 17,\" she says. \"I couldn't be left alone, I couldn't go out.\"",
      "Her autism diagnosis three years ago helped her to change the way she lives her life and to keep her mental health in a better place.",
      "But others worry that the version of autism people now see in the media and in their social media feeds is distorting public perceptions.",
      "A focus on celebrities can \"glamorise\" autism, says Venessa Swaby, who is also autistic and runs support groups for autistic children and their parents through her organisation A2ndvoice. Meanwhile, she says, families with non-speaking autistic children feel they are \"written off\".",
      "As the number of people diagnosed with autism has risen, so then has the diversity of autistic people, which, in turn, has brought tensions over who owns the word - and what it means.",
      "Environmental causes",
      "There's also been a looping effect: as more people are diagnosed with autism, more people become aware of it and that fuels the rise in numbers further.",
      "The internet and social media have played a big part in that - as well as speculation about the reasons behind the rapid rise in diagnoses.",
      "Disproven theories linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination to autism linger. Others say there must be something in what we eat, drink, or breathe that's causing more autism.",
      "But, as we've seen, the data suggest the rise in diagnoses can be explained by a broadening autism definition rather than an increase in the amount of underlying autism. And there's solid research showing that autism is largely a product of the genes you inherit from your parents.",
      "Is there any evidence that environmental causes could be playing some part in the rise, even if a small one?",
      "Ginny Russell looked at research into different potential environmental factors and found only a few that were plausible to explain some of the rise.",
      "\"There is definitely a quite well established link between autism and the age of the parent,\" she says. \"If the parent is older you're more likely to have an autistic child, but it's not a huge effect.\"",
      "She also says that there's some evidence around \"preterm birth and infection during pregnancy and also some birth complications\".",
      "But Ms Russell says it's important to put those possible factors into perspective.",
      "\"I honestly believe that the vast majority of the increase is due to what I would call a diagnostic culture,\" she says. \"Our conception of the condition has changed, and that's meant that there's been an increase.\"",

      "Following the publication of an interim report, in March 2021, NHS England said it would increase spending on maternity care by \u00a395m a year.",
      "At the time, it said the money would be used to hire as many as 1,000 midwives and around 80 consultant obstetricians.",

      "She urged ministers to \"urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way\".",

      "He added: \"One of the reasons the UK has done so well is we have some of the most highly skilled and experienced filmmakers and production crews in the world.\"",
      "Bell concurred that \"the issue isn't that foreign films are taking precedence over domestic films, it's that, firstly, films are cheaper to make overseas, because of lack of tax credits in certain places\" and lower costs.",
      "\"People aren't going to the cinema as much and decline in subscription services and rise of social media platforms and content creators... the industry is entirely changed.\"",
      "She added: \"The answer is not tariffs if [Trump is] trying to kick-start the industry in Hollywood.\"",
      "According to the Hollywood Reporter, the Californian film commission offers a 20\u202f percent base credit to feature films and TV series - lower than most other US states and countries like the UK and has a $330m (\u00a3248m) cap on the programme, which can make countries like the UK more attractive.",
      "A government spokesperson said on Monday: \"The film sector is a key part of the UK's world-class creative industries, which employ millions of people, generate billions for our economy and showcase the best of our creativity and culture to the world.",

      "Scotland's first minister John Swinney is not planning a party to celebrate his first anniversary in Holyrood's top political office. That's not really his style.",
      "Instead of cake, balloons and fizzy wine he will mark this milestone by announcing an updated \"programme for government\" - as the countdown begins to the next Holyrood election in almost exactly a year's time.",
      "As Swinney told me at a recent news conference, this is not about tearing up his existing programme and starting again but building on what's already there.",
      "Four priorities",
      "It's an opportunity for him to show that his focus is on the day job rather than on dreams of independence.",
      "You can expect him to talk a lot about his four stated priorities: improving public services, growing the economy, reducing child poverty and tackling climate change.",
      "Swinney specifically wants to deliver noticeable improvements in the NHS over the next 12 months.",
      "That's not only because the public wants faster access to diagnosis and treatment but also because he believes cutting the queues is the best way to build trust with voters and to retain power.",
      "He has also promised further economic action which in the short term could be about doing more to ease the cost of living pressures that many people feel.",
      "On 7 May next year the public will pass judgement on what will by then be 19 years of the SNP in government in Scotland.",
      "Voters will ultimately decide whether to keep John Swinney as first minister or kick him out.",
      "The Conservatives, Labour and other opposition parties argue that the SNP's record in office requires a change of political direction.",
      "They highlight long waits in the health service, high levels of drug deaths and new ferries arriving years overdue and seriously overbudget.",

      "While Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay wants his party to be seen as a lower tax alternative to both the SNP and Labour.",
      "Yet Swinney has greater cause for optimism about his political prospects now than he did a year ago.",
      "There has been a remarkable shift in the Scottish political narrative since he replaced Humza Yousaf as first minister.",
      "You may remember that Yousaf brought himself down by ending the SNP's power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens.",
      "That set him up for a confidence vote that he no longer had sufficient support to win and he stood down as first minister.",
      "Swinney's inheritance was challenging.",
      "His was a party fractured over independence strategy, gender politics and environmental commitments plus the legacy of harassment complaints against the former first minister Alex Salmond that were mishandled by the Scottish government.",
      "Then there was the ongoing police investigation into the SNP's finances which has since developed into a criminal prosecution of the party's former chief executive Peter Murrell.",
      "In July last year the SNP was heavily defeated by Labour in the UK general election but John Swinney, who had only just returned to the political frontline, escaped much of the blame.",
      "It was not that his colleagues forgot that he had been at the heart of SNP government for most of the party's time in office.",
      "It was that many saw him as the only figure with the knowledge, experience and political clout to manage the aftermath of such a major meltdown.",
      "Steadying the ship",
      "Swinney was elected party leader unopposed in May last year and moved quickly to patch up some of the divisions within the SNP by appointing Kate Forbes to his cabinet as deputy first minister.",
      "There have been other changes too.",
      "He no longer has a minister for independence, has shelved plans to pilot juryless rape trials and the creation of a new national care service has been dropped in all but name.",
      "Swinney has skilfully worked to calm controversy and steady the ship.",
      "The UK Supreme Court's decision on the definition of a woman under the Equality Act is another example.",
      "The judges decided biological sex and not acquired gender was the answer.",
      "Swinney immediately accepted the ruling as if it was a minor clarification of the law rather than a comprehensive defeat for the Scottish government by the campaign group For Women Scotland.",
      "The Conservatives are determined that the fall-out from this legal battle at least merits an apology from the first minister to the women who took the case to court.",
      "Instead, Swinney promises revised guidance on the provision and use of single-sex spaces and no attempt to revisit legislation to make it easier for trans people to legally change their gender.",
      "He insists he will protect the rights of everyone in Scotland and hopes that will help him glide past this particular row.",
      "The divisions in his party on this issue suggest his difficulties may not be so easily overcome, although the looming election may help bring different factions together.",
      "Unifying figure",
      "Having watched his old boss Nicola Sturgeon finish her term in office as a deeply polarising figure, John Swinney is attempting to avoid the same fate.",
      "That is why he is recasting himself as a unifying figure - someone prepared to reach out across party lines to work with others to get things done.",
      "Yes, this is the same John Swinney who played a central role in the independence referendum that literally made voters choose between \"yes\" and \"no\" on the question of leaving the UK political union.",
      "To be fair, the first minister demonstrated a capacity for more inclusive politics during the Scottish budget process, making sufficient concessions to other parties so that only the Scottish Conservatives voted against.",
      "He presented his recent \"summit\" with political, faith and civic leaders to counter anti-democratic forces in a similar light.",
      "However, his main rivals think that event, which excluded Reform UK, elevated Nigel Farage's party in the Scottish national debate.",
      "Reform UK is persistently polling in double figures in Scotland and other pro-UK parties are worried.",
      "While Swinney obviously despises Reform's hostility to both immigration and the pursuit of net zero, he also knows they are more likely to take votes from the Conservatives and Labour than the SNP.",
      "After Reform's big gains in the English local elections on Thursday, there is a significant electoral test of their support in Scotland in just over a month.",
      "The Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election on Thursday 5 June, following the death of SNP minister Christina McKelvie, will be widely seen as a two-horse race between the SNP and Labour.",
      "This constituency vote has the capacity to entrench or overturn the prevailing narrative in Scottish politics - that Scottish Labour has lost momentum as a result of difficult decisions by the UK government on issues like welfare.",
      "With a year to go, it looks perfectly possible that the SNP - far less popular than it has been in recent years - could still win a fifth term in office at Holyrood.",
      "If the SNP can hold the Hamilton seat, their confidence will rise.",
      "If Labour can take it from them, it will revive Anas Sarwar's sense that the public mood is for further political change.",
      "Labour thinks they can win if the vote is a referendum on SNP performance in devolved government but they fear that if it becomes a vote of confidence in Labour's decision-making at UK level they will struggle.",
      "The UK Labour government may have delivered record funding to the Scottish government but the SNP will not let the public forget the Treasury's cuts to the winter fuel payment for pensioners, which Scottish ministers plan to mitigate.",
      "Scottish Labour could do with the UK government using its economic clout to help address challenges in Scotland.",
      "They were delighted by the prime minister's promise of \u00a3200m to help secure a future for the Grangemouth industrial site but some in the party would like to see further intervention.",
      "With the Hamilton by-election a month away, the Conservatives start as the third placed party.",
      "They are worried that their new leader Russell Findlay has not had enough time to prevent Reform UK knocking them into fourth.",
      "Whatever Reform's performance, all parties will want to analyse what it might mean if replicated at the Holyrood election where the voting system is designed to make it easier for smaller parties to gain seats.",
      "Without a Scottish leader, a policy programme or an established organisational structure, Reform UK claims to have 10,000 members in Scotland who have turned to them because they are so fed up with politics as usual.",
      "One further twist is that when Nigel Farage turns up to campaign in the by-election he is likely to face detailed questions on recent comments where he suggested he was relaxed about John Swinney continuing in power.",
      "That may make his brand of politics less acceptable to pro-UK voters even though independence has slipped down the political agenda and there seems little prospect of another referendum anytime soon.",
      "Farage's mission in Scotland he told the BBC is to gain a foothold at Holyrood, become part of the Scottish national conversation and then to replace the Conservatives.",
      "That may help to explain why Russell Findlay is leaning more towards Reform UK positions in some policy areas.",
      "For example, he recently called for a more affordable transition to a low carbon economy or what Reform calls \"net stupid zero\".",
      "This type of Tory tilt, designed to stop their traditional supporters switching to Reform, has already cost the party the defection of MSP Jamie Greene to the Liberal Democrats - a significant coup for their leader Alex Cole-Hamilton.",
      "The Scottish Greens who gained significant profile during their period in government and will attract further attention when they elect a new co-leader to replace Patrick Harvie in the summer are among the range of other parties contesting the by-election and the Holyrood campaign in 2026.",
      "Senior SNP figures tell me that independence will feature in their national campaign and ministers have promised one further paper completing their independence prospectus in the coming months.",
      "That said, only the most optimistic independence supporter would predict another referendum in the next five years if there's a \"yes\" majority at Holyrood after the 2026 election.",
      "The issue is not dead but it certainly feels more dormant than at any time over the past decade.",
      "The less that constitutional politics is to the fore, the more space there will be to discuss the competing offers from rival parties on the domestic issues over which Holyrood has control.",
      "That's health, education, law and order, parts of welfare, transport, the environment and some aspects of the economy.",
      "Then there is global uncertainty.",
      "Politics at home is vulnerable to the impact of global issues, whether that's import tariffs from the US President Donald Trump or the effects of conflicts in the Middle East, Ukraine or elsewhere.",
      "Some of these issues may change the context in which domestic debates take place. Others could impact on the UK economy directly or as a knock-on effect.",
      "The US president and his vice-president JD Vance have been known to speak up for their preferred candidates in other people's elections.",
      "That's what John Swinney did when he suggested US voters back Donald Trump's principal opponent Kamala Harris. Don't be surprised if the Trump administration returns the compliment.",
      "There's no reason to think the first minister would lose sleep having President Trump against him or having Nigel Farage as a foil. Both could help motivate his political base.",
      "No-one in Scottish politics can take anything for granted. A lot can change in a year and uncertainty is likely to be a hallmark of the campaign to come.",
      "John Swinney and his rivals for the job of first minister are probably best advised to keep their fizzy wine on ice."

      "In Staffordshire, Reform won 72% of the seats on 41% of the vote. In Kent, 37% of the vote delivered it 70% of the seats, while in Derbyshire the same share was rewarded with 66% of all the councillors.",
      "Instead of insulating Conservative and Labour from the impact of a third-party challenge, as it has done so often before, first past the post exacerbated their losses. In both cases Reform took nearly half of all the seats those parties were defending.",
      "The map above is the most detailed local election mapping ever produced by the BBC. It details the strength of the Reform vote in every ward that voted on Thursday and shows support for Reform varied considerably.",
      "That variation has some striking and important features. They suggest the party was particularly popular among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019 - and that Reform's success cannot simply be dismissed as a short-lived protest vote.",
      "Brexit still a fault line",
      "Reflecting the party's anti-EU stance, Reform did much better in wards that voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum than it did in wards that backed Remain.",
      "In wards where more than 65% voted Leave in 2016, Reform won on average as much as 45% of the vote. In contrast, in places where a majority backed Remain, only 19% voted for Reform.",
      "Although talked about much less by politicians nowadays, Brexit is still an important fault line in our politics. Reform's appeal is significantly concentrated among those who believe the Brexit decision was right.",
      "Even so, the fact that even in pro-Remain wards the party was able to win as much as a fifth of the vote was testimony to the scale of the swing that it enjoyed on Thursday.",
      "The Brexit division is also evident in the demographic character of the places where Reform did best and those where it did less well.",
      "University graduates and those in professional and managerial jobs were least likely to vote for Brexit in 2016. Reform found it more difficult to do well in places where they are most numerous.",
      "Reform won 39% of the vote in heavily working-class wards but only 19% in the most middle-class ones.",
      "The map shows Reform's highest vote of all (65.1%) was in Thornley & Wheatley Hill, situated in Tony Blair's former Sedgefield constituency in Durham and once a centre of coal mining. Next highest was Chadsmoor in Staffordshire and Romney Marsh in Kent.",
      "Meanwhile, support for the party averaged 43% in wards where more than half of adults have few, if any, educational qualifications. In contrast, it polled just 19% where more than two in five have a degree.",
      "Reform's lowest share of the vote, 3.7%, was in the Parks ward in Oxford, situated in the heart of the famous university city.",
      "Immigration is also a key issue for Reform. However, this perhaps makes the party less appealing to those from a minority background.",
      "Certainly, on average the party only polled 22% in wards where more than one in five identify as other than 'white', compared with a tally of 33% in places where more than 95% told the 2021 Census that they were 'white'.",
      "In summary, Reform did best in what has sometimes been characterised in the wake of the Brexit referendum as 'left-behind' Britain \u2013 places that have profited less from globalisation and university expansion and where a more conservative outlook on immigration is more common.",
      "A problem for the two main parties",
      "Neither the Conservatives nor Labour are likely to recover from the drubbing they received on Thursday unless they can appeal more to this slice of Britain.",
      "Although polls indicate that Reform finds it easier to win over former Conservative voters than their Labour counterparts, Reform's average share of the vote was strikingly just as high in wards that Labour were defending as it was in places that the Conservatives were trying to retain.",
      "The party on average won 32% of the vote in previously Labour wards and 32% in Conservative ones.",
      "As a result, Labour lost seats to Reform at much the same rate as the Conservatives, a pattern that cost Labour control of the one council they were defending, Doncaster.",
      "In contrast, Reform's advance was more muted in wards that the Liberal Democrats and the Greens were defending.  The party's average share in these wards was just 22%. As a result, Reform had relatively little success in taking seats from these two parties.",
      "Liberal Democrat and Green wards \u2013 unlike many Conservative and Labour ones - are heavily populated by university graduates.",
      "Reform's success on Thursday undoubtedly reflects the mood of an electorate that still has little faith in the Conservatives and which now is disappointed by Labour's performance in office.",
      "However, it is evidently proving most popular in a very distinctive part of Britain that overturned the political tables a decade ago in voting for Brexit - and which now has done so again.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czjnzz7kvdlo",
    "published": "Sat, 03 May 2025 07:56:36 GMT",
    "summary": "Estimate included in official review of costs and impact of passing assisted dying law in England and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "The number of assisted deaths could be more than 4,000 in the 10th year after the law comes into force in England and Wales if MPs vote for it, a review of the policy says.",
      "The estimate forms part of the official impact assessment, carried out by civil servants to inform MPs as they debate whether to allow assisted dying.",
      "It said initially the numbers coming forward would be low, but are expected to grow over time.",
      "The impact assessment says that the total number of assisted deaths is estimated to range from between 164 and 787 in the first (half) year of the service to between 1,042 and 4,559 in year 10, and assuming a start date to the policy of October 2029.",
      "The upper estimate  of just over 4,500 assisted deaths would still only represent less than 1% of all deaths, the document said.",
      "The impact assessment also provides a financial analysis of the costs and savings involved \u2013 it is not a document that gets into the ethical or philosophical arguments for and against the policy.",
      "It comes as the bill returns to the House of Commons later this month, with a crucial vote that will determine whether the bill becomes law expected to happen in mid June.",
      "Costs and savings",
      "In the first six months, savings for the NHS could range from around \u00a3919,000 to \u00a310.3m.",
      "This figure includes hospital care, primary and community care, hospice, medicines and other care costs that someone choosing an assisted death would not need.",
      "By the time the system has been running for ten years, savings could range from \u00a35.84m to \u00a359.6m.",
      "But there will be costs too. Staffing an assisted dying service could cost in excess of \u00a310m a year within a decade. And training costs in the first six months alone could be over \u00a311m.",
      "One assisted death would likely involve six health and care professionals working 32 hours.",
      "It said this could take staff away from existing services, but the overall impact of this was uncertain.",
      "And each panel that would review cases, comprising of a lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker, could cost \u00a32,000 a day.",
      "Overall, it said it was not possible to calculate whether the costs outweighed the savings or vice versa as there were too many uncertainties.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said the government was neutral on the issue. It said the document had been produce to help ensure any legislation that passes through parliament is \"workable, effective and enforceable\".",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, said she was grateful for the work that had been done on the impact assessment.",
      "She said she was still \"firmly of the view that the overall impact of this long overdue reform will be to make end of life care in England and Wales more compassionate and significantly safer\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: \"For me, assisted dying and giving people a choice at the end of their life when they are facing a terminal illness is about the human cost, it's not about pounds and pence.\"",
      "But Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, a former Paralympian and member of the House of Lords, who opposes assisted dying, said: \"This assessment highlights how assisted dying would put disabled and other vulnerable people at grave risk by providing financial incentives to an already overburdened and under-resourced NHS to offer assisted dying as a 'treatment option'.\"",
      "Leadbeater told Today the eligibility criteria under the bill was \"extremely strict\".",
      "She said: \"You have to be terminally ill. There are multiple layers of safeguarding built into the bill, including a multi-disciplinary panel of experts.",
      "\"So we are assessing mental capacity, we are checking for coercion at every level of this process to make sure that this is the clear and settled informed wish of the person who is terminally ill.\"",
      "She said that the bill was \"only about terminally ill adults who have less than six months to live\". \"The bill does not cover people with disabilities,\" she added.",
      "Prof Katherine Sleeman, professor of palliative care at King's College London, said the cost of end of life care was \"very, very high\", adding \"obviously if someone is not living those last months of life then it's lower\".",
      "However, she cautioned that the figures in the assessment were estimates."

    "summary": "The government says there is not enough time to introduce a new misogyny law before next year's Holyrood election.",
    "story": [
      "The Scottish government has confirmed it will not bring forward planned legislation to criminalise misogyny before next year's Holyrood election.",
      "A bill has long been promised to improve protections for women and girls, but ministers now say there is not enough time to draw up a law which reflects the recent Supreme Court judgement on the definition of a woman.",
      "They are instead going to amend existing hate crime legislation to provide protections on the basis of sex.",
      "The government has also confirmed it will not be bringing forward legislation to end conversion therapy this term, and is hoping for a UK-wide solution.",
      "A new misogyny law was promised after an expert group in 2022 backed separate legislation rather than incorporating abuse and violence against women into Scotland's hate crime law.",
      "The group, led by Baroness Helena Kennedy KC, said this was a better option because women are not a minority, and a \"more fundamental set of responses\" were required to address the \"deeply rooted\" problem.",
      "The Scottish government proposed creating five new offences in its Misogyny Bill including stirring up hatred against women and misogynistic harassment.",
      "Misogyny would also be treated as an aggravating factor in crimes, which could lead to tougher sentencing.",
      "QC shocked by level of misogyny in Scotland",
      "Why are women not protected by new hate crime law?",
      "The Scottish government said it remained committed to ensuring people are protected from misogynistic abuse but it was a \"complex area of policy and law\" which required more time to work out where it would apply.",
      "This would include assessing the implications of the recent Supreme Court judgement that a woman is defined by biological sex for the purposes of equality legislation, it said.",
      "It said there was insufficient time to proceed with the bill in this parliamentary session, but in September it would add the protected characteristic of sex to Scotland's hate crime act.",
      "First Minister John Swinney said: \"We have to navigate a way through all of the issues that come out of the Supreme Court judgement.",
      "\"What action we can take is action we can take during this parliamentary term to tackle misogyny and that's what the government will do\".",
      "Conversion therapy",
      "The Scottish government said it was also dropping plans for a new law banning conversion therapy for sexual orientation or gender identity.",
      "Both pieces of legislation were part of the Bute House Agreement with the Scottish Greens which ended in April last year.",
      "Ministers previously said Scotland wanted to lead the way in outlawing such practices - but it has now urged the Labour government at Westminster to legislate on the issue.",
      "Equalities Minister Kaukab Stewart said if an approach covering Scotland, England and Wales could not be agreed, the Scottish government would introduce its own law within a year if it remained in power after next year's Holyrood election.",
      "A joint statement from Scottish LGBTQIA+ organisations said they were \"incredibly disappointed\" to see an end to conversion practices would not proceed - and that the community had felt rights were being \"rolled back and reduced\" for a long time.",
      "The statement said: \"Simply put, the longer it takes to legislate to end conversion practices the more harm will be done, including to those most vulnerable.",
      "\"The failure to progress this bill is yet another blow to our community's faith in government and the institutions that are meant to represent and protect us.\"",
      "Publishing this news in a written question on a Friday morning after elections down south is a classic attempt from the Scottish government to bury some bad news.",
      "In fairness, it is true to say that drawing up complicated legislation before the ink is even dry on a relevant Supreme Court's ruling would be a challenge in the remaining year of the Holyrood term.",
      "But a bill can pass in a matter of days if the political will is there.",
      "And women's groups are already deeply suspicious of the government, given it has spent the last few years engaged in court battle with campaigners about fundamental definitions.",
      "Ministers will point to the move to beef up hate crime law as evidence they are taking action on behalf of women and girls - despite the fact they were originally omitted from that bill with the promise of bespoke legislation.",
      "The point of this move is to get some awkward issues out of the way before John Swinney makes his programme for government speech next week about what he is  planning on doing for the rest of the Holyrood term.",
      "But for all he is keen to get away from spiky debates around gender politics - and you can read the shelving of the conversion therapy ban as part of that too - he is still going to face plenty of questions about this.",
      "Scottish Conservative deputy leader Rachael Hamilton MSP said the misogyny bill was the latest in a \"litany of paused, ditched or botched\" policies from Nicola Sturgeon's time as first minister.",
      "She said: \"Misogyny remains a serious problem and it's crucial that women and girls are protected from all forms of threatening and abusive behaviour in a way that safeguards their rights.\"",
      "Scottish Liberal Democrat equalities spokesperson Christine Jardine MP said: \"This is the wrong thing to do.",
      "\"The proposed legislation was a chance to substantially improve protections, help change culture and behaviours and move us closer to eradicating misogyny.\"",
      "'Screeching U-turn'",
      "Scottish Labour justice spokesperson Pauline McNeill said \"This is a shameful broken promise to Scottish women at a time when misogynistic hatred is on the rise.",
      "\"The SNP has spent years kicking this issue into the long grass by insisting this approach wouldn't work, only to perform a screeching U-turn.",
      "The Scottish Greens said dropping the two bills was a \"shameful backward step\".",
      "The party's equalities spokesperson Maggie Chapman said: \"The misogyny bill was a vital step in ensuring that reports of harassment and assault are taken seriously.",
      "\"LGBTQIA+ people are put at serious risk by cruel, harmful conversion practices that are currently flying under the radar. So-called conversion 'therapies' are deeply immoral and leave lasting damage for survivors.\""

      "Following the publication of an interim report, in March 2021, NHS England said it would increase spending on maternity care by \u00a395m a year.",
      "At the time, it said the money would be used to hire as many as 1,000 midwives and around 80 consultant obstetricians.",
      "Some of the money was also to be spent on allowing consultants and midwives to train together - a key recommendation of the initial report, by senior midwife Donna Ockenden - as well as allocating money for the NHS to recruit from overseas.",
      "But analysis of NHS funding for this year, carried out by the Health Service Journal, showed that just \u00a32m of the \u00a395m was to be ringfenced for 2025/26.",
      "The rest of the money will be given to the 42 Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) that decide how the health service funding is allocated locally across England.",
      "Responding to the change, Ms Ockenden posted on social media: \"How has this happened? So disappointed. Talking to colleagues across perinatal services, the sense of disappointment is profound.\"",
      "If the ICBs decide to spend the money they've been allocated on maternity care, there won't be a funding cut.",

    "summary": "Shabana Mahmood said judges at the UK's highest court had provided \"legal clarity\".",
    "story": [
      "The justice secretary has said it is \"absolutely unacceptable\" to question the validity of the Supreme Court after it ruled that the term \"woman\" is defined by biological sex.",
      "Speaking to Parliament's Human Rights Joint Committee,  Shabana Mahmood said judges at the UK's highest court \"provided the legal clarity in their legal decision which is exactly their job\".",
      "The decision was seen as a victory by women's rights groups but some trans campaigners have argued it did not take into account their view of the complexities of biology and a transgender former judge says she plans to bring an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights .",
      "Mahmood said: \"It's disappointing... that some individuals have sought to question the validity of the Supreme Court or cast aspersions...\"",
      "Supreme Court backs 'biological' definition of woman",
      "Trans former judge plans to challenge gender ruling at European court",
      "Equality watchdog issues interim guidance on single-sex spaces",
      "In its ruling, the Supreme Court said the terms \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the 2010 Equality Act \"refer to a biological woman and biological sex\".",
      "This means, for instance, that transgender women, who are biologically male but identify as women, can be excluded from women-only spaces.",
      "The judges said trans people are still protected from discrimination under equalities legislation, and that this interpretation of the law does not cause disadvantage to the \"potentially vulnerable group\".",
      "The Equalities and Human Rights Commission also published interim guidance after the ruling which said trans women \"should not be permitted to use the women's facilities\" in workplaces or public-facing services.  The same applies to trans men, who are biologically female.",
      "But it said that trans people \"should not be put in a position where there are no facilities for them to use\".",
      "Mahmood was speaking to MPs and peers a day after Dr Victoria McCloud, the only UK judge to publicly say she is transgender, said she is planning to bring an appeal case before the European Court of Human Rights.",
      "Dr McCloud, who stepped down from a High Court role last year, said the Supreme Court judgement and equality watchdog's new guidance violated her human rights and she felt \"contained and segregated\".",
      "She said the ruling had failed to consider human rights arguments that would have been put by trans people and the judgement had left her with the legal \"nonsense\" of being \"two sexes at once\".",
      "Some trans campaigners have expressed disappointment at the ruling. They argued, for example, it is impossible for services - from police officers performing a strip search through to restaurants - to truly specify someone's biology, pointing to intersex cases as an example of where biological sex is not binary.",
      "The Supreme Court ruling was the culmination of a long-running legal battle brought by campaign group For Women Scotland, which had argued that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female. The group had argued that women felt unsafe with trans women using female facilities.",
      "Mahmood told the committee the Supreme Court had \"handled things very sensitively\".",
      "She said the judges have \"done their job and I think they've sought to do it in a way that recognises that we're talking about a balance of rights but sought to give confidence to a minority community that they still have protections from discrimination\".",
      "In her evidence, to the Human Rights Joint Committee, the justice secretary also addressed the government's policy on transgender prisoners.",
      "Mahmood said it \"strikes the right balance\" but \"we will obviously now go back and with the clarity from the Supreme Court just make sure that that policy still stands to scrutiny or whether we need to make any changes\".",
      "The justice secretary said the vast majority of trans women inmates are within the male estate, and she had not moved any trans prisoners into women's jails since taking office last July.",
      "Prison service data for 2023-24 shows there were 295 transgender prisoners in England and Wales, with 51 in female prisons and 244 in male prisons.",
      "But she said: \"No trans women convicted of a rape or serious violence offence who retains birth genitalia would ever be considered for being placed in the women's estate.\"",

    "story": [
      "Kemi Badenoch has accused the government of breaking its promise to set up five local inquiries into grooming gangs despite pledging to do so.",
      "The Conservative leader said Sir Keir Starmer had promised \u00a35m to fund five locally-led investigations into grooming gangs but delivered just one, in Oldham.",
      "During Prime Ministers Questions, Badenoch suggested Sir Keir was \"dragging his heels\" on inquiries to shield Labour-run councils from scandal.",
      "Sir Keir said Labour were \"investing more in delivering truth and justice\" for victims of grooming gangs than the Conservatives had during \"14 long years\" in power.",
      "Ministers have been facing growing demands to reveal which areas are running grooming gang inquires alongside the review in Oldham, and a three-month audit of national evidence being led by government troubleshooter Baroness Louise Casey.",
      "Earlier this month Tom Crowther, the barrister helping to develop the schemes, suggested local inquiries into grooming gangs had stalled since they were announced in January.",
      "Crowther, who chaired the inquiry into child sex abuse in Telford, Shropshire, gave evidence to the Commons Home Affairs Committee at the start of April and told MPs he had asked a government official \"do you still want me?\"",
      "The issue was again raised in the Commons on Monday, when Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips told MPs she expected there to be more than five local inquires.",
      "Labour was focusing on ensuring \"there is a local process of accountability that actually changes things on the ground\", Phillips told MPs.",
      "More local grooming inquiries expected - minister",
      "Local grooming gang reviews will go ahead, says Cooper",
      "During a heated PMQs exchange, Badenoch sought to tie grooming gang inquiries to the local elections, a series of councils and mayoral votes across England on Thursday.",
      "The Tory leader said voters faced a choice of \"chaos and cover-ups under Labour councils or better services under the Conservatives\".",
      "Badenoch repeatedly asked Sir Keir for an update on the local inquires. When he did not respond, she said he \"cannot name a single place because nothing is happening\".",
      "She questioned whether the prime minister was \"dragging his heels\" on local inquiries into grooming gangs because he \"doesn't want Labour cover-ups exposed\", adding that the inquiries hadn't started because \"local authorities don't want to investigate themselves\".",
      "A national inquiry was needed as local probes \"cannot force witnesses to appear\" and \"cannot force people to give evidence under oath\", Badenoch said.",
      "Sir Keir accused Badenoch of \"staying silent\" on the issue in government while he \"oversaw the first grooming gang prosecution\" as Director of Public Prosecutions.",
      "He told the Commons: \"I was the prosecutor who brought the first case.",
      "\"On the back of that I then changed the entire approach to prosecutions, which was then lauded by the government that we were doing the right thing, and brought those prosecutions.\"",
      "In contrast to the Conservatives, Labour were \"implementing existing recommendations\" of the 2022 national inquiry into child sexual abuse and \"providing for local inquiries\", he said.",
      "For more than a decade there has been a series of high-profile cases where groups of men, predominantly of Pakistani descent, were convicted of sexually abusing and raping mainly white girls in the UK.",
      "In 2022, Prof Alexis Jay published the conclusions of a seven-year national inquiry into child sexual abuse, which investigated abuse in churches and schools, as well as by grooming gangs.",
      "The Conservative have been calling for a second national inquiry into grooming gangs since the issue was thrust back into the spotlight by tech billionaire Elon Musk at the start of the year.",
      "The proposal was backed by opposition MPs, as well as some Labour figures including Rotherham MP Sarah Champion alongside Labour mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham.",
      "Speaking in the House of Lords, Labour's Baroness Hazarika offered an apology on behalf of the Muslim community for the \"sickening, despicable, wicked acts\" of child grooming gangs.",
      "She said that many people in Muslim community were as appalled as anyone else, telling peers: \"This is not who we are\", and added that many of the men were abusing Muslim women as well as white women.",
      "The Liberal Democrats have called for the the government to focus on implementing all 20 of the recommendations made by the Jay inquiry.",
      "On Monday, party spokesperson Lisa Smart said MPs \"owe it to\" victims to not just \"offer words of support, but to deliver justice and bring offenders to account\".",
      "Reform UK have backed calls for a national inquiry and have previously offered to fund their own.",
      "Party leader Nigel Farage has previously accused both Labour and Tories of \"failing to bring justice to the thousands of victims across multiple decades of these horrific crimes\".",
      "Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer said Badenoch \"appears determined to use this issue as an excuse to push her own agenda and try to make political capital\".",
      "\"A leader of a major political party who is serious about tackling sexual abuse and exploitation of girls would put the victims and their needs front and centre and offer support for action to tackle misogyny,\" she added.",

      "The patchwork of different election results across England has been truly fascinating, throwing up all sorts of lessons.",
      "Here are seven things we have learnt from the contests:",
      "These are really bad results for the Labour Party",
      "Sometimes in politics what is most obvious is most important. These are a bad set of results for the Labour Party at their first electoral test since being swept to office ten months ago in a landslide of epic proportions.",
      "\"We did it!\" the prime minister told his jubilant supporters back then as seat after seat fell to Labour, adding: \"It feels good, I have to be honest.\"",
      "That's not so much the vibe these days.",
      "Leaving the eight-hour count after the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, Labour campaigners were utterly dejected, not least at having lost by only six votes, the closest result in any by-election ever.",
      "Yet even if they had won by six votes, the trend would have been the same -  a governing party which has burnt through goodwill at an unimaginable pace.",
      "It's possible to overstate how dramatic the contrast with the 2024 general election is, though.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer's victory was broad but shallow, his 411 seats procured on just over a third of the vote. Perhaps it's not surprising that the so-called loveless landslide has been followed by a rude awakening.",
      "Labour's debate on what to do next is just beginning",
      "\"On every door it was the same story - winter fuel and Pip.\"",
      "That's what a Labour campaigner in Runcorn told me, referring to the early decision this government made to means-test the winter fuel allowance and the more recent announcement that eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment will be tightened.",
      "Speaking to Labour MPs from different wings of the party over the course of the day, it's been surprising how many have pretty much stuck to that same theme. For almost all of them, the original sin of this government was the decision on winter fuel.",
      "There are nuances within that position. Some believe the cut could have been communicated better, making the case that some pensioners were receiving the benefit who simply didn't need it. Others think it was never worth the political risk for the amount of money it would raise.",
      "To stress, it is not just the left of the Labour Party, comprised of a handful of MPs willing to criticise Starmer publicly, who are saying this. I had a conversation with an MP on the right of the party who believes the situation is so dire, the damage so fundamental, that Rachel Reeves should simply reverse the cut.",
      "That is extremely unlikely. But it is where the debate may be headed when MPs return to the Commons and compare notes next week.",
      "And of course a crucial part of that debate is the parlous economic situation inherited by the government which, those around the prime minister insist, necessitated unpleasant decisions which were always bound to be unpopular. If it had not been winter fuel, it would have been something else \u2013 the argument goes.",
      "The consolation of sorts for Labour is that fixing their political predicament is in their hands. They are the government and the levers of power are at their command. The next general election is up to four years away. All in Labour agree that people need to be made to feel better off - and they hope that if that can be achieved, the political challenges melt away.",
      "For the Conservatives, things are somehow getting worse",
      "Turns out the only way wasn't up. The Conservatives were reduced to their fewest MPs ever last July. That annihilation is now being visited on their local politicians.",
      "Kemi Badenoch took charge of a crushed Conservative Party and has only had six months to begin trying to turn things round. Still, I am yet to meet a Conservative who will sincerely argue that she has made a good start.",
      "I have, though, lost count of Conservative MPs and advisers who say to me that, in a funny way, they need Labour to be doing better. The Conservatives are still tarnished in many voters' eyes by their governing record, meaning that the receptacle for voters' immediate frustration with Labour, in Runcorn and elsewhere, is Reform UK.",
      "But it's more than just a story about the government's woes, as longstanding Conservative strongholds such as Staffordshire and Lincolnshire falling to Reform show. Some of the results simply need to be stated to see how startling they are.",
      "Conservatives had run Staffordshire County Council since 2009. They had 56 of the 62 councillors on Thursday morning. Now they have only 10.",
      "The Lib Dems have taken dozens of seats from the Tories. They have pushed the party into third place in this set of elections. Leader Sir Ed Davey is claiming to have seized the title of the party of \"Middle England\".",
      "There does not seem to be any appetite at all in the Conservative Party to even begin a conversation about changing leader yet again. Robert Jenrick throwing his support behind the woman who beat him to the leadership was a significant moment.",

      "Their success in five constituencies at the general election - including Farage himself finally making it into parliament at the eighth attempt - suggested Reform UK was something different to his previous incarnations. That is surely now proven beyond all reasonable doubt.",
      "Reform has now won control of ten councils, and with victory comes responsibility.",
      "When Ukip ran up victories in the European elections, its mandate was to scrutinise the Brussels institutions its voters loathed.",

      "They are ecstatic to have leapfrogged the Conservatives into third place in the BBC's Projected National Share.",
      "The Greens are making gains too, although their failure to win or even come second in the West of England mayoral contest will sting. The battle between the Greens and Labour for younger, urban progressives is likely to come to the fore in future local elections.",

      "Labour's general election slogan was just one word: change. No wonder that it appeared at the start of new MP Sarah Pochin's victory speech in Runcorn too.",
      "If there's one thing every politician and strategist from every party seems to agree on, it is that people are crying out for things to be better. In other words, for change.",
      "It was the mantle Keir Starmer managed to seize in opposition. His challenge is to reclaim it while being in government.",

      "The era of fragmentation is here...at least for now",
      "The two-party double act which has governed Britain for a century appears to be under massive strain. It may be time to get used to elections in this country - parliamentary, mayoral, council - being won on low shares of the vote by very fine margins. Under our First Past The Post system (where the winner is simply the person with the most votes), if you have lots of parties with relatively even support, things can get really unpredictable.",
      "Yet if there's another lesson of British politics in recent years it's that politics is volatile. The death of the two-party system has been pronounced before. At the 2010 general election, Labour and the Conservatives only got 65% of the vote combined. By 2017 that figure was back up to 82%. In 2024 it was back to 57%. Things can change fast in politics - they have done, again and again.",
      "As politics begins to move at social media speed, who's to say Reform cannot fall away as fast as they rose?",
      "It's a counter-argument worth bearing in mind. On the other hand, it is no longer preposterous to say that Nigel Farage could be the next prime minister.",
      "The range of possible political futures which could unfold in the UK over the next few years is simply vast. Anyone who tells you what is going to happen next needs a whopping great dose of humility.",

      "Labour had a terrible night when many of the county council seats up for grabs in Thursday's English local elections were last contested in 2021.",
      "So far, today's results are even worse.",
      "Labour should have been within shouting distance of regaining control of Durham -but their vote tumbled.",
      "Before the result was announced, a former Labour MP texted to say - in colourful language \u2013 just how grim the political landscape was in the North East.",
      "And where voters were determined to oust the Conservatives in Staffordshire, they turned to Reform UK not Labour to do so.",
      "This has prompted calls for Sir Keir Starmer to change direction.",
      "The Labour Mayor of Doncaster Ros Jones - who had her majority slashed - blamed the withdrawal of winter fuel allowance from most pensioners, and urged a rethink on the forthcoming cuts to personal independence payments (Pips) for disabled people.",
      "Labour MP Richard Burgon \u2013 a shadow minister under Sir Keir's left wing predecessor Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 agreed.",
      "He said the current party leadership needed to \"change course\" and suggested that these policies were \"driving away our own voters, and letting Reform squeeze through.\"",
      "The Labour leadership won't be quaking in its boots when attacked by the Left.",
      "But what is noteworthy is that - off the record  - some MPs from across the party are making not dissimilar points, and have been contacting the BBC (and not vice versa) to make them.",
      "One of the new intake of Labour MPs told me \"this is not a verdict on our failure to deliver.",
      "\"It is a verdict on what we have delivered. People on the doorsteps are using the word 'betrayal.'",
      "\"It's winter fuel. It's fear of Pips, it's a bit of immigration.\"",
      "\"People voted for change \u2013 voted for Labour \u2013 but the government isn't looking Labour enough, and people are asking 'what's the point?'\".",
      "Another new MP - very much not on the left of the party - described the withdrawal of winter fuel payments as \"Labour's poll tax\".",
      "And a longer-standing Labour politician said to me it was \"more to do with uninspiring leadership\".",
      "\"And it turns out that cutting disability and winter fuel payments comes at a cost \u2013 these are not Labour things to do,\" they added.",
      "Another said that fellow backbenchers tend to panic close to general election time if their party is behind in the polls but \"we are panicking in less than a year\".",
      "A defeated Labour councillor from Lancashire, Matthew Tomlinson, described himself as \"an extremely loyal Labour Party supporter\".",
      "But he told the BBC when certain policies were taken together \u2013 and he included national insurance increases for employers and the lack of compensation for some women pensioners to the welfare cuts -  \"it feels like a Labour Party that just isn't Labour enough.\"",

      "Some are calling for a bigger rethink, with more focus on social issues and less on adjusting policies to meet economic forecasts.",
      "And there are calls for Chancellor Rachel Reeves' \"fiscal rules\"-  which restrict debt levels but also constrain investment \u2013 to be loosened.",
      "The Treasury has already rejected this \u2013 arguing that it would lead to higher interest rates and therefore mortgages.",
      "The 40 MPs in Labour's Red Wall group want to see a tougher line on immigration but also more investment in \"left behind\" areas in the Midlands and North of England.",
      "That has prompted demands for the shredding of the \"Green Book\" \u2013 the Treasury bible used to assess the costs and benefits of new projects.",
      "The belief is that this document tends to emphasise the cost and downplay the benefits.",
      "Jo White from Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire, who represents a group of backbenchers from 'Red Wall' areas in England, said the voices of \"people from the outside\" hadn't been listened to.",
      "She also called for schools and hospitals to be \"lifted from the shackles of debt\" so the party could deliver on its priorities.",
      "One Red Wall MP has suggested that if the chancellor won't contemplate a \"reset\" then she should be reshuffled, \"otherwise she'll bring Starmer down with her\".",
      "The prime minister said today that he \"gets\" the message of the election results \u2013 to go forward faster with his plan for change.",
      "I haven't got any sense that this involves a further change of direction.",
      "The party has already cut overseas aid to fund an increase in defence spending.",
      "This might have been expected to appeal to Reform-minded voters,  but the election results don't tend to suggest that it has worked.",
      "An array of announcements and initiatives are on the way \u2013 an immigration white paper in a matter of weeks; a long-awaited industrial strategy; the outcome a defence review; more on workers' rights; one or more trade deals.",
      "Labour will seek to get on the front foot.",
      "But much is either outside the government's control or is difficult to control, such as a stubbornly stagnant economy and an international trade war.",
      "Ministers point to progress on a number of fronts, from rising wages to falling NHS waiting lists.",
      "Yet the election results were an expression of voters' \"first impressions\" of Labour back in power.",
      "Some of its MPs worry that it will be difficult to change the negative prism through which the government is viewed."

      "Though some of the results are still to be reported, Reform are clearly the winners of Thursday's local elections.",
      "Across the 23 councils where a ballot was held, the party won more votes and more seats than any of its opponents by a clear margin. The party is probably heading for around 700 seat gains and won two mayoral contests.",
      "Meanwhile, it has won overall control of no less than seven councils, including the once Labour fiefdom of Durham and the two largest counties,  Kent and Lancashire.",
      "The party performed best in wards which voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 referendum. Yet even in places which voted to remain in the EU, the party was still routinely able to win as much as a fifth of the vote.",

      "In the BBC's projection of what would have happened if a nationwide election had been held on Thursday, Reform were credited with 30% of the vote. That easily beats the 23% that Ukip scored at the height of their popularity in 2013. It is the first time that a party other than Conservative or Labour has been placed first.",
      "Meanwhile, Reform also won the Runcorn by-election, albeit by the narrowest of margins. Never before has a pro-Brexit party candidate won a by-election, other than two local Tory MPs who defected to Ukip in 2014.",
      "For both the Conservatives and Labour the result was worse than their spokespersons feared. The Conservatives lost two in three of the seats they were defending and at best are likely to be left with control of just one council, Buckinghamshire.",
      "In a clear indication of the Conservatives' vulnerability to the challenge from Nigel Farage's party, its vote fell most heavily in places where the Reform advance was strongest. Their score in the BBC projection is by far a record low.",
      "Labour also lost two in three of the seats they were defending, though it had the consolation of winning three mayoral elections, albeit only by a narrow margin. Their projected share is the lowest since 2008, when the party suffered from the financial crash and the MPs' expenses scandal.",
      "In contrast, the Liberal Democrats were able to withstand the Reform tide, recording over 100 net gains. The party was particularly successful in councils that it had targeted, most notably Devon and Shropshire. Overall, however, the party's performance in votes was largely in line with that of other recent local elections. Much the same was true of the Greens, who made a modest gain of 38 seats.",

      "She was filmed giving the middle finger to protesters shortly before Johnson's resignation.",

      "The First Minister, Eluned Morgan, told the Senedd on Tuesday that she will be making a speech next week to outline her position \"more clearly\" on the UK Labour government's welfare reforms \u2013 a controversial issue in Wales, where claimant levels are high.",
      "We do not know how far she will go, or whether she will dip her toe into other areas.",
      "She has plenty to choose from, with decisions made at Westminster affecting steel, welfare, rail funding, crown estate and National Insurance all proving controversial and very current issues.",
      "If she was minded to a year to go until an election, which takes place on 7 May 2026, seems as good a time as any for the first minister to deal with Westminster decisions which she worries might cost Welsh voters and cost her votes.",

      "The letter can be seen two ways \u2013 it makes the case for Wales' share of that funding, but also plays into what might be a narrative of the FM trying to differentiate herself from her colleagues in London, or stand up to them.",

      "Some Labour MSs have already made their feelings clear on welfare reform.",
      "A minister \u2013 Jane Hutt \u2013 said that she had \"strongly\" complained about the \"adverse impact\" of the Westminster decision not to scrap the two-child limit for certain benefits.",
      "The first minister herself has made a veiled objection to comments from her Labour colleague, the Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens, that she had welcomed the reforms.",
      "When Eluned Morgan took over as FM last year a couple of her colleagues suggested to me that she might need a \"row\" \u2013 concocted or otherwise - with UK Labour, to bolster her position.",
      "When she makes her speech next week, will that time have come?",
      "If Morgan does sharpen up her language and criticism of UK Labour's approach, there would still be a risk for her.",

    "published": "Sat, 03 May 2025 06:29:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Scientists hope to make a universal antivenom from the extraordinary blood of a man exposed to snake venom for decades.",
    "story": [
      "The blood of a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades has led to an \"unparalleled\" antivenom, say scientists.",
      "Antibodies found in Tim Friede's blood have been shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of species in animal tests.",
      "Current therapies have to match the specific species of venomous snake anyone has been bitten by.",
      "But Mr Friede's 18-year mission could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites - which kill up to 140,000 people a year and leave three times as many needing amputations or facing permanent disability.",
      "In total, Mr Friede has endured more than 200 bites and more than 700 injections of venom he prepared from some of the world's deadliest snakes, including multiple species of mambas, cobras, taipans and kraits.",
      "He initially wanted to build up his immunity to protect himself when handling snakes, documenting his exploits on YouTube.",
      "But the former truck mechanic said that he had \"completely screwed up\" early on when two cobra bites in quick succession left him in a coma.",
      "\"I didn't want to die. I didn't want to lose a finger. I didn't want to miss work,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Mr Friede's motivation was to develop better therapies for the rest of the world, explaining: \"It just became a lifestyle and I just kept pushing and pushing and pushing as hard as I could push - for the people who are 8,000 miles away from me who die from snakebite\".",
      "'I'd love to get my hands on some of your blood'",
      "Antivenom is currently made by injecting small doses of snake venom into animals, such as horses. Their immune system fights the venom by producing antibodies and these are harvested to be used as a therapy.",
      "But venom and antivenom have to be closely matched because the toxins in a venomous bite vary from one species to another.",
      "There is even wide variety within the same species \u2013 antivenom made from snakes in India is less effective against the same species in Sri Lanka.",
      "A team of researchers began searching for a type of immune defence called broadly neutralising antibodies. Instead of targeting the part of a toxin that makes it unique, they target the parts that are common to entire classes of toxin.",
      "That's when Dr Jacob Glanville, chief executive of biotech company Centivax, came across Tim Friede.",
      "\"Immediately I was like 'if anybody in the world has developed these broadly neutralising antibodies, it's going to be him' and so I reached out,\" he said.",
      "\"The first call, I was like 'this might be awkward, but I'd love to get my hands on some of your blood'.\"",
      "Mr Friede agreed and the work was given ethical approval because the study would only take blood, rather than giving him more venom.",
      "The research focused on elapids \u2013 one of the two families of venomous snakes \u2013 such as coral snakes, mambas, cobras, taipans and kraits.",
      "Elapids primarily use neurotoxins in their venom, which paralyses their victim and is fatal when it stops the muscles needed to breathe.",
      "Researchers picked 19 elapids identified by the World Health Organization as being among the deadliest snakes on the planet. They then began scouring Mr Friede's blood for protective defences.",
      "Their work, detailed in the journal Cell, identified two broadly neutralising antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxin. They added in a drug that targets a third to make their antivenom cocktail.",
      "In experiments on mice, the cocktail meant the animals survived fatal doses from 13 of the 19 species of venomous snake. They had partial protection against the remaining six.",
      "This is \"unparalleled\" breadth of protection, according to Dr Glanville, who said it \"likely covers a whole bunch of elapids for which there is no current antivenom\".",
      "The team is trying to refine the antibodies further and see if adding a fourth component could lead to total protection against elapid snake venom.",
      "The other class of snake \u2013 the vipers \u2013 rely more on haemotoxins, which attack the blood, rather than neurotoxins. In total there are around a dozen broad classes of toxin in snake venom, which also includes cytotoxins that directly kill cells.",
      "\"I think in the next 10 or 15 years we'll have something effective against each one of those toxin classes,\" said Prof Peter Kwong, one of the researchers at Columbia University.",
      "And the hunt continues inside Mr Friede's blood samples.",
      "\"Tim's antibodies are really quite extraordinary - he taught his immune system to get this very, very broad recognition,\" said Prof Kwong.",
      "The ultimate hope is to have either a single antivenom that can do everything, or one injection for elapids and one for vipers.",
      "Prof Nick Casewell, who is the head of the centre for snakebite research and interventions at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said the breadth of protection reported was \"certainly novel\" and provided \"a strong piece of evidence\" that this was a feasible approach.",
      "\"There is no doubt that this work moves the field forwards in an exciting direction.\"",
      "But he cautioned there was \"much work to do\" and that the antivenom still needed extensive testing before it could be used in people.",
      "But for Mr Friede, reaching this stage \"makes me feel good\".",
      "\"I'm doing something good for humanity and that was very important to me. I'm proud of it. It's pretty cool.\""

      "A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild.",
      "Animals born and raised in zoos are rarely considered for release because they either don't have the survival skills or have become too used to human interaction.",
      "But a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme led to the unusual request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo.",
      "It has been moved to Germany where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge.",
      "This week the BBC watched on as, with the help of some judicious prodding with a broom, the Newquay lynx was loaded onto a truck headed for southwestern Germany.",
      "Two days later we were in Germany as it was cajoled into a 1,200-sq-metre enclosure. John Meek from Newquay Zoo was also on hand to see the lynx gingerly stroll out into its new home.",
      "\"I'm a big boy but I had a few tears in my eyes,\" he said. \" Nowadays, zoos are not here to keep animals in cages. They're there for conservation. And this is it, conservation in action.\"",
      "Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe.",
      "Though not officially classed as a \"big cat\" Eurasian lynx can weigh up to 30 kilos and hunt deer for food.",
      "Once native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction.",
      "\"Basically I'm Tinder for the zoo-born lynx,\" says Dina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park with a smile when I speak to her on Zoom.",
      "It was her who sent out the SOS for the Newquay lynx.",
      "The lynx-breeding coordinator for the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), she matches females and males from across the continent as well as finding new homes for their offspring.",
      "\"Our nature is very fragmented, due to railways and streets and cities. And this means we created a lot of barriers for the lynx, which leads to inbreeding,\" Dina says.",
      "To combat that Dina finds captive young lynx that can be introduced into the wild to increase numbers and improve the genetic mix. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind.",
      "But last year, much to Dina's frustration, there was a particularly high number of male lynxes born. And a successful rewilding programme needs females much more  than males.",
      "So Dina reached out to Newquay Zoo to ask them if their one year old female might be available.",
      "\"Of course we said yes straight away, that's something that we'd love to do,\" says John Meek, the curator of plants and animals at Newquay Zoo.",
      "Over the next few months the lynx will be monitored to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. Catching and killing prey is not expected to be a problem.",
      "\"If you know your cats, you know that even a cat that has lived in a room its whole life, once it gets out is able to kill a bird or a mouse,\" Eva Klebelsberg who runs the lynx reintroduction programme for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg told us.",
      "We're standing over the carcass of a Roe Deer in the Black Forest just outside Karlsruhe. There is a small population of lynxes already living in the forest and this is one of their kills.",
      "There are puncture marks on its throat \u2013 a sure sign.",
      "\"Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,\" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas.",
      "The key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans. Having spent its entire life looking through bars at visitors and being fed by keepers it will need to show that it is not going to seek out more human interaction.",
      "\"Central Europe is very crowded and we don't have many places where there is enough space for larger animals.\" says Dr Marco Roller from Karlsruhe zoo, who manages the enclosure.",
      "\"We don't want human animal conflicts. So for us it's important we don't have aggressive animals or curious animals which may walk through cities or close to human settlements.\"",

      "Heather Ferguson, professor of medical entomology at the University of Glasgow, described the initial response to their three-year long project as \"tremendous\".",
      "She said: 'We found them to a much greater extent than we've known before.",
      "\"In almost all parts of the country we got reports of different species. And a very exciting first for us, we found the most northernmost record for the UK when we had a member of the public in Shetland report a mosquito which we were able to confirm.\"",
      "In addition to the public sightings, the team hung traps at 24 locations across the country, luring the insects by the smell of carbon dioxide which mimics human breath.",
      "Dr Georgia Kirby leads the citizen science project and said public reporting has guided where they hang the traps, which can sometimes catch more than 1,000 mosquitoes in just two days.",
      "She said: \"There were several areas of Scotland where we received lots of reports of bites but very few photos of the culprits \u2013 understandably, as most people don't want to hold still for a photo while they're being bitten by insects.",
      "\"We had suspected that midges or clegs could be responsible, but in our follow-up investigations we invariably found that these locations were swarming with mosquitoes \u2013 proving that people in Scotland are good at recognising them and distinguishing them from more familiar insects.",
      "\"Most of these sites were areas of dense woodland, which is a key habitat for several aggressive human-biting mosquito species.\"",
      "Is malaria a risk?",
      "Mosquitoes don't currently pose a health risk to humans in Scotland. The parasite needed to spread infectious disease like malaria is not present here.",
      "However, it was a different story 200 years ago when malaria was common in the UK.",
      "It was present in the east of Scotland in particular and spread by native mosquitoes.",
      "Today, climate change is likely to mean we could see more mosquitoes in Scotland, as our climate becomes warmer and wetter - perfect conditions to allow them to thrive.",
      "Culex pipiens, the common house mosquito, has been found to carry and transmit the Usutu virus, originally discovered in the 1950s in Africa and present in Europe for the past three decades.",
      "The virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito and has affected blackbird populations.",
      "The Mosquito Scotland project will continue to help track their population and scientists say it will help provide a crucial early warning system for potential risk, as the species respond to environmental change.",
      "Professor Ferguson and Dr Kirby want to hear more from the public in 2025, to help increase their knowledge and build a picture of the biodiversity benefits of mosquitoes and any potential risks.",

      "Sandeels are a vital source of food for marine life including seabirds that live along the UK coastline.",
      "Two bans for English and Scottish waters were put in place in early 2024 to prohibit trawlers netting the tiny fish, following concerns that sandeel stocks were becoming too low.",
      "Judges at the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) based in The Hague ruled there is no legal obligation to reverse the closure order after the EU claimed the move was \"discriminatory and disproportionate\", and could threaten the future of commercial sandeel fishing in Denmark.",
      "The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), which manages Bempton Cliffs in East Yorkshire, was one of several conservation organisations that called for the measure to remain in place and gave evidence in the court hearing.",
      "Beccy Speight, the RSPB's chief executive, said: \"We are absolutely delighted the panel has found the ecological case for the closure of industrial sandeel fishing is sound.\"",
      "\"Safeguarding sandeel stocks is a key part of the jigsaw that will help set our puffins, kittiwakes and the wider marine environment on the path to recovery.\"",
      "The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) welcomed the court's decision and said it had found \"the UK successfully demonstrated that the measures taken to close English and Scottish waters were based on the best available science\".",
      "Sandeels comprise a number of species of small fish and are caught commercially for use in animal feed and in oil production.",
      "Danish fishing organisations had argued that the North Sea ban was \"unnecessary\" and claimed sandeel stocks were plentiful, disputing the scientific evidence.",
      "Speaking before the court ruling Esben Sverdrup-Jensen, from the Danish Pelagic Producers' Association, said the ban had a \"massive impact\" on the industry.",
      "\"It means we have lost about half of the fishing grounds that we have traditionally fished on for decades,\" he said.",
      "Mr Sverdrup-Jensen disputed the claim that sandeel stocks were under threat.",
      "\"Sandeel is probably the best managed fishery in the world,\" he added.",
      "The ruling means a sandeel fishing ban also remains in place in the Scottish areas of the North Sea and this has been welcomed by the Scottish government, which has continuing concerns about the seabird population.",
      "Scotland's Rural Affairs Secretary, Mairi Gougeon, said: \"Protecting our marine ecosystem is vital to Scotland's environment, and to the people and communities who rely on it.",
      "\"The ruling reaffirms the appropriateness of the actions we took last year to do just that.\"",
      "The Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling, which runs to nearly 300 pages, also stated the ban in English waters breached the post-Brexit trade deal because it was \"disproportionate\".",
      "In a statement, the European Commission said it welcomed the ruling as it \"provides clarity\" on fishing rights.",
      "It said: \"The UK is required to immediately comply with the final ruling and shall inform the EU within 30 days of the [compliance] measures it will take\".",

    "summary": "Study provides hope for future of the axolotl amphibian, pushed to the brink of extinction in Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "One of the world's most endangered amphibians - the strange, perpetually smiling Mexican axolotl - has thrived after being released in artificial wetlands, scientists have discovered.",
      "In a study that provides hope for the long-term future of a creature that was pushed to the brink of extinction, scientists released 18 captive-bred axolotls in restored and artificial wetland close to Mexico City.",
      "The researchers fitted the animals with radio trackers and found that they \"survived and foraged successfully at both sites\" - even gaining weight.",
      "Lead researcher Dr Alejandra Ramos from the Autonomous University of Baja California said this was an \"amazing result\".",
      "The findings are published in the journal PLoS One and they suggest, the researchers say, that the axoltol can be brought back to its native habitat.",
      "The waters of Xochimilco - shaped by traditional farming practices and flushed with spring water from the mountains - used to teem with these amphibians.",
      "But as Mexico City grew, urbanisation, pollution and other pressures pushed  axolotls to the brink of extinction, with some estimates suggesting that there were as few as 50 left in the wild.",
      "\"If we lose this species, we lose part of our Mexican identity,\" said co-lead researcher Dr Luis Zambrano from the National University of Mexico.",
      "It is no exaggeration to call the axoltol an icon. Aztec legend has it that the creature is a god in salamander form - the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl, disguised as a salamander.",
      "\"If we can restore this [wetland] habitat and restore the axolotl's population in a city of more than 20 million people,\" Dr Zambrano continued, \"I feel that we have hope for humanity.\"",
      "To lay the foundations for releasing the animals, the researchers worked with local farmers and a team of volunteers to create wetland \"refuges\" for the axolotls. They installed natural filtering systems to clean the water,",
      "The scientists released their captive-bred animals at two sites - one in Xochimilco and one at a disused quarry that, over decades, has turned into what they called an \"artificial wetland\".",
      "Every animal was tagged with a radio tracking device.",
      "\"The amazing news is that they all survived,\" Dr Ramos told BBC News. \"And not only that, but the ones that we recaptured had gained weight - so they're hunting.\"",
      "The monitoring also revealed intriguing insights into axolotl behaviour. \"We found that some spend most of their time with one other individual -  like they make these little friendships,\" Dr Ramos explained.",
      "Somewhat ironically, these charismatic salamanders are found in the world's laboratories and pet aquariums in their hundreds of thousands. The species is biologically fascinating - it has the remarkable ability to regrow any part of its body that is damaged or lost. So there is research underway to understand whether that ability could be harnessed medically.",
      "But in the murky wetlands of Mexico City, there is still a great deal of work to do to clean up and restore the habitat, and to give the wild axolotl a chance to recover.",
      "\"Many animals are losing their habitat around the world,\" said Dr Ramos. \"And restoration projects are not easy, but they can be done -  they just need a lot of people.",
      "\"You don't need to be a scientist to get involved - everybody in the world can help out.\""

      "OpenAI, the parent of artificial intelligence service ChatGPT, has announced a new governance plan after a bitter power struggle over the business.",
      "Boss Sam Altman said OpenAI would remain under the control of its for-profit board, while becoming what is known in the US as a public benefit corporation.",
      "Mr Altman had put forward a similar plan in December - but without clarifying the control of the non-profit.",
      "The update follows widespread scrutiny of the startup, which began as a non-profit and faced criticism, including from co-founder Elon Musk, that its quest for growth is pushing it to stray from its original mission of creating technology for the benefit of humanity.",
      "Last month, a group of former open AI staff and outside experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, wrote to regulators in California and Delaware, which have power over non-profits, asking them to intervene to block the conversion.",
      "OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor said the start-up made the decision \"after hearing from civic leaders and engaging in constructive dialogue with the offices of the Attorney General of Delaware and the Attorney General of California\".",
      "In the update on Monday, Mr Altman said the non-profit would continue to control OpenAI, receiving a \"big\", yet-to-be determined stake in OpenAI's business arm, which would give it access to money to put towards its own goals.",
      "He said the new plan would still allow the organisation to stop operating under its current complex governance structure, which had capped its profits.",
      "That was seen as a sticking point for investors, including Microsoft, that hindered the firm's ability to raise money.",
      "\"We are moving to a normal capital structure where everyone has stock,\" he wrote in a letter to staff that was shared on the OpenAI website. \"This is not a sale, but a change of structure to something simpler.\"",
      "Unlike traditional for-profit companies, which are bound to act in service to shareholders, a public benefit corporation is also responsible for a public mission.",
      "In the update on Monday, Mr Altman said he believed that growth and extending access to AI, which would take money, was consistent with the firm's mission, because it would help people \"build incredible things for each other and continue to drive society and quality of life forward\".",
      "\"It will of course not be all used for good, but we trust humanity and think the good will outweigh the bad by orders of magnitude,\" he wrote.",
      "It is not clear to what extent the new plan will satisfy investors or critics.",
      "After the announcement Page Hedley, OpenAI's former policy and ethics adviser, who had spearheaded last month's letter, said the update did not resolve issues such as who would own the firm's technology and how its goals would be prioritised.",
      "\"We're glad that OpenAI is listening to concerns from civil society leaders ... but crucial questions remain,\" he said."

      "Mr Brown's active, highly engaged Facebook audience is indicative of how more members of the public are turning to social media for news and weather updates - in the US, it's how 20% of adults get this information, according to Pew Research Centre.",

      "When Brisbane-based Prof Angus found himself caught up in the heavy rain and flooding brought on by Tropical Cyclone Alfred also in February, he preferred to follow official advice from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, as he believes they still provide the most accurate forecasts and warnings.",
      "Prof Angus recognises the rising popularity of weather influencers like Mr Brown's Wally's Weather as stemming from not just a broader trend of public mistrust towards mainstream media and government sources, but about filling gaps in coverage and relatability.",

      "\"Their credibility has grown because they are seen as passionate, knowledgeable, and often deeply embedded in the communities they report on.\"",

The bureau and governments are very reserved in putting out alerts and evacuation orders, because it only takes a few non-events for people to lose their trust in them,\" says Professor Angus.",

    "summary": "The Israeli military says the expanded offensive will displace most Palestinians in Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to expand its military offensive against Hamas which includes the \"capture\" of Gaza and the holding of its territory, according to an Israeli official.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the cabinet had decided on a \"forceful operation\" to destroy Hamas and rescue its remaining hostages, and that Gaza's 2.1 million population \"will be moved, to protect it\".",
      "He did not say how much territory would be seized by troops, but he stressed that \"they will not enter and come out\".",
      "The cabinet also approved, in principle, a plan to deliver aid through private companies, which would end a two-month blockade the UN says has caused severe food shortages.",
      "The UN and other aid agencies have said the proposal would be a breach of basic humanitarian principles and that they will not co-operate.",
      "A Hamas official said the group rejected Israel's \"pressure and blackmail\".",
      "Asked about the Israeli plan to expand its offensive, President Donald Trump repeated a pledge to help get food to Palestinians there.",
      "The UK meanwhile said it \"does not support an expansion of Israel's military operations in Gaza\". The EU earlier urged restraint, saying it was concerned about \"further casualties and suffering for the Palestinian population\".",
      "Israeli army starts calling up reservists for planned expansion to Gaza offensive",
      "Gaza kitchens warn food will run out in days after two months of Israeli blockade",
      "Israeli reservists speak out against Gaza war as pressure on Netanyahu grows",
      "Israel's security cabinet met on Sunday evening to discuss the Gaza offensive, which resumed when Israel ended a two-month ceasefire on 18 March.",
      "An Israeli official who briefed the media on Monday morning said ministers voted unanimously to approve a plan proposed by the Israeli military's Chief of Staff Lt Gen Eyal Zamir to \"defeat Hamas in Gaza and return the hostages\".",
      "\"The plan will include, among other things, the capture of the Strip and holding the territories, moving the Gazan population south for its defence, denying Hamas the ability to distribute humanitarian supplies, and powerful attacks against Hamas,\" the official said.",
      "Israeli media reported that first stage would include the seizure of additional areas of Gaza and the expansion of the Israeli-designated \"buffer zone\" running along the territory's borders. It would aim to give Israel additional leverage in negotiations with Hamas on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal.",
      "Later, a senior Israeli security official said the plan would not be implemented until after US President Donald Trump's visit to the region between 13 and 16 May, providing what he called \"a window of opportunity\" to Hamas to agree a new ceasefire and hostage release deal.",
      "Trump will visit Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar on his trip.",
      "Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich meanwhile told a conference in Jerusalem on Monday that Israel was \"going to finally occupy the Gaza Strip\", according to Reuters news agency.",
      "Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 Middle East war along with the West Bank. It unilaterally withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, but the UN still regards Gaza as Israeli-occupied territory because it retained control of Gaza's shared border, airspace and shoreline.",
      "In a briefing later on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the expanded campaign would displace most Palestinians in Gaza as air strikes and other military operations continued.",
      "However, critics say military action has failed to secure the return of the 59 remaining hostages - up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive - and have urged the government to strike a deal with Hamas.",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents hostages' relatives, said the plan was an admission by the government that it was \"choosing territories over the hostages\" and that this was \"against the will of over 70% of the people\" in Israel.",
      "Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi reiterated that the group wanted a comprehensive deal, including \"a complete ceasefire, full withdrawal from Gaza, reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, and the release of all prisoners from both sides\".",
      "Palestinians in north Gaza told the BBC that they were strongly opposed to being forcibly displaced to the south once again, with several saying they would rather die amid the ruins of their homes.",
      "\"In October 2023, I evacuated with my children, daughters, and grandchildren - about 60 people in total,\" 76-year-old Gaza City resident Ahmed Shehata said.",
      "\"We lived through unbearable conditions in what Israel claimed was a 'safe zone' in the south. This time, we will not leave, even if Israel brings down the tents over our heads.\"",
      "Osama Tawfiq, a 48-year-old father of five, said: \"Israeli threats won't scare us. We are staying in Gaza.\"",
      "The Israeli official said the security cabinet also approved by a large majority \"the possibility of humanitarian [aid] distribution - if necessary - that would prevent Hamas from taking control of supplies and would destroy its governmental capabilities\".",
      "The security official said deliveries would resume once the expanded offensive began, and that the military would establish a \"sterile area\" in the southern Rafah area that Palestinians would be able to enter pending inspection.",
      "On Sunday, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), a forum that includes UN agencies, said Israeli officials were seeking to \"shut down the existing aid distribution system\" and \"have us agree to deliver supplies through Israeli hubs under conditions set by the Israeli military, once the government agrees to re-open crossings\".",
      "The HCT warned that the plan would mean large parts of Gaza, including less mobile and most vulnerable people, would continue to go without supplies.",
      "\"It contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic \u2013 as part of a military strategy,\" it said.",
      "\"It is dangerous, driving civilians into militarized zones to collect rations, threatening lives, including those of humanitarian workers, while further entrenching forced displacement.\"",
      "Israel cut off all deliveries of humanitarian aid and other supplies to Gaza aid on 2 March, two weeks before resuming its offensive.",
      "According to the UN, the population is facing a renewed risk of hunger and malnutrition because warehouses are empty, bakeries have shut, and community kitchens are days away from running out of supplies.",
      "The blockade has also cut off essential medicines, vaccines and medical equipment needed by Gaza's overwhelmed healthcare system.",
      "The UN says Israel is obliged under international law to ensure supplies for Gaza's population, almost all of whom have been displaced. Israel says it is complying with international law and there is no shortage of aid.",
      "The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",
      "At least 52,567 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 2,459 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

    "story": [
      "I ran from the White House briefing room, past the portico entrance of the West Wing to our camera position on the lawn, and flung on an ear piece connecting me to the studio.",
      "A moment later the presenter asked me about the comments we had just heard live from US President Donald Trump.",
      "I said we were seeing a fundamental shift in a United States'\u202fpolicy position after decades of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.",
      "It was February this year, and Trump had just held talks with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - the first foreign leader since Trump's inauguration to be invited to the White House. The US president vowed that his country would take control of the Gaza Strip, having earlier pledged the territory would also be \"cleaned out\" and emptied of its Palestinian population.",
      "Trump was grabbing the world's attention with a proposal that hardened his administration's support for Israel and also upended international norms, flying in the face of international law. It marked an apex of the current Republican Party's relationship with Israel - sometimes described as support \"at all costs\".",
      "The alliance between the two countries had been thrust into the international spotlight after the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023 and Israel's offensive in Gaza that followed.",
      "During that war, the administration of President Joe Biden sent some $18bn (\u00a313.5bn) worth of weapons to Israel, maintaining unprecedented levels of US backing. The period was marked by intensifying protests in the US, with many of those protesting being traditional Democrat leaning voters. The fallout became the focus of a bitter culture war centring on American attitudes towards Israel and the Palestinians. I covered demonstrations in which protesters repeatedly labelled Biden \"Genocide Joe\" \u2013 an accusation he always rejected.",
      "At the time Donald Trump branded the protesters \"radical-left lunatics\" and the Trump administration is now targeting for deportation hundreds of foreign students who it accuses of antisemitism or support for Hamas, a move being vigorously challenged in the courts.",
      "But as a Democrat who could otherwise have expected the vote of many of those upset over his support for Israel that support was politically costly for Biden in a way not experienced by previous presidents or, indeed, Trump.",
      "One of Biden's key decision makers over relations with Israel still wrestles with the decisions they took.",
      "\"My first reaction is just, I understand that this has evoked incredibly passionate feelings for Arab Americans, for non-Arab Americans, Jewish Americans,\" says Jake Sullivan, Biden's former national security adviser.",
      "\"There were two competing considerations: one was wanting to curb Israel's excesses, both with respect to civilian casualties and the flow of humanitarian assistance. The other was [...] wanting to make sure that we were not cutting Israel off from the capabilities it needed to confront its enemies on multiple different fronts.\"",
      "He added: \"The United States stood behind Israel materially, morally, and in every other way in those days following October 7th.\"",
      "But opinion polls suggest support for Israel among the American public is dwindling.",
      "A Gallup survey taken in March this year found only 46% of Americans expressed support for Israel (the lowest level in 25 years of Gallup's annual tracking) while 33% now said they sympathised with the Palestinians - the highest ever reading of that measure. Other polls have found similar results.",
      "Surveys - with all their limitations - suggest the swing is largely among Democrats and the young, although not exclusively. Between 2022 and 2025, the Pew Research Center found that the proportion of Republicans who said they had unfavourable views of Israel rose from 27% to 37%  (younger Republicans, aged under 49, drove most of that change).",
      "The US has long been Israel's most powerful ally - ever since May 1948, when America was the first country to recognise the nascent State of Israel. But while US support for Israel is extremely likely to continue long-term, these swings in sentiment raise questions over the practical extent and policy limits of the US's ironclad backing and whether the shifting sands of public opinion will eventually feed through to Washington, with real-world policy impacts.",
      "An Oval Office argument",
      "To many, the close relationship between the US and Israel seems like a permanent, unshakeable part of the geopolitical infrastructure. But it wasn't always guaranteed - and at the very beginning largely came down to one man.",
      "In early 1948, US President Harry S Truman had to decide on his approach to Palestine. The country was in the grip of sectarian bloodshed between Jews and Arab Palestinians after three decades of colonial rule by Britain, which had announced its intention to pull out. Truman was deeply moved by the plight of Jewish survivors of the Holocaust stranded in displaced persons camps in Europe.",
      "In New York City, a young Francine Klagsbrun, who would later become an academic and historian of Israeli prime minister Golda Meir, watched her parents praying for a Jewish homeland.",
      "\"I grew up in a very Jewish home and a very Zionist home also,\" she explains. \"So my older brother and I would go out and collect money to try to get England to open the doors. My brother would go on the subway trains, all the doors open on the train and he'd shout 'open, open, open the doors to Palestine',\" she recalls.",
      "Truman's administration was deeply divided over whether to back a Jewish state. The CIA and the Department of State cautioned against recognising a Jewish state. They feared a bloody conflict with Arab countries that might draw in the US, risking Cold War escalation with the Soviets.",
      "Two days before Britain was due to pull out of Palestine, an explosive row took place in the Oval Office. Truman's domestic advisor Clark Clifford argued in favour of recognising a Jewish state. On the other side of the debate was Secretary of State George Marshall, a World War Two general whom Truman viewed as \"the greatest living American\".",
      "The man Truman admired so much was vigorously opposed to the president immediately recognising a Jewish state because of his fears about a regional war - and even went as far as telling Truman he would not vote for him in the coming presidential election if he backed recognition.",
      "But despite the moment of extraordinary tension, Truman immediately recognised the State of Israel when it was declared two days later by David Ben-Gurion, the country's first prime minister.",
      "The historian Rashid Khalidi, a New York-born Palestinian whose family members were expelled from Jerusalem by the British in the 1930s, says the US and Israel were fused together in part by shared cultural connections. From 1948 onwards, he says, the Palestinians had a critical diplomatic disadvantage in the US, with their claim to national self-determination sidelined in an unequal contest.",
      "\"On the one side, you had the Zionist movement led by people whom are European and American by origin\u2026 The Arabs had nothing similar,\" he says. \"[The Arabs] weren't familiar with the societies, the cultures, the political leaderships of the countries that decided the fate of Palestine. How could you speak to American public opinion if you had no idea what America is like?\" says Khalidi.",
      "Popular culture played its role too - notably the 1958 novel and subsequent blockbuster film Exodus by the author Leon Uris. It retold the story of Israel's establishment to mass audiences of the 1960s, the movie version creating a heavily Americanised portrayal of pioneers in a new land.",
      "Ehud Olmert, who at the time was a political activist but would later become Israeli prime minister, points to the war of 1967 as the moment when America's support for Israel became the profound alliance that it is today.",
      "That was the war in which Israel, after weeks of escalating fears of invasion by its neighbours, defeated the Arab countries in six days, effectively tripling the size of its territory, and launching its military occupation over (at that time) more than a million stateless Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.",
      "\"For the first time, the United States understood the importance and the significance of Israel as a major military and political power in the Middle East, and since then everything has changed in the basic relations within our two countries,\" he says.",
      "Indispensable relations",
      "Over the years, Israel became the biggest recipient of US foreign military aid on Earth. Strong American diplomatic support, particularly at the United Nations, has been a key element of the alliance; while successive US presidents have also sought to broker peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours.",
      "But in recent years it has been far from a straightforward relationship.",
      "When I spoke to Jake Sullivan, I put to him the issue of Arab Americans in the state of Michigan who boycotted Biden and his successor candidate Kamala Harris over the extent of their support for Israel during the Gaza conflict, voting instead for Trump. He rejected the idea that Biden lost the state because of this support.",
      "But that backing still prompted a marked backlash within a section of the American public.",
      "A Pew Research Center survey taken in March this year found that 53% of Americans expressed an unfavourable opinion of Israel, an 11 point increase since the last time the survey was taken in 2022.",
      "A fraying special relationship?",
      "Currently, these shifts in public opinion haven't yet prompted a major change in US foreign policy. Whilst some ordinary US voters are turning away from Israel, on Capitol Hill elected politicians from both parties are still mostly keen to talk up the importance of a strong alliance with Israel.",
      "Some think that a sustained, long-term shift in public opinion might eventually lead to reduced real-world support for the country - with weaker diplomatic ties and reduced military aid. This issue is felt particularly sharply by some inside Israel. Several months before 7 October, the former Israeli general and head of the Military Intelligence Directorate, Tamir Hayman, warned of cracks forming between his country and the United States, in part because of what he described as the slow movement of American Jews away from Zionism.",
      "Israel's political shift in favour of the national-religious right has played a key part in this. From early 2023, Israel was gripped by an unprecedented wave of protests among Jewish Israelis against Netanyahu's judicial reforms, with many arguing he was moving the country towards theocracy \u2013 a claim he always rejected. Some in the US who had always felt a deep sense of connection with Israel were watching with growing concern.",
      "In March this year, the Institute for National Security Studies, a leading Tel Aviv-based think tank led by Hayman, published a paper arguing that US public opinion had entered the \"danger zone\", as far as support for Israel was concerned. \"The dangers of diminished US support, particularly as it reflects long-term and deeply rooted trends, cannot be overstated,\" wrote the paper's author, Theodore Sasson. \"Israel needs the support of the global superpower for the foreseeable future,\".",
      "That support at the policy level has only strengthened over the decades, but it is important to note that historic American opinion polling shows public opinion has ebbed and flowed before.",
      "Today, Dennis Ross, who helped negotiate the Oslo accords with President Bill Clinton, says American opinion on Israel has become increasingly tied to sharp political divisions in the US.",
      "\"Trump is viewed very negatively by most Democrats - the latest polls show over 90 percent,\" Ross says. \"There's potential for Trumpian support for Israel to feed a dynamic here that, at least among Democrats, increases criticism of Israel.\"",
      "But he expects that Washington's support for Israel - in the form of military aid and diplomatic ties - will continue. And he thinks if Israeli voters eject their prime minister and replace him with a more centrist government, one that may reverse some of the disquiet in the US. A general election must be held in Israel before late October next year.",
      "Under such a new Israeli government, Ross argues, \"there won't be the same impulse towards creating de-facto annexation of the West Bank. There'll be much more outreach to the Democratic Party and the Democratic Party officials.\"",
      "Those who see a fraying relationship are paying particularly close attention to the views of younger Americans - a group that has shown the most marked shift in opinion since 7 October. As the 'TikTok generation', many young Americans get their news about the war from social media and the high civilian death toll from Israel's offensive in Gaza appears to have driven the declining support among young Democrats and liberals in America. Last year, 33 percent of Americans under 30 said their sympathies lie entirely or mostly with the Palestinian people, versus 14 percent who said the same about Israelis, according to a Pew Research poll published last month. Older Americans were more likely to sympathise with the Israelis.",
      "Karin Von Hippel, chair of the Arden Defence and Security Practice and a former official in the US State Department, agrees there is a demographic divide among Americans on the topic of Israel - one that even extends to Congress.",
      "\"Younger Congress men and women are less knee jerk, reactively supporting Israel,\" she says. \"And I think younger Americans, including Jewish Americans, are less supportive of Israel than their parents were.\"",
      "But she is sceptical of the idea that this might lead to a serious change at the policy level. Despite changing opinions among the party's base, she says, many of the most prominent Democrats who might run for President in 2028 are \"classically supportive of Israel\". She names Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, and Pete Buttigieg, the former Transportation Secretary, as examples. And what about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Instagram-famous congresswoman who is a long-standing supporter of Palestinian rights? Hippel responds bluntly: \"I don't think an Ocasio-Cortez type can win right now.\"",
      "In the weeks after February's Trump-Netanyahu press conference at the White House, I asked Jake Sullivan where he thought the US-Israel relationship was going. He argued that both countries were dealing with internal threats to their democratic institutions that would define their character and their relationship.",
      "\"I think it's almost less of a foreign policy question than it is a domestic policy question in these two countries - whither America and whither Israel?\" he says. \"The answer to those two questions will tell you where does the US-Israel relationship go five, ten, fifteen years from now.\"",
      "Xi's real test is not Trump's trade war",
      "There are signs Trump could be ready to retreat on tariffs",
      "Will this be the 'anyone but the big parties' local election?",

    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 21:27:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Experts say the federal government would have to overcome enormous hurdles to turn Alcatraz back into a prison.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has doubled down on his proposal to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the once-notorious prison island in the icy waters of San Francisco Bay.",
      "Alcatraz - popularly known as \"the Rock\" - has not been used as a prison for decades. It is now a historic landmark visited by millions of tourists each year.",
      "The US president says he believes the prison could be used once again to house dangerous inmates, and to serve as a symbol of law and order in the US.",
      "But experts say that refurbishing the dilapidated remains of the once-formidable prison is \"not realistic at all\". Here's what we know about the plan.",
      "What is Alcatraz and who owns it?",
      "Located on an island about 1.25 miles (2km) offshore from San Francisco, Alcatraz  originally was built as a naval defence fort, but was rebuilt in the early 20th century as a military prison.",
      "In 1934, it was formally converted into a federal prison - Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary - housing notorious inmates including gangster Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly, among others.",
      "The prison was among one of the most notorious in the US at the time, and was considered inescapable because of the strong currents and frigid temperatures of San Francisco Bay.",
      "Trump orders reopening of notorious Alcatraz prisonThe men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoonAlcatraz 1962 escapees had small chance of success",
      "Trump orders reopening of notorious Alcatraz prison",
      "The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon",
      "Alcatraz 1962 escapees had small chance of success",
      "The facility also was made famous by the 1979 American biographical prison movie, Escape from Alcatraz, which recounted a 1962 prisoner escape, starring Clint Eastwood as ringleader Frank Morris.",
      "It was also the site of the 1996 film The Rock, starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage, about a former SAS captain and FBI chemist who rescue hostages from Alcatraz Island.",
      "When did Alcatraz close?",
      "According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, BOP, it was nearly three times more costly to operate than other federal institutions and was ultimately closed by Attorney General Robert Kennedy in 1963.",
      "The island and prison are now a museum operated by the National Park Service. More than 1.4m people visit each year.",
      "\"Alcatraz is a place where the past meets the present,\" Christine Lehnertz, president and CEO of the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, said in a statement sent to the BBC.",
      "\"It challenges us to listen, to learn, and to carry forward the stories that still shape our world today,\" she added.",
      "Has it been considered for reopening before?",
      "Donald Trump is not the first president to mull re-opening the facility as a detention centre.",
      "In 1981, Alcatraz was one of 14 sites considered by the Reagan administration to hold up to 20,000 refugees who had fled from Cuba to Florida in the famous \"Mariel Boatlift\".",
      "The site eventually was rejected due to its value as a historical tourist site and its complete lack of adequate facilities.",
      "What has Donald Trump said about Alcatraz?",
      "In a Truth Social post on 4 May, Trump first said he had directed his government to re-open and expand the island prison, saying that \"for too long America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat criminal offenders\".",
      "Speaking to reporters at the White House the following day, Trump said that, in his view, Alcatraz \"represents something very strong, very powerful\" - law and order.",
      "\"We need law and order in this country,\" he said. \"So we're going to look at it. Some of the people up here are going to be working very hard on that.\"",
      "While he said he finds the idea \"interesting\", Trump also acknowledged that the prison is currently a \"big hulk\" that is \"rusting and rotting\".",
      "\"It sort of represents something that is both horrible and beautiful and strong and miserable,\" he said.",
      "Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, also told reporters that Alcatraz could be \"an option\" for \"significant public safety threats and national security threats\".",
      "\"It should be on the table,\" he added.",
      "Can Alcatraz actually be reopened?",
      "Soon after Trump's comments made news around the world, justice department spokesman Chad Gilmartin said in a statement that BOP \"is working towards rebuilding and opening Alcatraz to serve as a symbol of law and order\".",
      "But prison experts and historians have expressed serious doubts whether the plan is feasible.",
      "\"To be frank, at first I thought it was a joke,\" Hugh Hurwitz, who served as acting director of the BOP between May 2018 and August 2019, told the BBC. \"It's not realistic to think you can repair it. You'd have to tear it up and start over.\"",
      "Mr Hurwitz pointed to a number of issues with the facility, including buildings that are \"literally falling apart\", and cells in which \"a six-foot person can't stand up\".",
      "\"There's no security upgrades. No cameras. No fencing,\" he added. \"You can't run a prison.\"",
      "\"I have two words: water and sewage,\" said Jolene Babyak, an author and Alcatraz historian who lived there as a child during her father's two stints as prison administrator.",
      "\"In its heyday, all the sewage for 500 or more people was just dumped in the bay,\" she said. \"Nowadays it has to be boated off. It's just not realistic at all. But it captures everyone's imagination.\"",

    "summary": "Last year was the deadliest for Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war with at least 45,287 killed.",
    "story": [
      "Last year was the deadliest for Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine: at least 45,287 people were killed.",
      "This is almost three times more than in the first year of the invasion and significantly exceeds the losses of 2023, when the longest and deadliest battle of the war was taking place in Bakhmut.",
      "At the start of the war, losses happened in waves during battles for key locations, but 2024 saw a month-on-month increase in the death toll as the front line slowly edged forward, enabling us to estimate that Russia lost at least 27 lives for every square kilometre of Ukrainian territory captured.",
      "The BBC Russian Service, in collaboration with independent media outlet Mediazona and a team of volunteers, has processed open source data from Russian cemeteries, military memorials and obituaries.",
      "So far, we have identified the names of 106,745 Russian soldiers killed during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The true number is clearly much higher. Military experts estimate our number may cover between 45% and 65% of deaths, which would mean 164,223 to 237,211 people.",
      "20 February 2024 was the deadliest day for Russian forces that year.",
      "Among the casualties were Aldar Bairov, Igor Babych and Okhunjon Rustamov, who were with the 36th Motorised Rifle Brigade when four Ukrainian long-range HIMARS missiles hit a training ground near the city of Volnovakha in occupied Donetsk.",
      "They had been ordered to line up for a medal ceremony. Sixty-five servicemen were killed, including their commander Col Musaev. Dozens more were wounded.",
      "Bairov, 22 and from Buryatia in eastern Siberia, had studied to be a food sanitation specialist but was drafted for mandatory military service and then signed a contract to become a professional soldier.",
      "In February 2022 he went to fight in Ukraine and was part of the battle for Borodyanka during his brigade's advance towards Kyiv in March 2022. The town was almost completely destroyed. Ukrainian sources say Russian soldiers were involved in the execution of civilians.",
      "Okhunjon Rustamov, 31 and from Chita in Siberia, had worked as a welder after serving a mandatory term in special forces. He was mobilised during a partial draft in October 2022.",
      "Unlike Rustamov, Igor Babych, 32, had volunteered to go to war. He had worked with adults and children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, helping them with physical therapy until April 2023.",
      "In total 201 Russian soldiers died on that day, according to our data.",
      "A few hours after the strike on the training ground, then-Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu met Vladimir Putin to bring him news of military success from the front line.",
      "There was no mention of the training ground attack, nor was there any word from the Ministry of Defence in its daily reports.",
      "A relative of Okhunjon Rustamov said she had already buried three close family members over the course of the war. \"In December 2022, my husband died. On 10 February 2024, my godfather. And on 20 February my half-brother. From one funeral to the next.\"",
      "In our analysis, we prioritised exact dates of death for soldiers. If that wasn't available, we used the date of the funeral or the date the death was reported.",
      "In the first two years of the war, 2022 and 2023, Russian losses followed a wave-like pattern: heavy fighting with high casualties alternated with periods of relative calm.",
      "In 2023, for example, most casualties occurred between January and March, when Russian forces attempted to capture the cities of Vuhledar and Bakhmut in Donetsk Oblast.",
      "In the first year of the full-scale invasion, according to our calculations, Russia lost at least 17,890 soldiers. This number does not include losses from Russia's two proxy forces in occupied eastern Ukraine.",
      "In 2023, the number rose to 37,633.",
      "In 2024, there was no period showing a significant fall in casualties. Bloody battles for Avdiivka and Robotyne were followed by intensified assaults towards Pokrovsk and Toretsk.",
      "In August 2024, Russian conscripts were killed when Ukrainian forces stormed over the border into the Kursk region. From August 6 to 13 alone, an estimated 1,226 Russian soldiers died.",
      "However, the heaviest overall losses occurred during a slow Russian advance in the east between September and November 2024, according to leading US military analyst Michael Kofman.",
      "\"Tactics emphasised repeated attacks with dispersed assault groups, using small infantry fire teams, which increased overall casualties relative to terrain gained,\" he explained.",
      "After almost two years of intense fighting, Russian forces seized the logistical hub of Vuhledar in Donetsk on 1 October 2024.",
      "According to estimates by the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW), from September to November 2024, Russian forces captured 2,356 square kilometres of Ukraine.",
      "Even then, Ukrainian forces at the front did not collapse.",
      "The cost of this advance was at least 11,678 Russian military deaths.",
      "Actual losses figures are likely higher. We have only accounted for soldiers and officers whose names appeared in publicly available obituaries and whose dates of death or funeral fell within this period.",
      "Overall in 2024, according to ISW, Russia captured 4,168 square kilometres of land.",
      "If we assume that our figure of 45,287 confirmed deaths in 2024 is about 40% of the full number, then the total number would be closer to 112,000 fatalities last year.",
      "This means that for each square kilometre captured, 27 Russian soldiers were killed, and this does not include the wounded.",
      "How losses are changing recruitment",
      "Russia has found ways of replenishing its depleted forces.",
      "\"Russian recruitment also increased in the second half of 2024 and exceeded Russian casualties, allowing Moscow to generate additional formations,\" says Michael Kofman.",
      "One-time payments to soldiers signing new contracts were increased in three Russian regions. Combat salaries for volunteer soldiers are five to seven times higher than the average wage in most regions.",
      "We also class as volunteers those who signed up to avoid criminal prosecution, which was allowed by law in 2024.",
      "Volunteers have become the fastest-growing category of casualties in our calculations, making up a quarter of those we have identified.",
      "In 2023-2024, thousands of volunteers who signed contracts with the Ministry of Defence were sent to the front lines only 10\u201314 days later. Such minimal training will have dramatically reduced their chances of survival, experts say.",
      "One Russian republic, Bashkortostan, has seen the highest numbers of casualties, with 4,836 confirmed deaths. Most were from rural areas and 38% had gone to fight with no military experience.",
      "The one-time payment for signing a Russian army contract in Ufa is 34 times the region's average salary of 67,575 rubles (\u00a3600).",
      "Calculating deaths from open source data will always be incomplete.",
      "This is because the bodies of a significant number of soldiers killed in the past months may still be on the battlefield and retrieving them presents a risk to serving soldiers.",
      "The true death toll for Russian forces increases significantly, if you include those who fought against Ukraine as part of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics.",
      "An assessment of obituaries and reports of searches for fighters who have lost contact suggests between 21,000 and 23,500 people may have been killed by September 2024.",
      "That would bring the total number of fatalities to 185,000 to 260,700 military personnel.",
      "CLARIFICATION 5 May 2025: This story has been updated to make it clear that the figure of 27 losses per sq km is based on an estimated number of deaths last year of about 112,000."

      "\"The General Security department told us not to harm civilians, but only to shoot at insurgents who shot at us,\" he told me.",
      "\"There were eight men with me, but it was a large group, and the General Security department was overseeing things so that no-one would vandalise the village or harm the residents.\"",
      "He later filmed himself shooting dead a 64-year-old village resident, Mahmoud Yusef Mohammed, at the entrance to his house.",
      "Abu Khalid, who has now been arrested, insisted Mahmoud was an armed insurgent - but video he filmed of the incident does not support his account.",
      "Military police told the BBC there had been no coordination between security forces and Abu Khalid.",

      "The violence came a day after fighters loyal to the country's overthrown former President Bashar al-Assad, who is an Alawite, led deadly raids on government security forces.",
      "The new Sunni Islamist-led government had called for support from various military units and militia groups to respond to those raids \u2013 but that escalated into a wave of sectarian anger aimed at Alawite civilians.",
      "Witnesses told the BBC that several different armed groups had targeted Alawites for summary executions. Some also said that government security forces had battled violent and extremist factions to protect Alawite villagers from attack.",
      "When the violence along this coast erupted, the village of Sanobar was right in its path. Some 200 people were wiped out from this small Alawite village, over the course of a few days in early March.",
      "Almost two months after the killings, there have been no funerals in Sanobar.",
      "A mass grave now squats beside the winding village road. Hurried burials have cleared the remaining corpses.",
      "This is now a village of women and secrets. Most survivors are still too scared to speak openly but their stories, shared with us privately, are often strikingly similar.",
      "The body of Mahmoud Yousef Mohammed lay outside his simple breeze-block house in Sanobar for three days after he was shot dead.",
      "His wife, daughter and grandchildren, sheltering in a neighbour's house, were too afraid to emerge from hiding and bury him, as armed groups roamed the village.",
      "His family said Mahmoud was a polite man, known and respected in the village; a farmer with a military background, who sometimes worked as a minibus driver.",
      "His house, on a quiet street at the edge of the village, stands less than 300m (985ft) from the main highway where, on 6 March, army officers from Syria's former regime led co-ordinated attacks on the country's new security forces.",
      "For two days, government forces battled former regime fighters, known locally as \"filoul\" (\"remnants\"), in the villages along this coastal highway, calling for support from allied militia groups who helped push Bashar al-Assad from power last year.",
      "An array of armed supporters responded to the call, including foreign jihadist fighters, civilians and armed units now nominally part of the new Syrian army, but still not fully under government control. All are groups now accused by survivors of civilian executions.",
      "All day on 7 March, Sanobar residents listened to the sounds of intense fighting around the village, as families hid in their houses.",
      "Then the targeting of civilians began.",
      "\"All day, many groups entered our house,\" one survivor from Sanobar told me. \"They weren't from the [military] groups based here, but from Idlib, Aleppo and elsewhere. Some wore camouflage uniforms. But the ones who killed us were wearing green uniforms with a mask.\"",
      "\"They stole everything, insulted us, threatened the children,\" she continued. \"The last group came around 6pm. They asked, 'Where are the men?' and took my father and my brother Ali. We begged them not to kill them. They said, 'You're Alawite, pigs,' and shot them in front of our eyes.\"",
      "Some time that day, Mahmoud stepped outside the building he was sheltering in with his family. One of his relatives said he could smell toxic fumes from a fire nearby, and wanted to check on his own house.",
      "He never reappeared.",
      "\"We found the next morning that he had been killed,\" the relative told us.",
      "The story of what happened to Mahmoud began to emerge when a video of his killing surfaced on social media, filmed by the man who shot him.",
      "In the video, Abu Khalid is seen grinning and taunting Mahmoud from the back of a motorbike before shooting him six times.",
      "To meet Abu Khalid, we travelled to Idlib, the heartland of transitional President Ahmed al-Sharaa's Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which swept Syria's old regime from power last December.",
      "Now in military police custody pending an investigation, Abu Khalid shuffled into the room, blinking and stretching as his blindfold and handcuffs were removed.",
      "A young man in camouflage pants, he seemed keen to talk, explaining that Mahmoud was not a civilian, but an insurgent who was fighting in the village that day, and had been carrying an 8.5mm-calibre rifle when he shot him.",
      "\"I turned the camera on him and told him to sit down,\" Abu Khalid told me. \"He was running away and he wanted to kill me, so I shot him in the shoulder and the leg. When I got closer, I saw him moving his hand as if he had a bomb or a gun. I was afraid, so I killed him.\"",
      "But the video Abu Khalid filmed of the shooting - its location and timing verified by the BBC - does not support his account.",
      "A former member of the British special forces confirmed that there was no weapon visible on or near Mahmoud at any point in the video.",
      "And at no point does Abu Khalid ask the 64-year-old to stop or sit down - nor does he appear scared or under threat.",
      "Instead, he is shown whooping and grinning on the back of the motorbike, before calling out to Mahmoud, \"I've caught you, I've caught you! Look at the camera!\"",
      "He then shoots him three times in quick succession. Mahmoud falls to his knees inside the doorway of his house.",
      "\"You didn't die?!\" Abu Khalid calls out, as he follows him to the building.",
      "Mahmoud can be heard begging for his life, before Abu Khalid shoots him three more times at close range.",

      "\"Civilians are not supposed to be there during military operations,\" Mr Moussa said. \"He made a mistake. He could have captured the person, but instead he killed him.\"",
      "But Abu Khalid has little regret for what he did.",
      "When he cries during our interview, it's not for Mahmoud - or even for himself. It's for his little brother, killed in a bomb attack by President Assad's former army in 2018 as his family sat down at home to break their Ramadan fast.",
      "\"He was eight years old, and I held him while his soul left his body,\" he told me, before tears start flowing down his face.",
      "\"I was raised during the revolution, and saw nothing but injustice, blood, killing and terror. They ignore everything that happened in Syria before the liberation, and focus on the video I filmed.\"",
      "He tells me his family's latest casualty was his 17-year-old cousin, killed while fighting insurgents near Sanobar. \"He was completely burned,\" he said. \"We took him away in a plastic bag.\"",
      "\"If I was going for revenge for what they did to us, I wouldn't have left any of them.\"",
      "The insurgent attacks on 6 March ripped open sectarian fault-lines that Syria's new Islamist government had tried to paper over with promises of tolerance and inclusion.",
      "The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), an independent monitoring group, says former regime loyalists killed at least 446 civilians, including 30 children and women, and more than 170 government security forces, most of them on 6 March.",
      "Those attacks resurrected deep-seated anger over the repressive dictatorship of former President Assad, with Alawite civilians seen by some as complicit in the crimes of his regime - and as part of the insurgency that followed his fall.",
      "The SNHR says the government's crackdown on insurgents on the coast \"escalated into widespread and severe violations\", most of which were \"retaliatory and sectarian\".",
      "The group says that pro-government forces and supporters killed at least 889 civilians, including 114 children and women, in the days following the insurgent attacks.",
      "Amnesty International has investigated dozens of attacks it says were \"deliberate\", \"unlawful\" and targeted at Alawite civilians.",
      "One video from Sanobar shows a pro-government fighter marching through the village chanting, \"ethnic cleansing, ethnic cleansing\".",
      "Lists of victims from the village, compiled by local activists, include the names of more than a dozen women and children, including an 11-year-old, a pregnant woman and a disabled man.",
      "The survivor who watched gunmen kill her father and brother said the family showed their killers the men's civilian ID cards to prove they hadn't been part of Assad's army. But it made no difference; their only accusation, she said, was that the family were \"Alawite pigs\".",
      "Separating civilians from insurgents is key to the new government's plan to secure the country, and its promise to protect minorities.",
      "But that will require prosecuting those responsible - and proving it can control its own military forces and armed allies.",
      "Sharaa's HTS group - once the local affiliate of al-Qaeda and still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US and UK - formed the backbone of his new army.",
      "There has been rapid recruitment to fill the ranks of a new civilian police and the General Security Forces.",
      "Training has reportedly been shortened and many units say they are under-equipped. One commander looked wistfully at my body-armour and radio when we joined them on a patrol. \"We don't have those,\" he said.",
      "Turkish-backed militia and jihadist fighters who once fought alongside HTS to remove Bashar al-Assad are among those named by witnesses and human rights groups as carrying out summary executions.",
      "In the streets of Sanobar, the names of Turkish-backed units, now supposedly under government control, have been graffitied on the walls, and the BBC heard several reports that their men were still present in the village.",
      "Some videos of alleged violations also appear to show the presence of vehicles and uniforms from the official General Security Forces - prompting Amnesty International to call for investigation.",
      "The head of the General Security Forces for the Latakia region, Mustafa Kunaifati, told me that civilians with friends or relatives in the army were responsible for most of the crimes, but admitted that members of armed groups had also been involved - including what he called \"individual cases\" from his own General Security units.",
      "\"It happened,\" he said, \"and those members were also arrested. We can't accept something like that.\"",
      "After the former regime fighters were expelled and the situation brought under control, he said his men \"began removing all the rioters from the area and arresting anyone who had harmed civilians\".",
      "Several witnesses have confirmed to the BBC that Mr Kunaifati's forces intervened to protect them from other armed groups.",
      "One of Mahmoud's neighbours in Sanobar told us they evacuated him and his family 30 minutes before Mahmoud was killed.",
      "And the witness who described the killing of her father and brother said the General Security Forces had helped them escape the village, and later to return and bury their relatives.",
      "Sharaa has vowed that \"no-one will be above the law\" when it comes to prosecuting the killings on the coast.",
      "A special committee is currently investigating both the initial 6 March attack by insurgents, and the violence by pro-government forces that followed. The BBC understands some 30 people have been arrested.",
      "But in a country still waiting to see justice for the crimes of the past, this is a delicate moment.",
      "Some have argued that the government's decision to issue a general call for support after the insurgent attacks made violence predictable, even inevitable.",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump says he is directing his government to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the infamous former prison on an island near San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge.",
      "In a message on his Truth Social site on Sunday, President Trump said that \"for too long America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat criminal offenders\".",
      "The reopening of Alcatraz - once notorious as one of the US's toughest prisons - would serve as a \"symbol of law, order, and justice,\" he said.",
      "Leading Democrats said the proposal was \"not a serious one\". The maximum security facility, also known as The Rock, was closed in 1963 and it is currently operating as a successful tourist site.",
      "\"Today, I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ,\" Trump wrote.",
      "The prison would \"house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders\".",
      "President Trump has been clashing with the courts over his policy of sending alleged gang members to a prison in El Salvador. In March, he sent a group of more than 200 alleged Venezuelan gang members there. He has also talked about sending \"homegrown criminals\" to foreign prisons.",
      "Alcatraz was originally a naval defence fort, and it was rebuilt in the early 20th Century as a military prison. The Department of Justice took it over in the 1930s and it began taking in convicts from the federal prison system. Among its more famous inmates were the notorious gangsters Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly.",
      "The prison was also made famous by the 1962 film, Birdman of Alcatraz, starring Burt Lancaster, about the convicted murderer Robert Stroud, who while serving a life sentence on the prison island developed an interest in birds and went on to become an expert ornithologist.",
      "In 1979, the American biographical prison drama Escape from Alcatraz recounted a 1962 prisoner escape with Clint Eastwood starring as ringleader Frank Morris.",
      "It was also the site of the 1996 film The Rock, starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage, about a former SAS captain and FBI chemist who rescue hostages from Alcatraz island.",
      "The prison closed because it was too expensive to continue operating, according to the Federal Bureau of Prison website. It was nearly three times more costly to operate than any other federal prison, largely due to its island location.",
      "It would take an enormous amount of money to make Alcatraz into a functioning prison, Professor Gabriel Jack Chin from the Davis School of Law at the University of California told the BBC.",
      "The federal prison system is actually down about 25% from its peak population and \"there are a lot of empty beds\" in existing prisons, Chin said. \"So its not clear if a new one is needed.\"",
      "Alcatraz has \"a reputation as a tough prison\" and Trump is trying to send a message that his administration will be tough on crime, Chin added.",
      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat whose district includes Alcatraz, said the proposal was \"not a serious one,\"  while the Democratic state senator for San Francisco, Scott Wiener, called the idea \"deeply unhinged\" in a post on Instagram and \"an attack on the rule of law.\""

      "It is not clear what prompted them to kill the group.",
      "Since 2020, illegal mining has taken over several mines run by Poderosa, forcing them to abandon some operations and \"putting the physical safety of our employees and the artisanal miners at risk,\" the company said.",

      "In a statement to the BBC about the federal criminal charges, his lawyer said: \"Mr Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process.",
      "\"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"",
      "Diddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss one part of the federal indictment in which he is accused of transportation to engage in prostitution. His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race.",
      "In a hearing in New York a week before the trial, his attorneys told the court that the rapper led the \"lifestyle\" of a \"swinger\" and was not a criminal.",
      "They said he thought it was \"appropriate\" to have multiple sex partners, including sex workers.",
      "At the same hearing, prosecutors revealed that Mr Combs had rejected a plea deal.",
      "Is Diddy in jail?",
      "Mr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, since his arrest on 16 September 2024.",
      "His lawyers have argued for his release, citing the jail\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d conditions.",
      "Critics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, with a culture of violence.",
      "A New York federal judge denied the bail request, describing Mr Combs as a \u201cserious flight risk\u201d.",

      "A judge has granted Mr Combs permission to wear non prison clothing during his trial rather than the jumpsuits he wears in jail.",
      "At the first day of his trial on Monday for jury selection, the rapper appeared in court in a blue sweater and white shirt, wearing glasses on his head with streaks of gray in his hair.",
      "He asked the judge for multiple bathroom breaks, telling the court he was \"a little nervous today\".",
      "When is the Diddy trial and how long will it last?",
      "The trial began on Monday, with the jury selection expected to last one week to choose a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates.",
      "Mr Combs' trial is taking place in front of US District Judge Arun Subramanian at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in lower Manhattan.",
      "The judge has told jurors the case could last around eight weeks total.",
      "The trial is expected to be open to the public, but won't be streamed online.",
      "Cameras, phones and electronic devices are normally not allowed in US federal courtrooms.",
      "How are jurors selected?",
      "Attorneys made progress on Monday weeding through dozens of potential jurors, after already ruling out some who were not able to attend the lengthy trial.",
      "Judge Subramanian reminded the court several times on Monday of the importance of seating a fair and impartial jury. He called in dozens of people who walked the judge through their answers to a lengthy questionnaire.",
      "Nearly every one had read news reports of the allegations in the case, and many had seen the footage of Mr Combs kicking his girlfriend in the hotel hallway.",
      "Many female potential jurors also said they had been victims of sexual abuse or assault themselves or knew someone close who had.",
      "Still, over a dozen of them said they could go into the case with an open mind and pledged not to form an opinion until they heard all the evidence.",
      "At the end of the day, 19 jurors were moved onto the next stage of questioning. They range in age from 30 to 75 and are from Manhattan, the Bronx and Westchester. They have diverse occupations including financial analysts, teachers, scientists and cashiers.",
      "How long could Diddy spend in jail?",
      "Mr Combs faces up to life in prison if convicted on the racketeering charge.",
      "He faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of sex trafficking.",
      "Transportation for purposes of prostitution carries a maximum sentence of 10 years."

    "summary": "The South American country is turning to wind power, but some local people are unhappy.",
    "story": [
      "When Jos\u00e9 Luis Iguar\u00e1n steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea.",
      "The Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguar\u00e1n belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing.",
      "With some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.",
      "But this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature.",
      "\"You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n says.",
      "His community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more.",
      "\"At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n adds.",
      "The Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family.",
      "Despite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguar\u00e1n says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones.",
      "Isagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions.",
      "Mr Iguar\u00e1n believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm.",
      "\"The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,\" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela.",
      "His community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption.",
      "\"Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,\" he adds.",
      "These concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits.",
      "\"There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,\" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu.",
      "\"In Colombia\u2026 there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable.\"",
      "In December 2024, Spanish company EDP Renov\u00e1veis shelved plans for two wind farms in La Guajira, saying the projects were no longer economically viable.",
      "One factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113.",
      "EDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to \"constant protests\" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023.",
      "Guajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard.",
      "And think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms.",
      "\"We call it the 'wind wars',\" says Ms Barney.",
      "For Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies.",
      "\"There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,\" he says.",
      "This gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects.",
      "\"For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected.\"",
      "By contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs.",
      "While Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix.",
      "For energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect.",
      "One such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms.",
      "The company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits.",
      "But it says good community relations are not enough.",
      "\"We cannot do these projects alone,\" says Federico Echavarr\u00eda, general manager of AES Colombia. \"The government must help resolve conflicts between communities.\"",
      "On the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state.",
      "Education and healthcare are poor, and most rural communities do not have running water.",
      "Some people still walk hours each day to collect water from jag\u00fceys \u2013 reservoirs filled with rainwater.",
      "His community has a small salt-water treatment plant that produces fresh water and it wants the company planning to build the nearby wind farm to expand it, so that more locals benefit.",
      "Despite the talk of progress, he points to a lingering paradox. \"The worst thing is we won't receive even a single kilowatt of the electricity produced here,\" he laments.",
      "The plan is for the wind farm's electricity to instead be sent elsewhere, and that the village will continue to rely on generators, at least in the medium term.",
      "While the future might look bright for clean energy, many Wayuu are still anxious they will be left in the dark."

    "summary": "The find could shed light on how Indians lived 1,000 years ago - but is without a museum because of red tape.",
    "story": [
      "A 1,000 year-old human skeleton buried sitting cross-legged in India is still without a museum to house it because of bureaucratic wrangling, six years after it was unearthed.",
      "Archaeologist Abhijit Ambekar made the significant discovery in 2019, when he spotted what looked like the top of a human skull while excavating in western Gujarat state.",
      "As his team dug deeper, they found the well-preserved remains in a pit in what appeared to be a meditative posture. Similar remains have been found at only three other sites in India.",
      "But officials are still arguing over who should take charge of the skeleton. It remains in a makeshift shelter \u2013 not far from a new museum of local archaeology.",
      "Abhijit Ambekar says the skeleton - found in the town of Vadnagar - is likely to belong to the Solanki period. The Solanki dynasty, also known as the Chaulukya dynasty, ruled over parts of modern-day Gujarat between 940 to 1300 CE.",
      "The skeleton's right arm rested on its lap and its left arm lay suspended in the air, as if resting on a stick.",
      "\"The skeleton is an extremely valuable find, not just for Vadnagar but for the whole country. It can help us understand how our ancestors lived, and reveal details about the past that are yet unknown,\" says Dr Ambekar, who heads the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) division in Mumbai, and led the team that found the skeleton.",
      "That it is yet to find a proper resting place, despite its archaeological significance, appears to come down to red tape.",
      "Mr Ambekar says the Gujarat government's plan for all artefacts excavated from Vadnagar was to place them in local museums.",
      "He says around 9,000 artefacts, including the skeleton, that were excavated from Vadnagar between 2016 and 2022 by the ASI and had been handed over to the Gujarat government have been placed in local museums - except for the skeleton.",
      "However, the state government says the skeleton is still in the possession of the ASI.",
      "\"As proper process was not followed, it [the skeleton] was not placed in the museum,\" Pankaj Sharma, director of the state's Directorate of Archaeology and Museums, told the BBC.",
      "Yadubir Singh Rawat, director general of the ASI, did not respond to the BBC's questions on the matter.",
      "M Thennarasan, principal secretary of the state's Sports, Youth and Cultural Activities Department told the BBC, that authorities were working on shifting the skeleton to a museum as soon as possible.",
      "Excavating the skeleton was a time-consuming process, Mr Ambekar says, adding that it took two months to complete. Various tools were used to carefully brush the soil away and free the skeleton from its ancient grave.",
      "It is currently housed in a tarpaulin shelter in Vadnagar, unprotected by security guards and exposed to natural elements. Locals sometimes bring relatives and friends to see the skeleton - a curiosity that has put a spotlight on the town, which is also the birthplace of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "What's interesting is that just a short distance away is the new Archaeological Experiential Museum - inaugurated by India's home minister in January.",
      "According to a government press release, the museum has been built at a cost of $35m and is spread across 12,500 sq m. It boasts that it showcases \"Vadnagar's 2,500-year-old history with over 5,000 artefacts, including ceramics, coins, tools and skeletal remains\".",
      "While the museum has a massive framed photo of the skeleton, it does not house the actual remains.",
      "Vadnagar is a historically significant region in Gujarat and excavations by the ASI have found traces of human settlements dating back to more than 2,000 years ago. Mr Ambekar says that portions of an earthen rampart believed to have been built by the region's first settlers exists even today.",
      "Digs have also revealed remnants of ancient Buddhist monasteries and stupas. These findings and others \u2013 such as terracotta figurines, coins, shell jewellery and stone and copper plate inscriptions - have helped archaeologists establish seven cultural sequences or phases in the area, starting from around the 2nd Century BCE and dating all the way up to the 19th Century CE.",
      "Mr Ambekar says the age of the skeleton he and his team found was estimated based on a DNA analysis of its teeth and a stratigraphic study of the excavation site. Stratigraphy involves studying rock sediments or layers of earth to determine their age. This is then used to establish the chronology of historical events or the approximate age of artefacts.",
      "\"The DNA analysis tells us that the skeleton is of local ancestry and belongs to a man in his forties, but more studies need to be done to understand his diet and lifestyle, which will in turn give us a better understanding of the region as it existed 1,000 years ago,\" he says.",
      "It could also shed light on the phenomenon of \"samadhi burials\" - an ancient burial practice among Hindus where revered figures were buried instead of being cremated, Mr Ambekar says.",
      "He adds that the skeleton had managed to survive the passage of time because the soil around it had remained undisturbed and displayed characteristics that prevent skeletal decay.",
      "Extricating the skeleton from the site and moving it to its current location was not an easy task. First, a block of earth with the skeleton nestled inside was cut out from the soil surrounding it. The skeleton and soil were treated with different chemicals to consolidate their structures. The block of earth was then put into a wooden box filled with wet mud and a crane was used to move the box to its current site.",
      "The entire operation took six days to complete, says Mr Ambekar.",
      "He hopes that the skeleton will find a place in a museum soon. But he adds it will need to have mechanisms to control the temperature and humidity of the space to prevent the skeleton from decomposing.",
      "Locals the BBC spoke to expressed similar sentiments and blamed \"red tapeism\" for the back-and-forth over the skeleton.",
      "\"We are proud of Vadnagar's ancient history but this treatment of a 1,000-year-old skeleton is deeply concerning. What is the point of building a museum if the most unique antiquity is left outside under a plastic roof?\" Vadnagar resident Jesang Thakor said.",
      "Another resident, Bethaji Thakor, said that he believed the skeleton could draw tourists from around the world to Vadnagar.",

      "Ahead of Sweden's Walpurgis festival to mark the start of spring, young people were busy selecting outfits or getting their hair done. Not all of them made it there alive.",
      "At a hair salon in Uppsala, a city north of Stockholm, three young men who police say were aged between 15 and 20 were shot dead on Tuesday before the celebrations started.",
      "The horror left many shaken in the build-up to the festival, known as Valborg in Swedish, which is typically a convivial affair each 30 April on the eve of the Christian feast day of Saint Walpurga. Celebrated nationwide, Uppsala hosts the country's largest and most high-profile Walpurgis events, popular with students.",
      "The partying did go ahead in full swing, but a subtle heaviness hung over the Swedish blue and yellow flags which fluttered around the city.",
      "And now, with the festival finished, it's only police tape - not flags - fluttering outside the basement barber shop where the shooting took place close to Vaksala Square.",
      "'I knew something had happened'",
      "\"It's really sad,\" says 20-year-old student Yamen Alchoum, who is in the area to eat at a nearby food truck. He says he was at another barber shop on the night of the shootings, but previously had his hair cut at this salon multiple times. \"I think if I was there [on Tuesday]\u2026I would be, like, involved in the shooting. And it's a bit scary.\"",
      "According to witnesses speaking to Swedish media TV4 and Aftonbladet, two of the young victims were dressed in barber capes and sat in parlour chairs when they were shot in the head just after 5pm on Tuesday.",
      "The city centre was busy at the time as commuters made their way to the nearby train station and students from the city's prestigious university cycled back to their flats.",
      "Witnesses reported hearing loud bangs which many mistook for fireworks. Minutes later several police cars and an ambulance arrived, blocking the street and forcing a bus to turn around. Helicopters and drones were dispatched to try and track down the suspect. Local media reported that he had worn a mask and used an electric scooter to get away from the scene.",
      "\"I heard the helicopters, so then I knew that something had happened,\" says Sara, a 32-year-old who lives on the street. She says her phone quickly lit up with news notifications and texts from friends asking if she was okay.",
      "Around two hours after the shootings, police arrested a 16-year-old boy. In Sweden, suspects can be held based on different levels of suspicion, and the teenager was initially held at the second-highest level, indicating strong suspicion.",
      "However, by Friday, prosecutors said the case against him had weakened and he was released.",
      "On Saturday, Swedish police confirmed that six people have now been arrested in connection with the case. The suspects range in age from under 18 to 45, according to the state prosecutor's office, and one is suspected of carrying out the killings.",
      "People intending to visit Uppsala for the Walpurgis festival were advised not to change their plans, as police promised extra resources on the cathedral city's streets and suggested the shooting was likely an \"isolated incident\".",
      "While many were shaken, tens of thousands of Swedes still heeded their advice, packing the banks of Uppsala's Fyris river to watch the annual student raft race, drinking in the city's pubs and parks or heading to a huge public bonfire in the evening. Others joined the annual spring ceremony outside the university where current and former students gathered to wave white caps.",
      "\"I don't really feel so scared,\" says Alvin Rose, 19, a social studies student, having a snack in Vaksala Square, just around the corner from where the shootings happened. \"It feels like there's more security, more cops about.\"",
      "His friend Kassandra Fritz, an 18-year-old natural sciences student, says she has driven to Uppsala from her home in G\u00e4vle, two hours north, to \"have fun and meet new people\".",
      "She reflects that she no longer has a \"strong\" reaction to news about shootings in Sweden since they are frequently in the headlines. \"There's been so many shootings lately, not only here in Uppsala but like, everywhere in Sweden.\"",
      "A hotspot for gun violence",
      "Over the past decade, Sweden has emerged as a European hotspot for gun crime, often linked to criminal networks. Research for Sweden's National Council for Crime Prevention released last year concluded that the profile of perpetrators is \"increasingly younger\", with growing numbers of teenagers both carrying out or dying from gun violence.",
      "Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson was on a work trip to Valencia when the Uppsala shooting took place, but has since described it as \"an extremely violent act\".",
      "\"This underlines that the wave of violence is not over - it continues,\" he said in an interview with Swedish news agency TT on Wednesday.",
      "At a news conference the day after, officers said they were investigating the possibility that the deaths were linked to gang crime, but said it was too soon to confirm this.",
      "Police in various Swedish cities have previously said it is becoming more common for gangs to contract vulnerable children to carry out crimes, because those who are 15 or younger are below the age of criminal responsibility in Sweden.",
      "Sweden's government recently proposed controversial new legislation that would allow police to wiretap children, in an attempt to prevent them from being recruited to teenage gangs.",
      "Ministers have also said they want to tighten the country's gun laws.",
      "In February, 10 people were killed in the country's worst mass shooting at an adult education centre in the Swedish town of Orebro. In this case, police suspect a 35-year-old was behind the killings. He legally owned a weapon, and was found dead inside the building.",
      "Tributes and tears",
      "Outside the hair salon in Uppsala, 20-year-old Yamen says he has never been involved in gang crime but knows plenty of others who have.",
      "\"Many times in my school, there was gang violence, and in the streets - dealers,\" he says. \"But my personality was to work, study, and now I am in college.\"",
      "As he leaves to meet friends, a steady stream of young people continue to stop at the street corner next to the hairdressers, some bringing bouquets of flowers. Several appear visibly shaken and have tears in their eyes.",
      "\"I knew him very well,\" says Elias, a 16-year-old who says he was friends with one of the victims, and has asked the BBC not to share his surname. \"It feels unreal, you know. It doesn't feel like I've truly accepted the situation.\"",

      "That would become Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 which, five years later, has become a sensation.",
      "It sold one million copies in just three days, topped Spotify viral charts with its soundtrack, and even won praise from French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "But one of the most remarkable things about it is the story of how it was made - a tale of random Reddit messages, \"massive luck\" and an unusual approach to game development.",

      "Each year an entity known as The Paintress emerges and lowers the number by one, causing everyone of that age to vanish, and the game follows a group on a quest to destroy the mysterious being.",
      "It's an intriguing set-up for an epic tale, but the game's aesthetic, inspired by 19th-Century France, and its old-school turn-based battles also set it apart.",
      "But the conventional wisdom when Guillaume began was that players didn't want something like that.",
      "So, five years ago, he started to recruit people for his passion project, firing out messages on Reddit and online forums to potential colleagues.",
      "One of those who responded was Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, who was under lockdown in Australia at the time.",

      "After securing funding from publisher Kepler Interactive, the core team grew to about 30 people.",
      "Many of them were found in a similar, unusual manner to Jennifer.",

      "\"I have a list of 15 people to contact and I'm like: 'Okay I'm probably going to get maybe no one at all'.",
      "\"And every time the first one is like: 'Yeah, let's do it'.\"",

      "Expedition 33 has also been widely praised for its production values - rivalling those of games worked on by hundreds, even thousands of staff.",
      "Guillaume attributes some of this to recent advances in tools used to make games, which allowed the team to work more efficiently.",
      "Having the backing of Kepler allowed the studio to attract actors including Daredevil's Charlie Cox, Lord of the Rings star Andy Serkis, and video game actors Jennifer English and Ben Starr.",

    "published": "Sat, 03 May 2025 23:26:31 GMT",
    "summary": "As Western alliances unravel, Europe is entering an era that seems distant from what VE Day represented, the BBC's Katya Adler writes.",
    "story": [
      "\"Celebration? What celebration? It feels more like a funeral\" - the damning words of a former senior Nato figure to describe this week's ceremonies marking Victory in Europe Day.",
      "The top-level diplomat who spent years at the transatlantic defence alliance asked not to be named in order to speak freely, but why so nihilistic? VE Day was a joint Allied triumph over Nazi Germany; over hatred, dictatorship, the Third Reich's territorial expansionism and heinous crimes against humanity.",
      "So much blood was spilled achieving that victory. Some 51 million Allied soldiers and civilians died during World War Two, united in a pursuit to rid the world of the scourge of Nazism.",
      "But 80 years on, we're surrounded by countless news and academic analyses breathlessly singling out Donald Trump as the modern day nail in the coffin of the strong transatlantic bonds forged back then. In Europe, the American president is viewed by many as the slayer-in-chief of decades-old common values; shared visions of security, democracy and rule of law.",
      "But is that accurate, or too simplistic?",
      "Russia - divisions from the start",
      "To get the full picture on what happened to allied ties after WW2, we cannot omit Russia, then or now.",
      "By 1945, about 24 million Russians and other Soviets had been slaughtered in the war with Germany. Without their sacrifice, as well as that of the other allies, the Nazis would not have been vanquished.",
      "\"One thing we need to recognise, though, is Russia was never a true friend of the West,\" says Michael Zantovsky, a former Czech Ambassador to Washington and to London.",
      "\"During WW2 it was an ally for existential reasons. It needed any help [against the Nazis] that it could get. And it was the same story with western powers, to be fair. They needed the help of the Soviet Union. But Russia did not plan on continuing the alliance after the war. As soon as the threat of Nazi Germany was destroyed, the Soviet Union intended to follow its own objectives.\"",
      "Splits appeared the moment Germany was defeated; there was even a disagreement over which day VE Day fell. Western powers witnessed the signing of Germany's military capitulation in the French cathedral city of Reims, news that broke on 8 May 1945. The USSR wanted its own, separate, signing with surrendering Germany in Soviet-occupied Berlin a day later. Russia marks VE Day on 9 May to this day.",
      "Depending where you are in Europe on VE Day, the mood is varied - particularly this year.",
      "Western Europe welcomes liberty, democracy and an end to the Nazi threat. In the UK for example, multiple VE Day celebrations are planned this year, as with every year.",
      "But people living in central and eastern Europe, such as Czechoslovakia, emerged from Nazi occupation in 1945 only to end up under Communist regimes - whether they liked it or not.",
      "As a result, Ambassador Zantovsky describes his country's relationship to VE Day as \"ambiguous\".",
      "\"The western part of Czechoslovakia was liberated by US troops, the rest of the country by Soviet soldiers,\" he tells me.",
      "Czechoslovakia was taken over by the Communist Party in 1948 and fully invaded by the Soviet Union two decades later. \"During communist times, the West's role in WW2 was deliberately suppressed and marginalised. We were told we owed our liberty [from the Nazis] to the Soviets.\"",
      "Russia marks VE Day with triumphalist military parades - and President Vladimir Putin knows the deep sense of nationalist pride that Russians still feel at defeating the Nazi regime in 1945. It is no coincidence that he publicly labels Ukraine's leadership \"Nazis\" as a means of besmirching them in Russian eyes.",
      "For VE Day this year, President Putin called a three-day ceasefire with Ukraine \u2013 it's presumed, because he wants to concentrate, uninterrupted, on showing off Russia's military muscle in front of a crowd of foreign dignitaries, including President Xi Jinping of China.",
      "The official reason Putin gave for the Ukraine ceasefire was \"humanitarian grounds\". Quite the irony, since he's the one who ordered the invasion of that sovereign country.",
      "That invasion brought back difficult memories for Czechs of their own occupation and suppression. \"That's why we feel so strongly for Ukraine,\" says Zantovsky.",
      "\"It's only a few hundred kilometres away. Our sense of security is threatened once again.\"",
      "The US - a marriage of convenience",
      "This is why most Europeans are so shocked at President Trump's apparent respect for, even deference towards, Putin, while simultaneously verbally threatening the territorial integrity of traditionally close allies like Canada and Denmark.",
      "Europe has viewed the US as its closest friend since WW2. Washington poured money into the war-shattered continent in the late 1940s - including West Germany, which was ever thankful to the US for bringing it back into the fold after the horrors of Nazism. The US also gave Europe post-war security guarantees; Nato was founded in 1949.",
      "But this wasn't American altruism, as Trump implies. It too was a marriage of convenience, of sorts.",
      "Following WW2, the US worried about the spread of communism. It fretted that Europe, with its economy and infrastructure in tatters, was vulnerable both to home-grown communist parties and abroad from an expansionist Soviet Union. By swooping in to help rebuild Europe, the US was gaining a geostrategic foothold on the Soviet Union's doorstep throughout the Cold War.",
      "The idea of a \"West\" - made of countries sharing security goals and values - was born.",
      "Might we now be witnessing its death, or gradual strangulation? With no common enemy anymore, the friendship is certainly fraying. In 2025, the president of the United States no longer feels threatened by Russia.",
      "\"Shared history served as the foundation for the (transatlantic) relationship for eight decades, but it's not enough to propel the relationship forward anymore,\" Washington's former Nato ambassador Julie Smith told me.",
      "The war in Ukraine is the biggest conflict in Europe since WW2. With Russia's economy resolutely on a war footing, it has the potential to spread.",
      "Europe, unlike the US, still feels threatened by Russia. Capitals across the continent have been left speechless and nervous by Trump appearing to blame Ukraine, not Moscow, for the bloodshed.",
      "The televised press conference in the White House Oval Office in late February, where Trump and his deputy, JD Vance, seemingly tried to bait, berate and humiliate Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, was a turning point in European public opinion and politics.",
      "A YouGov poll in March indicated that, 80 years on from VE Day, a large majority of Western Europeans (78% in the UK, 74% in Germany, 75% in Spain) now view the White House as a big threat to peace and security in Europe.",
      "In Europe's east, the Soviet Union's former sphere of influence, people fear President Trump's attitude to Ukraine will only embolden President Putin in his expansionist drive.",
      "If Russia gets US recognition for \"crimes of conquest\" in Ukraine, says historian and author Timothy Garton Ash, VE Day this year would be better labelled DE Day - Defeat in Europe Day.",
      "And with Trump frequently accusing Europe of free-loading, and taking advantage of the US, there's a nervousness among leaders across the continent that they could be left alone to defend themselves for the first time since WW2. Boosting defence spending is now a huge topic in European capitals.",
      "Germany decides to leave history in the past and rebuild its military",
      "How ordinary Poles are preparing for a Russian invasion",
      "'Kicking butt' or 'going too fast'? Trump voters reflect on 100 days",
      "The message Berlin has taken from Trump's first 100 days in office is: \"We cannot rely on the US anymore,\" says Peter Wittig, Germany's former ambassador to Washington.",
      "That's a massive turnaround for Germans, who have been reluctant to rebuild their country's military might after WW2. Instead, Germany leant particularly heavily on the US for its security. A large chunk of the estimated 100,000 US troops stationed in Europe are based in Germany. The US stores nuclear arms in the country too.",
      "The Trump-shock among normally pro-US German politicians is so profound that it prompted a change in the country's constitution this spring. Parliamentarians voted to lift Berlin's long established debt brake - which limited government spending - in order to invest heavily and power up the country's military going forward.",
      "Ursula von der Leyen, once Germany's defence minister, is now the president of the European Commission in Brussels. She is transatlantic-leaning and carefully-spoken, but even she summed up the present situation starkly: \"The West as we knew it, no longer exists.\"",
      "'The end of an era' - but what now?",
      "Still, the pivot away from Europe by the US cannot just be blamed on Trump.",
      "China, not Russia, has been viewed by the White House as strategic threat number one for some time now. In 2012, then-US President Barack Obama said he wanted to focus his foreign policy on Asia, and Trump's predecessor Joe Biden invested a lot of time trying to shore up China-wary allies in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "Trump or no Trump, concentrating foreign policy on Asia and withdrawing substantially from Europe is unlikely to change, says Ambassador Wittig - whichever political party wins the next US election - especially as there is now a growing reluctance in US public opinion to carry the burden of financing allies.",
      "Wittig calls it \"the end of an era - the end of engagement in Europe\".",
      "Despite all the European hand wringing, there is a recognition among the continent's leaders that, 80 years after VE Day, it is high time they take more responsibility for paying and providing for their own defence capabilities, rather than relying on Washington.",
      "Some also see potential in the relationship reset. Ambassador Zantovsky calls this \"an opportunity brought about by crisis, a sense of urgency regarding security that hasn't existed [in Europe] for the last 30 years\".",
      "Perhaps, but during the Cold War western European societies had younger populations and far more slim-line welfare states. Spending 4% or 5% of gross domestic product on defence was do-able.",
      "Analysts say that's what would be needed again now to wean Europe off US security support, but it's unclear if present-day voters would accept the painful compromises needed - in terms of cuts in government spending on health or education for example - in return for boosting their country's defence capabilities.",
      "This is especially the case in European nations geographically further from Russia's orbit, where the sense of immediate threat feels less acute.",
      "Mr Garton Ash wonders if there is a transitional path from the current US-led Nato to a more European Nato, with the US still at the table but Europe taking responsibility for its own security.",
      "\"We need a new generation of political leaders who are up to the challenge,\" says political historian and biographer Sir Anthony Seldon.",
      "\"A need can often bring forward the right people,\" he added, reflecting on European and US leaders in the aftermath of WW2.",
      "\"Something has certainly broken. The future is uncertain. Do we have to go to war periodically to realise how terrible it is, and to force us to work together?\"",

    "summary": "Buddha\u2019s sacred jewels, unearthed in 1898, head to auction at Sotheby\u2019s, raising ethical concerns.",
    "story": [
      "On Wednesday, a cache of dazzling jewels linked to the Buddha's mortal remains, which have been hailed as one of the most astonishing archaeological finds of the modern era, will go under the hammer at Sotheby's in Hong Kong.",
      "For over a century these relics, unearthed from a dusty mound in northern India in 1898, have sat largely unseen, cradled by a private British collection.",
      "Now, as the gems prepare to leave the custody of their keepers, they are stirring not just collectors' appetites but also some unease.",
      "They come from a glittering hoard of nearly 1,800 pearls, rubies, topaz, sapphires, and patterned gold sheets, first glimpsed deep inside a brick chamber in present-day Uttar Pradesh in India, near the Buddha's birthplace.",
      "Their discovery \u2013 alongside bone fragments identified by an inscribed urn as belonging to the Buddha himself \u2013 reverberated through the world of archaeology. Nicolas Chow, chairman of Sotheby's Asia and worldwide head of Asian Art, believes this is \"among the most extraordinary archaeological discoveries of all time\".",
      "Yet as these relics now face the glare of the auction room, experts tell the BBC that a question hangs heavy: can the sale of treasures so intimately woven into India's sacred past be considered ethical?",
      "In 1898, William Claxton Pepp\u00e9, an English estate manager, excavated a stupa at Piprahwa, just south of Lumbini, where the Buddha is believed to have been born. He uncovered relics inscribed and consecrated nearly 2,000 years ago.",
      "Historians agree these relics, intact until then, are the heritage of both the Buddha's Sakya clan descendants and Buddhists worldwide. The bone relics have since been distributed to countries such as Thailand, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, where they continue to be venerated.",
      "\"Are the relics of the Buddha a commodity that can be treated like a work of art to be sold on the market?\" wonders Naman Ahuja, a Delhi-based art historian. \"And since they aren't, how is the seller ethically authorised to auction them?",
      "\"Since the seller is termed the 'custodian', I would like to ask \u2013 custodian on whose behalf? Does custodianship permit them now to sell these relics?\"",
      "Chris Pepp\u00e9, great-grandson of William, told the BBC the family looked into donating the relics, but all options presented problems and an auction seemed the \"fairest and most transparent way to transfer these relics to Buddhists\".",
      "Julian King, Sotheby's international specialist and head of sale, Himalayan Art, New York told the BBC the auction house had made a thorough review of the jewels.",
      "\"As is the case with any important items and collectibles that are offered for sale at Sotheby's, we conducted requisite due diligence, including in relation to authenticity and provenance, legality and other considerations in line with our policies and industry standards for artworks and treasures,\" King said.",
      "Ashley Thompson, of Soas University of London, and curator Conan Cheong, both experts in Southeast Asian art, have more questions. In a joint statement they told the BBC: \"Other ethical questions raised by the sale are: should human remains be traded? And who gets to decide what are human remains or not? For many Buddhist practitioners around the world, the gems on sale are part and parcel of the bones and ash.\"",
      "The sale of the relics has also sparked concern among Buddhist leaders.",
      "\"The Buddha teaches us not to take other people's possessions without permission,\" Amal Abeyawardene of London-based British MahaBodhi Society, told the BBC. \"Historical records indicate that the Sakyamuni clan were granted custody of these relics, as the Buddha emanated from their community. Their wish was for these relics to be preserved alongside adornments, such as these gems, so that they may be venerated in perpetuity by the Buddha's followers.\"",
      "Chris Pepp\u00e9 has written that the jewels passed from his great-uncle to his cousin, and in 2013 came to him and two other cousins. That's when he began researching their discovery by his great-grandfather.",
      "The Los Angeles-based television director and film editor wrote he had found 1898 newspaper reports - from Reuters to the New York Tribune - announcing the find of Buddha's remains.",
      "\"The colonisation of India by the British had been a source of some cultural shame for me [and continues to be] but, amidst the treasure hunters who hauled their finds back to England, there had also been people focused on the pursuit of knowledge,\" Chris Pepp\u00e9 writes.",
      "He noted his research revealed a lot about his ancestors who he had dismissed as \"prejudiced Victorians from a bygone era\".",
      "\"I learned that Willie Pepp\u00e9's first wife chose to travel around India for her honeymoon and loved the country and its culture. Sadly, she died from an unspecified illness. I learned that my grandmother was outraged at the land laws that applied to Indian women.",
      "\"And I learned that the excavation of the stupa was an attempt by Willie Pepp\u00e9 to provide work for his tenant farmers who had fallen victim to the famine of 1897.\"",
      "He writes his great-grandfather's \"technical diagrams of ramps and pulleys suggest that he was also a trained engineer who couldn't resist a project\".",
      "William Pepp\u00e9 handed the gems, relics and reliquaries to the colonial Indian government: the bone relics went to the Buddhist King of Siam (Rama V). Five relic urns, a stone chest and most other relics were sent to the Indian Museum in Kolkata - then the Imperial Museum of Calcutta.",
      "Only a small \"portion of duplicates\", which he was allowed to keep, remained in the Pepp\u00e9 family, he notes. (Sotheby's notes say Pepp\u00e9 was allowed to keep approximately one-fifth of the discovery.)",
      "Sources told the BBC the auction house considers the \"duplicates\" to be original items considered surplus to those donated, which the \"Indian government permitted Pepp\u00e9 to retain\".",
      "Over the past six years years, the gems have featured in major exhibitions, including one at The Met in 2023. The Pepp\u00e9 family has also launched a website to \"share our research\".",
      "Some scholars argue Buddha relics should never be treated as market commodities.",
      "\"The Sotheby's auction transforms these highly sacred materials into saleable objects, in continuation of acts of colonial violence which extracted them from a stupa and called them 'gems' and 'objects of interest to Europeans', creating a false division with the ash and bone fragments they were consecrated with,\" say Thompson and Cheong.",
      "Chris Pepp\u00e9 told the BBC that in all the monasteries he had visited \"no Buddhists regard these as corporeal relics\".",
      "\"A few Buddhist academics\u00a0at western universities have recently offered a convoluted, fact-defying logic whereby they may be regarded as such.\u00a0It's an academic construct that is not shared by Buddhists in general who are familiar with the details of the find,\" he said.",
      "Pepp\u00e9 said the family \"looked into donation [of the relics] to temples and museums and they all presented different problems on closer scrutiny\".",
      "\"An auction seems the fairest and most transparent way to transfer these relics to Buddhists and we are confident that Sotheby's will achieve that.\"",
      "Some also point to The Koh-i-Noor, seized by the British East India Company and now part of the Crown Jewels, with many Indians viewing it as stolen. Should the Buddha's jewels be next?",
      "\"Repatriation, I believe, is seldom necessary,\" says Ahuja. \"Such rare and sacred relics that are unique and which define a land's cultural history, however, deserve the government's exceptional attention.\""

    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 17:02:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs will appear in Manhattan federal court for a sex-trafficking trial beginning with jury selection. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, the music mogul accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and otherwise exploiting women in recurring incidents over multiple decades, is standing trial in New York City this month. Jury selection began Monday, and opening statements are scheduled to follow on May 12.",
      "Combs, 55, faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has been jailed since September, when he was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and at his final pre-trial hearing, rejected a plea deal.",
      "As the trial gets underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know.",
      "Combs will be tried on 5 charges",
      "One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment.",
      "Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts \u2014 one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution \u2014 against him in early April.",
      "The indictment alleges Combs \"engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\" which was \"verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.\" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and the sex workers to be flown to him.",
      "The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \"Freak Offs,\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and sometimes lasted multiple days.",
      "Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment.",
      "In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct.",
      "According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors.",
      "If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him.",
      "His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "\"This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,\" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment.",
      "2016 hotel security video",
      "A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial.",
      "The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage.",
      "Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit.",
      "Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \"Freak Off.\" Combs lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\" between the two.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said.",
      "Jury selection",
      "Twelve jurors and six alternates will be chosen for the trial.",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions.",
      "Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors.",
      "In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not \"explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury\" nor acknowledge \"the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs.\"",
      "They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners.",
      "Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were \"utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\"",

The theme's ties to the history of Christ were not well received by some critics who thought fashion should stay out of the church.",
      "2017 Met Gala theme: \"Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: Art of the In-Between\"",
      "The 2017 event paid tribute to Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo and her Comme des Gar\u00e7ons avant-garde designs that play with the body's shape and form. Duality, a motif for the exhibit, highlighted almost four decades of her work. Guests brought to the event pops of red from Kawakubo's palette, intricate embellishments and sheer fabrics. Caroline Kennedy and Rihanna embraced more fantastical designs, pairing shape-shifting silhouettes with florals, inducing more authenticity to a much-subdued theme interpretation.",
      "2016 Met Gala theme: \"Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology\"",
      "The influence of technology in fashion turned the 2016 Met Gala into a spectacular display of metallics and cutting-edge designs. Many of the garnmets appeared too intricate and precise to be man-made, an ode to the artisans all over the world who piece together exquisite Haute Couture creations by pouring thousands of hours into each work. CBS News spent the day with supermodel and entrepreneur Karlie Kloss, who wore a sleek white Brandon Maxwell number that referenced classic men's tailoring paired with Ala\u00efa-esque angular cuts.",
      "2015 Met Gala theme \"China: Through the Looking Glass\"",
      "While the 2015 Met exhibit scoped a wide history of artifacts and influence from Asian art, the gala came down to just one word: Rihanna. Dawning a sunny yellow cape that cascaded down the steps of the Met, the singer and fashion icon elevated the meaning of attending fashion's biggest night. The couture garment designed by China's Guo Pei took two years to make, Rihanna told Vanity Fair. The look quickly comes to mind around the world when the first Monday in May is discussed.",
      "2014 Met Gala theme: \"Charles James: Beyond Fashion\"",
      "The Costume Institute has been celebrating those behind fashion since its inception, and in 1973 it began hosting the gala within the museum itself, Vogue recounts. Fashion authority Diana Vreeland brought to life \"The World of Balenciaga\" after exiting Vogue as editor-in-chief, and her tribute to Spanish designer Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga left a blueprint for other designer-centered celebrations that followed.",
      "In 2014, couturier Charles James' work went on display at the Met and guests embraced brilliant gowns with his grandiose touch. James' tailored and structural approach to the female form, mixed with modern fabrics, brought elegance and regalia to the occasion.",
      "2013 Met Gala theme: \"Punk: Chaos to Couture\"",
      "Anti-establishment influence inked its way into the Met's\u00a0history in 2013.\u00a0Started in the 1970's, the punk movement gave guests a reason to wear garments embellished with the spirit of teen disobedience and air of grungy D.I.Y. personal style. Madonna honored the era with fishnets, metal studs and silver chains adorning a Givenchy mini plaid blazer by Riccardo Tisci. Rebellion was also apparent in the hairstyles exhibited, most notably by singer Miley Cyrus, a fashion fanatic, whose short, spiked look paired perfectly with her risque fishnet Marc Jacobs gown.",
      "What was the first Met Gala theme?",
      "The Costume Institute started holding benefits in 1948, but it was Vreeland who brought themed galas to the next level as a Met consultant with \"The World of Balenciaga\" in 1973, according to Vogue.",
      "Full list of past Met Gala themes over the years",
      "Inspecting the art of the world's most famous designers and houses, declaring the impact of global cultures and movements, and defining the prevalence of certain style icons, the Met Gala has explored many themes throughout The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute history. Here's a look at the full list of Met Gala themes:",

      "Zendaya has become a favorite at the Met Gala, and last year she was a co-chair, alongside Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Hemsworth and, of course, Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour. The night's theme was \"Sleeping Beauties: Fashion Reawakened,\" and the dress code was \"Garden of Time.\"",
      "The \"Dune\" and \"Euphoria\" star opened the evening in an ocean blue gown by Maison Margiela with fitted a corset and layers of metallic fabric, styled with a feather headpiece and smokey makeup.",
      "Then hours later, she made a surprise return on the red carpet with a second look. She appeared in a never-before-worn Givenchy couture gown from the 1996 collection -- the year she was born -- along with a vintage Alexander McQueen hat adorned with a bouquet of roses.",
      "\"When it comes to the Met carpet, Zendaya is all about keeping us guessing-but one thing is for certain: She will always turn heads. Clearly, she did it again tonight,\" Vogue's Senior Fashion and Style Writer Christian Allaire wrote of her back-to-back looks.",

      "He wore a navy smoking jacket with red and white stitching, topped with a large beret and gold sunglasses.",
      "The Puerto Rican artist arrived on the red carpet carrying a floral bouquet made from the same fabric as his jacket. The blooms represented the flor de maga -- the national flower of Puerto Rico -- along with roses and the flax plant that Sleeping Beauty pricked her finger on in the fairy tale.",
      "His backless, all-white look from 2023, honoring\u00a0late designer Karl Lagerfeld, also gets an honorable mention on the list.",
      "Tyla's sand dress, 2024 Met Gala",

      "\"We were looking to do something creative, something completely different for my first Met Gala,\" the singer and songwriter told Vogue ahead of the event. \"So when Balmain showed me the idea and sketch, I just knew it was perfect. The idea was crazy, and I loved it.\"",

      "Her fellow co-chairs included Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Roger Federer and Dua Lipa.",
      "Doja Cat goes full cat, 2023 Met Gala",
      "Love it or hate it, Doja Cat did not hold back for the 2023 Met Gala. It was her first time attending, and she fully embraced -- and embodied -- the theme, dressing up as Karl Lagerfeld's beloved cat, a Burmese named Choupette.",

      "Lively made an entrance on The Met steps worthy of her \"Gossip Girl\" character Serena Van Der Woodsen. Her first look featured a metallic bodice and bow inspired by the Manhattan skyline and Empire State Building, then it transformed into a long blue-green train based on Grand Central's constellation ceiling. She also wore a seven-tier crown to symbolize the Statue of Liberty.",
      "Husband Ryan Reynolds was by her side to co-chair the event in a black velvet tuxedo by Ralph Lauren.",

      "He started in a large, gold cape that was then removed to reveal a golden suit of armor underneath, which he later shed to show off a crystal-covered body suit.",
      "The fashion house called it a \"three-part LGBTQ+ American fairytale.\" The cape was meant to conceal his identity, the armor symbolized protection against prejudice, and finally the body suit represented \"living life as your true, unguarded self.\"",
      "The artist is known for his daring fashion choices, including his purple prom look at the MTV Awards just days before.",
      "Iman's latest iconic look, 2021 Met Gala",

      "Her outfit from Harris Reed, supported by Dolce & Gabbana, featured a gold strapless jumpsuit under a massive hoop skirt and matching headpiece made of feathers.",
      "Reed told Vogue they were inspired by 18th-century hooped cage skirts that could \"take up space in a way that says, 'I deserve to be here and I own it.'\"",

      "Maluma's red leather suit, 2021 Met Gala",

      "He joined Donatella Versace for the 2021 Met Gala in a red-hot leather suit with bejeweled accents and accessories.",
      "\"My favorite part of my outfit was everything,\" Maluma told Vogue. \"I loved the cowboy inspiration, as I ride horses, but the highlight was the belt... It was a signature Versace cowboy belt inspired by the late Gianni Versace's classic '90s looks.\"",
      "He also wore a 14-karat gold chain link glove with his nickname, Papi Juancho, written in stones.",
      "Zendaya's light-up Cinderella look, 2019 Met Gala",
      "First, there was Joan of Arc in 2018. Then, her Cinderella gown was among the highlights of the wacky and weird 2019 Met Gala, \"Camp: Notes on Fashion.\"",
      "With the wave of a wand from her stylist and fairy godfather Law Roach, the dress lit up The Met steps, literately. It magically changed from gray to blue, prompting a large cheer from the crowd.",
      "Roach said the gown, by Tommy Hilfiger, represented Zendaya's transformation from the Disney Channel to \"Euphoria\" and more adult roles.",
      "As for last year's looks, he said Zendaya wasn't even fitted until Saturday, two days before the big event.",
      "\"I haven't seen Zendaya's dress!\" he told The New York Times in an interview ahead of time. \"We've been on two press tours - 'Dune 2' and 'Challengers' - and doing two Vogue covers.\"",

      "\"I loved this dress. It was slim-fitting and body-hugging, and just glistened,\" she told Vogue in a 2020 interview. \"I remember when I saw this dress for the first time, I thought, wow, Gianni, is that for me? It seemed like one of those dresses that you read in those fairytale books.\"",
      "Campbell made her Met Gala debut in 1990 wearing a multi-colored mini dress also from Gianni Versace.",

    "summary": "The actor-playwright received two Tony nominations for the over-the-top comedy about Mary Todd Lincoln and her secret passion of becoming a cabaret star, while her husband, Abe, is trying to win the Civil War.",
    "story": [
      "\"Oh, Mary!\" may be Broadway's most unlikely offering this season, a wildly over-the-top, not-at-all historically accurate look at first lady Mary Todd Lincoln, written by and starring Cole Escola.",
      "Abraham Lincoln: \"For God's sake, Mary! How would it look for the first lady of the United States to be flitting about a stage right now in the ruins of war?\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"How would it look? Sensational!!\"",
      "It's a broad comedy about Mary's secret passion of becoming a cabaret star. Meanwhile, her husband, Abe, is just wrapping up the Civil War, and is more concerned with keeping the country together.",
      "Abraham Lincoln: \"No! It's inappropriate! We're at war!\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"With who?\"Abraham Lincoln: \"The south!\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"Of what?\"",
      "It's not a revival, it has no movie stars (\"Well, speak for yourself, Mo!\"), and it's a smash hit, breaking box office records.",
      "What does that say? \"Inflation is high,\" Escola laughed.",
      "Escola came up with the idea in 2009: \"I sent an email to myself that said, 'What if Abraham Lincoln's assassination wasn't such a bad thing for Mary Todd?' You know, like, Mary's starting over. Like, 'Now I'm single. I can date.' You know?\"",
      "But this fever dream Mary remained just a dream for years. \"I loved this idea so much, I didn't want it to get on paper and for it to disappoint me \u2013 to disappoint me, not just the audience, but, like, me,\" Escola said. \"There are certain ideas that you're just like, 'Oh, I don't wanna plant this seed, because what if it's an ugly flower?'\"",
      "Escola eventually wrote the play. \"Oh, Mary!\" opened to rapturous reviews downtown, quickly moved uptown to Broadway, and just this week earned five Tony nominations, including two for 38-year-old Escola (for best play and best actor).",
      "It's all a long way from rural Oregon, where Escola was raised. The family had little money, with a Vietnam veteran father, Escola says, who suffered from mental illness. \"When I was maybe five years old, my father chased us out of the home with a shotgun. He was having some sort of alcoholic manic break and thought that there were people after him. And so, he chased my mother and my brother and I out of the trailer, and then we moved out and didn't come back.\"",
      "The family moved in with Escola's grandmother. \"Then, her and I shared a bedroom, and I remember that's when she taught me to read. And she was in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's so she would repeat stories a lot. But I loved them. I loved her stories. I realize now, when she would tell these stories, we were, like, meeting in the middle of her memory. Like, she was living out the fantasy of her childhood, and I was also living out my fantasy of being a young girl on a farm in Alberta.\"",
      "I asked, \"And you didn't mind that she was repeating the stories?\"",
      "\"No, no,\" Escola replied. \"Because she would remember certain details in a new telling or, like, leave something out, and then I got to be, like, you know, 'And you were wearing a dress, right, Gramma?'\"",
      "\"And is it right that she gave you a Barbie when you were five?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She gave me my first Barbie. just completely took me at face value when I was doing something that wasn't what boys were supposed to do.\"",
      "Her understanding proved prescient. Escola now uses they/them pronouns. Asked to explain, Escola said, \"I have always felt not male, not female. And you know, it's funny, because recently I saw photos of me on Instagram. The comments were like, 'What is that? Like, that's not a man.' 'Well, it sure as hell ain't a woman, either.' And I was like, 'Exactly.' Like, you do get it.\"",
      "Likewise, Escola's comedic identity has never been in doubt.",
      "I asked, \"Comedically, have you always done your own thing?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"So, there was never a time where you thought, 'I need to be more like this person to make people respond to me'?\"",
      "\"No,\" said Escola. \"It would be like trying to speak German when I don't actually know any German. It has to make me laugh in order for it to even have a chance of making someone else laugh.\"",
      "Escola began performing in community theater back in Oregon, and eventually scraped together the money to make it to New York (\"It was New York or bust!\"), at first attending college and living at the 92nd Street Y. It was a short stint of only nine months. \"I had to drop out because they wouldn't let me take out any more loans. I guess I was so poor that they were like, 'You'll never be able to pay this back.'",
      "\"I felt like there was something wrong with me that I couldn't afford to go to school. That's the thing that makes me the most angry about being poor, just this innate sense that it's like a moral failing or an innate thing that's broken in you.\"",
      "Escola eventually did make it back to New York to stay, gaining a fan base with online videos, such as \"Mom Commercial\" (2015):",
      "\u2026 and then on TV, playing a range of deranged, yet delightful characters in shows like \"At Home with Amy Sedaris.\"",
      "And then along came Mary.",
      "I said, \"You don't come to see the show and go, 'Oh, there were layers and layers of development people that were saying, No, you've gotta tweak it for this audience and do this for that audience.'\"",
      "\"No,\" Escola said. \"There is something special about the fact that I wrote this for me and my friends, and for my audience that I've had in downtown venues and stuff. And the fact that it's successful is, I don't know, it makes it that much sweeter. It really does.\"",

    "summary": "When Alex Matisse founded East Fork Pottery, in Asheville, N.C., he didn't want to use the name of his great-grandfather, artist Henri Matisse. But after business took off, Alex decided it was time \u2013 and now graces his ceramics with the imagery of his famous forebear.",
    "story": [
      "As an apprentice to a potter, what Alex Matisse discovered shaped him like clay itself.\u00a0 \"When I walked in, I knew that this is what I was going to do,\" he said. \"We were told pots have skin and bones and skeletons and, like, a plate should have the fullness of the moon.\"",
      "Artful descriptions, much the way a painter might define their craft. In fact it was Henri Matisse who once said, \"I don't literally paint that table, but the emotion it produces upon me.\"",
      "When Alex founded East Fork Pottery in Asheville, North Carolina, back in 2009, he took the same view. He saw ceramics as a canvas. It came easily, like it was woven into his DNA \u2013 because it was. Alex is the great-grandson of artist Henri Matisse.",
      "I asked, \"What did you know of your great-grandfather when you were growing up?\"",
      "\"He was everywhere, kind of in the air that we breathed, around the house, on the walls,\" Alex replied.",
      "It was a famous last name he ran away from for years.\u00a0 \"I had a very grumpy relationship with it,\" he laughed. \"It was this kind of shadow thing that followed me around that I wanted to shake.\"",
      "Maybe it was stubbornness, or pride, but Alex was determined to make his own way. He convinced his soon-to-be-wife Connie to help him build a wood kiln on an old tobacco farm.",
      "I asked, \"Did she have the same passion for it that you did?\"",
      "\"No. She didn't have a passion for clay,\" Alex said.",
      "\"But she had a passion for you, so she kept going?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She stuck around,\" he laughed.",
      "And without anyone knowing who he really was, his business boomed. He could barely keep up with the demand. He realized, \"If we're gonna play in this world, something's gotta change. Like, we cannot keep doing it like we did.\"",
      "So, he decided to mechanize, at least partially. The pottery was still his, only he thought better, especially the colors.\u00a0 He was excited. \"And we sent out a postcard of these new pots that look, you know, they were plain, they had colors on them,\" he said. \"And nobody showed up. So overnight, we lost almost every single one of our customers. Like, they had thought we had lost our minds.\"",
      "And yet, he still refused to fall back on the Matisse name, and it turned out that belief in himself paid off.",
      "Today, he has legions of fans who call themselves \"Potheads.\" They buy, share and trade East Fork dinnerware online. On the secondary market, some of his early pieces can go for thousands of dollars.",
      "And so, with East Fork firmly established, about 18 months ago Alex decided it was time to use his own name. He, along with his sister and brother, poured over hundreds of works by their great-grandfather to find the ones that could be pottery perfect.",
      "\"We wanted something like the Blue Nude series that was instantly recognizable,\" Alex said. \"But then, I wanted some that spoke to me a little more personally.\"",
      "Decals were made of the chosen works, faithful to their great-grandfather's exacting details. Each one is carefully applied by hand, and inspected by hand over and over again.",
      "He says he doesn't wonder what his great-grandfather would think of his new collection. \"Oh, geez. No.\" Alex said, \"Because he was very serious. He was so focused on his work. Like, that's what he cared about.\"",
      "Henri Matisse once famously said, \"Creativity takes courage.\" His great-grandson Alex Matisse would certainly agree with that. His only caveat is that sometimes courage is all in the timing.",
      "\"There's not a heaviness to it,\" he said. \"It's just another layer. It's just another interesting part of my history, my family's history. And it feels great to celebrate it and share it.\"",

      "Last month, in an interview with Cincy Music, Sobule was asked about the changes she has seen in the recording business during her career. \"The demise of the music industry as we once knew it, hasn't been great,\" she said. \"Thinking of the sad-ass checks from Spotify. But it has also made one become creative in other endeavors. For example, musical theater.

      "Buzzi died Thursday at her home in Texas, her agent Mike Eisenstadt said in a statement. She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and was in hospice care. Shortly before her death, her husband, Kent Perkins, had posted a statement on Buzzi's Facebook page, thanking her many fans and telling them: \"She wants you to know she probably had more fun doing those shows than you had watching them.\"",

      "Buzzi enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse at age 17. Two years later, she traveled with singer Rudy Vallee in a musical and comedy act during her summer break. That earned her an Actors' Equity union card before she graduated from the playhouse's College of Theatre Arts.",

    "story": [
      "The National Institutes of Health has laid off hundreds more staff, multiple current and laid-off employees of the health agency told CBS News, including at its cancer research institute.",
      "Around 200 employees began receiving layoff notices Friday evening, said three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The move surprised NIH officials, since the department previously claimed no further cuts were planned at the agency.",
      "\"We thought the worst was behind us, and we were transitioning into this new phase, and the rug was just pulled out from underneath us,\" one laid-off employee said.",
      "A spokesperson for the NIH did not comment on why NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya sought the additional layoffs, referring an inquiry to the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH. An HHS spokesperson said that, after a review, the department had notified additional employees that they were \"also impacted\" by the layoffs plan announced in March.",
      "Fewer than 250 employees at the department received notices, the spokesperson said. An HHS official said that \"the same number of employees will be brought back in critical areas\" elsewhere at the department.",
      "Two people said they had been told that the second round of cuts was done as part of an effort to compensate for other scientists needing to be reinstated, in order to comply with layoff targets.",
      "\"The savings from these reductions will help redirect resources toward critical programs and strengthen our ability to serve the American people effectively. The goal is clear: reduce waste and maximize the impact of every taxpayer dollar,\" the HHS spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, said in a statement.",
      "Among the cuts on Friday were around 50 employees at the NIH's National Cancer Institute, or NCI. They had worked in the institute's\u00a0Office of Communications and Public Liaison\u00a0overseeing programs like the\u00a0Cancer Information Service, which provides answers to doctors and patients about cancer, and updates to databases\u00a0summarizing\u00a0cancer information for healthcare providers.",

    "story": [
      "Nearly all of the remaining staff at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health were laid off Friday, multiple officials and laid-off employees told CBS News, gutting programs ranging from approvals of new safety equipment to firefighter health.",
      "Much of the work at NIOSH, an arm of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had already stalled after an initial round of layoffs on April 1 at the agency ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "New requests for investigations of firefighter injuries and workplace health hazards had already stopped being accepted. A CDC plan to help Texas schools curb the spread of measles infections was also scrapped due to the layoffs.",
      "NIOSH was started in 1970 as part of the same law that created another federal agency called the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA. In addition to its own voluntary recommendations for employers, NIOSH produces research to inform OSHA's regulations and enforcement.",
      "NIOSH employees receiving layoff notices late Friday included some workers for the World Trade Center Health Program, miner safety, and firefighter health programs. Some workers for those programs had been asked to temporarily return to work for another month or two, after pleas from members of Congress.",
      "Among the layoffs to NIOSH's World Trade Center Health Program were nurses and scientists, two CDC officials said. Staff dealing with enrollment, member services and other administrative duties were also cut.",
      "Layoff notices received by workers Friday were almost identical to those received in the initial round of Kennedy's cuts, which said that their duties \"have been identified as either unnecessary or virtually identical to duties being performed elsewhere in the agency.\"",
      "The main difference with Friday's layoff notices was the date they take effect: workers are being put on leave until an official separation from service on July 2, instead of in June.",
      "The layoffs also stopped work at the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. This NIOSH division had been the government body tasked with vetting safety equipment like N95 masks and breathing devices used by emergency workers.",
      "The laboratory's respirator approval program had been in the middle of processing around 100 applications for personal protective equipment, one laid-off official said.",
      "Stalled work includes changes needed to meet new standards issued by the National Fire Protection Association for this year. No equipment is currently certified to meet those standards, nor has the agency been able to issue refunds to application fees paid for by manufacturers.",
      "Efforts to spot and warn of counterfeit personal protective equipment was also halted due to the layoffs, officials said.",
      "\"Millions of workers across various sectors - including healthcare, construction, and emergency services - depend on NIOSH-approved respirators. Without these approvals, their safety is compromised, leading to potential illness, injury, or even death,\" laid-off employees wrote in a letter shared with CBS News.",
      "HHS responds to NIOSH layoffs",
      "HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday, asking what would happen to the agency's work now that most of its teams had been eliminated. The department had previously said that NIOSH would be absorbed into a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "In\u00a0a post Saturday on X, the department said that firefighter programs were still a top priority and that as \"the agency continues to streamline operations, the essential services provided by NIOSH will remain fully intact and uninterrupted.\"",
      "The department also claimed no CDC employees had been terminated on Friday and only a \"required notice was sent to NIOSH employees, following the agreed-upon standard process with the union.\"",
      "Laid-off NIOSH workers told CBS News that the department's post was misleading, since workers represented by unions were still on the job until Friday, when they received letters from HHS informing them of the layoffs and that they would be locked out of the agency's buildings.",
      "That capped a process which started\u00a0in late March, after unions received a notice saying that most NIOSH employees could be cut by the end of June. In the past, unions could use that time to negotiate with the department, allowing employees to continue to work during talks that might mitigate or avoid a \"reduction in force\" of their members.",
      "However, unions were unable to initiate negotiations with Kennedy's department to head off the layoff notices Friday.\u00a0 An executive order issued by President Trump ended collective bargaining with unions representing the CDC and some other agencies, which is now being challenged in court.",

Between\u00a0Texas\u00a0and\u00a0New Mexico, at least 750 of the measles cases reported this year have been linked to that outbreak. Cases in\u00a0Oklahoma\u00a0and other states have also been linked to the outbreak.",

      "\"We look at the trends over time and we'd want to see several weeks of decline. New cases sometimes get reported to public health up to a week after someone was tested, especially if the test was done at a commercial lab,\" Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, told CBS News in a statement.",

      "\"Data show an increase in mortality rates for all people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and research shows that people with underlying conditions, including diabetes, are more likely to become very sick from COVID-19 and have a higher risk of hospitalization and death,\" Christopher Holliday, head of the CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation, told CBS News in a statement.",

      "The 100% clawback policy was directed by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to\u00a0cut costs\u00a0at the agency. Dudek said in a March 7 press release that the change was needed to \"properly safeguard taxpayer funds.\"",
      "The agency's move to recover overpayments has long been a pain point for thousands of beneficiaries who are overpaid each year, with many people unaware they had received a bigger benefit than they were entitled to until receiving notices from the Social Security Administration.",
      "The agency's inspector general found that 73,000 overpayments in 2022 were due to problems with Social Security's own calculations, rather than the fault of the beneficiary.",
      "\"SSA's automated systems could not compute benefit payments due in certain situations, and the Agency did not provide employees with a comprehensive tool to use when they had to manually calculate them. Without adequate automation tools, employees can make errors,\" the inspector general said in a report.",
      "Severe clawbacks cause hardship",
      "Last year, the Biden administration\u00a0capped the clawback rate\u00a0at 10% after reports that some seniors and disabled beneficiaries had been forced into financial hardship, including homelessness, due to the prior 100% clawback rate. But that 10% rate was only effective for about a year, with the the agency returning it to a 100% rate in March.",
      "Those most at risk from the government's stepped-up effort to recover overpayments are the roughly one-third of Social Security recipients who rely on their monthly benefit check for at least 75% of their income. Some seniors have told CBS News they were left\u00a0too financially strapped\u00a0to afford rent, food and other basics.",
      "Many of the overpayments involve disabled workers who receive payments through the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program, whose recipients receive an average of $1,538 per month, said Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.",
      "One SSA\u00a0report found that SSDI has a higher rate of overpayments than the overall Social Security program because disabled recipients sometimes fail to report work income, which can occur if they're not aware they need to disclose extra earnings to the agency. Social Security\u00a0reduces benefits for disabled recipients who earn more than $1,620 a month.",
      "\"While walking back the clawback of overpayments from 100% to 50% is a step in the right direction, taking half of the monthly benefit will still be a burden to many workers with disabilities who receive SSDI,\" Adcock told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"A fifth of all SSDI beneficiaries rely on their benefits for almost all of their income. That means some SSDI recipients are still going to have trouble paying for rent, food, utilities and prescriptions\" with the 50% clawback rate.",
      "The Social Security Administration docked the the benefits of about 670,000 recipients by 10% for overpayment last year, according to KFF.",
      "Under the new rule, the 50% clawback for overpayments started April 25, according to the SSA's statement.",

      "The Real ID deadline is rapidly approaching. Americans will be required to switch to the enhanced form of identification by Wednesday, May 7, if they want to travel by plane domestically.",
      "If you still need to update your ID you're not alone: CBS data shows that dozens of states are behind on compliance.",
      "An analysis conducted from April 7-18 found that 30 states are less than 70% compliant. Out of all states, New Jersey had the lowest compliance rate in the nation at 17%.",
      "Here's what you need to know to make sure you're ready for the May 7 Real ID deadline.",
      "What is a Real ID?",
      "The Real ID is a federally compliant license, learner permit or nondriver ID card issued by state driver's license agencies. You can tell if a state-issued license or ID card is a Real ID if it has a black or gold star in the upper right corner.",
      "The symbol might look slightly different depending on the state from where it's issued: California, for example, puts its star symbol inside a golden bear.",
      "Who needs a Real ID?",
      "Real or Enhanced IDs are required for those over 18 who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification, unless they want to bring a valid U.S. passport.",
      "When will I need to use a Real ID?",
      "Americans will need to show Real IDs to access certain federal facilities \u2014 including TSA checkpoints \u2014 enter nuclear power plants and board commercial aircraft, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).",
      "Am I required to get a Real ID?",
      "Real or Enhanced IDs are only required for those over 18 without a valid U.S. passport who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification.",
      "That's said, Real IDs are considered a more secure form of identification than a classic driver's license.",
      "The requirement for Real IDs was established by Congress in 2005, following the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that the Federal Government \"set standards for the issuance of sources of identification, such as driver's licenses,\" according to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The deadline for implementation has been delayed several times, although some states started issuing Real IDs as far back as 2009.",
      "You can find more details on Real ID on the DHS' website.",
      "Can I use an Enhanced ID instead of a Real ID?",
      "Five states \u2014 Washington, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Vermont \u2014 issue what is called an\u00a0Enhanced Driver's License\u00a0(EDL), or Enhanced ID. This is considered an acceptable alternative to a Real ID card.",
      "Whereas Real IDs have a star emblem, Enhanced IDs have an image of the U.S. flag in the top right corner or the word \"Enhanced\" at the top of the card.",
      "Both Real IDs and Enhanced IDs are federal documents that allow holders to fly domestically.",
      "Enhanced IDs also allow you to travel from the U.S. to Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean through a land or sea port of entry, without a passport \u2014 something you can't do with a regular Real ID.",
      "How much does a Real ID cost?",
      "Prices vary by state. In\u00a0New York, for example, there is no additional fee for a Real ID beyond the normal transactional cost you pay for a standard license, ID or renewal. Pennsylvania, however, charges a \"one-time $30 Real ID fee\" on top of standard renewal fees. New York charges an additional $30 fee for Enhanced IDs.",
      "It's best to check your state's Real ID guidelines for an accurate estimate of how much you'll pay. The same goes for Enhanced IDs.",
      "How do I get a real ID? Can I apply for one online?",
      "Each state has a driver's licensing agency that issues Real IDs. To find out how to apply where you live, visit the DHS website and click on your state of residence for specific instructions. DHS recommends that you visit your state's driver's licensing agency website to find out exactly what documentation you'll need to brings in order to obtain a REAL ID.",
      "Be sure to plan ahead as some states have longer wait times for DMV appointments.",
      "What if I plan to travel next week but I don't have a real ID yet?",
      "A TSA spokesperson told CBS News Philadelphia that if travelers show up to the airport next Wednesday without a Real ID they may still be able to fly, but getting on board the plane may take longer than usual. The transportation agency recommends that people without a Real ID arrive at the airport three hours early to ensure enough time to get through security.",
      "TSA said it's seeing about 81% compliance at airport checkpoints, meaning approximately four out of every five travelers are showing up with a Real ID-compliant driver's license or another valid form of identification.",
      "\"We don't have concerns at this point about this deadline really impacting operations, especially for those people who again are prepared and have everything they're supposed to have,\" Jessica Mayle, a public affairs specialist at TSA, told CBS Philadelphia.",
      "Are there alternative forms of identification I can use at the airport?",
      "If you don't have a Real ID, TSA has a list of other valid forms of identification you can use to get through an airport checkpoint. This includes passports, permanent resident cards, Enhanced IDs and Global Entry cards.",
      "Can I use a Real ID for international travel?",

    "story": [
      "Millions of student loan borrowers could face a wake-up call Monday as the Department of Education resumes collecting on school loans. The restart of collections comes as data from a recent analysis shows delinquency rates among people with student debt are at an all-time high.",
      "After nearly five-years since the U.S. government first paused federal student loan payments and interest accrual as a temporary relief measure during the COVID-19 pandemic, May 5 marks the first day the Education Department's\u00a0Office\u00a0of Federal Student Aid (FSA) restarts collections on defaulted federal student loans.",
      "Referrals for collection had been put on hold since March 2020 because of the pandemic.",
      "\"The level of concern here really depends on the reasons a borrower has not paid their federal student loans. If they don't have the capacity, they may be overstretched,\" Michele Raneri, vice president and head of research at TransUnion, said in a statement. \"They may not know they have to pay them, may not be able to find the information on how to do so, or may not have a willingness to pay for one reason or another,\" she said.",
      "Still, one in five borrowers is \"seriously delinquent\" or has a past-due payment of 90 days or more, according to a new analysis by TransUnion, one of the three major credit bureaus. The analysis looks at the percentage of student loan borrowers at risk of default and the impact that has on their credit scores.",
      "Those in default face an uphill battle: Failing to make a payment means\u00a0the government can withhold portions of Social Security benefits and tax refunds and garnish wages. Defaulting on a loan can also tank your credit score, which in turn can make it more difficult to obtain a loan in the future.",
      "Read on for more information about the state of student loan borrowing as default collections resume.",
      "Millions at risk of defaulting",
      "The credit bureau's findings underscore how student loan repayments have struggled to get back on track since COVID-19. Payments on student loans were\u00a0paused\u00a0in March 2020 and didn't\u00a0resume\u00a0until October 2023.",
      "For borrowers across the U.S. who didn't have to worry about making payments for years, the resumption of student loan payments\u00a0presented a challenge\u00a0for many individuals struggling financially.",
      "Out of the 19.6 million student loan borrowers, TransUnion found that roughly 20% are at risk of defaulting. The figure \u2014 which TransUnion estimates could be much higher \u2014 outpaces the credit bureau's previously recorded all-time high of 15.4% in 2012.",
      "For its analysis, TransUnion looked at those susceptible to being 90-days past due on their loans. That winnowed the field of borrowers from roughly 42 million to a total of 19.6 million borrowers. Excluded from this report were people in deferment or forbearance, as well as private student loan borrowers.",
      "As the federal student aid\u00a0website\u00a0outlines, loan servicers can report borrowers who are behind on their loans for 90 days or more to the national credit bureaus.",
      "On average, people who faced default lost an average of 63 points, TransUnion found, although those with higher credit scores were at risk if losing much more. Those in \"super prime\" credit territory \u2014 defined by a spokesperson for TransUnion as a credit score of 781 or higher \u2014 saw an average credit score decline of 175 points as a result of impending student loan defaults.",
      "\"Borrowers can review their credit report to see what loan servicers are reporting,\" Raneri told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This can also help people find who to contact if they have a loan they didn't expect to see.\"",
      "To minimize student loan defaults, prioritizing income-driven repayment (IDR) plans \u2014 which tabulate the monthly payment based on what someone makes and their family size \u2014 along with better outreach to borrowers and automation could go a long way, Pew Charitable Trusts says in an online\u00a0post.",
      "\"Data-sharing could also be used to automatically enroll borrowers into an IDR plan if they fall severely behind on payments, a move that could significantly curb future defaults by connecting borrowers with affordable payments,\"\u00a0wrote\u00a0Regan Fitzgerald, senior manager; Brian Denten, officer; and Ilan Levine, senior associate at Pew's Student Loan Initiative.",
      "All told, the nation's nearly 43 million student loan borrowers hold a collective $1.6 trillion in debt, according to the Education Department. Agency\u00a0data indicates that over 5 million of these borrowers have not made a monthly payment in over 360 days, while only 38% are on track with their repayment plans.",
      "Secretary of Education: Long overdue",
      "Student loan collections were upended during the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, during President Trump's first term in office, the Education Department paused student loan payments and knocked interest rates to zero to give borrowers some breathing room.",
      "When former President Biden took office in 2021, he extended the loan repayment deadline multiple times until Congress passed a law directing payments to resume in October 2023. The Biden administration made several attempts to deliver a student loan debt relief during his time in office, but his efforts were stymied by courts.",
      "While student loan repayments resumed over a year and a half ago, Monday, May 5, is the first day since March 2020 the Department of Education is collecting repayments from borrowers who have struggled to meet their payment deadlines. For U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, the return is long overdue.",
      "\"American taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,\" said McMahon in an April statement. \"The Biden Administration misled borrowers: The executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe debt away, nor do the loan balances simply disappear. Hundreds of billions have already been transferred to taxpayers.\"",

      "President Trump in February said he would eliminate the loophole because he didn't believe China was taking sufficient action to stem the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump in April signed an executive order eliminating the duty-free treatment for low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2. As of Friday, packages that would have qualified for exemption under the de minimis provision will \"be subject to all applicable duties,\" the executive order states.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump called the de minimis exemption \"a big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses.\"",
      "\"We put an end to it,\" he said.",
      "Goods from China are subject to new tariffs of up to 145%, while Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on goods from the U.S.",
      "What does the end of the exemption mean for consumers?",
      "Retailers are already tacking on hefty tariff surcharges to customers' orders, leading to sticker shock for some U.S. shoppers who had long relied on China for cheap imported goods.",
      "\"The way we shop online will never be the same,\" Ram Ben Tzion, CEO of Publican, a company that authenticates shipment documentation, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Specifically, \"everything will take more time, cost more money, and everything that's price-sensitive won't be available,\" he said.",
      "The rise of trade between the U.S. and China allowed for a much greater variety of goods to enter U.S. markets. But the end of the loophole will lead to a \"much diminished market,\" said Mary Lovely, an international trade expert and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "If prices of Chinese goods rise, there will be less demand, and sellers could decide to import fewer goods.",
      "\"You'll see much diminished market and at some point it won't be worth it to import to a small market,\" so you'll see products disappearing, Lovely said.",
      "Could the new rule cause delays?",
      "Requiring millions more packages to be inspected daily will create a challenge for CBP, experts noted.",
      "\"It will be an administrative nightmare, so you will see a lot of delays,\" Ryan Young, a trade policy expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "It's unclear if the government has enough CBP agents to efficiently inspect packages and enforce policies, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"As these adjustments are made, a key question remains, which is the ability of CBP to effectively regulate and enforce these measures,\" Ben Tzion said. \"As of today. CBP does not have that ability.\"",
      "\"Without personnel, you'll have backlogs and pile ups and U.S. customs might have to get more warehousing space,\" Young added.",
      "Who might benefit?",
      "Companies that sell goods made in the U.S. could face less competition as previously cheap China-made goods rise to new price highs.",
      "\"Consumers could become more wary of foreign brands to avoid paying hefty prices,\" Ines Durand, a retail strategist at Similarweb, a web analytics company.",
      "Larger corporations with bigger profit margins, or more diversified businesses, will likely fare better than smaller retailers that operate on thin profit margins, making it difficult to re-jigger supply chains.",

Small businesses do not have the margin or capital reserves to survive an increase in tariffs, Clark wrote in the letter.",
      "\"The Chamber requests the administration take immediate action to save America's small businesses and stave off a recession,\" she wrote.",
      "The Trump administration's tariff policies are already weighing on growth and have\u00a0raised the chances\u00a0of a recession over the next 12 months, according to economists. Still, the International Monetary Fund\u00a0said\u00a0in April it does not expect the U.S. to enter a recession in 2025.",
      "Clark added that tariffs could cause \"irreparable harm\" to the small business community if trade deals are not reached soon. Products from most countries are subject a 10% tariff, while products from China face a much steeper levy of up to 145%.",
      "In an interview with Time\u00a0magazine last week, President Trump said that trade deals would be reached in the \"next three to four weeks.\" In the meantime, small businesses are being forced to make difficult decisions about how to operate amid uncertainty as a result of on-and-off tariffs.

    "summary": "In recent weeks, Social Security has been plagued by problems related to technology, system errors, and even the marking of living people as dead.",
    "story": [
      "Rennie Glasgow, who has served 15 years at the Social Security Administration, is seeing something new on the job: dead people.",
      "They're not really dead, of course. In four instances over the past few weeks, he told KFF Health News, his Schenectady, New York, office has seen people come in for whom \"there is no information on the record, just that they are dead.\" So employees have to \"resurrect\" them \u2014 affirm that they're living, so they can receive their benefits.",
      "Revivals were \"sporadic\" before, and there's been an uptick in such cases across upstate New York, said Glasgow. He is also an official with the American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represented 42,000 Social Security employees just before the start of President Trump's second term.",
      "Martin O'Malley, who led the Social Security Administration toward the end of the Biden administration, said in an interview that he had heard similar stories during a recent town hall in Racine, Wisconsin. \"In that room of 200 people, two people raised their hands and said they each had a friend who was wrongly marked as deceased when they're very much alive,\" he said.",
      "It's more than just an inconvenience, because other institutions rely on Social Security numbers to do business, Glasgow said. Being declared dead \"impacts their bank account. This impacts their insurance. This impacts their ability to work. This impacts their ability to get anything done in society.\"",
      "\"They are terminating people's financial lives,\" O'Malley said.",
      "Though it's just one of the things advocates and lawyers worry about, these erroneous deaths come after a pair of initiatives from new leadership at the SSA to alter or update its databases of the living and the dead.",
      "Holders of millions of Social Security numbers have been marked as deceased. Separately, according to The Washington Post and The New York Times, thousands of numbers belonging to immigrants have been purged, cutting them off from banks and commerce, in an effort to encourage these people to \"self-deport.\"",
      "Glasgow said SSA employees received an agency email in April about the purge, instructing them how to resurrect beneficiaries wrongly marked dead. \"Why don't you just do due diligence to make sure what you're doing in the first place is correct?\" he said.",
      "The incorrectly marked deaths are just a piece of the Trump administration's crash program purporting to root out fraud, modernize technology, and secure the program's future.",
      "But KFF Health News' interviews with more than a dozen beneficiaries, advocates, lawyers, current and former employees, and lawmakers suggest the overhaul is making the agency worse at its primary job: sending checks to seniors, orphans, widows, and those with disabilities.",
      "Philadelphian Lisa Seda, who has cancer, has been struggling for weeks to sort out her 24-year-old niece's difficulties with Social Security's disability insurance program. There are two problems: first, trying to change her niece's address; second, trying to figure out why the program is deducting roughly $400 a month for Medicare premiums, when her disability lawyer \u2014 whose firm has a policy against speaking on the record \u2014 believes they could be zero.",
      "Since March, sometimes Social Security has direct-deposited payments to her niece's bank account and other times mailed checks to her old address. Attempting to sort that out has been a morass of long phone calls on hold and in-person trips seeking an appointment.",
      "Before 2025, getting the agency to process changes was usually straightforward, her lawyer said. Not anymore.",
      "The need is dire. If the agency halts the niece's disability payments, \"then she will be homeless,\" Seda recalled telling an agency employee. \"I don't know if I'm going to survive this cancer or not, but there is nobody else to help her.\"",
      "Some of the problems are technological. According to whistleblower information provided to Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, the agency's efforts to process certain data have been failing more frequently. When that happens, \"it can delay or even stop payments to Social Security recipients,\" the committee recently told the agency's inspector general.",
      "While tech experts and former Social Security officials warn about the potential for a complete system crash, day-to-day decay can be an insidious and serious problem, said Kathleen Romig, formerly of the Social Security Administration and its advisory board and currently the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Beneficiaries could struggle to get appointments or the money they're owed, she said.",
      "For its more than 70 million beneficiaries nationwide, Social Security is crucial. More than a third of recipients said they wouldn't be able to afford necessities if the checks stopped coming, according to a January survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance.",
      "Advocates and lawyers say lately Social Security is failing to deliver, to a degree that's nearly unprecedented in their experience.",
      "Carolyn Villers, executive director of the Massachusetts Senior Action Council, said two of her members' March payments were several days late. \"For one member that meant not being able to pay rent on time,\" she said. \"The delayed payment is not something I've heard in the last 20 years.\"",
      "When KFF Health News presented the agency with questions, Social Security officials passed them off to the White House. White House spokesperson Elizabeth Huston referred to Mr. Trump's \"resounding mandate\" to make government more efficient.",
      "\"He has promised to protect social security, and every recipient will continue to receive their benefits,\" Huston said in an email. She did not provide specific, on-the-record responses to questions.",
      "Complaints about missed payments are mushrooming. The Arizona attorney general's office had received approximately 40 complaints related to delayed or disrupted payments by early April, spokesperson Richie Taylor told KFF Health News.",
      "A Connecticut agency assisting people on Medicare said complaints related to Social Security \u2014 which often helps administer payments and enroll patients in the government insurance program primarily for those over age 65 \u2014 had nearly doubled in March compared with last year.",
      "Lawyers representing beneficiaries say that, while the historically underfunded agency has always had its share of errors and inefficiencies, it's getting worse as experienced employees have been let go.",
      "\"We're seeing more mistakes being made,\" said James Ratchford, a lawyer in West Virginia with 17 years' experience representing Social Security beneficiaries. \"We're seeing more things get dropped.\"",
      "What gets dropped, sometimes, are records of basic transactions. Kim Beavers of Independence, Missouri, tried to complete a periodic ritual in February: filling out a disability update form saying she remains unable to work. But her scheduled payments in March and April didn't show.",
      "She got an in-person appointment to untangle the problem \u2014 only to be told there was no record of her submission, despite her showing printouts of the relevant documents to the agency representative. Beavers has a new appointment scheduled for May, she said.",
      "Social Security employees frequently cite missing records to explain their inability to solve problems when they meet with lawyers and beneficiaries. A disability lawyer whose firm's policy does not allow them to be named had a particularly puzzling case: One client, a longtime Social Security disability recipient, had her benefits reassessed. After winning on appeal, the lawyer went back to the agency to have the payments restored \u2014 the recipient had been going without since February. But there was nothing there.",
      "\"To be told they've never been paid benefits before is just chaos, right? Unconditional chaos,\" the lawyer said.",

      "Some 7,000 SSA employees have reportedly been let go; O'Malley has estimated that 3,000 more would leave the agency. \"As the workloads go up, the demoralization becomes deeper, and people burn out and leave,\" he predicted in an April hearing held by House Democrats. \"It's going to mean that if you go to a field office, you're going to see a heck of a lot more empty, closed windows.\"",

He had previously said he didn't want to retire because he enjoys figuring out where to invest Berkshire's money too much, and that he planned to continue working until he dies or becomes incapacitated.",
      "Buffett said he will recommend to Berkshire Hathaway's board that Greg Abel should become CEO at the end of the year.",
      "\"I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the Chief Executive office of the company at year end,\" Buffett said. \"I want to spring that on the directors effectively, and then get that as my recommendation ... I think they'll be unanimously in favor of it.\"",

      "While Buffett said it is best for trade to be balanced between countries, he doesn't think Mr. Trump is going about it the right way with his widespread tariffs. He said the world will be safer if more countries are prosperous.",
      "\"We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best,\" he said.",
      "America has been going through revolutionary changes ever since its birth and the promise of equality for all, which wasn't fulfilled until years later, Buffett said. But nothing that is going on today has changed his long-term optimism about the country.",
      "\"If I were being born today, I would just keep negotiating in the womb until they said, 'You could be in the United States,'\" Buffett said.",
      "Tariffs were the top subject that shareholders asked about in the questions they sent ahead of time to the CNBC reporter who will grill Buffett and his top two managers throughout the day. But investors will also be looking for him to explain why he is sitting on $347.7 billion in cash at Berkshire.",
      "Buffett said he just doesn't see many attractively priced investments that he understands these days, but he predicted that one day Berkshire will be \"bombarded with opportunities that we will be glad we have the cash for.\"",

      "The startup, called World (formerly Worldcoin), is launching in the U.S. with the distribution of 20,000 tech devices called Orbs that scan a person's retina to verify they are human. After confirming a person's humanity, World then creates a digital ID for users that proves their personhood, distinguishing them from a bot or AI program that can mimic human behavior.",
      "The device, which looks like something out of \"Black Mirror,\" may seem ironic coming from Altman, given that its purpose is to help people stand out from the very same types of technology he helped develop. But World's backers say the Orb and its \"proof of personhood\" is addressing a problem that can stymie everything from finance to online dating: bots impersonating people.",
      "The Orb \"is a privacy-first way to prove you are a human in the world of AI and bots,\" said Jake Brukhman, co-founder of CoinFund, one of the project's earliest backers. \"That is getting relevant as AI is becoming much more prevalent in the world.\"",

      "World isn't exactly new, as it debuted outside the U.S. in 2023 and has already sparked privacy backlash, with Kenya's government shutting down the service, according to the Associated Press. Other jurisdictions followed suit, including Hong Kong and Spain.",
      "\"I will say that upon the launch in 2023 there was a lot of noise about this,\" Brukhman said. \"But a lot of noise came from the lack of understanding about the Orb and how it works.\"",
      "The Orb doesn't store any biometric data, he added. The device takes photos to ensure a person is human, but then stores that info on the user's device, not in the Orb, according to World's website.",
      "World also has a link to cryptocurrencies, as the Orb's human-verification process is designed to be used in the World App, which is a digital wallet that gives people access to decentralized finance and cryptocurrencies.",
      "The time is right for a rollout in the U.S., Brukhman said, with expectations of looser crypto regulations under Trump administration. President Trump, who has vowed to turn the U.S. into the cryptocurrency capital of the world, is working on a \"crypto strategic reserve\" for the nation.",
      "The Orbs will be rolled out in stores in six U.S. cities, including Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nashville, Miami and San Francisco, as well as at gaming retailer Razer, with the idea that people can go to physical locations to get themselves verified as human.",

But look closely enough and there are hints, like the slight decline in manufacturing payrolls and another drop in federal government jobs,\" Elyse Ausenbaugh, head of investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management, said in an email.",
      "Although the latest employment numbers suggest a steady job market, government data this week showed that more Americans are filing for unemployment benefits as layoffs mount. Jobless claims increased 18,000 to 241,000 for the week ending April 26, the highest level since mid-February, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "\"Continued claims are more volatile week to week, but remain elevated, signaling that workers who lose their job are facing challenges in finding new employment,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "In another important snapshot of the economy this week, the nation's gross domestic product shrank 0.3% in the first three months of the year, down from growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter. The main reason for the sharp decline was the rush by consumers and businesses to order imported goods ahead of tariffs taking effect (Imports reduce GDP, while exports increase it.)",
      "What experts are saying",
      "Experts say the economy has proved resilient, with steady hiring despite concern over the Trump administration's trade policies. A recession appears unlikely for now, although economists note it could take several months for tariff-induced instability to appear in the government's monthly job numbers.",
      "\"Some of the increase in employment in April... reflects a burst of pre-tariff activity, which will unravel over the next couple months,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a research note.",
      "Soft data like consumer confidence survey,\u00a0polling\u00a0and jobless claims show signs of economic weakness.",
      "The solid job gains in April also increase the odds that the Federal Reserve will keep its benchmark interest rate steady when policy makers meet next week on May 6-7, experts say.",
      "\"The healthy 177,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in April and unchanged unemployment rate will reassure the Fed that there is no need to be hasty in lowering interest rates when it meets next week,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a report.",

      "Guangzhou, China\u00a0\u2014 The annual Canton Fair in Guangzhou is China's largest import-export trade show. It covers a space equal to about 200 football fields and has been running since 1957 \u2014 when China's economy was isolated from the rest of the world. The country's leaders decided the expo, since formally named the China Import and Export Fair, was the best way to overcome trade obstacles imposed by the West and to drum up business investment and interest from overseas markets.",
      "In the almost seven decades since, China has transformed into the world's manufacturing powerhouse. But President Xi Jinping's government believes the U.S. is once again working to isolate China, through President Trump's tariff trade war, and that Washington will try to force other countries \u2014 and their consumers \u2014 to pick a side.",
      "Richard Qiu told CBS News it's simply unfair. Wearing a pale blue Ralph Lauren shirt, the businessman invited CBS News to sit down in his display booth at the Canton Fair for a chat. Surrounded by thousands of small fabric gift bags designed for everything from Christmas to Easter to birthdays, the fact that Qiu even quickly agreed to an interview was disarming; Every other Chinese businessperson we approached turned our camera away, wary of speaking with foreign media.",
      "His openness and warmth indicated a sense of ease with Westerners, and more importantly, his desire to tell his story about how external forces, completely out of his control, were affecting him and his livelihood.",
      "Qiu's Liaoning Perfect Import/Export Co. Ltd has been making gift bags for 20 years, and he has fostered strong relationships with his U.S. customers, who, in recent years, have made up 30-40% of his exports. He's traveled to the U.S. at least six times and says he loves the country: \"It's about freedom, democracy, it's open and fair.\"",
      "\"But this isn't fair,\" he said of the trade war sparked by President Trump's steep tariffs. \"It makes me feel sick about the U.S. now.\"",
      "Mr. Trump insists his tariffs will, despite current economic pain in the U.S., bring manufacturing back to America and buoy the economy, reshaping the global trade system. But Qiu said it's about something else. He believes President Trump is punishing China for being the best at producing everyday products at affordable prices, and using that prowess to dominate the global market.",
      "\"Our people are industrious, diligent, working hard to make the products good price, good quality, to sell all over the world. It's not our problem,\" he said. \"I think it's your problem.\"",
      "Since Mr. Trump imposed 145% tariffs on all Chinese imports \u2014 though the White House later exempted smartphones and some other electronics from the levies \u2014 Qiu says his U.S. sales have ground to a halt.",
      "\"U.S. buyers said, 'Richard you have to stop production; we have to cancel it.' I think 90% of my U.S. orders will be canceled.\"",
      "For years, the Canton Fair has been packed with American buyers looking to bring their customers back at home the best possible deals on offer. But this year, officials admitted to CBS News that the numbers are way down \u2014 another sign of President Trump's trade war taking hold.",
      "One American we did come across perusing the stalls in Guangzhou wasn't there to buy, but rather to research new products.",
      "\"Tariffs are going to come down at some point and we need to be ready for it,\" Jonathan Scheerz who lives in Michigan, where he runs a homewares business, told CBS News. He said he got a lot of orders in for products from China before Mr. Trump's inauguration, because he was anticipating a trade war \u2014 but not like this.",
      "\"I don't want to bring them in at the current tariff rate,\" he lamented. \"It just doesn't work. It's too high, but I also don't believe it's going to last months and months.\"",
      "The optimism is based on his belief that no one does it better than China when it comes to offering so many different products at such low prices.",
      "\"In my eyes, China produces what you want,\" Scheerz said. \"Simple as that.\"",
      "But if the trade war does drag on, many business owners who spoke with CBS News off camera said they were prepared to take the pain.",
      "Qiu knows tough days are ahead. He's looking to diversify his export portfolio in Europe, but there's only so much the market can absorb, so it's uncertain times.",
      "\"It's like a war, I think. Under a war, the most suffering is the people, no matter if it's the U.S. or China,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Qiu added, however, that over the course of China's history, the country has endured real hardship and pain, and he believes the Chinese people have the strength and fortitude to do it again.",
      "\"If we do something unfair, I will not support the government, but it's your government \u2014 the U.S. government that's put unfair things on us, so we say, 'okay, we fight.'\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-minerals-deal-trump-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Fri, 02 May 2025 07:02:15 -0400",
    "summary": "The joint economic investment between the U.S. and Ukraine comes after China restricted exports of some rare earth minerals to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The joint economic investment deal announced Wednesday that gives the U.S. access to Ukrainian minerals may provide Ukraine with more support for its defense against Russia. But it also comes at a key moment for the American economy amid its growing trade war with China, a major producer of rare earths and other critical minerals.",
      "The new deal was described by Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economic development minister, as an equal partnership between the U.S. and Ukraine that\u00a0includes development of\u00a0mineral, oil and gas projects. The U.S. will provide either direct financial assistance or new military assistance to Ukraine, which will contribute half of any royalties from future oil, gas and mineral licenses.",
      "The pact comes as America's access to rare earth minerals, which are key to manufacturing high-tech products like computer chips and military equipment, has diminished after China last month announced export restrictions on some of these minerals in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. Although Mr. Trump has suggested buying Greenland, which has rare earths and critical minerals as well as oil and natural gas, Ukraine may provide a more readily available source for these strategically vital natural resources, experts say.",
      "\"You hear a lot about Greenland, but that is a very, very long term play with a lot of building up of infrastructure and a lot of ice-melting, to be fair,\" Heidi Crebo-Rediker, an expert with the Council on Foreign Relations, told CBS News.",
      "By contrast, Ukraine has the workforce and the metallurgical know-how to extract and develop these rare earth minerals, she added. Here's what to know about the U.S.' deal with Ukraine.",
      "What does the U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal cover?",
      "The deal covers minerals, including rare earth elements, but also other valuable resources, including oil and natural gas, according to the text released by Ukraine's government.",
      "It does not include resources that currently generate revenue for the Ukrainian state. In other words, any profits under the deal are dependent on the success of new American investments.",
      "Ukrainian officials have also noted that the deal does not refer to any debt obligations for Kyiv, meaning profits are unlikely to go toward paying the U.S. back for its previous financial support for the country in its war with Russia, according to Svyrydenko.",
      "The text of the deal lists 55 minerals subject to the U.S-Ukraine agreement, but says more can be added to the pact. Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in Ukraine's rare earth elements, and some of them are included in the list, as are other critical minerals, including titanium, lithium and uranium.",
      "What are rare earth minerals?",
      "Rare earth minerals are a set of 17 metallic elements, such as scandium and yttrium, according to U.S. Geological Survey. Scandium is used in aluminum alloys for aerospace parts, while yttrium is used in LEDs and solid oxide fuel cells, according to Stanford Advanced Materials, a scandium supplier.",
      "China is the the world's largest producer of rare earths, data from the Geological Survey shows.",
      "Aside from rare earth minerals, China also dominates production of critical minerals such as lithium and graphite, which are both essential for producing batteries used in electric vehicles and other devices.",
      "How large are Ukraine's mineral reserves?",
      "Ukraine holds about 5% of total global mineral reserves, which include both critical minerals and rare earth elements, according to Capital Economics, which cited the Ukrainian Geological Survey.",
      "\"Monetary estimates of Ukraine's reserves vary wildly. However, there is a lot of skepticism over the accuracy of Ukraine's national estimates given they reportedly rely on outdated Soviet-era assessments,\" Capital Economics said in a May 1 research note.",
      "Currently, Ukraine's critical minerals generate less than $200 million in annual export revenues, analysts with the investment advisory firm said. \"[T]he reality is that most of Ukraine's mineral reserves are unlikely to be economically viable, especially in the near term,\" they added.",
      "Ukraine has large deposits of cobalt and nickel, which are important for high-performance batteries, Crebo-Rediker said.",
      "What's happening with China's minerals?",
      "China placed new restrictions on seven heavy rare earth minerals on April 4, including scandium and yttrium, in retaliation against U.S. tariffs.",
      "\"Beijing has a history of responding to measures such as tariffs and tech controls from Washington by imposing curbs on exports of raw materials to the U.S.,\" Capital Economics analysts wrote in a May 1 report.",
      "They added, \"Under President Trump, it seems that developing alternative sources of supply will remain a key priority, which could limit any disruption to supply chains from geopolitics in the medium term and reduce Western reliance on China and its allies.\"",
      "China has a \"a near complete chokehold on another important critical material \u2014 graphite,\" Crebo-Rediker added. \"Ukraine is the fifth-largest producer of graphite and also gallium, which is restricted by China right now.\"",
      "What is the state of Ukraine's minerals industry?",
      "Ukraine's rare earth elements are largely untapped because of state policies regulating the industry, a lack of good information about deposits and the war with Russia. The industry's potential is also unclear given that mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate, according to analysts.",
      "In general, however, Ukraine's natural resources are considered to have signifiant commercial potential. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe's largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe's largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian minerals industry accounted for 6.1% of the country's gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it's in Mr. Trump's interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",

    "summary": "Starbucks plans to hire more baristas at thousands of stores starting in May as the coffee chain looks to improve customer service.",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks is rethinking the role of \"innovation\" in running a coffee chain.",
      "After rolling out a new system of technical enhancements to streamline cold food and drink orders, the company made an abrupt U-turn this week and said it would halt use of its automated equipment and restore the human touch by bringing more baristas on board.",
      "The reboot comes at a delicate time for the restaurant giant, which is under pressure to boost sales and revive a brand that has lost its luster with some customers. Although Starbucks remains profitable, its sales slowed last year. In the company's most recent quarter its revenues rose 2% to $8.7 billion, falling just short of Wall Street analysts' forecasts of $8.8 billion.",
      "In a bid to win back customers, starting in May Starbucks will expand its \"Green Apron service model\" which will involve hiring new baristas at thousands of locations and fine-tuning an algorithm to manage orders, CEO Brian Niccol said on a call with Wall Street analysts earlier this week.",
      "\"What we've learned over the last couple of months, specifically behind both the algorithm pilot and the labor pilot, is the combination of staffing, deployment and technology gives us the outcomes of a great customer connection experience as well as the right speed and throughput associated with what we want to achieve, both in-cafe, mobile order and drive-thru,\" Niccol said.",
      "What is the Siren system?",
      "Named after the\u00a0twin-tailed mermaid\u00a0that serves as the face of the company's branding, the Siren system is a series of hot and cold food equipment that Starbucks started rolling out in 2022 to \"make crafting beverages and food more straightforward\" for workers, according to the coffee chain's website. The Siren System is installed in less than 10% of U.S. company operated stores, according to a Starbucks spokesperson.",
      "Building on that platform, Starbucks unveiled the Siren Craft System in July 2024. The technology is aimed at streamlining beverage and food preparation, shortening wait times, and helping baristas deal with the daily flood of orders, including the speciality concoctions the coffee chain has become known for, according to Starbucks.",
      "Less than a year later, however, Niccol said the company will halt its deployment of the Siren tech and instead invest more in labor. Focusing on expanding its workforce, the company said, has proven more effective than implementing new tech when it comes to driving growth.",
      "\"It's not that we're not going to ever use the Siren system,\" Niccol said in the earnings call. \"It's just not something that we need to be rolling out across all 10,000 stores.\"",
      "Starbucks will bring more baristas on board this year at thousands of locations and allow employees to pick up extra shifts, the Starbucks CEO said. The company's hope is that small personal touches \u2014 like handwritten notes from baristas on their cups and ceramic to-stay mugs \u2014 will keep customers coming in the door and entice them to stay longer.",
      "\"What we're discovering is the equipment doesn't solve the customer experience that we need to provide, but rather staffing the stores and deploying with this technology behind it does,\" Niccol said.",
      "To be sure, Starbucks isn't turning its back on tech. While Siren is taking a backseat, the CEO also said the company is testing a new sequencing algorithm that has lowered drive-thru and in-store wait times to less than four minutes.",
      "Starbucks\u00a0employs around 361,000 workers worldwide, according to\u00a0The Associated Press. In February, the coffee chain\u00a0announced\u00a0it would lay off 1,100 corporate employees, about 7% of all its white-collar workforce. This did not include baristas who service the stores.",
      "How much do baristas earn?",
      "Starbucks baristas earn an average of $19 an hour, according to a spokesperson. The company also offers health care, retirement and other benefits, distinguishing it from many retailers.",
      "\"When you factor in benefits, our comprehensive compensation package averages $30 per hour,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Starbucks' automation push was part of a larger effort to draw more customers to its stores, known as the \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy. After enjoying years of rapid growth, the company's progress has stalled, with U.S. same-store sales slipping 2% last year.",
      "Looking for a refresh, the company in 2024 brought Niccol \u2014 a highly regarded restaurant industry veteran who as CEO of Chipotle had helped the fast-casual chain more than double its business \u2014 in as chief executive.",
      "In coming aboard in September, Niccol promised\u00a0to elevate the in-store experience, reduce wait times and boost sales. \"It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers and return to growth,\" Niccol\u00a0said\u00a0during a call with analysts last year.",

      "A 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. took effect on April 3. President Trump announced on Tuesday that he would provide some relief to U.S. automakers by ensuring they are not also levied with 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum.",

      "The two-page letter to the university's president calls out what the administration views as Harvard's \"systemic pattern of violating federal law.\" McMahon accuses Harvard of ignoring antisemitism, engaging in discrimination, abandoning \"any semblance of academic rigor\" and \"disastrous mismanagement.\"",
      "\"The above concerns are only a fraction of the long list of Harvard's consistent violations of its own legal duties,\" McMahon wrote. \"Given these and other concerning allegations, this letter is to inform you that Harvard should no longer seek GRANTS from the federal government, since none will be provided.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has approached far-flung countries to aid its mass deportation effort, asking nations like Angola and Equatorial Guinea to accept migrants who are not their citizens, according to internal federal government documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "The talks are part of an intense diplomatic campaign by the Trump administration to convince as many nations as possible \u2014 including those with controversial human rights records \u2014 to receive deportees from the U.S., such as migrants whose home countries won't take them back.",
      "The administration has already brokered agreements with several Latin American countries willing to accept migrants who are not their own. In February, the U.S. deported hundreds of African and Asian migrants to Costa Rica and Panama. In March, the Trump administration sent nearly 300 Venezuelans accused of being gang members to El Salvador, which imprisoned them at an infamous mega-prison.",
      "Guatemala has also agreed to take in third country deportees from the U.S. The Mexican government, under a deal that preceded Mr. Trump's second term, has been receiving migrants from other Latin American countries, like Venezuela, caught crossing the U.S. southern border illegally.",
      "But behind the scenes, the Trump administration has been negotiating with countries outside of the Western Hemisphere to send migrants thousands of miles away, across the Atlantic Ocean, to places in Africa and Europe.",
      "The Eastern Hemisphere countries that the Trump administration has identified as places that could potentially accept deportations of third country nationals include Angola, Benin, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Libya, Moldova and Rwanda, according to the internal government documents and officials. The U.S. has yet to announce any formal deals with these nations.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported on the internal talks with some of these countries in April. The negotiations with Angola and Equatorial Guinea have not been previously reported.",
      "It's unclear who exactly would be sent to the third countries if any deportation arrangements are finalized. But one of the ideas under consideration, the internal government documents show, would be for the U.S. to use the agreements to deport suspected members of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang Mr. Trump has made into a focal point of his crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "How deportees would be treated by governments that are not their own is also an open question. As part of its arrangement with El Salvador, for example, the U.S. agreed to give the Salvadoran government millions of dollars to detain Venezuelans deemed to be Tren de Aragua members.",
      "Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security referred questions about the deportation negotiations, and how the potential agreements would work, to the Department of State, which did not immediately comment on CBS News' reporting.",
      "The embassies of Benin, Eswatini, Libya, Moldova and Rwanda did not respond to requests for comment. A representative for the embassy of Equatorial Guinea said the \"Embassy is not aware of any such conversations going on between the two governments.\"",
      "On Monday, after CBS News published its story, a spokesperson for the Angolan Embassy in the U.S. said, \"Angola has stated that it is not accepting deported individuals of other nationalities.\"",
      "In recent years, Western countries bedeviled by migration crises and the accompanying political backlash have sought to forge diplomatic agreements that allow them to re-route migrants and asylum-seekers to third countries.",
      "The first Trump administration convinced El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to sign \"safe third country\" deals that allowed the U.S. to divert migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border to those countries; though only one of the deals was implemented before they were scrapped by the Biden administration.",
      "In 2022, the United Kingdom brokered a \"safe third country\" deal with Rwanda, but it was ultimately discontinued amid intense controversy and legal challenges. Under another arrangement, Albania agreed to host migrants in Italian custody, though that effort has been partially blocked by judges.",
      "Andrew Selee, the president of the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based research group, said there are many legal, political and humanitarian questions about the agreements the Trump administration is considering, including whether the U.S. will try to ensure deportees are not mistreated in the receiving countries.",
      "A court ruling from April prohibited the Trump administration from sending deportees to a third country without informing them of the destination and allowing them to be screened for any concerns they have about being harmed there.",
      "But Selee said the deportation deals, even if they're limited in scope or held up in court, are principally designed to deter migrants from entering or staying in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"It sends a message that will scare off people from coming unauthorized to the U.S.,\" Selee said. \"And it allows them to say that they can deport people from any nationality somewhere.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 19:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration said a lawsuit involving the abortion pill mifepristone that was brought by three GOP-led states should be dismissed.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Monday urged a federal district court to dismiss a lawsuit challenging the Food and Drug Administration's actions expanding access to the widely used abortion pill mifepristone.",
      "Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing with the U.S. district court in Amarillo, Texas, that the three states pursuing the lawsuit \u2014 Missouri, Idaho and Kansas \u2014 should not be able to do so in that court. The administration is pursuing a request initially made by the Biden administration last year in the closely watched challenge to mifepristone, a drug used to terminate an early pregnancy, that has been playing out before U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk.",
      "\"At bottom, the states cannot keep alive a lawsuit in which the original plaintiffs were held to lack standing, those plaintiffs have now voluntarily dismissed their claims, and the states' own claims have no connection to this district,\" Trump administration lawyers wrote. \"The states are free to pursue their claims in a district where venue is proper, but the states' claims before this court must be dismissed or transferred pursuant to the venue statute's mandatory command.\"",
      "The legal battle over mifepristone was initially filed by a group of anti-abortion rights doctors and medical associations in November 2022. The coalition sought to roll back a series of changes made by the FDA that relaxed the rules for the drug's use. But the Supreme Court last year rejected that challenge and unanimously ruled that the plaintiffs did not have the legal right to sue, a concept known as legal standing.",
      "But attorneys general for Missouri, Idaho and Kansas, who had intervened at an earlier stage in the litigation, sought to continue the lawsuit. They argued that changes made by the FDA beginning in 2016 were unlawful. Among those efforts were allowing mifepristone to be taken up to 10 weeks into a pregnancy, rather than seven weeks, expanding the health care providers who can prescribe the drug and allowing the medication to be dispensed through the mail.",
      "The Justice Department said in its filing to Kacsmaryk, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, that the states' claims \"have no connection\" to the Northern District of Texas, where the case was filed, and that even if they were to file their own lawsuit there, it could not move forward because it is not the proper venue.",
      "\"Regardless of the merits of the states' claims, the states cannot proceed in this court,\" administration lawyers said. \"The states' amended complaint should be dismissed or transferred for lack of venue.\"",
      "The Justice Department also said the states do not have the legal standing to sue and waited too long to challenge the FDA's 2016 actions, which are subject to a six-year statute of limitations. The FDA first approved mifepristone in 2000 and has issued a series of changes in the years since that have made the drug more widely available.",
      "Medication abortions made up more than half of all abortions in the United States health care system in 2023, according to a study from the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research group. Twenty-eight states restrict access to mifepristone, according to the organization, four of which prohibit the mailing of abortion pills to patients.",
      "The filing from the Trump administration is the first in which it has expressed a position on the challenge involving mifepristone. After Mr. Trump won a second term in office, conservatives urged his administration to force the FDA to roll back its earlier moves that made mifepristone easier to obtain.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0told senators during his confirmation hearing earlier this year that Mr. Trump had asked him to study the safety of mifepristone. Kennedy, whose agency oversees the FDA, said that while the president had not taken a stand on how to regulate the abortion pill, he would implement the president's policies.",
      "The president said in June 2024 that he had \"strong views\"\u00a0on mifepristone and pledged to release a policy position on access to the drug, but did not do so.",

      "The lawsuit \u2014\u00a0filed in Rhode Island federal court by New York, California, 17 other states and Washington, D.C. \u2014 claims the Trump administration has sought to \"dismantle\" HHS through layoffs that disproportionately hit \"disfavored work and programs,\" like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "HHS is aiming to cut its headcount by 20,000 \u2014 or nearly 25% \u2014 through a combination of layoffs, buyouts and early retirement offers, the department announced in March, framing it as a \"dramatic restructuring\" aimed at making HHS more efficient and cutting redundant or unnecessary services. The cuts are part of a wider initiative by the Trump administration, led by billionaire Elon Musk, to slash the size of the federal government.",
      "Since then, thousands of HHS staff have gotten layoff notices. The cuts have hit large agencies like the FDA and CDC, along with departments that handle mental health, federal poverty guidelines and other services, CBS News has previously reported. Deep cuts are also slated for the National Institutes of Health.",

      "The layoffs have allegedly cut off the states from data and made it harder to access grants for everything from worker safety to the Head Start preschool program, the lawsuit argues. The suit also says the agency has shuttered key disease\u00a0testing labs, forcing them to \"find new partners to handle their most difficult testing needs that had previously been handled by the CDC.\"",
      "The states are asking a federal judge to halt Kennedy's directive to reorganize and cut the HHS, arguing the moves exceed HHS's legal authority and violate the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine by slashing programs authorized by Congress.",
      "The suit also takes aim at Kennedy's views, citing his vaccine skepticism and \"history of advocating for the evisceration of the Department's statutorily mandated work promoting public health.\" It also pointed to Kennedy's acknowledgement that 20% of job cuts at the HHS may need to be reversed due to \"mistakes.\"",
      "An HHS spokesperson said in response to the lawsuit, \"HHS remains confident that the process will withstand legal scrutiny.\"",

      "The Georgia Senate race is one of next year's most closely watched contests, and retaining the seat could prove essential to Democrats' efforts to regain control of the Senate, where Republicans currently hold a 53-47 edge.",
      "Elections in Georgia \u2014 once a consistently red state \u2014 are perennially close. Ossoff won his Senate seat by under two points in a 2021 runoff against GOP Sen. David Perdue, driven by strong performance in the Atlanta suburbs and among Black voters \u2014 helping to cinch the Democrats' narrow Senate majority. And Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock was reelected by fewer than three points in 2022, beating Trump-backed ex-football star Herschel Walker.",
      "Kemp's plans for the Senate race were closely watched due to his popularity in the state. The term-limited governor defeated Democrat Stacey Abrams by just 1.4 points in 2018, but improved his margin to 7.5 points in a 2022 rematch against Abrams. Kemp also easily staved off a Trump-backed primary challenge by Perdue in 2022, beating him by over 50 points.",
      "Kemp and Mr. Trump have a rocky relationship, dating back to the governor's refusal to help the president overturn his narrow 2020 election loss in Georgia. Mr. Trump endorsed Perdue's primary election, calling Kemp the \"WORST Governor in the Country on Election Integrity.\" Kemp later endorsed Mr. Trump's 2024 campaign, and Mr. Trump won back Georgia.",
      "With Kemp out of the race, it's unclear who will seek to run against Ossoff.",
      "Mr. Trump said in 2023 he would \"fight like hell\" for Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene if she runs for Senate. The firebrand lawmaker said earlier this year she's \"considering all possibilities\" when asked if she will run for statewide office in 2026.",
      "Candidates other than Kemp could face a tougher path: In last month's Journal-Constitution poll, Ossoff led Greene 54%-37%. The incumbent senator also led Georgia Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner John King 51%-38%, and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger \u2014 another Trump foe \u2014 48%-39%.",
      "In a statement after Kemp's announcement, Ossoff's campaign manager, Ellen Foster, said the senator is \"well-prepared to defeat any challenger.\"",

      "The National Institutes of Health has laid off hundreds more staff, multiple current and laid-off employees of the health agency told CBS News, including at its cancer research institute.",
      "Around 200 employees began receiving layoff notices Friday evening, said three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The move surprised NIH officials, since the department previously claimed no further cuts were planned at the agency.",
      "\"We thought the worst was behind us, and we were transitioning into this new phase, and the rug was just pulled out from underneath us,\" one laid-off employee said.",
      "A spokesperson for the NIH did not comment on why NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya sought the additional layoffs, referring an inquiry to the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH. An HHS spokesperson said that, after a review, the department had notified additional employees that they were \"also impacted\" by the layoffs plan announced in March.",
      "Fewer than 250 employees at the department received notices, the spokesperson said. An HHS official said that \"the same number of employees will be brought back in critical areas\" elsewhere at the department.",

The goal is clear: reduce waste and maximize the impact of every taxpayer dollar,\" the HHS spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, said in a statement.",
      "Among the cuts on Friday were around 50 employees at the NIH's National Cancer Institute, or NCI. They had worked in the institute's\u00a0Office of Communications and Public Liaison\u00a0overseeing programs like the\u00a0Cancer Information Service, which provides answers to doctors and patients about cancer, and updates to databases\u00a0summarizing\u00a0cancer information for healthcare providers.",

      "Since the beginning of the year, more than 550 employees have left the National Weather Service, leaving it down 10% of its staffing levels ahead of hurricane season and the busiest time of year.

    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 13:57:29 -0400",
    "summary": "Sen. Dick Durbin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, wants the congressional watchdog agency to examine what the FBI spent on Patel's personal travel.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Democrats have asked the U.S. Government Accountability Office to review the FBI Director Kash Patel's personal travel on government aircraft, according to congressional sources. (A spokesperson for the GAO said it has not yet received a formal request from Congress).",
      "The review will examine Patel's use of the FBI's private fleet of jets, as well as every director's approach since 2013, when the GAO last studied the issue. Investigators at the congressional watchdog agency are expected to examine Patel's flight records to determine the purpose of his travel, how much the bureau spent and whether Patel reimbursed the government for personal trips.",
      "Last week, both CBS News and The New York Times reported on questions swirling within the FBI about the degree to which Patel has used government aircraft for purely personal reasons, including trips to visit his girlfriend and attend hockey games and other sporting events.",
      "Asked about the inquiry, the FBI declined to comment.",
      "FBI directors are required by executive branch policy to use government aircraft for air travel, whether official or personal. That allows them to maintain access to secure communications wherever they travel and to move quickly in the event of an emergency. They must reimburse the government for personal flights at coach fare rates. Directors are permitted to take family or friends on personal trips, but the cost of their trips must be reimbursed to the government, as well.",
      "The FBI wouldn't share Patel's flight schedule, citing security concerns, and officials declined to confirm his presence on a number of flights to destinations that matched his appearances in those same places. During the first week of April, for example, a Boeing 757 leased by the Justice Department made two round-trip flights to New York.",
      "On April 5, the narrow-bodied jet took a 57-minute flight to Stewart International Airport, a short drive from West Point, where Patel participated in a charity hockey game hosted by the FBI. The next day, the 757 was back in the air to JFK Airport, landing just hours before Patel showed up in box seats next to hockey legend Wayne Gretzky to watch Washington Capitals star Alex Ovechkin break the NHL scoring record.",
      "Patel also has apparently made use of the FBI's Gulfstream 5 jets to travel to Las Vegas, where he has a home, and to Nashville, where Patel's girlfriend, a country singer, lives. Sources familiar with Patel's travel confirmed to CBS News that the director was on the plane for several trips captured by public flight trackers, including a weekend jaunt to Las Vegas on March 7 and a weekend in Nashville on March 24.",
      "On some occasions, Patel appeared to travel for both business and pleasure. An FBI jet flew on March 21 from Washington, D.C., to Nashville. That day, Patel participated in a roundtable meeting with state and local law enforcement there, and also visited the FBI field office. The plane returned to Washington later that afternoon. It is unclear whether Patel also visited his girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins.",
      "In a statement to CBS News after Patel's travel patterns became public last week, Sen. Dick Durbin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said \"the Judiciary Committee must investigate Director Patel's apparent misuse of taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, did not respond to a question about whether the committee would probe Patel's use of FBI planes for personal travel.",
      "It is at the director's discretion how often to use government aircraft for personal travel and for what specific purposes. In 2013, the GAO last investigated the use of FBI planes for \"non-mission\" purposes and laid out a detailed accounting of how often the aircraft were being used by the director as well as the attorney general, who also has access to the planes. While the probe found little wrongdoing, the report cautioned against excessive use of the planes for personal travel.",
      "Diana Maurer, a director at GAO and author of the 2013 report, told CBS News that the same principles that were at play when the government watchdog agency did its review, remain relevant today.",
      "\"I don't know what the current FBI director did or didn't do,\" Mauer said in an interview. \"But just because you're allowed to do something doesn't mean you necessarily should.\"",
      "She pointed out that operating government aircraft costs considerably more than commercial flights and that officials shouldn't abuse their privileges at the expense of taxpayers.",
      "\"I hope the FBI and the Department of Justice are considering the implications for taxpayers when the director uses government aircraft for non-mission purposes,\" Maurer said in the interview.",
      "Use of the FBI's aircraft for personal travel has been a flashpoint between Congress and the bureau in recent years. When Christopher Wray, Patel's predecessor, ran the FBI, his personal use of the executive jets became a focus of Republicans on Capitol Hill and conservative critics.",
      "Wray was hit for flying back and forth from Washington to his hometown of Atlanta, where his family maintained its residence. (Wray rejected the criticism at the time, noting that he was a \"required-use traveler,\" and that he reimbursed the government in every instance he used the planes for personal purposes.)",
      "Wray also drew criticism from GOP lawmakers and from some former FBI agents for summoning the G5s to Reagan National Airport from Manassas, a 15-mile flight, rather than being driven 30 miles to the Virginia airport where the FBI maintains a hangar.",
      "Patel himself was a vocal critic of Wray's use of FBI aircraft for personal travel. Two years ago, on his podcast \"Kash's Corner,\" he admonished the FBI to \"ground Chris Wray's private jet that he pays for with taxpayer dollars to hop around the country.\" Now that he has replaced Wray at the top of the FBI, he is staying mum about his own use of the bureau's fleet of private aircraft for personal use.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Sunday he is directing his administration to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the notorious former prison on an island off San Francisco, California.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social site, Mr. Trump wrote that, \"For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering. When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That's the way it's supposed to be.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he is directing the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Homeland Security to \"reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders.\"",
      "\"The reopening of ALCATRAZ will serve as a symbol of Law, Order and JUSTICE,\" he added.",
      "A spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons told The Associated Press in a statement that the agency \"will comply with all Presidential Orders.\" The spokesperson did not immediately answer the AP's questions regarding the practicality and feasibility of reopening Alcatraz or the agency's role in the future of the former prison given the National Park Service's control of the island.",
      "Mr. Trump's social media post comes as he has been clashing with the courts as he tries to send accused gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador, without due process. Mr. Trump has also talked about wanting to send American citizens there and to other foreign prisons.",
      "Mr. Trump, returning to the White House on Sunday night, told reporters he came up with the idea because of frustrations with \"radicalized judges\" who have insisted those being deported receive due process.",
      "\"It's an idea I had I guess because the judges, so many of these radicalized judges they want to have trials for every single person. Think of it. Every single person that is in our country illegally,\" he said.",
      "He called Alcatraz \"a bad symbol, but it's a symbol of law and order.\"",
      "Why was Alcatraz closed?",
      "Alcatraz prison, located on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay, just over a mile north of the city, was a maximum-security, minimum-privilege prison opened in 1934 to deal with the \"most incorrigible inmates in federal prisons,\" the Bureau of Prisons says. Before that, dating back to the 1850s, the site was used by the U.S. Army as a defensive citadel and to hold military prisoners.",
      "It was also designed to \"show the law-abiding public that the Federal Government was serious about stopping the rampant crime of the 1920s and 1930s,\" the bureau says on its website.",
      "Well-known criminals such as Al Capone, George \"Machine-Gun\" Kelly, Alvin Karpis (the first \"Public Enemy No. 1\") and Arthur \"Doc\" Barker did time in Alcatraz, according to the BOP. However, most of the prisoners were not infamous gangsters but prisoners who refused to conform to the rules and regulations of other federal institutions.",
      "Alcatraz had a capacity of 336 prisoners, though the average population was only about 260 to 275 at any given time.",
      "Over the 29 years that it operated as a prison, 36 men were involved in 14 separate escape attempts. Of these, 23 were caught, six were shot and killed, and two drowned.",
      "It closed on March 21, 1963, because the prison was too expensive to continue to operate, the BOP said. Because of its location on an island, all of its supplies \u2014 food, fuel, even fresh water \u2014 had to be brought in by boat.",
      "The government determined at the time that it cost three times more per prisoner to operate Alcatraz than any other federal prison, and that would be more economical to shut it down and build a whole new facility, the bureau said.",
      "After it closed, it was basically abandoned for years. In 1969, a group of Native American Indian activists occupied Alcatraz for 18 months, claiming it as Indian land.",
      "Can people visit Alcatraz?",
      "After its closure, the prison was often portrayed as \"America's Devil's Island\" in books and movies, including \"The Rock\" starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage and the 1979 film \"Escape from Alcatraz\" starring Clint Eastwood.",
      "In 1972, Congress created the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the island where Alcatraz sits on was included as part of a new National Park Service site. The island opened to tourists in the fall of 1973 and has become one of the most popular National Park Service sites.",
      "Alcatraz Island continues to operate as a tourist site to this day.",
      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat whose district includes the island, questioned the feasibility of reopening the prison after so many years.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has suggested in a handful of appearances in recent months and years that he's looking at ways to run again for president, though the Constitution limits any person to being elected to the office twice. But in his latest comments on the issue, the president downplayed talk of a third term.",
      "The president told NBC News in an interview that aired on May 4 that \"I'll be a two-term president.\"",
      "The comments came after he told NBC in March that he was \"not joking\" about seeking another term in office, after repeatedly publicly musing about the possibility. He also said at the time that despite the constitutional limitations, \"there are methods which you could do it.\"",
      "Trump supporters like former strategist Steve Bannon have called on the president to run again, and Rep. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, introduced a resolution earlier this year to amend the Constitution to allow Mr. Trump to be elected to another term. Senate Majority Leader John Thune also said of Mr. Trump's prospects of serving a third term, \"not without a change in the Constitution.\" He told reporters, \"I think that you guys keep asking the question and \u2026 I think he is having some fun with it, probably messing with you.\"",
      "Experts say changing the Constitution is extremely unlikely. Election law scholars\u00a0raised the possibility that talk of a third term, whatever its likelihood, may function as a show of strength to try to stave off the perception that Mr. Trump is a lame-duck president.",
      "Here's a timeline of Mr. Trump's comments on a third term:",
      "\"We're probably entitled to another four after that\"",
      "Mr. Trump flirted with additional time in office beyond two terms when he sought reelection in 2020. During a rally in Minden, Nevada, the president predicted he would win four more years in the White House, and even suggested that he could go on to another term after his second.",
      "\"We're going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that, we'll negotiate, right?\" Mr. Trump said. \"Because we're probably, based on the way we were treated, we're probably entitled to another four after that.\"",
      "\"Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "Shortly after returning to office, Mr. Trump again made reference to another term at a rally in Las Vegas on Jan. 25.",
      "\"It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve, not once but twice \u2014 or three times or four times,\" Mr. Trump quipped to applause from the crowd, before adding that \"no, it will be to serve twice.\"",
      "Then on Jan. 27, Mr. Trump joked to Republican lawmakers about a third term. Speaking before the House GOP conference in Florida, Mr. Trump touted the money he'd raised for another race that he said \"I assume I can't use for myself.\"",
      "\"But I'm not 100% sure because, I don't know,\" the president continued, to laughter from House Republicans. \"I think I'm not allowed to run again. I'm not sure. Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me.\"",
      "At the National Prayer Breakfast on Feb. 6, Mr. Trump said, \"They say I can't run again \u2014 that's the expression.\"",
      "\"Then somebody said, 'I don't think you can.' Oh,\" the president added.",
      "On Feb. 20, the president again joked about an additional term at a White House event to mark Black History Month, as he celebrated the support he saw from Black Americans in the 2024 election.",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me,\" Mr. Trump said, as supporters chanted, \"four more years!\"",
      "\"There are methods\"",
      "In an interview with NBC's Kristen Welker on March 30, Mr. Trump said, \"I'm not joking\" about serving a third term, and for the first time mentioned an awareness of potential paths.",
      "\"There are methods which you could do it,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview, adding that \"it is far too early to think about it.\"",
      "The president pointed to his favorability rating and suggested that Americans would like him to serve a third term. Mr. Trump told Welker, \"I have had more people say, 'please run again,'\" while noting \"we have a long way to go before we even think about that.\" On Air Force One Sunday night, he\u00a0spoke\u00a0with reporters and briefly addressed questions about a third term and reiterated that it's still a distant consideration.",
      "\"No matter how you look at it, we've got a long time to go. We have a long time. You know, we have almost four years to go,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"But despite that, so many people are saying, 'you've got to run again.' They love the job.\"",
      "While speaking to reporters on Monday in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump denied that he has ever looked into running for another term.",
      "\"People are asking me to run,\" he said. \"There's a whole story about running for a third term. I don't know. I never looked into it. They do say there's a way you can do it. But I don't know about that. But I have not looked into it.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was also asked whether it would open the door to Democrats running former President Barack Obama, who served two consecutive terms, against him.",
      "\"I'd love that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"That would be a good one. I'd like that.\"",
      "\"I'll be a two-term president\"",
      "In another interview with Welker conducted on May 2, Mr. Trump downplayed talk of seeking another term. The president said \"so many people want me to do it,\" saying he has \"never had requests so strong as that.\" But he added that \"it's something that, to the best of my knowledge, you're not allowed to do.\"",
      "\"This is not something I'm looking to do,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'm looking to have four great years, and turn it over to somebody \u2014 ideally a great Republican, a great Republican \u2014 to carry it forward. But I think we're going to have four years and I think four years is plenty of time to do something really spectacular.\"",
      "Asked about moves by his allies to make another term possible, like by seeking a constitutional amendment, the president said \"that's because they like the job I'm doing, and it's a compliment. It's really a great compliment.\"",
      "\"There are ways of doing it,\" the president added, alluding to a possible write-in vote or move to elect Vice President JD Vance and have him turn the power over to Mr. Trump. But the president said he's \"not looking at that\" and hasn't had official meetings about possible avenues.",
      "\"I'll be an eight-year president,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'll be a two-term president.\"",

      "\"I have to respond by saying again, and I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "His comments come as he discussed the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the El Salvadoran native who is married to a U.S. citizen and was living in Maryland before the Trump administration\u00a0mistakenly deported him in March. Immigration and Customs Enforcement admitted in a court filing that the deportation of the Baltimore father was an \"administrative error\" and an \"oversight.\"",
      "Last month, a federal judge and the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia to the U.S., but Abrego Garcia remains in a detention facility in Santa Ana, El Salvador, after spending almost a month at the country's notorious Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT).",
      "When asked about the delay in returning Abrego Garcia to the U.S. and whether he's defying the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump told NBC that Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Justice Department had interpreted the court's 9-0 decision differently.",
      "\"They're not viewing the decision the way you said it. They don't view it that way at all. They think it's a totally different decision,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"I have the power to ask for him to come back if I'm instructed by the attorney general  that it's legal to do so,\" the president added. \"But the decision as to whether or not he should come back will be  the head of El Salvador. He's a very capable man.\"",
      "President Nayib Bukele has said he won't return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. During his visit to the White House last month, Bukele referred to Abrego Garcia as a \"terrorist,\" and said, \"I don't have the power to return him to the United States.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said in the interview that aired Sunday that there's a possibility that the Department of Justice will go back to the Supreme Court and ask the justices to clarify their order to the administration to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return. The president and the Justice Department have said that Abrego Garcia shouldn't be in the country because of his alleged involvement with MS-13.",
      "The Trump administration, including its \"border czar\" Tom Homan, claimed that Abrego Garcia's finger tattoos are among \"one of many\" proofs that he's involved with the gang.",
      "\"He seems certainly like a very  dangerous, very bad person,\" the president told Welker, referencing the audio released last week by the\u00a0Department of Homeland Security of Abrego Garcia's wife when she filed a protective order against him in 2020, alleging domestic violence.",
      "Jennifer Vasquez also filed another protective order against him back in 2021 over allegations of domestic violence, according to court records obtained by CBS News. Abrego Garcia has no criminal record and his family says he was never involved with a gang.",
      "Since Abrego Garcia's deportation, Vasquez has been outspoken in support of his return. At a rally outside the White House on Thursday, she said her husband \"was thrown away to die.\"",

    "story": [
      "Rennie Glasgow, who has served 15 years at the Social Security Administration, is seeing something new on the job: dead people.",
      "They're not really dead, of course. In four instances over the past few weeks, he told KFF Health News, his Schenectady, New York, office has seen people come in for whom \"there is no information on the record, just that they are dead.\" So employees have to \"resurrect\" them \u2014 affirm that they're living, so they can receive their benefits.",
      "Revivals were \"sporadic\" before, and there's been an uptick in such cases across upstate New York, said Glasgow. He is also an official with the American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represented 42,000 Social Security employees just before the start of President Trump's second term.",
      "Martin O'Malley, who led the Social Security Administration toward the end of the Biden administration, said in an interview that he had heard similar stories during a recent town hall in Racine, Wisconsin. \"In that room of 200 people, two people raised their hands and said they each had a friend who was wrongly marked as deceased when they're very much alive,\" he said.",
      "It's more than just an inconvenience, because other institutions rely on Social Security numbers to do business, Glasgow said. Being declared dead \"impacts their bank account. This impacts their insurance. This impacts their ability to work. This impacts their ability to get anything done in society.\"",
      "\"They are terminating people's financial lives,\" O'Malley said.",
      "Though it's just one of the things advocates and lawyers worry about, these erroneous deaths come after a pair of initiatives from new leadership at the SSA to alter or update its databases of the living and the dead.",
      "Holders of millions of Social Security numbers have been marked as deceased. Separately, according to The Washington Post and The New York Times, thousands of numbers belonging to immigrants have been purged, cutting them off from banks and commerce, in an effort to encourage these people to \"self-deport.\"",
      "Glasgow said SSA employees received an agency email in April about the purge, instructing them how to resurrect beneficiaries wrongly marked dead. \"Why don't you just do due diligence to make sure what you're doing in the first place is correct?\" he said.",
      "The incorrectly marked deaths are just a piece of the Trump administration's crash program purporting to root out fraud, modernize technology, and secure the program's future.",
      "But KFF Health News' interviews with more than a dozen beneficiaries, advocates, lawyers, current and former employees, and lawmakers suggest the overhaul is making the agency worse at its primary job: sending checks to seniors, orphans, widows, and those with disabilities.",
      "Philadelphian Lisa Seda, who has cancer, has been struggling for weeks to sort out her 24-year-old niece's difficulties with Social Security's disability insurance program. There are two problems: first, trying to change her niece's address; second, trying to figure out why the program is deducting roughly $400 a month for Medicare premiums, when her disability lawyer \u2014 whose firm has a policy against speaking on the record \u2014 believes they could be zero.",
      "Since March, sometimes Social Security has direct-deposited payments to her niece's bank account and other times mailed checks to her old address. Attempting to sort that out has been a morass of long phone calls on hold and in-person trips seeking an appointment.",
      "Before 2025, getting the agency to process changes was usually straightforward, her lawyer said. Not anymore.",
      "The need is dire. If the agency halts the niece's disability payments, \"then she will be homeless,\" Seda recalled telling an agency employee. \"I don't know if I'm going to survive this cancer or not, but there is nobody else to help her.\"",
      "Some of the problems are technological. According to whistleblower information provided to Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, the agency's efforts to process certain data have been failing more frequently. When that happens, \"it can delay or even stop payments to Social Security recipients,\" the committee recently told the agency's inspector general.",
      "While tech experts and former Social Security officials warn about the potential for a complete system crash, day-to-day decay can be an insidious and serious problem, said Kathleen Romig, formerly of the Social Security Administration and its advisory board and currently the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Beneficiaries could struggle to get appointments or the money they're owed, she said.",
      "For its more than 70 million beneficiaries nationwide, Social Security is crucial. More than a third of recipients said they wouldn't be able to afford necessities if the checks stopped coming, according to a January survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance.",
      "Advocates and lawyers say lately Social Security is failing to deliver, to a degree that's nearly unprecedented in their experience.",
      "Carolyn Villers, executive director of the Massachusetts Senior Action Council, said two of her members' March payments were several days late. \"For one member that meant not being able to pay rent on time,\" she said. \"The delayed payment is not something I've heard in the last 20 years.\"",
      "When KFF Health News presented the agency with questions, Social Security officials passed them off to the White House. White House spokesperson Elizabeth Huston referred to Mr. Trump's \"resounding mandate\" to make government more efficient.",
      "\"He has promised to protect social security, and every recipient will continue to receive their benefits,\" Huston said in an email. She did not provide specific, on-the-record responses to questions.",
      "Complaints about missed payments are mushrooming. The Arizona attorney general's office had received approximately 40 complaints related to delayed or disrupted payments by early April, spokesperson Richie Taylor told KFF Health News.",
      "A Connecticut agency assisting people on Medicare said complaints related to Social Security \u2014 which often helps administer payments and enroll patients in the government insurance program primarily for those over age 65 \u2014 had nearly doubled in March compared with last year.",
      "Lawyers representing beneficiaries say that, while the historically underfunded agency has always had its share of errors and inefficiencies, it's getting worse as experienced employees have been let go.",
      "\"We're seeing more mistakes being made,\" said James Ratchford, a lawyer in West Virginia with 17 years' experience representing Social Security beneficiaries. \"We're seeing more things get dropped.\"",
      "What gets dropped, sometimes, are records of basic transactions. Kim Beavers of Independence, Missouri, tried to complete a periodic ritual in February: filling out a disability update form saying she remains unable to work. But her scheduled payments in March and April didn't show.",
      "She got an in-person appointment to untangle the problem \u2014 only to be told there was no record of her submission, despite her showing printouts of the relevant documents to the agency representative. Beavers has a new appointment scheduled for May, she said.",
      "Social Security employees frequently cite missing records to explain their inability to solve problems when they meet with lawyers and beneficiaries. A disability lawyer whose firm's policy does not allow them to be named had a particularly puzzling case: One client, a longtime Social Security disability recipient, had her benefits reassessed. After winning on appeal, the lawyer went back to the agency to have the payments restored \u2014 the recipient had been going without since February. But there was nothing there.",
      "\"To be told they've never been paid benefits before is just chaos, right? Unconditional chaos,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Researchers and lawyers say they have a suspicion about what's behind the problems at Social Security: the Elon Musk-led effort to revamp the agency.",
      "Some 7,000 SSA employees have reportedly been let go; O'Malley has estimated that 3,000 more would leave the agency. \"As the workloads go up, the demoralization becomes deeper, and people burn out and leave,\" he predicted in an April hearing held by House Democrats. \"It's going to mean that if you go to a field office, you're going to see a heck of a lot more empty, closed windows.\"",
      "The departures have hit the agency's regional payment centers hard. These centers help process and adjudicate some cases. It's the type of behind-the-scenes work in which \"the problems surface first,\" Romig said. But if the staff doesn't have enough time, \"those things languish.\"",
      "Languishing can mean, in some cases, getting dropped by important programs like Medicare. Social Security often automatically deducts premiums, or otherwise administers payments, for the health program.",
      "Lately, Melanie Lambert, a senior advocate at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, has seen an increasing number of cases in which the agency determines beneficiaries owe money to Medicare. The cash is sent to the payment centers, she said. And the checks \"just sit there.\"",
      "Beneficiaries lose Medicare, and \"those terminations also tend to happen sooner than they should, based on Social Security's own rules,\" putting people into a bureaucratic maze, Lambert said.",
      "Employees' technology is more often on the fritz. \"There's issues every single day with our system. Every day, at a certain time, our system would go down automatically,\" said Glasgow, of Social Security's Schenectady office. Those problems began in mid-March, he said.",
      "The new problems leave Glasgow suspecting the worst. \"It's more work for less bodies, which will eventually hype up the inefficiency of our job and make us, make the agency, look as though it's underperforming, and then a closer step to the privatization of the agency,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "The South Texas home of Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket company is on its way to becoming an official city with a galactic name: Starbase.",
      "A vote Saturday to formally organize Starbase as a city was approved by a small group of voters who live there and are mostly Musk's employees at SpaceX.",
      "Starbase is the facility and launch site for the SpaceX rocket program that is under contract with the Department of Defense and NASA, which hopes to send astronauts back to the moon and someday to Mars.",
      "Early results look favorable",
      "Musk first floated the idea of Starbase in 2021, and approval of the new city was all but certain. Of the 283 eligible voters in the area, most are believed to be Starbase workers.",
      "The unofficial results on election night show 212 votes for the City of Starbase incorporation, or 100%, with Bobby Peden elected as mayor with 100% of the votes.",
      "The election victory was personal for Musk. The billionaire's popularity has diminished since he became the chain-saw-wielding public face of President Donald Trump's federal job and spending cuts, and profits at his Tesla car company have plummeted.",
      "SpaceX has generally drawn widespread support from local officials for its jobs and investment in the area.",
      "Musk's personal stake in the outcome",
      "But the creation of an official company town has also drawn critics who worry it will expand Musk's personal control over the area, with potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches.",
      "Companion efforts to the city vote include bills in the state Legislature to shift that authority from the county to the new town's mayor and city council.",
      "All these measures come as SpaceX is asking federal authorities for permission to increase the number of South Texas launches from five to 25 a year.",
      "The city at the southern tip of Texas near the Mexico border is only about 1.5 square miles (3.9 square kilometers), crisscrossed by a few roads and dappled with airstream trailers and modest midcentury homes.",
      "SpaceX officials have said little about exactly why they want a company town and did not respond to emailed requests for comment.",
      "\"We need the ability to grow Starbase as a community,\" Starbase General Manager Kathryn Lueders wrote to local officials in 2024 with the request to get the city issue on the ballot.",
      "The letter said the company already manages roads and utilities, as well as \"the provisions of schooling and medical care\" for those living on the property.",
      "Increased launch activity and beach closures",
      "SpaceX officials have told lawmakers that granting the city authority to close the beach would streamline launch operations. SpaceX rocket launches and engine tests, and even just moving certain equipment around the launch base requires the closure of a local highway and access to Boca Chica State Park and Boca Chica Beach.",
      "Critics say the beach closure authority should stay with the county government, which represents a broader population that uses the beach and park. Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino, Jr. has said the county has worked well with SpaceX and there is no need for change.",
      "Another proposed bill would make it a Class B misdemeanor with up to 180 days in jail if someone doesn't comply with an order to evacuate the beach.",
      "The South Texas Environmental Justice Network, which has organized protests against the city vote and the beach access issue, plan to hold another protest Saturday night as the polls close.",

    "summary": "Mr. Trump has repeatedly vowed to secure U.S. control of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, while threatening to make Canada the 51st state.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said he would talk to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney about making Canada the 51st state. But the president said he didn't expect it to get to the point of using military force \u2014 though he wouldn't commit to the same for Greenland.",
      "\"Something could happen with Greenland, I'll be honest,\" Trump said in an interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that aired on Sunday.\u00a0 He said that \"we need that for national and international security,\" but he added \"I don't see it with Canada. I just don't see it.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly vowed to secure U.S. control of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, while also threatening to make Canada the 51st state. And last week, the president's territorial threats against Canada, coupled with his tariffs, appeared to play a part in a major political turnaround for Canada's Liberal Party in the federal elections.",
      "The president spoke with Carney following his victory, but the men said they didn't talk about making Canada the 51st state. Still, when asked whether he would do so when the leaders next speak, Mr. Trump said \"I'll always talk about that.\"",
      "Mr. Trump outlined his reasoning, claiming \"we subsidize Canada to the tune of $200 billion a year\" and arguing that \"we don't need anything that they have.\" He said \"if Canada was a state, it wouldn't cost us.\"",
      "The president said it would be a \"cherished state,\" while urging that North America would be \"beautiful\" without the U.S.-Canadian border running through it.",
      "\"When I look down at that, without that artificial line that was drawn with a ruler many years ago \u2014 it was just an artificial line, it goes straight across \u2014 you don't even realize what a beautiful country it would be,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It would be great.\"",
      "As for Greenland, the president said when asked to clarify whether he would rule out using military force on the territory that \"I don't rule it out, I don't say I'm going to do it, but I don't rule out anything, no \u2014 not there.\"",
      "\"We need Greenland very badly,\" he added. \"Greenland is a very small amount of people we'll take care of, and we'll cherish them and all of that, but we need that for international security.\"",
      "Located between the U.S., Russia and Europe, Greenland is viewed as a strategic position for both economic and defense purposes, with melting sea ice opening up new shipping routes through the Arctic. Greenland's prime minister has pushed back sharply against Mr. Trump's threats, saying in March that \"we are not for sale and cannot simply be taken.\"",
      "In the wide-ranging hourlong interview with \"Meet the Press,\" Mr. Trump waffled on whether the thinks he needs to \"uphold the Constitution.\"",
      "\"I don't know. I have to respond by saying again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what Supreme Court said,\" Mr. Trump said regarding due process for immigrants sent to a prison in El Salvador.",

    "summary": "PBS CEO Paula Kerger said Sunday that \"we have never seen a circumstance like this\" after President Trump last week ordered a cut off to federal funding to PBS and NPR.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 PBS CEO Paula Kerger said Sunday that \"we have never seen a circumstance like this\" after President Trump issued an executive order last week aimed at cutting federal funding to the two major public broadcasting systems \u2014 PBS and NPR.",
      "\"This is different. They're coming after us on many different ways,\" Kerger said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "On Thursday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order instructing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the private nonprofit that serves as the steward of the funding to public media, to cease federal funding for PBS and NPR. The executive order dictates that the government \"shall cease direct funding to NPR and PBS, consistent with my Administration's policy to ensure that Federal funding does not support biased and partisan news coverage.\"",
      "Kerger said it's one of a number of avenues where the administration is \"coming after us,\" including with a possible rescission of already appropriated funds, and an effort to challenge sponsorships from corporations through the Federal Communications Commission, among other things.",
      "\"Obviously we're going to be pushing back very hard, because what's at risk are our stations, our public television, our public radio stations, across the country,\" Kerger said.",
      "Kerger said PBS gets 15% of its funding from the federal government, but said that figure is an aggregate number, with some stations in small communities receiving up to 40% or 50% of their funding from the government. For them, she said \"it's existential,\" adding \"that's what's at risk if this funding goes away.\"",
      "Among the funding that Kerger said she expects to be impacted is funding from the Department of Education, which she said has supported the creation of children's programming and the research behind its educational components. Kerger said the programming was created because not all children have access to formal pre-kindergarten.",
      "\"That was the idea with Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers, and everything that's followed since is to make sure that children that do not have access to a full array of resources have the opportunity to learn and to develop skills that they'll need the first time they enter preschool,\" Kerger said. \"That's what's at risk.\"",
      "NPR CEO Katherine Maher also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday and said \"we're looking at whatever options are available to us\" to challenge the executive order. Maher echoed that the \"immediate damage is to local stations,\" while noting that other scenarios, like a clawback of already appropriated funds, or if stations were no longer able to participate in their membership dues, would be \"damaging.\"",
      "\"The impact of this could really be devastating, particularly in rural communities,\" Maher said, noting that there are 246 stations throughout the country, and for some Americans, they provide the sole local source of news.",
      "The executive order says \"Americans have the right to expect that if their tax dollars fund public broadcasting at all, they fund only fair, accurate, unbiased, and nonpartisan news coverage,\" while arguing that government funding for news media is \"not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence.\" The order claims that neither PBS nor NPR present \"a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.\"",
      "Maher, who noted that she doesn't personally make editorial decisions, said in response to the suggestion that NPR is not fair and non-partisan that \"I think our newsroom would really take issue with that.\"",
      "\"We have been on air for more than 50 years. We have been covering news as it occurs across the nation, in local communities, overseas,\" Maher said. \"We have an extraordinary Washington desk, and our people report straight down the line, and I think that not only do they do that, they do so with a mission that very few other broadcast organizations have, which is a requirement to serve the entire public. That is the point of public broadcasting.\"",

      "Good to see you here in person.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-Ohio): Thanks for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I have a lot of national security topics to get to you, but at the heart of so much is America's economic strength. And so I want to ask you about what President Trump said this week about the cost, the impact of his China tariffs on the supply of goods in the United States.",
      "Take a listen.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Somebody said, oh, the shelves are going to be open. Well, maybe the children will have two dolls, instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do your constituents back in Ohio really want to hear the message that they need fewer Christmas presents this year?",
      "He's acknowledging less supply, higher prices.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I think there's going to be a lot that has to be shaken out here. And we certainly are seeing, I think, some reaction now in China also that means that the president's goal is that these nations, that \u2013 of which he's putting tariffs on the table and tariffs, which are a punishment for having behaved poorly, taking advantage of the United States economically, will come to the table and negotiate better economic deals than the United States has been experiencing.",
      "Those deals are beginning to be offered. The White House is beginning to negotiate those. China is beginning to signal that they're willing to come to the table. So, even though the president is making those statements, at the same time, we're seeing that the president taking that step of saying we want a better economic deal is beginning to work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, in the meantime, China said it may restrict exports of materials used by General Dynamics, which makes tanks, including in your state of Ohio. Are you concerned that the trade war won't just impact people's purchasing of toys, but preparedness, tanks, and military readiness?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I think we're all concerned of the effects on the supply chain. And certainly we have got to make certain that this works through the entire processes and that we are concerned on the effects of the economy.",
      "I think the president's going to be looking at that. Congress is going to be looking at that. But the real concern here is that we do have to look long term as to how this protects our overall economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Beijing has not yet launched those talks. We will be watching for them if they do get under way.",
      "Let's get to the other news of the week, the reshuffling at the top of the national security apparatus. It has long been clear there are divides within the administration on certain topics. Iran is one of them. Russia is another one of them. Mike Waltz, who you served with, viewed as a traditional Republican hawk.",
      "I say this because, when he was on this program previously, he laid out in pretty clear terms that the U.S. goal in these negotiations with Iran are dismantlement of its nuclear program, not limits on enrichment, not verification, but those are the things that the envoy negotiating with Iran have said.",
      "We're seeing policy differences from within the president's own administration here. Has Congress been given details on what the goal is and what the plan is?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I mean, the goal is simply stated, that we do not have a nuclear Iran.",
      "And, certainly, the president is leaning strongly in that. From his first term, with the maximum pressure campaign, the president was clear that, both in non-nuclear Iran and also making certain that we have \u2013 that the nefarious activities of Iran working through their proxies, the terrorist groups and organizations, that that be stopped.",
      "So the president is very strong on an anti-Iran policy, including ensuring that there not be a nuclear Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the things that his envoy have described sound a lot like that 2015 nuclear deal negotiated under President Obama, with limits on enrichment, for example, and things like that.",
      "I know in the past you voted for legislation that would give Congress more oversight over a deal with Iran. Do you expect President Trump to bring any kind of deal he brokers to Congress for approval?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I think we have to see what the deal is.",
      "I mean, currently, there's just ongoing negotiations. We will have to see how that evolves. We will have to see what those terms are and really \u2013 well, I\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't want any kind of review regardless?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I mean, as it evolves, we will have to see what those terms are and what \u2013 and really what is achieved.",
      "And, certainly, there's a role for Congress to play as that goes forward. But I think we need to give them the opportunity for success.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Israeli prime minister issued a statement yesterday denying that he personally was talking to Mike Waltz about bombing Iran, military action against Iran. Of course, we know his aides could have those conversations.",
      "Is it appropriate work for the national security adviser to the president to be coordinating with Israel about military action against Iran, or was Mike Waltz possibly in the wrong here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, first off, we don't know specifically that that was occurring.",
      "But, at the same time, the National Security Council, the function of the National Security Council is to ensure that the president of the United States has the greatest information possible. And Mike Waltz is \u2013 has an incredible background and experience. He worked diligently to make certain he had a strong role in the national security team of the president.",
      "And I'm certainly glad that he's going to be retained and staying in a strong role in this administration. Working directly with world leaders and heads of state is certainly an important role of \u2013 as the national security adviser to the president. And I \u2013 certainly, I think, even as U.N. ambassador, he will continue to do that type of function.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it in the national security interest, though, to have the secretary of state, who also has, at least on paper, three other jobs now, in this role, and for how long?",
      "You're saying how important it is.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I mean, it certainly \u2013 certainly, we know Henry Kissinger has been in that position before.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And even he said it was untenable.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And even \u2013 but he was in lockstep with his president.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I think what's also very important here is that Marco Rubio, from a policy perspective, is very strong in this administration. His signal of being in this position sends a signal of continuing the same policies in the administration.",
      "From a Trump team policy perspective, him taking over this sends a signal of continuation and strength. That's excellent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the policy\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Now we have got to give him the opportunity of, is he going to be able to build out the team in the National Security Council?",
      "And that's certainly hope \u2013 hopefully that he will be able to do so and build out a strong team there that represents really the opportunity to support President Trump in giving him the information and knowledge and the access to information and knowledge that he needs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a diplomatic way of saying there shouldn't be loyalty tests to the president. You want actual experts staffing National Security Council. You don't want Laura Loomer, a far right activist, making decisions on personnel?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, at the same time, there does have to be loyalty to the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course, but also to the Constitution.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I mean, we saw in the president's first term that the president was betrayed during the first Trump impeachment by individuals who were at the National Security Council.",
      "So Trump personally has an understanding that you have to have people at the National Security Council that are on Trump's team. And the National Security Council, being \u2013 directly working with him and being in the White House, it's very, very important that they be personnel that work for and on behalf of the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were talking about National Security Council members who testified under oath that the president was withholding aid to Ukraine during the first administration for a political favor.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: And was shown to have wrongly been testified, because I was part of that panel. And they \u2013 their testimony was proven not to be accurate, that the president was not tying aid to Ukraine to the investigation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that was the premise of the impeachment.",
      "But your point is, that looms large in the president's memory and interaction with the National Security Council now. OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: The president needs to make certain that he has staff that are supportive of him in the National Security Council and his policies and makes certain that they're providing him information.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: This is the heart of, what does the president know that our adversaries are doing?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: When he's dealing with Russia and what \u2013 and policies with respect to Ukraine, he needs to know what Vladimir Putin is doing. And that's coming directly from the National Security Council.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Noted.",
      "The White House budget was released Friday. It is not the trillion-dollar promise the president campaigned on. Susan Collins on Appropriations, Roger Wicker on the Senate Armed Services Committee says this is not adequate. And, in fact, he said: \"The intention is to shred to the bone our military capabilities and support to service members.\"",
      "Do you share your Republican senators' concerns?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I think there's more work that can be done on the national security portion of the president's budget.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You would like to see more defense spending than the White House is putting forth?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I think there's going to be more debate and I think there's more opportunity for increased investment.",
      "We really need to do more in the national security space. There are adversaries that we have that want to do America harm, and we need to be strong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Congressman Turner, thank you for joining us.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Illinois Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth.",
      "Good to have you here in person.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-Illinois): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Senator, I know you did vote to confirm Secretary Rubio. Do you have confidence that he can juggle all four of the jobs that he now has for an indefinite period of time?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: No. There's no way he can do that and do it well, especially since there's such incompetence over at DOD with Pete Hegseth being secretary of defense, and just the hollowing out of the top leadership.",
      "There's no way he can carry all that entire load on his own. And so I do think that they need to find a new secretary of defense. They need to find a new NSA \u2013 head of NSA as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, at this point, we heard from the chief of staff that she believes all the Cabinet secretaries will serve a full year. What makes you think that Secretary Hegseth could actually be dismissed?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I think he should be dismissed.",
      "Whether or not President Trump's going to dismiss him is a whole different conversation. He should never have been nominated in the first place. He is the most untrained, inadequate secretary of defense in our nation's history. And look at what he's done at the Pentagon. It's in turmoil.",
      "He lost his top staffers within a matter of days. He's now put classified information an unclassified chain, and he's put on our nation's national security at risk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says no war plans, wasn't classified, but it was sensitive information. That's part of this ongoing inspector general probe, as I understand it, into his conduct.",
      "Do you have any timeline, any sense of how seriously that's being taken and when the results will be seen?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: We don't have a timeline. It is very serious.",
      "Let me make it clear what he did. He put into an unclassified Signal chain that the aircraft are going to be over a certain point in space at a certain point in time. That's classified information. Any basic person getting through military training knows that is classified information.",
      "And he did it on a separate chain with his wife and family members.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, because you sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, along with Armed Services\u2026",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Armed Services, yes.",

And, you know, as you know, after that meeting, we have signed really a great agreement, economic partnership agreement between our two nations, which will take that partnership to a new level.",

I've read that the deal counts future U.S. military assistance in the form of ammunition, weapon systems and training as a contribution to the investment fund, and that Ukraine will not reimburse Washington for past military aid. Is that how it's set up?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA (Ukrainian Ambassador): Well, we - first of all, it's important that it's going to be, as we say, a 50/50 deal. So we, together, will set up that fund, we will run it together. And all the future contribution that - or investments that U.S. will be providing us, including military deals, will be counted as contribution to that fund, and Ukraine will be also committing the proceeds from the new licenses and new developments into the fund. So, essentially, it's a true partnership where we would be able to put resources together in order to invest into a wide range of projects, including infrastructure, including rare earths, including critical minerals, and both of our nations will benefit from it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When does that get up and running?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: We're working very actively on it. As you saw, the deal between the governments have been signed. It's going to be ratified by our parliament hopefully soon. You have seen strong messages from President Zelenskyy. And it's his vision and vision of President Trump behind the deal that is moving it forward.",
      "Of course, there will be the creation of the fund, the set-up of the fund. I used to work in private equity in my previous life. That takes a little bit of time. But we are moving very fast. So, hopefully the teams will come - put everything together and we'll start working.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But within this there aren't security guarantees. Are there promises of future military aid from the United States? Because if this effort to get a peace deal together doesn't work, the fate of the war is still in question.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, you know, this - the situation with Russian aggression towards Ukraine is so complex. There are many - we've discussed the potential possible peace deals. We're discussing this economic partnership deal which is already signed. We're discussing other possible scenarios and security guarantees and involvement of other friends and allies. And, you know, Europe has been more active and proactive in a number of areas.",
      "So, this economic partnership deal in itself is a very important part of the broader security, security architecture, if I may say so. And, frankly, that fund will be successful if Ukraine is stable and peaceful. So, in a way, it's an important part of the future security guarantees.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin told Russian state TV, he thinks that he can bring this war to a logical conclusion. He avoided the word war. He said this thing that started in 2022. But he said, here's been no need to use nuclear weapons and, quote, \"I hope they will not be required.\"",
      "How do you interpret that?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, it's very difficult to interpret a man and a so- called leader of the nation who attack Georgia in 2008, attacked Ukraine in 2014, conducted two genocidal wars on his own in his own federation against Chechnya, the war crimes in Syria, poisoned people in - in Great Britain. I mean, I think at this point it doesn't matter how we interpret what he says, we just have to believe what he says and understand what he says.",
      "He is a threat, not only to Ukraine, but also to anyone who believes that nations should live peacefully, do not challenge each other's borders and just focus on the economic operation. That's what we are doing with the United States.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

But then, as of Friday morning, we found Wong was still on the job. It is not clear what the National Security Council makeup will be or how long the secretary of state will be at the head of it advising the president.",
      "What significance does this have for America's national security?",
      "H.R. MCMASTER: I think it's significant, Margaret, because I think what it reveals is, is a fight that's going on within the administration associated with the - our role in the world and how certain people in the administration perceive America's role in the world. And I think Mike Waltz as an America first guy, but he was an internationalist and prioritized, I think, our alliances. He knew that, I think, that, quite correctly, that Putin won't stop until he is stopped. And so, he was an advocate for a strong approach to Putin. And I think there were those in the administration that have a much different world view, you know, who are in favor of - of U.S. retrenchment or disengagement from complex challenges abroad and want to prioritize kind of the western hemisphere/North American defense. And you see that in your discussion with - with Congressman Turner as well associated with the defense budget and what's being prioritized in the defense budget as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you see this as a - as a policy argument, not just a Signal messaging mistake that, you know, Mike Waltz created that channel where he accidentally included a reporter?",
      "H.R. MCMASTER: It is. I think it's a - it's a policy issue, a world view issue, but it's also an understanding of the role of the - the national security council staff and the national security staff that - that - that Mike Waltz was running, and Alex Wong is - is still running. And - and that's really the staff that allows the president to drive his agenda, that gets best analysis, best advice to the president and gets him multiple options.",
      "It seems pretty clear that President Trump is not very patient in terms of a deliberative process these days, and this is why I think he may see the National Security Council staff as an impediment instead of really the best vehicle to drive his agenda and to integrate all elements of national power and efforts of like-minded partners to advance American interests.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, I thought it was an interesting point Congressman Turner made when he brought up the specific point of reference the president has for the National Security Council during his first term, which is, Turner argued, seeing them as the reason he was impeached where - during his first impeachment related to Ukraine. Do you think that is something that makes him distrust that counsel? Why is it that he would take the advice of someone like Laura Loomer, this far right activist who has made racist attacks on some of the members of that council?",
      "H.R. MCMASTER: You know, Margaret, I think there are three times of people in any administration, those who are there to give the president best advice, those who are there not for that but want to manipulate decisions consistent with their own agenda. These are people inside and outside of the administration. And there's a third group of people who sometimes take on the role of maybe saving the country and the world from the president. That second and third group, if you have an effective national security decision-making process that gives the president multiple options, they tend to oppose that process. They tend to oppose the national security adviser.",
      "And I think what you're seeing is how easy it is for certain people to get in the president's ear, to sow distrust, to drive a wedge between him and the national security adviser in this case or the national security staff and those who are there to get him multiple options.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You referenced the different world view of some of the people advising the president right now. Particularly regarding our allies.",
      "In Europe, we saw an interesting decision this week in Germany. Their domestic intelligence agency concluded an investigation into a far-right political party known as AFD. They declared it to be an extremist group because of anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim positions. Their leaders have trivialized the Holocaust. They've called for deporting non-white citizens because that violates the German constitution.",
      "This would sound like a domestic issue. However, the vice president and the secretary of state have taken very public statements here wading into this. Rubio calling it \"tyranny in disguise.\" Vice President Vance also weighing in here. Do you think that's advisable when that party's leaders have such a troubled history? Can you explain it?",
      "H.R. MCMASTER: Yes, part - part of this, Margaret, is - is what you covered earlier in the show about this kind of women, peace and security initiative, as well as I would say some of the radical DEI agendas of the Biden and maybe the Obama administration before that. This is like an equal and opposite reaction. And it's international.",
      "And this is one of the reasons why there are some people in the United States who kind of regard Putin as - as - as the savior of - of western civilization, or - or Christianity and so forth, which is obviously kind of a - a perverse view of him as well.",
      "But I think what's related to this is this sort of - this emphasis on, you know, retrenchment, just take care of ourself, disengage from the world and - and I think that these are - are related. What's - what's, I think, interesting about this though is that the Trump administration, I think, risks replicating the flaws of the Obama administration's policy, because what you see is, now some people in the Republican Party seeing the source of all ills in the world as, like, the neocons and - and they trace it back in particular to the invasion of Iraq in 2003.",
      "So, that blaming ourselves, other Americans for the ills of the world, and the associated impulse toward disengagement risks recreating, I think, some of the fundamental flaws in sort of the Obama administration approach to the world.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Important point to make.",

      "PAULA KERGER: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Whether it was in Congress or the president saying he's doing it now. That's not new, right? That's been a talking point for years. There have been efforts in Congress. You do have funding, I think, through 2027, but it feels a little bit different this time. Do you have a backup funding plan?",
      "PAULA KERGER: Yes, it is different this time. And I've been through these battles now for a number of years. I've been at PBS almost 20 years. And I remember even going back to the Newt Gingrich days.",
      "But this is different. They're coming after us on many different ways. We're waiting for a possible rescission of those funds that have already been appropriated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're clawing them back.",
      "PAULA KERGER: There was an effort within the FCC challenging our ability to accept sponsorships from corporations, which is something that we have worked with the FCC on for many, many years. There was the executive order. There was the effort to try to remove a few members of the CPB board. So, we have never seen a circumstance like this. And, obviously, we're going to be pushing back very hard because what's at risk are our stations, our public television, our public radio stations across the country. We get 15 percent of our funding from the federal government. That's 1-5 percent, but that's an aggregate number. Some of our stations in small communities, it's 40 percent to 50 percent of their funding. And for them it's existential. And that's what's at risk if this funding goes away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, is it immediate for NPR?",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: In - in a similar fashion. If we were to see a claw back of these funds, which we know is part of the conversation from a rescission standpoint, or if we were to see that the stations were no longer able to participate in their membership due, that would be damaging.",
      "But I think that Paula's point is the one that really people need to hear. The immediate damage is to local stations. And with NPR we have stations in more than - 246 stations with newsrooms, we're in 200 newsrooms in every state in the country, and that includes journalists who are out there covering their local communities, especially in a time where we're seeing an advance of news deserts across the nation, 20 percent of Americans don't have access to another local source of news. The impact of this could really be devastating, particularly in rural communities.",

      "PAULA KERGER: Absolutely. (INAUDIBLE).",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that impacted too?",
      "PAULA KERGER: Absolutely. And out of this executive order, we believe it impacts our funding out of the Department of Education, which is a 30-year program that has supported the development - not only the creation of many of the children's programming that you see on public television, but also the research that we do to ensure that that programming is not just safe and enjoyable, but that children, after watching, come away with understanding of basic letters and numbers. Half the kids in this country are not enrolled in formal pre-k. That's why programming for children on public television was created. That was the idea with \"Sesame Street\" and \"Mister Rogers.\" And everything that's followed since is to make sure that children that do not have access to a full array of resources have the opportunity to learn and to develop skills that they'll need the first time they enter preschool. That may be at age two, or three, or four, and sometimes five, not until they start kindergarten. That's what's at risk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At risk or right now? I mean, do you have the money to keep functioning?",
      "PAULA KERGER: Well, we have programming, so you're not going to turn on your TV set and not see our children's programming anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "PAULA KERGER: But if that funding is cut off, we have programs in development right now. And that will suddenly skid to a halt. We also have stations around the country that work directly with preschool providers and parents, and this funds those activities. So, the immediate impact would be fairly significant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Katherine, I want to ask you about the news. When we went and we read the executive order, the language in there says, \"government funding of news media in this environment is outdated and unnecessary, corrosive to the appearance of independence. Ad Americans have the right to expect if their tax dollars fund public broadcasting, that it's fair, accurate, unbiased and non-partisan.\"",
      "How do you respond to the implication that your news coverage is not?",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: Is not fair and - and non-partisan? I mean I think -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And unbiased.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: Yes, I mean, well, first of all, I think it's important to note that I'm the CEO and we have an independent editor in chief who oversees the newsroom. And so, I don't make editorial decisions. And that, I think, is just always an important point to make.",
      "But I think our newsroom would really take issue with that. We have been on air for more than 50 years. We have been covering news as it occurs across the nation, in local communities, oversees. We have an extraordinary Washington desk. And our people report straight down the line. And I think that not only do they do that, they do so with a mission that very few other broadcast organizations have, which is a requirement to serve the entire public. That is the point of public broadcasting as we bring people together in those conversations.",
      "And so, we've had a whole host of conservative voices on air of late. We've been making requests of the Trump administration to have their officials on air. We would like to see more people accept those invitations. It's hard for us to be able to say we can speak for everyone when folks won't join us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that was the executive order. Then we went and we looked at the White House talking points and what they're putting on social media. They're a lot more about you than you. And on NPR they were saying things like, July 2022 editor's note that said the Declaration of Independent had offensive language against Native Americans. We checked, and the word \"savages\" is used. The White House faults your editors for avoiding the term \"biological sex\" when discussing transgender issues. They apparently want you to use the term \"pro-life\" and faulted your use of the term \"anti-abortion rights\" to refer to activists.",
      "So, when you see specific editorial criticisms like that, what do you interpret the intention of this being.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: Well, I interpret the intention of this being - trying to create a narrative around our editorial independence. And as I said in our",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To control it and then (INAUDIBLE)?",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: To control it. And I think that that's a - that is an affront to the First Amendment. We have an independent newsroom and we will always have an independent newsroom.",
      "From my perspective, part of the separation of - that the First Amendment offers to keep government out. In fact, the statute that was written when the Public Broadcasting Act was signed into law was very explicit about interference from any member of the government, whether it is elected officials, whether members of independent agencies, because it is so sacrosanct, that division between the state and independent media.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: That's correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Set it up as a private corporation to give protection from influence and control. I would assume that's also from the White House, influence and control.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: That's right. And President Lyndon Johnson, who signed the bill into law creating public - the Public Broadcasting Act and creating the system that we all operate within, was - was very note - he noted in his remarks upon signing that speech was that it does requires a greater wisdom, and that's why we have a two-year advance appropriation is to - is to insulate both of our work from political interference. I think that that is critical that Americans understand that public broadcasting is meant to be independent so that we can serve the public interest regardless of whatever administration is in office or whatever Congress' whims are.",
      "PAULA KERGER: And the - and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was set up as a private corporation with that same intent. So, I think there was a lot of focus, even at that moment, in - when the act was signed that protections would need to be put in place, because if we do our job, it is - it is possible that we will produce content that some people may wish we have done a different way. And this way it gives us the independence this way.",
      "The other thing that keeps us independent is that most of our funding comes from viewers like you. We ask people to make contribution to public broadcasting for something they get for free.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "PAULA KERGER: Because we are available free to every home in this country. And so, both the combination of the fact that it was built as a public/private partnership, there would be some public money that went into public broadcasting that would enable stations in small communities to exist, alongside the fact that most of our support comes from people in communities. That really does create something that is very independent and very responsive to the communities that we serve.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: And if I may, just to give a sense of those numbers, for every single dollar that the federal government puts in, stations raise on average about $7 -",
      "PAULA KERGER: Right.",
      "KATHERINE MAHER: From public/private - sorry, from private sources. And so you also have to recognize that this order interferes with the First Amendment rights of our listeners and viewers who have made a choice to contribute. And this is the news that they want to see and hear, or the programming that they are committed to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It did just stand out to us, as journalists ourselves, because the research shows that, you know, there's declining trust in media, in news, and the president was talking about that himself there, that he wants a free and fair press.",
      "We're going to continue to cover this. And thank you for your time today.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with H.R. McMaster, first Trump term national security adviser and CBS News contributor, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on May 4, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to retired Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster. He served as National Security Advisor during President Trump's first term, and he is the author of \"At War With Ourselves: My Tour of Duty in the Trump White House.\" Good to have you back with us.",
      "RETIRED LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: Hey, great to be with you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you've been here. Mike Waltz is no longer the national security adviser. CBS reported his deputy, Alex Wong, will also depart his role. But then, as of Friday morning, we found Wong was still on the job. It is not clear what the National Security Council makeup will be or how long the Secretary of State will be at the head of it advising the president. What significance does this have for America's national security?",
      "MCMASTER: I think it's significant, Margaret, because I think what it reveals is, is a fight that's going on within the administration associated with our role in the world and how certain people in the administration perceive America's role in the world. And I think Mike Waltz was an America first guy, but he was an internationalist and prioritized, I think, our alliances. He knew that, I think, that- quite correctly that Putin won't stop until he is stopped. And so he was an advocate for a strong approach to Putin. And I think there are those in the administration who have a much different worldview, you know, who are in favor of U.S. retrenchment or disengagement from complex challenges abroad, want to prioritize, kind of, the Western Hemisphere, North American defense. And you see that in your discussion with Congressman Turner as well, associated with the defense budget and what's being prioritized in the defense budget as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you see this as a policy argument, not just a Signal messaging mistake, that Mike Waltz created that channel where he accidentally included a reporter.",
      "MCMASTER: It is. I think it's a policy issue, a worldview issue, but it's also an understanding of the role of the National Security Council staff and the National Security staff that Mike Waltz was running and Alex Wong is still running. And that's really the staff that allows the president to drive his agenda, that gets best analysis, best advice to the president, and gets him multiple options. It seems pretty clear that President Trump is not very patient in terms of a deliberative process these days. And this is why I think he may see the National Security Council staff as an impediment instead of, really, the best vehicle to drive his agenda and to integrate all elements of national power and efforts of like-minded partners to advance American interests.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I thought it was an interesting point Congressman Turner made when he brought up the specific point of reference the president has for the National Security Council during his first term, which is, Turner argued, seeing them as the reason he was impeached, during his first impeachment related to Ukraine. Do you think that is something that makes him distrust the council? Why is it that he would take the advice of someone like Laura Loomer, this far right activist who has made racist attacks on some of the members of that council?",
      "MCMASTER: You know, Margaret, I think there are three types of people in any administration. Those who are there to give the president best advice, those who are there not for that, but want to manipulate decisions consistent with their own agenda. These are people inside and outside of the administration. And there's a third group of people who sometimes take on the role of, maybe, saving the country and the world from the president. That second and third group, if you have an effective national security decision-making process that gives the president multiple options, they tend to oppose that process. They tend to oppose the national security advisor. And I think what you're seeing is how easy it is for certain people to get in the president's ear to sow distrust, to drive a wedge between him and the national security advisor in this case or the national security staff and those who are there to get him multiple options.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You referenced the different worldviews of some of the people advising the president right now, particularly regarding our allies. In Europe, we saw an interesting decision this week in Germany. Their domestic intelligence agency concluded an investigation into a far-right political party known as AfD. They declared it to be an extremist group because of anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim positions. Their leaders have trivialized the Holocaust. They've called for deporting non-white citizens because that violates the German Constitution. This would sound like a domestic issue. However, the vice president and the secretary of state have taken very public statements here wading into this. Rubio calling it \"tyranny in disguise.\" Vice President Vance also weighing in here. Do you think that's advisable when that party's leaders have such a troubled history? Can you explain it?",
      "MCMASTER: You know, part- part of this, Margaret, is what you covered earlier in the show about this kind of Women, Peace and Security initiative as well as, I would say, some of the radical DEI agendas of the Biden and maybe the Obama administration before that. This is like an equal and opposite reaction and it's international. And this is one of the reasons why there are some people in the United States who kind of regard Putin as the savior of Western civilization or Christianity and so forth, which is obviously kind of a perverse view of him as well. But I think what's related to this is this sort of, this emphasis on, you know, retrenchment, just take care of ourselves, disengage from the world. And I think that these are related. What's, I think, interesting about this, though, is that the Trump administration, I think, risks replicating the flaws of the Obama administration's policy. Because what you see is now some people in the Republican Party seeing the source of all ills in the world as like the neocons and they trace that back in particular to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. So that blaming ourselves, other Americans for the ills of the world and the associated impulse toward disengagement risks recreating, I think, some of the fundamental flaws in, sort of, the Obama administration approach to the world.",

The president's budget proposal, along with efforts by the White House and Republicans to claw back some federal funding already authorized by Congress, would solidify cuts championed by the White House's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.",
      "\"This is a pretty historic effort to deal with the bureaucracy that you have heard and seen such action from our administration with DOGE to be able to deal with the bureaucracy that we believe has grown up over many years to be entrenched against the interests of the American people,\" the senior OMB official told reporters on a conference call Friday, speaking on condition of anonymity.",
      "The president's proposed budget would put all discretionary spending at $1.7 trillion, down from $1.83 trillion in the current fiscal year, and increase defense spending by 13%, the official said. The president's budget recommendation would have the lowest non-defense discretionary spending since 2017, or, adjusted for inflation, the lowest non-defense discretionary spending since 2000, the official said.",
      "The White House isn't yet saying what their deficit or revenue projections will be. The president's recommendation is in the hands of the Republican-controlled Congress, which is responsible for crafting and passing a budget.",
      "On average, agencies would see about 35% in cuts, although some entities, like the Department of Homeland Security, would see more funding under the proposal. Entities including the State Department and Department of Health and Human Services would see significant cuts under the president's proposal.",
      "The senior OMB official said the president's budget proposal includes \"an enormous cut to foreign aid, but one that still preserves substantial presence\" to provide for \"targeted\" aid when it's in the interest of the United States.",
      "But spending on things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to be the biggest drivers of the federal deficit and national debt, and those programs, along with interest on the debt, are taking up an increasingly large piece of the federal spending pie.",

      "Forests on Earth collectively absorb and store about 8 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually, the ESA said. That regulates the planet's temperature. Deforestation and degradation, especially in tropical regions, means that stored carbon is being released back into the atmosphere, the ESA said, which can contribute to climate change. There's a lack of accurate data on how much carbon the planet's estimated 1.5 trillion trees store and how much human activity can impact that storage, the ESA said.",

    "story": [
      "For nearly a decade, Bree Smith was a familiar face in Nashville. But, in January, the mom and former TV meteorologist stopped appearing on the local CBS-affiliated station \u2014 a decision she made after months of fighting against deepfakes, which are simulated online images or videos that can seem realistic.",
      "In Smith's case, an image of her was doctored to create explicit pictures and videos, with her face edited onto different, partly nude bodies, and then used to try to extort money from others. \"Sextortion\" scams like this one have targeted tens of thousands of Americans in the past year alone, according to the FBI.",
      "\"I cry myself to sleep most nights, mostly because I don't want my kids to see me,\" said Smith, who is 43. She recalled first learning about the images in an email, which included a screen grab of an exchange between the sender and an \"impersonator\" posing as the doctored version of her on the internet.",
      "The deepfakes quickly multiplied, accompanying offers for private dinners and intimate acts in exchange for hundreds of dollars, and targeting anyone who might recognize Smith. She began to keep track of new accounts using the deepfake in a Google spreadsheet \u2014 and added 24 over the course of just one week, among hundreds that she says have emerged online. A fabricated video also surfaced where a deepfake claims to be Smith.",
      "\"You're basically taking someone's identity,\" she said. \"You're weaponizing them.\"",
      "Smith has become a vocal advocate for regulations that could empower sextortion victims to fight back against their offenders. And last week, a bill Smith backed passed in the Tennessee Senate. The bill, called the \"Preventing Deepfake Images Act,\" was sent to Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, who is expected to sign it into law. It provides a path for people targeted by sextortion scams to sue if images of them are shared without their consent.",
      "\"These imposters are trying to take my story, and my story is mine,\" Smith said. \"This is my life. I'm 43 years old and I have worked hard and I have loved well, and I'm not going to just roll over and take this.\"",
      "She said \"defining it as illegal is a critical first step,\" but that work still needs to be done, such as figuring out how to stop it and hold people accountable.",
      "As the bill worked its way through the Tennessee legislature, Smith appeared last month before the Tennessee House Criminal Justice Subcommittee to share her experience with deepfakes and the ways in which the scam has impacted her and her family. In her testimony to lawmakers, she said deepfake accounts pretending to be her have shown up on Facebook and Instagram, in quantities too large for her to find and report as an individual person, CBS News affiliate WSMV reported.",
      "\"I try my best to catch the imposters and block them, but like I said, there have been hundreds of them. It's like whack a mole, they just appear everywhere,\" Smith told lawmakers. \"I'm just supposed to look at them and say, 'nothing we can do, bud?'\"",
      "There were over 34,000 victims of sextortion in 2023, according to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. That number climbed to more than 54,000 victims last year. The FBI said financial sextortion, which differs from typical sextortion as it involves an offender threatening to release explicit material unless a payment is met, has been on the rise in the U.S. and targeting minors.",
      "Hayley Elizondo, who tracks sextortion crimes at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said financial gain is the perpetrators' primary goal.",
      "\"These offenders, their whole game is to make money,\" she said. \"I'm not surprised that we are seeing adults also become the target of financial sextortion. Frankly, they're going to reach out to those who can pay them.\"",
      "Officials say the most important thing for people to do if they think they are a victim of deepfakes is to report them.",
      "\"If you come across deepfake content that involves you or someone you know, report it to the platform hosting the content,\" says the National Cybersecurity Alliance, a nonprofit organization. \"This can help in having it removed or investigated, limiting its potential reach.\"",
      "The organization also advises reporting it to federal law enforcement, which can be done through the Internet Crime Complaint Center.",

      "A federal judge has strongly rebuked Apple, finding that the iPhone maker willfully violated a court injunction in an antitrust case filed by \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games.",
      "U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers had ordered Apple to lower the barriers protecting its previously exclusive payment system for in-app digital transactions and allow developers to display links to alternative options. On Wednesday, she found that Apple violated a 2021 injunction that, she wrote, sought to \"restrain and prohibit the iPhone maker's anticompetitive conduct\" and pricing.",
      "\"Apple's continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated,\" Gonzalez Rogers wrote in Wednesday's ruling, which held Apple in contempt.",

      "In a statement provided to CBS News Wednesday night, an Apple spokesperson said: \"We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal.\"",

      "Although Gonzalez Rogers had rejected the monopoly claims, she ordered Apple to lower the barriers protecting its previously exclusive payment system for in-app digital transactions and allow developers to display links to alternative options. The Supreme Court rejected Apple's appeal in the case in January 2024.",
      "\"In stark contrast to Apple's initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option,\" the judge wrote on Wednesday. She accused Apple's vice-president of finance Alex Roman of \"outright\" lying under oath.",
      "\"Internally, (longtime Apple executive) Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the injunction, but (CEO) Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. Cook chose poorly,\" Gonzalez Rogers wrote.",

In March, the Trump administration sent nearly 300 Venezuelans accused of being gang members to El Salvador, which imprisoned them at an infamous mega-prison.",

But the Supreme Court last year rejected that challenge and unanimously ruled that the plaintiffs did not have the legal right to sue, a concept known as legal standing.",
      "But attorneys general for Missouri, Idaho and Kansas, who had intervened at an earlier stage in the litigation, sought to continue the lawsuit. They argued that changes made by the FDA beginning in 2016 were unlawful. Among those efforts were allowing mifepristone to be taken up to 10 weeks into a pregnancy, rather than seven weeks, expanding the health care providers who can prescribe the drug and allowing the medication to be dispensed through the mail.",
      "The Justice Department said in its filing to Kacsmaryk, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, that the states' claims \"have no connection\" to the Northern District of Texas, where the case was filed, and that even if they were to file their own lawsuit there, it could not move forward because it is not the proper venue.",
      "\"Regardless of the merits of the states' claims, the states cannot proceed in this court,\" administration lawyers said. \"The states' amended complaint should be dismissed or transferred for lack of venue.\"",
      "The Justice Department also said the states do not have the legal standing to sue and waited too long to challenge the FDA's 2016 actions, which are subject to a six-year statute of limitations. The FDA first approved mifepristone in 2000 and has issued a series of changes in the years since that have made the drug more widely available.",
      "Medication abortions made up more than half of all abortions in the United States health care system in 2023, according to a study from the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research group. Twenty-eight states restrict access to mifepristone, according to the organization, four of which prohibit the mailing of abortion pills to patients.",
      "The filing from the Trump administration is the first in which it has expressed a position on the challenge involving mifepristone. After Mr. Trump won a second term in office, conservatives urged his administration to force the FDA to roll back its earlier moves that made mifepristone easier to obtain.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0told senators during his confirmation hearing earlier this year that Mr. Trump had asked him to study the safety of mifepristone. Kennedy, whose agency oversees the FDA, said that while the president had not taken a stand on how to regulate the abortion pill, he would implement the president's policies.",
      "The president said in June 2024 that he had \"strong views\"\u00a0on mifepristone and pledged to release a policy position on access to the drug, but did not do so.",

      "The Trump administration announced Monday it will offer free airline tickets and a $1,000 incentive to some unauthorized immigrants if they sign up for self-deportation and return to their home countries voluntarily.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said it has helped some migrants obtain plane tickets so they can return to their native countries in the next two weeks. A migrant has already returned to Honduras using the self-deportation program to book a flight out of Chicago, the department added.",

      "The Trump administration has threatened certain unauthorized immigrants with prosecution, jail time and fines if they fail to register with the federal government. It has also dramatically broadened whom ICE deportation officers can target for arrest, reversing Biden-era rules that largely limited immigration arrests to serious criminals, national security threats and recent arrivals.",

      "This year's co-chairs are Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky, Pharrell Williams and, of course,\u00a0Vogue\u00a0editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. LeBron James is an honorary chair, but is unable to attend due to a knee injury. There is also a host committee made up of 25 other stars.",
      "What is the Met Gala theme this year?",
      "The 2025 theme explores Black style and the history of dandyism.",
      "\"We're going to see lots of suits, I think in all shapes, sizes, colors,\" says Complex\u00a0editor-in-chief Aria Hughes. \"I think designers are going to play in different ways, and then hopefully lay in some storytelling. I hope to see some archival pieces from Black designers, like a Patrick Kelly or a Willi Smith. So I'm really hoping that people have fun with it.\"",
      "Hughes said the stars to watch include Andr\u00e9 3000 and Slick Rick, whose Bronx roots helped influence style in hip-hop.",
      "\"I really want to see Andr\u00e9 3000. I think that he's been someone who has used dress in such a powerful way. Sometimes it's incredibly rebellious and fun, sometimes it's very conservative,\" she said. \"I also think it's important to have a southern lens, he's from Atlanta. So I think him bringing that to the red carpet will be incredibly important.\"",
      "She also expects to see Grace Wales Bonner's designs somewhere on red carpet.",
      "\"Her work has been about the study of Black male identity and then reflecting that through fashion in a very modern but historical way,\" she said. \"So I think she's a current day designer who really embodies Black dandyism.\"",
      "What exhibition is the 2025 Met Gala theme celebrating?",
      "The gala serves as an annual benefit for the museum's Costume Institute, dating back to 1948.",
      "The museum's CEO announced Monday this year's event has already raised a record $31 million.",
      "The institute says this exhibition is the first in more than 20 years to focus exclusively on menswear.",
      "\"It's incredibly significant, because this is the first time in the Met's history that they are centering Black identity and Black designers. So that acknowledgement from that institution is huge,\" Hughes explained. \"And I think as we face a lot of Black history being erased, this is just kind of combatting that.\"",
      "\"So in many ways, Black designers are getting the same treatment as their white peers, whose work is preserved in museums. So they'll have this same chance,\" she continued. \"And I think just from a mass-level with the gala, now people are understanding the influence of Black identity on fashion.\"",
      "The exhibition was inspired by Guest Curator Monica L. Miller's book,\u00a0\"Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity.\"",
      "\"Fashion and dress have been used in a contest of power and aesthetics for Black people from the time of enslavement to the present, and dandyism has long served as a vehicle through which one can manipulate the relationship between clothing, identity, and power,\" Miller wrote in a statement when it was announced in February. \"The history of Black dandyism illustrates how Black people have transformed from being enslaved and stylized as luxury items, acquired like any other signifier of wealth and status, to autonomous, self-fashioning individuals who are global trendsetters.\"",
      "\"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" opens May 10 and will be on view through October 26. Entrance is free with museum admission.",
      "What is Black dandyism?",
      "Dandyism was once used to describe aristocratic style, but the term later evolved with the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Miller writes in her book that dandified Black servants in 18th century England were forced to wear gold, brass and silver collars with padlocks to signify their owners' wealth.",
      "Slaves arrived in America with few or no belongings, and treasured what they had left, Miller writes. Stripped of their identities, they often added their own flair to their tailored Sunday best looks for church or holidays.",
      "Post-Emancipation, Black Americans had a chance to reclaim their autonomy, paving the way for the Harlem Renaissance. From the 1920s to 1930s, the neighborhood became a hub for Black cultural expression.",
      "The renaissance was a time of living and dressing boldly for Black Americans. Women donned furs and beaded dresses, while men experimented with tailored fabrics, billowing silhouettes, fedora hats and two-toned oxfords.",
      "One prominent style to arise was the zoot suit -- defined by high-waisted draped pants and oversized jackets with large shoulders and lapels. The suits were subversive by taking up space and, because of fabric rations during World War II, owning one was an act of protest.",
      "So what makes someone a dandy today?",
      "\"It's really someone who is dedicated to dress, like they see dress as a discipline, in the same way viewing working out as a discipline or studying music as a discipline. So they view it as a discipline, and a lot of the times it shows up in tailored clothes, but... it's not only people who wear suits, it's become more casual and I think just more free and fluid,\" explained Hughes.",
      "Hughes also noted a recent\u00a0interview where Dapper Dan said there are two kinds of dandy -- \"the ascot dandy and the sweatsuit dandy.\"",
      "\"Ultimately, it's someone who wants to use clothes as armor in a way to impact the way in which people perceive them and fight stereotypes that are sometimes rooted in racism,\" she said.",
      "Dandyism isn't just for men. Janelle Mon\u00e1e, who sits on the Met Gala's host committee, is known for her dandy style, with tailored suits, ornate bowties and oversized hats.",
      "What were past Met Gala themes through the years?",
      "The 2024 Met Gala theme was \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\"\u00a0and the accompanying dress code was \"Garden of Time.\"",
      "Stars wore nature-inspired designs, including lots of nude looks from the likes of Emily Ratajkowski, Mona Patel, Rita Ora and Karol G. Tyla carried an hour glass clutch and wore a gown made of sand, and Doja Cat went for a wet look with dripping mascara and soaked white dress.",
      "In 2023, the gala honored the late designer\u00a0Karl Lagerfeld, with references to his unique style and combination of black, white and leather, as well as his\u00a0beloved cat Choupette.",
      "There was a two-part theme for 2021 and 2022: \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\" and \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion.\" The first part explored the country's evolving culture, and some of the night's designs incorporated masks in wake of the COVID pandemic. The second part celebrated American identity through fashion's eyes, with lots of \"Gilded Glamour.\"",
      "Before that, 2019 brought \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\" and Zendaya's dazzling light-up Cinderella dress, and 2018's theme \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" saw Katy Perry in a giant set of angel wings from Versace.",

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, the music mogul accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and otherwise exploiting women in recurring incidents over multiple decades, is standing trial in New York City this month. Jury selection began Monday, and opening statements are scheduled to follow on May 12.",
      "Combs, 55, faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has been jailed since September, when he was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and at his final pre-trial hearing, rejected a plea deal.",
      "As the trial gets underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know.",
      "Combs will be tried on 5 charges",
      "One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment.",
      "Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts \u2014 one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution \u2014 against him in early April.",
      "The indictment alleges Combs \"engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\" which was \"verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.\" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and the sex workers to be flown to him.",
      "The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \"Freak Offs,\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and sometimes lasted multiple days.",
      "Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment.",
      "In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct.",
      "According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors.",
      "If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him.",
      "His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "\"This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,\" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment.",

      "A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial.",
      "The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage.",
      "Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit.",
      "Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \"Freak Off.\" Combs lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\" between the two.",

      "Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions.",
      "Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors.",
      "In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not \"explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury\" nor acknowledge \"the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs.\"",
      "They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners.",
      "Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were \"utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 16:36:13 -0400",
    "summary": "The Social Security Administration said it will now seek to recoup less money from beneficiaries. Advocates say the revised policy is still burdensome.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration is retreating from a recent policy change on the agency recovering overpayments that sparked concerns it could cause financial hardship for tens of thousands of beneficiaries.",
      "In an April 25 \"emergency message\" to Social Security employees, the agency said it is reducing its overpayment clawback rate to 50% from 100%. The change comes after SSA on March 27 started recovering erroneous overpayments to Social Security recipients by\u00a0taking 100%\u00a0of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up sharply from the prior rate of 10%.",
      "The agency didn't explain its reason for the change, nor immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The 100% clawback policy was directed by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to\u00a0cut costs\u00a0at the agency. Dudek said in a March 7 press release that the change was needed to \"properly safeguard taxpayer funds.\"",
      "The agency's move to recover overpayments has long been a pain point for thousands of beneficiaries who are overpaid each year, with many people unaware they had received a bigger benefit than they were entitled to until receiving notices from the Social Security Administration.",
      "The agency's inspector general found that 73,000 overpayments in 2022 were due to problems with Social Security's own calculations, rather than the fault of the beneficiary.",
      "\"SSA's automated systems could not compute benefit payments due in certain situations, and the Agency did not provide employees with a comprehensive tool to use when they had to manually calculate them. Without adequate automation tools, employees can make errors,\" the inspector general said in a report.",
      "Severe clawbacks cause hardship",
      "Last year, the Biden administration\u00a0capped the clawback rate\u00a0at 10% after reports that some seniors and disabled beneficiaries had been forced into financial hardship, including homelessness, due to the prior 100% clawback rate. But that 10% rate was only effective for about a year, with the the agency returning it to a 100% rate in March.",
      "Those most at risk from the government's stepped-up effort to recover overpayments are the roughly one-third of Social Security recipients who rely on their monthly benefit check for at least 75% of their income. Some seniors have told CBS News they were left\u00a0too financially strapped\u00a0to afford rent, food and other basics.",
      "Many of the overpayments involve disabled workers who receive payments through the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program, whose recipients receive an average of $1,538 per month, said Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.",
      "One SSA\u00a0report found that SSDI has a higher rate of overpayments than the overall Social Security program because disabled recipients sometimes fail to report work income, which can occur if they're not aware they need to disclose extra earnings to the agency. Social Security\u00a0reduces benefits for disabled recipients who earn more than $1,620 a month.",
      "\"While walking back the clawback of overpayments from 100% to 50% is a step in the right direction, taking half of the monthly benefit will still be a burden to many workers with disabilities who receive SSDI,\" Adcock told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"A fifth of all SSDI beneficiaries rely on their benefits for almost all of their income. That means some SSDI recipients are still going to have trouble paying for rent, food, utilities and prescriptions\" with the 50% clawback rate.",
      "The Social Security Administration docked the the benefits of about 670,000 recipients by 10% for overpayment last year, according to KFF.",

      "The Real ID deadline is rapidly approaching. Americans will be required to switch to the enhanced form of identification by Wednesday, May 7, if they want to travel by plane domestically.",
      "If you still need to update your ID you're not alone: CBS data shows that dozens of states are behind on compliance.",
      "An analysis conducted from April 7-18 found that 30 states are less than 70% compliant. Out of all states, New Jersey had the lowest compliance rate in the nation at 17%.",
      "Here's what you need to know to make sure you're ready for the May 7 Real ID deadline.",
      "What is a Real ID?",
      "The Real ID is a federally compliant license, learner permit or nondriver ID card issued by state driver's license agencies. You can tell if a state-issued license or ID card is a Real ID if it has a black or gold star in the upper right corner.",
      "The symbol might look slightly different depending on the state from where it's issued: California, for example, puts its star symbol inside a golden bear.",
      "Who needs a Real ID?",
      "Real or Enhanced IDs are required for those over 18 who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification, unless they want to bring a valid U.S. passport.",
      "When will I need to use a Real ID?",
      "Americans will need to show Real IDs to access certain federal facilities \u2014 including TSA checkpoints \u2014 enter nuclear power plants and board commercial aircraft, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).",
      "Am I required to get a Real ID?",
      "Real or Enhanced IDs are only required for those over 18 without a valid U.S. passport who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification.",
      "That's said, Real IDs are considered a more secure form of identification than a classic driver's license.",
      "The requirement for Real IDs was established by Congress in 2005, following the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that the Federal Government \"set standards for the issuance of sources of identification, such as driver's licenses,\" according to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The deadline for implementation has been delayed several times, although some states started issuing Real IDs as far back as 2009.",
      "You can find more details on Real ID on the DHS' website.",
      "Can I use an Enhanced ID instead of a Real ID?",
      "Five states \u2014 Washington, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Vermont \u2014 issue what is called an\u00a0Enhanced Driver's License\u00a0(EDL), or Enhanced ID. This is considered an acceptable alternative to a Real ID card.",
      "Whereas Real IDs have a star emblem, Enhanced IDs have an image of the U.S. flag in the top right corner or the word \"Enhanced\" at the top of the card.",
      "Both Real IDs and Enhanced IDs are federal documents that allow holders to fly domestically.",
      "Enhanced IDs also allow you to travel from the U.S. to Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean through a land or sea port of entry, without a passport \u2014 something you can't do with a regular Real ID.",
      "How much does a Real ID cost?",
      "Prices vary by state. In\u00a0New York, for example, there is no additional fee for a Real ID beyond the normal transactional cost you pay for a standard license, ID or renewal. Pennsylvania, however, charges a \"one-time $30 Real ID fee\" on top of standard renewal fees. New York charges an additional $30 fee for Enhanced IDs.",
      "It's best to check your state's Real ID guidelines for an accurate estimate of how much you'll pay. The same goes for Enhanced IDs.",
      "How do I get a real ID? Can I apply for one online?",
      "Each state has a driver's licensing agency that issues Real IDs. To find out how to apply where you live, visit the DHS website and click on your state of residence for specific instructions. DHS recommends that you visit your state's driver's licensing agency website to find out exactly what documentation you'll need to brings in order to obtain a REAL ID.",
      "Be sure to plan ahead as some states have longer wait times for DMV appointments.",
      "What if I plan to travel next week but I don't have a real ID yet?",
      "A TSA spokesperson told CBS News Philadelphia that if travelers show up to the airport next Wednesday without a Real ID they may still be able to fly, but getting on board the plane may take longer than usual. The transportation agency recommends that people without a Real ID arrive at the airport three hours early to ensure enough time to get through security.",
      "TSA said it's seeing about 81% compliance at airport checkpoints, meaning approximately four out of every five travelers are showing up with a Real ID-compliant driver's license or another valid form of identification.",
      "\"We don't have concerns at this point about this deadline really impacting operations, especially for those people who again are prepared and have everything they're supposed to have,\" Jessica Mayle, a public affairs specialist at TSA, told CBS Philadelphia.",
      "Are there alternative forms of identification I can use at the airport?",
      "If you don't have a Real ID, TSA has a list of other valid forms of identification you can use to get through an airport checkpoint. This includes passports, permanent resident cards, Enhanced IDs and Global Entry cards.",

      "Since the beginning of the year, more than 550 employees have left the National Weather Service, leaving it down 10% of its staffing levels ahead of hurricane season and the busiest time of year. And the proposed budget released by the White House will cut NOAA, the parent agency of the National Weather Service, by nearly 30%, virtually eliminating NOAA's research functions for weather, limiting ocean data observations and decreasing funding for new satellites, they said.",

      "Some forecast offices might be so short-staffed they have to function only part-time, they warned.",

      "\"It is very unusual that all five of us former directors have agreed upon anything,\" said Friday, who is 86 years old and retired, living in Oklahoma. But collectively, the group felt it was important to the organization and science to share the message, he said.",
      "Specifically, the former NWS directors warned that staffing cuts could have ramifications for airplanes that can't fly without accurate weather observations and forecasts, and ships that rely on storm forecasts to avoid dangerous high seas.

    "summary": "TransUnion, one of the three major credit bureaus, found that one in five student loan borrowers is at risk of defaulting.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of student loan borrowers could face a wake-up call Monday as the Department of Education resumes collecting on school loans. The restart of collections comes as data from a recent analysis shows delinquency rates among people with student debt are at an all-time high.",
      "After nearly five-years since the U.S. government first paused federal student loan payments and interest accrual as a temporary relief measure during the COVID-19 pandemic, May 5 marks the first day the Education Department's\u00a0Office\u00a0of Federal Student Aid (FSA) restarts collections on defaulted federal student loans.",
      "Referrals for collection had been put on hold since March 2020 because of the pandemic.",
      "\"The level of concern here really depends on the reasons a borrower has not paid their federal student loans. If they don't have the capacity, they may be overstretched,\" Michele Raneri, vice president and head of research at TransUnion, said in a statement. \"They may not know they have to pay them, may not be able to find the information on how to do so, or may not have a willingness to pay for one reason or another,\" she said.",
      "Still, one in five borrowers is \"seriously delinquent\" or has a past-due payment of 90 days or more, according to a new analysis by TransUnion, one of the three major credit bureaus. The analysis looks at the percentage of student loan borrowers at risk of default and the impact that has on their credit scores.",
      "Those in default face an uphill battle: Failing to make a payment means\u00a0the government can withhold portions of Social Security benefits and tax refunds and garnish wages. Defaulting on a loan can also tank your credit score, which in turn can make it more difficult to obtain a loan in the future.",
      "Read on for more information about the state of student loan borrowing as default collections resume.",
      "Millions at risk of defaulting",
      "The credit bureau's findings underscore how student loan repayments have struggled to get back on track since COVID-19. Payments on student loans were\u00a0paused\u00a0in March 2020 and didn't\u00a0resume\u00a0until October 2023.",
      "For borrowers across the U.S. who didn't have to worry about making payments for years, the resumption of student loan payments\u00a0presented a challenge\u00a0for many individuals struggling financially.",
      "Out of the 19.6 million student loan borrowers, TransUnion found that roughly 20% are at risk of defaulting. The figure \u2014 which TransUnion estimates could be much higher \u2014 outpaces the credit bureau's previously recorded all-time high of 15.4% in 2012.",
      "For its analysis, TransUnion looked at those susceptible to being 90-days past due on their loans. That winnowed the field of borrowers from roughly 42 million to a total of 19.6 million borrowers. Excluded from this report were people in deferment or forbearance, as well as private student loan borrowers.",
      "As the federal student aid\u00a0website\u00a0outlines, loan servicers can report borrowers who are behind on their loans for 90 days or more to the national credit bureaus.",
      "On average, people who faced default lost an average of 63 points, TransUnion found, although those with higher credit scores were at risk if losing much more. Those in \"super prime\" credit territory \u2014 defined by a spokesperson for TransUnion as a credit score of 781 or higher \u2014 saw an average credit score decline of 175 points as a result of impending student loan defaults.",
      "\"Borrowers can review their credit report to see what loan servicers are reporting,\" Raneri told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This can also help people find who to contact if they have a loan they didn't expect to see.\"",
      "To minimize student loan defaults, prioritizing income-driven repayment (IDR) plans \u2014 which tabulate the monthly payment based on what someone makes and their family size \u2014 along with better outreach to borrowers and automation could go a long way, Pew Charitable Trusts says in an online\u00a0post.",
      "\"Data-sharing could also be used to automatically enroll borrowers into an IDR plan if they fall severely behind on payments, a move that could significantly curb future defaults by connecting borrowers with affordable payments,\"\u00a0wrote\u00a0Regan Fitzgerald, senior manager; Brian Denten, officer; and Ilan Levine, senior associate at Pew's Student Loan Initiative.",
      "All told, the nation's nearly 43 million student loan borrowers hold a collective $1.6 trillion in debt, according to the Education Department. Agency\u00a0data indicates that over 5 million of these borrowers have not made a monthly payment in over 360 days, while only 38% are on track with their repayment plans.",
      "Secretary of Education: Long overdue",
      "Student loan collections were upended during the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, during President Trump's first term in office, the Education Department paused student loan payments and knocked interest rates to zero to give borrowers some breathing room.",
      "When former President Biden took office in 2021, he extended the loan repayment deadline multiple times until Congress passed a law directing payments to resume in October 2023. The Biden administration made several attempts to deliver a student loan debt relief during his time in office, but his efforts were stymied by courts.",
      "While student loan repayments resumed over a year and a half ago, Monday, May 5, is the first day since March 2020 the Department of Education is collecting repayments from borrowers who have struggled to meet their payment deadlines. For U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, the return is long overdue.",
      "\"American taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,\" said McMahon in an April statement. \"The Biden Administration misled borrowers: The executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe debt away, nor do the loan balances simply disappear. Hundreds of billions have already been transferred to taxpayers.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Vietnam War started in 1955, nearly 8,000 miles away from the U.S. in the dense and remote jungles of South Vietnam. While the U.S. slowly deployed into Vietnam in the 1950s, the full deployment of combat units began in 1965.",
      "Fighting would soon spread to Laos and Cambodia, with the CIA recruiting and training thousands of Hmong people to fight on behalf of Americans during a clandestine operation in Laos known as the \"Secret War.\"",
      "But the effort to stop the spread of communism in Southeast Asia failed on April 30, 1975 with the fall of Saigon, when U.S. troops evacuated the country. According to the National Archive, more than 58,220 Americans were killed in the war.",
      "As many as 3.5 million Vietnamese people were killed, including soldiers on both sides of the conflict and civilians.",

      "In October 1975, Minnesota had received the highest number of Southeast Asian refugees in the Midwest, according to then-Gov. Wendell Anderson.",
      "But the governor was thinking, long-term, how would these refugees get the services they needed in the state? What kind of help would they need in the future? And how would they adapt and succeed in a place with a completely different culture and language?",
      "In December 1975, Anderson established the Indochinese Resettlement Office, which later became the Refugee Programs Office in 1981. The office worked with groups like Catholic Charities, Lutheran Social Services and the American Red Cross, along with local families, church groups and community organizations to sponsor refugee families and helped them settle into their new homes.",
      "Anderson also created the Indochinese Refugee Task Force to advise his office, which included representatives from social service organizations, the Vietnamese-American Association, the Cambodian refugee community, the departments of welfare, employment services and education, and the private sector.",
      "The task force had two main jobs: Collect data about Southeast Asian households in the state and provide information about classes, programs and recent laws to the refugee community.",
      "The task force would also later make efforts to address racial discrimination, hiring bias and language barriers that refugees faced when arriving in Minnesota.",
      "Best estimates show\u00a0that today in Minnesota, there are more than 16,000 Laotian immigrants; more than 33,000 Vietnamese immigrants; and nearly 12,000 Cambodian immigrants.",

      "\"Flew missions into different parts of Laos, and I flew in American military operative, translate for them, talk to troops on the ground and relayed it to the American troops,\" Wong said. \"I was traveling with so they could relay it back to the base or the headquarter and call for support.\"",

      "\"I was able to communicate and translate for people, so I'd be busy day and night,\" he said. \"We'd be at the hospital, the clinic, at the airport.\"",
      "Wong would spend years working for refugee programs with Lutheran Social Services and the state, helping people find jobs and working with employers to create those jobs.",
      "He'd also advocate for policy changes in support of refugees, all while traveling across Minnesota, and eventually across the country, to break down barriers and to educate others on the Hmong people.",
      "These days, Wong owns several commercial buildings across the Twin Cities, and also has his sights set on building more affordable housing for all Minnesota families.",
      "\"I don't think I'll ever retire. I think I will continue to advocate for our community and to work and contribute back to our community, as well as the community at large,\" he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 12:42:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A Houthi missile struck Ben-Gurion airport Sunday for the first time since the war began, briefly closing it just as Israel voted to expand Gaza operations.",
    "story": [
      "Israel's government approved plans on Monday for its forces to capture the entire Gaza Strip and remain in the territory for an unspecified amount of time, two Israeli officials told The Associated Press. The plans appear set to vastly expand Israel's operations in the war-torn Palestinian territory, and they're likely to bring fierce international opposition.",
      "Israeli Cabinet ministers approved the plan in an early morning vote, just after the Israeli military chief said the army was calling up tens of thousands of reserve soldiers for an expanded assault on the strip.",
      "The news came hours after a Sunday\u00a0Houthi missile strike targeted Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion airport for the first time since the war began, briefly halting flights and lightly wounding four people. Israeli officials quickly vowed to respond.",
      "Israel's expansion plan, which the officials told the AP is meant to help achieve the country's war aims of defeating Hamas and freeing hostages still held in Gaza, would push hundreds of thousands of Palestinians into southern Gaza, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian crisis in the enclave.",
      "In a video message posted Monday on social media, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not confirm the intention for Israel's military to seize control of the entire strip, but he said the operation would be \"intensive.\"",
      "The European Union was among the first international entities to voice concern over the prospect of expanded Israeli military operations in Gaza, with spokesman Anouar el-Anouni saying an escalation would \"result in further casualties and suffering for the Palestinian population,\" and urging Israeli forces \"to exercise the utmost restraint,\" according to the French news agency AFP.",
      "Since a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas collapsed in mid-March with a renewed Israeli assault, the Israel Defense Forces have unleashed fierce strikes on the territory that have killed hundreds. The IDF has captured swathes of territory and now controls roughly half of Gaza. Before the truce ended, Israel halted all humanitarian aid into Gaza, including food, fuel and water, setting off what is believed to the be the worst humanitarian crisis in nearly 19 months of war.",
      "The ban on aid has prompted widespread hunger and shortages have set off looting, according to aid agencies that work in the enclave.",
      "The Israeli officials said the plan included the \"capturing of the strip and the holding of territories.\"",
      "With the plan, the officials said Israel also wants to keep Hamas from distributing humanitarian aid in the enclave it's controlled for nearly two decades, which Israel says strengthens its rule over Gaza. Israeli officials have accused Hamas of keeping aid materials for itself, to bolsters its capabilities. The plan also includes more powerful strikes against Hamas targets, the officials said.",
      "They added that Israel was in touch with several countries about President Trump's plan for the U.S. to \"take over\" Gaza and relocate its population of about 2 million Palestinians. Israeli officials have said it will entail \"voluntary emigration,\" but the suggestion that so many civilians could be moved out of the territory has sparked condemnation from Israel's allies in Europe, and from its Arab neighbors, who Mr. Trump said would take in the relocated masses.",
      "In his video message on Monday, Netanyahu said Gaza's \"population will be moved, for its own protection,\" without offering details.",
      "Asked Monday about the Israeli plans, U.S. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said President Trump remained \"committed to securing the immediate release of hostages and an end to Hamas rule in Gaza,\" reiterating the White House's stance that \"Hamas bears sole responsibility for this conflict, and for the resumption of hostilities.\"",
      "One of the Israeli officials told the AP the plan would be implemented gradually. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing secret military plans.",
      "Israel has tried for weeks to ratchet up pressure on Hamas to show more flexibility in ceasefire negotiations. But international mediators trying to bring the sides toward a new deal have struggled to do so. Israel's measures \u2014 most notably the ongoing strikes and the complete blockade on aid and other materials entering Gaza \u2014 do not appear to have moved Hamas away from its negotiating positions. The group, long designated a terrorist organization by Israel, the U.S. and the European Union, has demanded that Israel agree to a complete withdrawal from Gaza as part of any lasting ceasefire.",
      "The previous ceasefire was meant to lead the sides to negotiate an end to the war, but that goal has been a repeated sticking point in talks between Israel and Hamas. Israel says it won't agree to end the war until Hamas is defeated.",
      "Israel's announcement of an expansion of military operations angered families of the remaining Israeli hostages. The Hostage Families Forum, which supports the families, said Monday that the plan puts every hostage at risk and urged Israel's decision-makers to secure a deal that prioritizes the hostages, as many as 24 of whom Israeli officials believe are still alive.",
      "At a committee meeting of Israeli lawmakers on Monday, Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is among the hostages still in Gaza, called on soldiers \"not to report for reserve duty for moral and ethical reasons.\"",
      "The Israeli officials did not disclose details of how the plan seeks to prevent Hamas from involvement in aid distribution. One said the ministers had approved \"the option of aid distribution,\" without elaborating.",
      "According to an internal memo circulated among aid groups and seen by the AP, Israel has told the United Nations that it will use private security companies to control aid distribution inside Gaza. The U.N., in a statement Sunday, said it would not participate in the plan as it was presented, saying it violates its core principles.",
      "The memo, sent to aid organizations on Sunday, detailed notes from a meeting between the Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating aid for Gaza, COGAT and the U.N.",
      "Under COGAT's envisioned plan, all aid would enter Gaza through the southern Kerem Shalom crossing, including approximately 60 trucks per day, although the convoys' contents were not made clear, nor were how many people would have access to the aid coming in. Previously, the U.N. and other aid providers have said hundreds of trucks per day are needed to bring food and other vital materials into Gaza.",
      "The memo said the aid would be distributed at logistics hubs run by private security companies, and that facial recognition would be used to identify Palestinians at the hubs and SMS alerts would be used to notify people in the area that they could come to collect aid.",
      "Aid workers say the plan to centralize aid, rather than delivering it to Palestinians where they are, will forcibly displace more people. The fighting has already displaced more than 90% of Gaza's population, often multiple times, and turned much of Gaza into an uninhabitable moonscape.",
      "The U.N. said the plan would leave large parts of the population, including the most vulnerable, without supplies. It said the plan \"appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic \u2014 as part of a military strategy.\"",
      "In a statement on Monday, Hamas said it firmly rejected the Israeli plan to control aid distribution, calling it a plan \"to turn aid into a tool for political blackmail or subject it to Israel's conditions,\" which it said \"constitutes a violation of international law and an extension of the starvation policy.\"",
      "The memo says the U.S. government has voiced clear support for Israel's plan, but it's unclear who would provide funding for the private military companies or the aid. COGAT and the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Israeli officials have repeatedly denied a humanitarian crisis in Gaza and said there is sufficient food in the territory, blaming Hamas for failing to distribute it to civilians.",
      "Earlier this week, The Associated Press obtained dozens of documents about aid groups' concerns that the aid distribution hubs could end up permanently displacing Palestinians and forcing them to live in \"de facto internment conditions.\"",
      "Capturing and potentially occupying Gaza again for an indefinite period would not only further dash hopes for Palestinian statehood, it would embed Israel inside a population that is deeply hostile to it and raise questions about how Israel plans to govern the territory, especially at a time when it is considering how to implement President Trump's vision for Gaza.",
      "Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack on southern Israel, during which 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken as hostages back into Gaza. The Israeli offensive has killed more than 52,000 people in Gaza, many of them women and children, according to Palestinian health officials in the Hamas-ruled territory, who do not distinguish between combatants and civilians.",
      "Israel occupied Gaza during a war in 1967 but withdrew troops and settlers from the enclave in 2005. Two years later, Hamas took over and has controlled the territory since.",

    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 12:27:52 -0400",
    "summary": "The aircraft crashed into a lagoon infested with anacondas and alligators, forcing the pilot and four passengers \u2014 including a 6-year-old boy \u2014 to cling to the plane's wreckage.",
    "story": [
      "It was after their tiny plane crashed into the Bolivian jungle earlier this week that their ordeal really began.",
      "After smashing into the ground, the aircraft flipped over into a lagoon infested with anacondas and alligators, plunging the pilot and four passengers \u2014 including a 6-year-old boy \u2014 into a harrowing 36 hours spent clinging to the plane's wreckage before being rescued Friday in the northeast of this Andean nation.",
      "The doctor who treated the five survivors told The Associated Press on Saturday all were conscious and in stable condition, with only the young boy's 37-year-old aunt still hospitalized for an infected gash to her head. The rest were discharged and recovering from dehydration, minor chemical burns, infected cuts, bruises and insect bites all over their bodies.",
      "Bolivia's civil defense vice ministry released dramatic video and images of the group being rescued on Friday.",
      "\"We couldn't believe it, that they weren't attacked and left for dead,\" Dr. Luis Soruco, director of the hospital where the survivors were delivered in Bolivia's tropical Beni province, said by phone after sending the pilot and two of the women home with a strong course of antibiotics.",
      "The pilot, 27-year-old Pablo Andr\u00e9s Velarde, emerged Friday to tell the story that has transfixed many Bolivians \u2014 a rare piece of uplifting news for a nation badly in need of it after years of a spiraling economic and political crisis.",
      "\"The mosquitoes wouldn't let us sleep,\" Velarde told reporters from his hospital cot in the provincial capital of Trinidad, where Dr. Soruco said he was in surprisingly good health and spirits. \"The alligators and snakes watched us all night, but they didn't come close.\"",
      "Shocked that the caimans, a species of the alligator family native to Central and South America, didn't lunge at them, Velarde speculated it was the stench of jet fuel spilling from the wreckage that had kept the predatory reptiles at bay, although there's no scientific proof that's an effective alligator repellent.",
      "Velarde said that the five of them survived by eating ground cassava flour that one of the women had brought as a snack. They had nothing to drink \u2014 the lagoon water was filled with gasoline.",
      "The small plane had set off Wednesday from the Bolivian village of Baures, bound for the bigger town of Trinidad farther south, where Patricia Coria Guary had a medical check-up scheduled for her 6-year-old nephew at the pediatric hospital, Dr. Soruco said. Two other women, neighbors from Baures ages 32 and 54, joined them.",
      "Such flights are a common form of transportation in this remote Amazonian region carved with rivers. Heavy rains wash away unpaved roads this time of year.",
      "But just 27 minutes \u2014 almost halfway \u2014 into the flight, the plane's lone engine cut out. Velarde said he reported their imminent crash over a portable radio to a colleague.",
      "He recalled in interviews with local media that he scanned the vast emerald green canopy below him and aimed for a clearing near a lagoon.",
      "\"There was no ranch or road along the route,\" he said. \"It was just swamp.\"",
      "Instead of skidding across the shore as planned, the plane smashed into the ground and flipped upside down \u2014 injuring everyone on board and leaving Coria Guary with an especially deep cut to her forehead \u2014 before splashing into the water.",
      "\"The landing was very rough,\" Velarde said.",
      "As the plane flooded, the five of them managed to clamber on top of the fuselage, where they stayed for two terrifying nights surrounded by caimans and anacondas and attacked by swarms of mosquitoes and other insects.",
      "They waved shirts and sheets to no avail and screamed each time they heard the thud of propellers or revving of a boat engine. On Friday, at the sound of approaching motorboats, \"we started shining our cell phone flashlights and shouting,\" Velarde said.",
      "A group of fishermen noticed, and helped them into their canoe. They called the authorities and delivered them to an army helicopter some hours later.",
      "\"We couldn't have handled it one more night,\" Velarde said.",
      "Bolivia's civil defense vice minister hailed the rescue operation.",
      "\"We're proud of the work our rescue team does. Their dedication and professionalism have allowed the lives of the crew of the stranded aircraft to be saved,\" Minister Edmundo Novillo said in a statement. \"This success is an example of the capability and efficiency of our Armed and Civil Defense Forces in emergency situations.\"",

      "Poachers in South Africa killed more than 100 rhinos in the first three months of this year, most of them inside national parks \u2014 highlighting an ongoing battle to protect one of the best-known endangered species.",
      "South African Environment Minister Dion George announced the figures on Monday and said that 65 of the 103 rhinos killed between Jan. 1 and March 31 were poached in national parks.",
      "The average of more than one rhino killed a day is in line with last year's count and \"a stark reminder of the relentless threat to our wildlife,\" George said.",
      "South Africa has the largest rhino population in the world, with an estimated 16,000 to 18,000 animals, according to conservation groups. That includes black and white rhinos.",
      "Black rhinos are only found in the wild in Africa and are listed as critically endangered, with around 6,400 left, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Around 2,000 are in South Africa.",
      "\"In the last decade, poachers have killed almost 10,000 rhinos across Africa to feed the demand for horn on the black market,\" the IUCN says.",
      "The organization says rhino horn is \"a lucrative, illicit commodity sought after by well-established, organized and powerful transnational criminal syndicates.\" There is demand for horn in Asia, particularly in Vietnam and China, which continues to threaten all five species of rhino, it says.",
      "South African authorities have focused in recent years on criminal syndicates they believe are behind much of the country's rhino poaching. The environment ministry hailed a conviction last year of what it called a poaching \"kingpin\" from Mozambique. Simon Ernesto Valoi was sentenced to 27 years in prison by a Mozambique court for running an operation poaching rhinos in South Africa's huge Kruger National Park, which borders Mozambique.",

    "story": [
      "Pope Francis' death on April 21, the day after Easter Sunday, started off a series of traditions that will soon culminate in a vote for the next pope. His successor will be decided by the Catholic Church's cardinal electors, a group of 133 cardinals under the age of 80, who are set to\u00a0begin their conclave\u00a0on May 7 to hold a secretive election for the next pontiff.",
      "\"Every papal conclave comes down, in some sense, to a referendum on the papacy that has just ended,\" John Allen, a longtime observer of the Vatican and editor of the Catholic news site \"Crux,\" said. Several of the likely frontrunners would represent continuity with the direction set\u00a0by Pope Francis, he said, while others would signal \"a change in a slightly more traditional, conservative direction.\"",
      "No matter their leanings, Allen said, the cardinal electors will be looking for someone who can equal Pope Francis' stature on the world stage. \"They want, in part, someone who can have the same capacity to make it absolutely impossible for the wider world to ignore what the Catholic Church has to say.\"",
      "Over the last 600 years \u2014 since 1378 \u2014 cardinals have been chosen for the position, although eligibility technically extends to any male Roman Catholic who has been baptized.",
      "Here is look at some of the cardinals considered possible contenders to become pope:",
      "Cardinal Peter Erdo, archbishop of Budapest, Hungary",
      "Cardinal Peter Erdo, a 72-year-old canon lawyer, is the highest ranking Catholic leader in a country that is 80% Christian. He is known for his support of the pope's outreach to Orthodox Christians.",
      "Erdo is also on the conservative side of the European cultural divide. On migration, a key issue for Hungary, he has conveyed a balanced approach, recognizing the right to migrate but also the importance of ensuring political stability.",
      "Erdo is considered a traditionalist but is also respected by liberals, which could make him a unifying force within the church.",
      "Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo, archbishop of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo",
      "Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo, president of the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar, grew global attention for leading African bishops in unanimous rejection of \"Fiducia Supplicans,\" a declaration the Vatican issued in 2023 that included guidelines on the blessings of people in same-sex relationships.",
      "At 65 years old, he is known as a supporter of orthodoxy and defends priestly celibacy and the church's moral teachings. He is also known as a promoter of social justice and a champion of the poor and voiceless, and is outspoken in his criticism of the Congolese government.",
      "If elected he would be the first African chosen to lead the Catholic Church in more than 1,500 years. The last African pontiff was Pope Gelasius, who died in 496 after leading the church for a little over three years.",
      "Cardinal Mario Grech, secretary general for the Synod of Bishops",
      "Cardinal Mario Grech, 68, is a canon lawyer who has major influence on how synods in the church are run. Supporters have praised him for leading the charge in implementing a more consultative and inclusive approach to church governance.",
      "Grech comes from Malta, which is one of the smallest countries in the world.",
      "Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state",
      "Cardinal Pietro Parolin, 70, is second-in-command at the Vatican and a career diplomat who has consistently risen above any turbulence marking the pontificate.",
      "He is regarded as a moderate who, if elected, could repair rifts inside the church. He is also considered a progressive with a global vision.",
      "Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, Latin patriarch of Jerusalem",
      "Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, 60, is a pastoral candidate who has spoken out amid the Israel-Hamas war and visited Gaza during the conflict.",
      "He is a proponent of social justice and sees himself as a servant of the people. He is similar to Francis in his concern for migrants, interfaith dialogue and his disdain for clericalism.",
      "Cardinal Luis Tagle of the Philippines",
      "Cardinal Luis Tagle, 67, and pro-prefect for the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, is known as the \"Asian Francis\" for his missionary spirit as well as his emphasis on caring for the poor and welcoming of LGBTQ and divorced and remarried Catholics.",
      "He is the former archbishop of Manila, in the Philippines, which is one of the most Catholic countries on the continent of Asia, and studied in the U.S. for seven years. His election would signal a continuation of Francis' pontificate.",
      "Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, archbishop of Bologna, Italy",
      "Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, 69, is the president of the Italian bishops conference. He is known as a \"street priest\" and missionary and wants a church that listens to the faithful and is willing to modernize. Zuppi is inclusive of same-sex couples, as well as people of different religions.",
      "Francis chose Zuppi as his envoy to Russia and Ukraine, as well as to the West Bank and Beijing, to promote peace.",
      "Cardinal Anders Arborelius, archbishop of Stockholm",
      "Cardinal Anders Arborelius, 75, was raised Lutheran and converted to Catholicism at the age of 20. He is the first ever cardinal from Scandinavia.",
      "He is also a traditionalist on the church's teaching on sexual ethics and gender, and has a strong concern for the environment.",
      "Arborelius has been a proponent of immigration into Sweden, calling for dialogue and integration instead of restrictions.",
      "Cardinal Gerald Cyprien Lacroix of Quebec",
      "Cardinal G\u00e9rald Cyprien Lacroix, Metropolitan Archbishop of Quebec, Canada, is 67 years old. Earlier in his career he spent years as a missionary and seminary professor in Colombia.",
      "He temporarily stepped back from his duties amid sexual abuse allegations, which he denied, and returned to his duties last year after a church-led investigation found no evidence of misconduct.",
      "Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana",
      "Conservative-leaning Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana would, like Ambongo, be the Catholic Church's first contemporary African pope if selected.",
      "But the Ghanaian, who was the first man from his country to be made a cardinal, is considered a less hard-line conservative than his Congolese counterpart.",
      "The 76-year-old has opposed the criminalization of homosexual relationships in Africa, including in his home country.",
      "In 2012, he was criticized for fear-mongering about Islam in Europe during a Vatican conference, and he later apologized.",
      "The following year, he told BBC News he didn't want the Catholic Church's top job, saying, \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope.\"",

      "The BRP Miguel Malvar, which was decommissioned by the Philippine navy in 2021, took on water while being towed in rough waters facing the disputed South China Sea and sank about 30 nautical miles off the western Philippine province of Zambales. Nobody was onboard when the ship listed then sank, the Philippine military said.",
      "American and Philippine forces would proceed with other live-fire maneuvers off Zambales on Monday despite the premature sinking of the Malvar. The ship was built as a patrol vessel for the U.S. Navy in the 1940s and was transferred to Vietnam's navy before the Philippine military acquired it, Philippine navy Capt. John Percie Alcos said.",
      "\"It's an 80-year-old dilapidated ship and it wasn't able to withstand the rough seas,\" Philippine Lt. Col. John Paul Salgado told The Associated Press.",
      "Originally named the USS Brattleboro, the ship was in service for the U.S. Navy for more than 20 years. It was heavily involved in the Battle of Okinawa where the vessel \"treated over 200 badly wounded men and rescued in excess of 1,000 survivors of ships that sank,\" according to the U.S. Navy. Brattleboro earned three battle stars during World War II.",
      "The vessel was sold to the Republic of Vietnam in 1966, the U.S. Navy said. The Philippine Navy acquired and refurbished the ship after its crew fled Vietnam following the 1975 fall of Saigon, according to Agence France-Presse.",
      "The ship-sinking exercise was planned in an offshore area facing the hotly disputed Scarborough Shoal, which has been closely guarded by the Chinese coast guard, navy and suspected militia ships.",
      "The Philippines also claims the fishing atoll, which lies about 137 miles west of Zambales. Chinese and the Philippine forces have had increasingly hostile confrontations in the waters and airspace of Scarborough in recent years.",

It was supposed to be one of the highlights of largescale annual military exercises by the United States and the Philippines from April 21 to May 9 with about 14,000 U.S. and Filipino forces participating.",
      "Called Balikatan, Tagalog for shoulder-to-shoulder, the combat drills have increasingly focused on the defense of Philippine sovereignty in the face of China's growing aggression in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims virtually in its entirety.",
      "Mock battle scenes which have been staged so far, including the retaking of an island from hostile forces, have reflected assurances by the Trump administration, including by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, that the U.S. would abide by its treaty commitment to defend the Philippines in case Filipino forces come under an armed attack, including in the South China Sea.",
      "On Sunday, U.S., Australian and Philippine forces practiced retaking an island from hostile forces in the coastal town of Balabac in western Palawan province, which faces the South China Sea.",
      "Japanese forces and British marines joined as observers of the combat exercise, which \"showcased the growing interoperability and cohesion among partner nations in maintaining regional security,\" Salgado said.",

    "summary": "As a fireworks expert tests the Vatican's contemporary system for \"holy smoke,\" Catholic cardinals mull their divergent priorities for Pope Francis' successor.",
    "story": [
      "Rome \u2014 It's been called \"holy smoke.\" And it's color coded.",
      "Black and white plumes puffed from canisters over the weekend as pyrotechnics expert Massimiliano De Sanctis tested the mechanism that will signal the fate of the Catholic Church, and who will be the next man to lead its 1.4 billion followers.",
      "If the smoke that emerges from the chimney at the Sistine Chapel is black, it will mean the 133 cardinal electors inside for the papal conclave will continue voting. When it is white, it means they have elected the heir to St. Peter \u2014 and more recently, to Pope Francis.",
      "''Until the election of Pope Benedict XVI, the smoke was carried out in the traditional way,\" explained De Sanctis, who owns the FD Group Fireworks company. \"Ballots were burned to make black smoke and ballots were burned together with wet straw to make white smoke. But the Vatican realized that the smoke was not particularly intense, so it had an electrical control unit designed that controlled the classic pyrotechnic smoke.''",
      "The nine-day mourning period for the late Pope Francis, who died at the age of 88 on April 21 after 12 years leading the Catholic Church, officially came to an end Monday. As that period, known by its Latin name Novemdiales, came to an end, dozens of cardinals, carpenters and pyrotechnics experts were already at work preparing for the conclave to elect Francis' successor.",
      "Vatican firefighters installed the chimney at the Sistine Chapel over the weekend, along with the small stove in which the cardinals will burn their crumpled up ballots after each vote. The voting continues, with one round on the first day of the conclave and then up to four daily until one proves conclusive, with a new pontiff being chosen by a majority of two-thirds plus one of the 133 electors.",
      "Different ideologies at play as cardinals mull next Catholic leader",
      "That secretive process begins Wednesday, with the first vote, but the cardinal electors have already begun descending on Vatican City from across the world. And with them, comes the intrigue of the political campaign-like process of selecting one of their own to lead the church forward.",
      "Some of the believed front-runners among the cardinals would be expected to align with the policies and philosophies of Pope Francis if they were to get the Catholic Church's top job, including newly-minted Swedish Cardinal Anders Arborelius. He told CBS News over the weekend about meeting with many of his fellow cardinals for the first time.",
      "\"I must say, I'm surprised that it's so peaceful and such a friendly atmosphere,\" he said. \"If you read the papers, you get the idea that there are two parties fighting for power.\"",
      "\"Of course there are different points of view,\" acknowledged Arborelius, who is attending his first conclave. \"It's natural.\"",
      "Much like Francis was, Arborelius is a strong supporter of immigrants' rights. He said migrants to Europe have helped to keep Catholicism alive and well on the continent, making them \"very important for the church.\"",
      "\"I know there are exceptions, but still, we live in a global time, and it's nearly impossible to stop migration. And we need it also, I mean, in healthcare, care for elderly people, taxi drivers,\" he said, adding that, \"of course, there has to be some kind of order, some kind of harmonious migration and integration\" to ensure immigrant populations can thrive.",
      "The Swedish cardinal also hopes Francis' successor will push to integrate women \u2014 to a limited degree \u2014 more into the church's operations.",
      "\"Some people are very eager to have female priests,\" acknowledged Arborelius. \"But we cannot have that. So, it's important to show and to help women to find the positions and the work that they can do in the church.\"",
      "Asked why he, like Francis, backed more roles for women, but not priesthood, the cardinal said that, \"according to our faith, Christ as a man is the icon of what it is to be a priest. Mary is the icon of what a woman can be in the church.\"",
      "\"Of course, nowadays it's not easy to explain that,\" he said, noting the example of the Lutheran Church in Sweden, which he said now has \"more female ministers than male.\"",
      "\"So that's one of our tasks \u2014 to show that women have a very important place in the church, but we have to show what they can do and how they can do it. And I think Pope Francis has started this. For instance, now they always say in the Vatican state they have a prime minister who is a sister, Sister Rafaela. And on many issues, for instance I'm also a member of the Council of Economy, we have six ... experts in economy, all women, who help us to clear up the mess of the economy in the Vatican. So, I think there are many important tasks where a woman could do very much in order to help the church in the society of today.\"",
      "Others among the senior prelates gathering at the Vatican, however, have been openly critical of Francis, including German Cardinal Gerhard Muller, who has been a staunch defender of traditional Catholic doctrine.",
      "\"Gay marriage is not possible, it's absolutely against the word of God,\" he told CBS News, adding that in his view, that impossibility extends to the practice of priests blessing same-sex unions \u2014 which Francis green-lighted in a landmark decision almost two years ago.",
      "\"We cannot have a blessing in the sense of justifying of a behavior or of a lifestyle which is against the reason God Himself gave,\" Muller told CBS News, adding that he believes the next pope must bring more clarity to interpreting Catholic doctrine, \"I think not only for me, but for all the Catholics in the world.\"",
      "It's possible that that diversity in viewpoints among the cardinal electors inside the Sistine Chapel could lead to a drawn-out conclave.",
      "In recent times, cardinals have decided on a new pope in just two to three days.",
      "The longest-ever conclave took place during the 13th century, in the nearby city of Viterbo. It lasted for nearly three years, and locals became so frustrated with the dithering that they removed the roof from the building where the cardinals were staying. They eventually elected Pope Gregory X.",

    "story": [
      "The reign of Pope Francis is over, and as the Catholic Church mourns his death, it is also looking to the future. Two days after\u00a0the pope's funeral, the Vatican confirmed that a\u00a0papal conclave will begin on May 7 to choose his successor.",
      "The question now turns to which man \u2014 and it will be a man, as women cannot be ordained priests in the Catholic Church \u2014 will emerge and step onto the balcony in papal regalia to greet the crowds massed in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican.",
      "Below is a look inside the conclave process, with a step-by-step breakdown of how the next pope will be chosen and anointed under Michelangelo's iconic fresco on the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel.",
      "What is the papal conclave, exactly?",
      "The papal conclave is the closely guarded gathering of the cardinal electors \u2014 all serving cardinals under the age of 80 \u2014 to elect the next pope.",
      "The exact number varies, but of the 135 cardinals eligible to serve as electors right now, the Vatican has confirmed that 133 of them will gather from around the world to choose the successor to Pope Francis. One, Italian Cardinal Angelo Becciu, has said he will not enter the conclave after being sentenced to 5-1/2 years in jail by a Vatican court in 2023 for embezzlement and fraud. He has denied all wrongdoing and remains free pending an appeal to the Vatican court, but said on April 29 that he would not take part in the conclave.",
      "Of all the current cardinal electors, a large majority \u2014 108 \u2014 were appointed by Pope Francis during his 12-year papacy. They come from 71 different countries, including 10 from the United States.",
      "When will the papal conclave begin?",
      "The Vatican has announced that the conclave will begin on Wednesday, May 7.",
      "Under church rules, it must start 15 to 20 days after a pope's death; Pope Francis died on April 21.",
      "Ahead of the conclave, on May 5, Vatican officials and employees who will help support the process, including other clergy, security personnel, drivers, cleaning crews, doctors and nurses, must take an oath of secrecy.",
      "How does the papal conclave work?",
      "How this assembly proceeds to choose the next pope is a process that dates back hundreds of years \u2014 an intricate, choreographed procession of rituals and ballots.",
      "On the first day of the papal conclave, the cardinal electors will shut themselves off from the outside world and begin the momentous task of choosing \u2014 likely from among their own ranks \u2014 the man who will become the 267th Bishop of Rome, better known as the pope.",
      "On Day One, the cardinals celebrate a morning Mass in St. Peter's Basilica. In the afternoon, they walk in a solemn procession into the Sistine Chapel, which will have undergone a security sweep to check for any illicit recording devices before their arrival.",
      "For centuries, the cardinal electors were physically locked inside the Sistine Chapel until they elected a new pontiff, left to eat and sleep beneath Michelangelo's vivid Renaissance masterpiece. These days, they do leave to rest and share meals at Santa Marta House \u2014 a hotel-like residence inside Vatican City where Francis had his own personal apartment during his pontificate \u2014 for however many days it takes them to come to a decision.",
      "Once the cardinals have all filed into the chapel, its great bronze doors are dramatically closed and sealed, and the first day's voting begins.",
      "How does the voting for a new pope work?",
      "The cardinals will have already discussed the merits of each papal prospect during days of \"general congregations\" at the Vatican before the conclave, but now the voting begins. Choosing the new pope requires not just a majority, but a two-thirds plus-one vote among the cardinal electors for a candidate to win. Pope Benedict XVI, who led the church prior to Francis, raised the threshold and enshrined the two-thirds requirement into church law two days before he stepped down.",
      "Each cardinal must swear an oath of absolute secrecy before they vote. If they disclose any information from within the conclave they will be excommunicated by the church.",
      "To vote, each cardinal writes their chosen candidate's name on a ballot, disguising his handwriting, then walks to an altar at the front of the chapel and deposits the paper onto a ceremonial plate. He then tips the ballot from the plate into a chalice-urn.",
      "As they are counted and the handwritten entries recorded by three cardinals at the altar, known as scrutineers, the ballots are deposited into another urn.",
      "A third urn, made of gilded bronze and silver and adorned with Christian imagery, is used to ferry ballots from any cardinals too ill to leave their sleeping quarters to the chapel for counting.",
      "After the first vote is held on the first afternoon, the cardinals' ballots are placed into one of two small ovens inside the Sistine Chapel and burned. A plume of smoke flows up a chimney and into the air over St. Peter's Square, watched for eagerly by the faithful, and the world's media.",
      "If that round of voting yields no winner, the smoke will be black \u2014 a sign to the world that the Holy See remains vacant.",
      "How long can a conclave last?",
      "The voting process will repeat itself the following day, with the cardinals holding two ballots in the morning and two in the afternoon. If the morning sessions are inconclusive, black smoke will be seen again around lunchtime \u2014 early morning on the U.S. East Coast.",
      "If there's still no winner following the afternoon votes, more black smoke will stream into the early evening Roman sky.",
      "If there's no two-thirds majority after three days, voting is paused for a day to allow time for prayer, discussion and a \"brief spiritual exhortation\" by the senior cardinal in the Order of Deacons.",
      "Then the voting process resumes. A conclave will last until enough of the cardinal electors agree on a choice for the next pope.",
      "How long has it taken to choose a new pope in the past?",
      "The longest conclave in history was the one that brought Pope Gregory X to the papacy in 1281. It lasted almost three years from the time the cardinals first began their voting.",
      "Recent conclaves, however, have lasted just days. Pope John Paul II needed eight ballots, over two days, to become the pontiff in 1978. His successor, Benedict XVI, was chosen on the fourth ballot, after two days, in 2005.",
      "Francis, in 2013, needed a mere five ballots, with the voting taking just 24 hours.",
      "What will happen once the conclave chooses the next pope?",
      "When enough cardinals agree on a candidate and the vote reaches the two-thirds-plus-one threshold, the chosen man is asked if he accepts the role. He will acknowledge by simply saying the word for \"I accept\" in Latin: \"Accepto.\"",
      "At that point, he becomes the new pope and will state his chosen pontifical name before the assembled cardinals. The most common papal name has been John, used 21 times. Others, including Simplicius, Hilarius and Zosimus, have only ever been used once. Pope Francis was also the first to choose his papal name.",
      "The ballots are then burned in the stove, but this time, a chemical additive is left out to create the much-anticipated plume of \"fumata bianca,\" white smoke.",
      "There has been confusion during some past conclaves over the color of the smoke rising over the chapel, so two conclaves ago, in 2005, a new tradition began. In addition to the white smoke, bells now chime, heralding the news that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.",
      "The new pope then immediately goes into a chamber adjoining the Sistine Chapel to be clad in the papal robes.",
      "As the faithful and the curious crowd into St. Peter's Square below, the cardinal deacon steps out onto the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica to introduce the new pontiff with the famous phrase, \"Habemus papa\" \u2014 We have a pope.",
      "Finally, the new leader of the Catholic Church emerges into the spotlight to deliver his first blessing.",

      "An eyewitness in Swindon told the BBC they saw six men go into a cafe and order coffee and donuts before following a suspect who had been inside out of the business, where they \"jumped on him.\"",
      "Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said police were still working to establish a motive, \"as well as to identify whether there may be any further risk to the public.\"",

      "Sunday marked the end of a formal mourning period in the Catholic Church for Pope Francis, who died April 21 after 12 years in the papacy. He was 88. The pontiff's death catalyzed an extensive list of traditions dating back centuries, one of which is Novemdiales, a nine-day period of mourning that began with his funeral in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican.",
      "The schedule for Novemdiales included daily masses inside St. Peter's Basilica, each presided over by a different cardinal and dedicated to the late pope. Sunday's mass was headed by Cardinal Dominique Mamberti, a senior deacon in the College of Cardinals that serves as advisers to the pope and steers the process of electing a replacement when the position is vacant.",
      "Like most processions held throughout the mourning phase, hundreds of cardinals attended the final event along with crowds of laypeople who packed into the cathedral. The Vatican shared a livestream of the mass on Sunday as it has done every day of Novemdiales.",
      "Mamberti led the mass in Italian, as a choir sang hymns and a number of others stepped up to the altar to sing or give remarks.",
      "\"We have all admired how Pope Francis, animated by the love of the lord and carried by his grace, was faithful to his mission until the extreme consumption of his strength,\" said Mamberti, in part of the homily translated to English by a moderator. \"He admonished the powerful, that they must obey god rather than man, and proclaimed to all humanity the joy of the gospel.\"",
      "Remembered for challenging long-held norms within the church, Francis died of a stroke on Easter Monday that led to a coma and heart failure, the Vatican said in a statement at the time. He had experienced major health issues in recent years, including two abdominal surgeries and multiple respiratory infections. The pope was hospitalized for five weeks between February and March after developing bronchitis and, later, pneumonia.",

    "published": "Sat, 03 May 2025 11:31:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Holy See released a video Saturday of the preparations for the May 7 conclave after Pope Francis died on April 21.",
    "story": [
      "Vatican workers installed the simple stove in the Sistine Chapel where ballots will be burned during the upcoming conclave to elect a new pope, as jockeying continued outside over who among the cardinals is in the running.",
      "The Holy See released a video Saturday of the preparations for the May 7 conclave, which included installing the stove and a false floor in the frescoed Sistine Chapel to make it even. The footage also showed workers lining up simple wooden tables where the cardinals will sit and cast their votes starting Wednesday, and a ramp leading to the main seating area for any cardinal in a wheelchair.",
      "On Friday, fire crews were seen on the chapel roof attaching the chimney from which smoke signals will indicate whether a pope has been elected.",
      "The preparations are all leading up to the solemn pageantry of the start of the conclave to elect a successor to\u00a0Pope Francis, history's first Latin American pope, who died April 21 at age 88. The Vatican said in a statement that Francis\u00a0died of a stroke\u00a0that put him into a coma and led to irreversible heart failure.",
      "Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni issued a net denial Friday of reports that one of the leading candidates, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, had suffered health problems earlier in the week that required medical attention. The reports, which spoke of a blood pressure issue, were carried by Italian media and picked up by Catholicvote.org, the U.S. site headed by Brian Burch, the Trump administration's choice to be ambassador to the Holy See.",
      "Speculation about a papal candidate's health is a mainstay of conclave politics and maneuvering, as various factions try to torpedo or boost certain candidates. Francis experienced the dynamic firsthand: When the votes were going his way in the 2013 conclave, one breathless cardinal asked him if it was true that he had only one lung, as rumors had it. (Francis later recounted that he told the cardinal he had had the upper lobe of one lung removed as a young man.) He was elected a short time later.",
      "Some are weighing in on other so-called \"pope-fuls.\" In addition to Parolin, other candidates whose names have arisen include Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, the former archbishop of Manila, and conservative Cardinal Robert Sarah from Guinea.",
      "Less is known about the 15 cardinals that Francis named from countries that previously had none \u2014 or how they will vote. One of them is Anders Arborelius of Sweden.",
      "\"We live in a time of conflict, wars,\" he said. \"So it's important to have a voice that can say something else, that God is present.\"",
      "What is the papal conclave?",
      "The papal conclave is the closely guarded gathering of the cardinal electors \u2014 all serving cardinals under the age of 80 \u2014 to elect the next pope.",
      "The exact number varies, but there are currently 135 cardinal electors eligible to convene at the Vatican from around the world to choose the successor to Pope Francis. Of all the current cardinal electors, 108 were appointed by Pope Francis during his 12-year papacy. They come from 71 different countries, including 10 from the United States.",
      "What happens in the conclave?",
      "Under church rules, the conclave must start 15 to 20 days after a pope's death. Pope Francis\u00a0died on April 21.",
      "Wednesday morning begins with a Mass in St. Peter's Basilica celebrated by the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, after which the cardinal electors are sequestered from the rest of the world. In the afternoon, they will process into the Sistine Chapel, hear a meditation and take their oaths before casting their first ballots.",
      "If no candidate reaches the necessary two-thirds majority on the first ballot, the papers will be burned and black smoke will indicate to the world that no pope was elected.",
      "The cardinals will go back to their Vatican residence for the night and return to the Sistine Chapel on Thursday morning to conduct two votes in the morning, two in the afternoon, until a winner is found.",
      "Each cardinal must swear an oath of absolute secrecy before they vote. If they disclose any information from within the conclave, they will be excommunicated by the church.",
      "After every two rounds of voting, the ballots are burned in the stove. If no pope is chosen, the ballots are mixed with cartridges containing potassium perchlorate, anthracene \u2014 a component of coal tar \u2014 and sulfur to produce black smoke out the chimney. If there is a winner, the ballots are mixed with potassium chlorate, lactose and chloroform resin to produce the white smoke.",
      "The white smoke came out of the chimney on the fifth ballot on March 13, 2013, and Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was introduced to the world as Pope Francis a short time later from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica.",
      "The preparations are underway as the cardinals meet privately in more informal sessions to discuss the needs of the Catholic Church going forward and the type of pope who can lead it.",

      "Authorities charged Diddy with multiple counts of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion and transporting for prostitution in an indictment unsealed in September. Since then, the government has filed two superseding indictments against the rapper that added charges and an additional victim. Diddy has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.",
      "Diddy's team and the prosecution were allotted five days to seat the jury, which will likely be a \"difficult\" process, legal experts told Fox News Digital. Diddy and the government are facing off in the rapper's hometown of New York, creating an uphill battle for the disgraced music mogul.",

      "\"Diddy is one of the most recognizable names in music and pop culture, and the public attention surrounding the allegations is enormous,\" New York-based defense attorney Duncan Levin told Fox News Digital. \"In high-profile cases like this, the challenge isn\u2019t just finding jurors who have heard of the defendant \u2013 it\u2019s finding ones who\u00a0haven\u2019t already formed an opinion\u00a0based on media coverage.

      "\"Most potential jurors will have heard of the case and will have formed some opinion of what happened,\" entertainment lawyer Tre Lovell told Fox News Digital. \"That being said, the real question is: Can the jurors put aside whatever initial thoughts they have and be able to decide the case based solely on the evidence?\"",

And the jurors will fill out questionnaires before they meet the judge, which will help the judge to further limit the pool to jurors who have limited knowledge about the case, and the participants.\"",
      "\"But, of course, even jurors in Manhattan will likely know about Diddy, and I expect many will have heard of or read about the allegations against him, and many may have an opinion about him,\" he added. \"This is true in every high-publicity case.\"",

      "Too easily overlooked are non-influenza, non-COVID viruses and bacteria that are burgeoning and spreading unchecked \u2014 both in the U.S. and around the world. While they may not cause the next pandemic, they do cause a lot of illness and death.",
      "One such bacteria is Streptococcus Group A, an old enemy that colonizes the throat and tonsils of close to 20% of U.S. children, according to Dr. Joshua Osowicki, team leader and senior research fellow at the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia.",
      "CDC WARNS OF INCREASE IN INVASIVE STRAIN OF STREP THROAT IN US",
      "This problematic bacterial strain is easily treated with penicillin drugs when it causes a clinical infection, Osowicki told Fox News Digital in an on-camera interview. (See the video at the top of this article.)",
      "But the problem, he said, is that because the bacteria may be harbored, the diagnosis isn\u2019t always found early enough.",
      "The Streptococcus Group A bacteria has been on the rise around the world, doctors warn. (iStock)",
      "Scarlet fever and rheumatic fever/rheumatic heart disease can result from recurrent or untreated strep \u2014 and they are on the increase again in areas without adequate medical care, including parts of the U.S.",

      "\"It actually does its damage in severe, life-threatening cases before the patient receives antibiotics.\"",
      "The important thing with group A strep, according to the doctor, is that antibiotic resistance isn't the primary issue.",

      "Strep A colonizes the throat and tonsils of close to 20% of U.S. children, according to the researcher. (iStock)",
      "\"The point is that it actually does its damage in severe, life-threatening cases before the patient receives antibiotics. There's this period where it is too hard to diagnose and treatment comes too late.\"",
      "In those cases, he said, the patients need ICUs, surgery and \"the most intensive treatment we have to offer.\"",
      "Among patients over the age of 65 or so, a quarter of them will die with this form of the disease, according to Osowicki.",
      "Need for a vaccine",

      "\"The current thrust of my research is all vaccine-related,\" he shared. \"We do what are called human challenge trials, where we deliberately infect healthy adult volunteers with group A strep, painting it on their tonsils.

      "\"Mr. Trump, I'm so, so grateful for you to bring me home and for [the] American government. And I never felt more blessed to be American, and I'm so, so happy to get home,\" Karelina said in a video posted by Trump deputy assistant Sebastian Gorka on April 11 upon her return to the U.S.",

      "The recent surge of attacks on Tesla owners, dealerships and charging stations has morphed into a broader campaign of intimidation, fueled by weaponized personal data. But the fallout isn't limited to Tesla owners alone.",
      "Sites like \"Dogequest\" have published names, addresses and phone numbers supposedly belonging to Tesla owners, yet many victims never owned a Tesla or sold theirs years ago. Some were misidentified due to errors in public records or outdated databases, turning ordinary people into targets for harassment and threats. The site's operators have even demanded proof of sale from anyone seeking removal, putting the burden on innocent people to clear their names.",

The site didn't just list dealerships and charging stations; it exposed names, home addresses, phone numbers and emails, sometimes even in real time. The twist? Many of the people listed never owned a Tesla at all.",
      "The data fueling this attack came from public vehicle registration records and third-party databases, notorious for their inaccuracies. Some victims had sold their Teslas years ago. Others were never owners, just mistakenly linked by a typo, a recycled phone number or a database error. Yet they found themselves on a digital hit list, with their privacy and safety at risk.",
      "The real-world consequences",
      "This isn't just an online problem. Firebombings at showrooms, bullets through dealership windows and threats to families have all been linked to these doxxing campaigns.

Report it to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3),\u00a0ic3.gov, or to local law enforcement, as many states have laws addressing doxxing, stalking and cyber harassment.

      "Have you ever stopped to think about what happens to those little orange pill bottles after you finish your prescription? Every year, around 200 billion of these bottles are produced worldwide, and sadly most of them end up in landfills. In the U.S. alone, about 4 to 5 billion plastic pill bottles are thrown away each year.",

      "A paper bottle that\u2019s changing the game",
      "Plastic has become the go-to material for packaging, including in medicine, because it\u2019s cheap, durable and easy to produce. However, the environmental cost is huge, and the pharmaceutical industry has struggled to find a sustainable alternative.",
      "Enter the\u00a0Tully Tube, a revolutionary new pill bottle made mostly from 100% sustainably sourced paper. Developed by Parcel Health, this isn\u2019t just any paper bottle. It\u2019s the first one to meet the strict U.S. FDA regulations for food-contact packaging, making it safe to use for prescription medications.",
      "What makes the Tully Tube really impressive is how it balances sustainability with practicality. The body of the bottle is made from recyclable and compostable paper, which means it can break down naturally instead of piling up in landfills. The cap, which needs to be child-resistant for safety, is still made from plastic but uses recycled materials to reduce its environmental impact.",

      "STOP SORTING YOUR GARBAGE WITH THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY",

It\u2019s coated with a food-safe compostable layer that keeps water and humidity out, ensuring your medication stays fresh and effective.",
      "When it\u2019s time to toss the bottle, a patented pull tab makes it easy to separate the paper body from the plastic cap and neck. This means the paper part can be composted or recycled, while the plastic pieces can be recycled separately. It\u2019s a simple but smart way to make sure every part of the bottle is handled properly at the end of its life.",
      "Tully Tube (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "IS THIS TECHNOLOGY THE ANSWER TO CLEANING UP OUR OCEAN'S PLASTIC PROBLEM?",
      "Why should pharmacies care?",
      "One of the biggest hurdles for sustainable packaging is cost. Fortunately, the Tully Tube is priced competitively with traditional plastic bottles, so pharmacies don\u2019t have to pay more to go green. Plus, because the paper surface is easier and cheaper to print on, pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies can customize the bottles with logos, designs or even characters to make the packaging more engaging for customers.",
      "From an environmental perspective, the Tully Tube reduces carbon emissions by about 30% compared to plastic bottles. That\u2019s a significant cut in greenhouse gases, especially when you consider the billions of bottles used every year.",

      "For individuals whose data was exposed, this breach poses real risks. Information like your Social Security number, birth date and address can be misused for identity theft, such as opening fraudulent accounts or filing false tax returns in your name. Even beyond financial fraud, having such personal data in the wrong hands can lead to targeted phishing scams.",
      "What worries me the most is the delay in fully notifying everyone affected. VeriSource had sent out preliminary breach notices to about 55,000 people in May 2024 and then to another 112,000 people in September 2024. However, those early notifications covered only a small fraction of the approximately 4 million victims eventually identified. This means the majority of affected individuals did not learn of the breach until the final notification wave in April 2025, more than a year after the data was actually compromised.",

      "If you think you were affected by the VeriSource data breach or just want to be cautious, here are some steps you can take right now to stay safe from the data breach:",
      "1. Consider a personal data removal service:\u00a0VeriSource hackers have access to your name, Social Security number, mailing address and more, which they can easily use against you.\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to scam you. After the VeriSource breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the VeriSource breach, including Social Security numbers. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You can freeze your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus. They\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "4. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per yearor more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "5. Be wary of social engineering attacks and use strong antivirus software: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Also, never click on unexpected links or attachments in emails, texts or messages because they may contain malware or lead to phishing sites designed to steal your information.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "What stands out in the VeriSource breach isn\u2019t just the scale, but the silence. When a company sits on breach data for over a year, regardless of intent, it erodes trust in systems designed to protect workers. These aren\u2019t just compliance failures. They\u2019re human ones. Four million people had their most sensitive information exposed, and for many of them, the warning came far too late. This should be a moment of reckoning for how organizations define responsibility after a breach. A timely response isn\u2019t just good PR. It\u2019s a baseline expectation. And if it takes over a year to realize the full scope of a cyberattack, maybe the incident isn\u2019t the only vulnerability worth addressing.",

      "Yale New Haven Health is a nonprofit healthcare system based in New Haven, Connecticut. It includes five acute-care hospitals, a medical foundation, and a network of outpatient facilities and multispecialty centers across Connecticut, New York and Rhode Island.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",

Reportedly, the number of affected individuals may still change as investigations continue. Importantly, electronic medical record systems and treatment information were not accessed, and no financial account, payment or employee HR information was involved.",
      "This is not the first time healthcare systems have been in the crosshairs of cybercriminals. In recent years, attacks on institutions like\u00a0UnitedHealth and\u00a0Ascension Health have led to months of operational disruption, massive financial costs and prolonged investigations.",

The organization noted that it regularly updates and strengthens its systems to protect sensitive data and will continue those efforts. Notification letters began going out to affected individuals on April 14, and complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services have been offered to those whose Social Security numbers were compromised.",
      "The breach could have serious consequences for those impacted. The stolen data includes highly sensitive information that can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, phishing attacks or targeted scams. Healthcare data is especially valuable on the black market because it can be exploited for long periods without easy detection. Even if Social Security numbers or medical information aren\u2019t misused right away, the long-term risk for affected individuals remains significant.",

      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Yale New Haven Health data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, social security number, and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The Yale New Haven Health data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Yale New Haven Health hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses..",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know, and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "While Yale New Haven has been working with security experts to contain the breach and notify those affected, it is troubling that hackers were able to access the data of 5.5 million individuals before the organization detected the intrusion. The incident highlights a deeper issue, revealing gaps in the security infrastructure that many healthcare institutions are still not adequately addressing.",

      "If you\u2019re still weighing your options, here\u2019s how the two approaches stack up.",
      "Manual opt-outs demand a significant time investment, requiring you to personally navigate each data broker\u2019s unique removal process. While free, this approach offers variable coverage depending on how diligently you track down brokers, and consistency is challenging; you\u2019ll need to repeat the process regularly to keep your data private. Success also depends heavily on your ability to decipher vague opt-out instructions and adapt to each broker\u2019s requirements.",
      "In contrast, data removal services save time by handling the legwork for you. They provide broad coverage by targeting numerous brokers simultaneously and maintain consistency through ongoing monitoring. While these services come with subscription fees, they eliminate the need for personal expertise, offering a hands-off solution to data privacy.",
      "The bottom line: Why personal data removal services win the privacy battle",
      "After testing both manual opt-outs and automated services, using a personal data removal service emerges as the clear solution for reclaiming your data. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "If you\u2019ve got the time and patience, you can absolutely take the DIY route. But if you\u2019re looking for a way to protect your privacy without sinking hours into research, filling out forms and monitoring, a data removal service makes things a lot quicker and more convenient. For most people, this is likely the better option. Many states have privacy laws that give you the right to request that data brokers remove your personal information, but the system seems to be rigged to make exercising those rights unreasonably difficult.\u00a0While it shouldn\u2019t be necessary, data removal services offer a way to cheat that system.",

The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.

If they become aggressive and try to exploit you, tell them you will report them and hang up.",

These numbers often belong to scammers trying to trick you into sharing personal information or making payments. Instead, always verify contact details through official websites or trusted sources before reaching out.",

Once the satellites separated from the rocket, control was transferred to Project Kuiper\u2019s mission operations center in Redmond, Washington.",
      "Each satellite underwent a series of automated steps to activate onboard systems and began using electric propulsion to ascend to its final orbital altitude of 392 miles. Traveling at speeds exceeding 17,000 miles per hour, these satellites now circle Earth approximately every 90 minutes.",
      "The ultimate goal of KA-01 was not just deployment but to establish end-to-end network connectivity. This involves transmitting data through ground stations to satellites and back to customer antennas, a process that will enable high-speed internet service across even the most remote locations on Earth.",

      "Starlink: With over 7,000 satellites already in orbit and plans for a constellation of up to 42,000, Starlink currently leads in deployment. Its satellites orbit at approximately 248 miles, allowing for lower latency but requiring more satellites for global coverage.",
      "Project Kuiper: Kuiper plans to deploy over 3,200 satellites orbiting at 311 miles. This higher altitude provides broader coverage per satellite but results in a 40% reduction in signal strength compared to Starlink due to increased distance. To compensate, Kuiper\u2019s satellites use larger antennas to maintain performance.",

Virginia is leading the nation in year-over-year percentage declines in drug overdose deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",

      "TEL AVIV - A leading archaeology journal has effectively barred submissions by Israelis on Judea and Samaria unless they \"have cooperated with the relevant Palestinian authorities,\" in what analysts say is a microcosm of the harm caused by a global campaign to whitewash the Jewish people\u2019s history in the Land of Israel.",
      "According to a report recently published by The Press Service of Israel (TPS-IL), the\u00a0Palestine Exploration Quarterly\u00a0(PEQ)\u2014a peer-reviewed journal of the London-based Palestine Exploration Fund (PEF)\u2014is refusing to accept submissions from researchers affiliated with institutions operating in what it refers to as \"occupied territory,\" citing concerns over alleged Israeli violations of international law.",
      "\"Publication in\u00a0PEQ\u00a0is guided by the PEF\u2019s ethical policy. The main aspect of this is international law, by which many academic institutions and publications, including\u00a0PEQ, are bound,\" Charlotte Whiting, the journal\u2019s editor-in-chief, told TPS-IL.",

      "Israeli archaeologists told TPS-IL that any cooperation with Palestinian authorities or colleagues was practically impossible, because they \"would be treated as traitors for this.\" They also said that their work is in many instances shunned by the broader academic world and, as such, researchers are forgoing focus on the biblically significant areas of Judea and Samaria (West Bank) to protect their careers.",
      "\"What we\u2019re seeing is a deliberate attempt to undermine Jewish historical ties to the land,\" Yishai Fleisher, international spokesman for Hebron, the cradle of Jewish civilization located in Judea, told Fox News Digital. \"There are three strategies at play: the Palestinians either acknowledge Jews were once here but argue they no longer belong, deny any Jewish connection at all, or destroy the evidence outright.\"",
      "Fleisher noted ongoing efforts by Palestinian authorities and others to rename historical Jewish sites. \"They call Hebron \u2018Al-Khalil,\u2019 and the Cave of the Patriarchs becomes the \u2018Ibrahimi Mosque.\u2019 The Temple Mount is now the \u2018Al-Aqsa complex,\u2019 and Rachel\u2019s Tomb has been rebranded as the \u2018Bilal Bin Rabah Mosque,\u2019\" he said.",
      "To counter this, he says Israeli advocates are working to mark and preserve ancient Jewish landmarks. \"We added an Israeli flag and a menorah to a building originally constructed by King Herod 2,000 years ago\u2014which itself stands atop a tomb dating back 3,500 years\u2014to make it unmistakably clear it\u2019s a Jewish site, despite the later addition of three minarets by Muslim conquerors.\"",

      "In December 2021, the United Nations General Assembly passed a non-binding resolution referring to the Temple Mount, Judaism\u2019s holiest site\u2014located in Jerusalem but beyond the 1967 borders\u2014only by its Muslim name, \"Haram al-Sharif.\" In September 2024, P.A. leader Mahmoud Abbas called the Temple Mount the \"exclusive property of Muslims.\" Last week, Abbas said in a rare televised speech that the Koran describes the Jewish Temple as being in Yemen.",

      "\"In Solomon\u2019s Pools, which is under P.A. jurisdiction in accordance with the Oslo Accords, they\u2019re constructing condominiums directly on top of ancient Jewish infrastructure,\" Kahn told Fox News Digital. \"These are internationally recognized heritage sites, but the agreements are being violated.",
      "She cited the Hasmonean fortresses near Jericho as a major example. \"The burial grounds of Hasmonean kings\u2014the largest necropolis in the Middle East from the Second Temple period\u2014have been plowed and used for farming and construction. In one case, we found human bones scattered in the fields. The Israeli Civil Administration had to collect and rebury them.\"",
      "Khan also referenced Sebastia, the Greco-Roman name for the ancient city of Samaria. Originally founded by King Omri in the 9th century BC, Samaria became the capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel, as noted in the Hebrew Bible (1 Kings 16:24). It served as the kingdom\u2019s capital until it fell to the Assyrians in 722 BCE. Centuries later, Herod the Great rebuilt the city and renamed it Sebaste\u2014Sebastia in later usage\u2014in honor of the Roman Emperor Augustus, whose name in Greek, \"Sebastos,\" carried the same imperial meaning.",

      "\"I\u2019m disgusted, but not concerned,\" Sandra Hagee Parker, Chairwoman of the Christians United for Israel Action Fund, told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"Where are the Romans, Ottomans, and Crusaders? The enemies of Israel are remembered only for their ultimate defeat by the God of Abraham and His children.",
      "\"Moreover, the grotesque effort to deny the Jewish connection to the Land is a rejection of God Himself,\" she continued. \"It is both antisemitic and anti-Christian\u2014and it will never succeed. My only concern is that America continues to stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel and her people,\" she added.",
      "Ze'ev Orenstein, Director of International Affairs at the Jerusalem-based City of David Foundation, stressed that \"from its inception in 1964, the Palestine Liberation Organization\u2014the forerunner of today\u2019s Palestinian Authority\u2014was founded on the denial of thousands of years of Jewish history and heritage rooted in the Land of Israel in general, and in Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria\u2014the Biblical heartland\u2014in particular.",
      "\"This denial,\" Orenstein told Fox News Digital, \"aimed to delegitimize and undermine the Jewish people's legal, moral and historical right to sovereignty in the Land of Israel, portraying a people with some of the deepest archaeological ties to the land as occupiers and colonizers.",
      "\"For that reason, the Islamic Waqf carried out a campaign of systematic destruction of antiquities atop the Temple Mount in the late 1990s, and Palestinian leadership continues to deny, damage, and destroy Jewish heritage sites throughout Judea and Samaria,\" he said.",
      "Following the destruction and severe damage by Palestinian rioters at the 'Joshua Altar' archeological site located on the spur of Mt. Ebal, dozens of Jewish worshipers arrived for morning prayers at the site. (TPS)",
      "In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in July 2023 announced a $33 million program to safeguard and rehabilitate archaeological sites in the biblical heartland.",
      "\"In every corner of Judea and Samaria, one need only to put spade to ground in order to uncover archaeological finds that attest to our deep roots in the Land of Israel,\" Netanyahu said at the time. \"This plan will encourage tourism, education and [present] information for these important sites that tell the story of our people in Judea and Samaria.\"",
      "Rev. Dr. Petra Heldt, professor at the Jerusalem University College and director of the Ecumenical Theological Research Fraternity in Israel, cited biblical texts and ongoing excavations as proof of longstanding Jewish presence in the region.",
      "\"There are hundreds of biblical place names showing Jews lived in Judea and Samaria since the time of Abraham,\" Heldt told Fox News Digital. \"The Palestinian Authority has tried to erase this evidence, but it\u2019s nearly impossible to eliminate.\"",
      "Heldt pointed to Shiloh as a thriving example, with an active kibbutz and archaeological site where new discoveries are regularly unearthed. \"Jewish communities are not only living in their ancestral homeland\u2014they\u2019re documenting it. You can see the impact of various layers of occupation over the last hundred years.\"",

      "The struggle to preserve Jewish historical sites in Judea and Samaria is not just about stones or ruins\u2014it\u2019s a battle over narrative, legitimacy and identity, according to the experts.",
      "\"The way to fight this is to build, to educate and to assert our sovereignty,\" Hebron\u2019s Fleisher said. \"That\u2019s how we strengthen our connection to the land and protect the truth of our history.\"",

      "Of the 23 cardinals from Asia eligible to vote, one name comes up again and again, that of Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines, sometimes called the \"Philippine Francis.\"",
      "The 67-year-old had a close relationship with Pope Francis and served as his envoy to Asia during the 2015-16 special Jubilee Year, during which he made a brief stop in Taipei, Taiwan. Tagle also accompanied Francis on his first international trip to Asia in 2014, when the pontiff visited South Korea.",

      "Another Asian candidate is Burma's Cardinal Charles Maung Bo, 76, from a country where Catholics represent just about 1% of the population. Meanwhile, over the last several days, reports from\u00a0South Korean newspapers\u00a0are suggesting South Korean Cardinal Lazarus You Heung-sik, 74, is among the leading candidates to succeed Pope Francis.",

      "Francis may one day be rated as among the most influential popes of all time. Pope John Paul II made history by becoming the first pope from Poland and his pontificate lasted 26 years (1978-2006). Francis was head of the Catholic Church for a much shorter time, almost exactly 12 years, but the late pope appointed 80% of the cardinals who will vote for his successor.",
      "The late Holy Father also enlarged the number of cardinals and, for the first time in history, the upcoming conclave will see European cardinals in the minority. However, some experts warn against assuming the next pope will be \"Francis the Second,\" as many of these new cardinals are considered more conservative.",

      "The home nation of Asian cardinals doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect the number of Catholics there. In Japan, Catholics make up fewer than 0.5% of the population, but there is a Japanese cardinal who is reasonably active on social media. The largest Asian block of cardinals hails from majority-Hindu India, which has six to the predominately Catholic Philippines\u2019 five.",
      "Still, many Vatican watchers believe Cardinal Tagle remains the most likely Asian candidate, although his progressive stances may prove divisive. Tagle has publicly criticized the church for using \"harsh words\" in past criticisms of LGBTQ Catholics and remarried divorcees and advocates for a more flexible approach. This stance is in line with Pope Francis\u2019 2015 papal declaration that said the church needs to \"avoid judgments which do not take into account the complexity of various situations.\"",

      "Should Tagle beat the odds and become the next pope, his election would energize the church\u2019s progressive wing, as he would likely continue the liberal-leaning direction charted by Francis. His emphasis on serving the poor has won him admiration across Asia and beyond, as has his relatable style. Tagle reportedly prefers being called by his nickname \"Chito,\" rather than by his formal title.",
      "Pope Francis officiating the General Audience in Saint Peter's square. Pope Francis together with Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle. (Photo by Grzegorz Galazka/Archivio Grzegorz Galazka/Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images)",
      "Thomas Tu shared a personal story about Tagle\u2019s compassion, recalling an incident before the cardinal received his red hat. After a young seminarian died suddenly, Tagle chose to join the group of senior seminary members and personally visit the grieving family, later giving a moving sermon in which he \"compared the church to a mother, similar to the one who had lost her son,\" Tu said. \"Tagle just has a way of reaching people that is special.\"",
      "Few dispute that the election of the next pope will be among the most consequential moments for the Catholic Church in decades. And, for the first time, candidates from Asia are now part of serious conversations about the future direction of the faith.",

      "FIRST ON FOX: The United Nations\u2019 UN80 Task Force is examining multiple suggested methods for reorganizing the institution, according to a leaked, confidential document shared with Fox News Digital. The six-page paper cites multiple inefficiencies and areas of improvement needed to combat \"geopolitical shifts and substantial reductions in foreign aid budgets\" which are \"challenging the legitimacy and effectiveness of the organization.\"",
      "The effort is \"eight and a half years late,\" Hugh Dugan,\u00a0former National Security Council Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for International Organization Affairs, told Fox News Digital: \"If [Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio] Guterres really comprehends that the system needs a major overhaul, he should step down and facilitate an early U.N. Secretary-General election.\" Dugan said that \"the person with the fresh mandate\" should overhaul the U.N.",

      "The UN80 Task Force document notes that \"overlapping mandates, inefficient use of resources, and inconsistent delivery of services\" are among the problems with proliferating agencies, funds and programs, and notes ways to integrate, consolidate, and coordinate among reformed entities to maximize the benefit for those who rely on the U.N.",
      "As another means of reducing outlays, the task force also recommended reducing the quantity of high-level posts, establishing single entities to coordinate Peace and Security, Humanitarian Affairs, and Human Rights, and \"reduc[ing] the number of U.N. development system entities.\"",
      "Dugan said the document \"looks more like a whiteboard stream of consciousness approach that you find on the first day of a business retreat.\" He said that it lacks mention of human resource improvements, finding ways of recruiting \"the very best in the world,\" or \"identifying performance measurements or metrics against the leaders of the organization, branches, [or] offices.\"",
      "Dugan said that the task force is also missing the important confidence-building measures needed to increase buy-in from members, to keep them \"impressed and enthusiastic\" about U.N. programs. \"They\u2019re assuming that they are the leaders that are the right people at the right time.\" Dugan said this is \"a real shortcoming.\"",

      "\"I don\u2019t think they have the confidence of the world community or the talents or the resources to hold out another year and a half under this regime of Secretary Guterres,\" Dugan said. Rather than utilize the \"Noah\u2019s Ark management mentality\" of attempting to \"weather the storm,\" Dugan said that the U.N. must \"get very creative very quickly with what they have at hand.\"",
      "Dugan noted that the U.N. has gone through a \"fall-off in relevance\" with its lack of involvement in \"real world dynamics between member states.\" He urged the organization to identify \"the multilateral collateral, meaning we\u2019ve got to identify what\u2019s good, and then we have to get rid of what\u2019s damaged after eight years.\"",

Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said that the memo \"is the result of an exercise to generate ideas and thoughts from senior officials on how to achieve the Secretary-General\u2019s vision\" and is one \"of the three work streams that we are working on.\"",
      "Dujarric pointed to a speech Guterres delivered in March when introducing the UN80 Initiative, in which he called for an \"ambitious reform agenda to strengthen how we work and deliver.\" Guterres said this involves increasing transparency and accountability, being more effective and cutting costs, and decentralizing decisions to serve those who rely on the U.N.",

      "For Dugan, Guterres\u2019 failure to attempt those \"sweeping\" reforms prior to 2025 is an indication that regime change is needed. He reiterated that \"the Secretary-General\u2019s \u2018Trust me\u2019 window dressing is no longer convincing us to pay full retail.\"",

      "The Department of Homeland Security is intensifying its efforts to persuade unauthorized immigrants to self-deport by offering a $1,000 stipend and travel assistance.",
      "The federal agency announced Monday that those who use the CBP Home app to voluntarily leave the United States will receive assistance \"to facilitate travel back to their home country\" and $1,000 \"paid after their return to their home country has been confirmed through the app.\"",
      "The announcement comes as the number of deportations\u00a0has remained stagnant during President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office. One of the president's key campaign promises was that he would enact mass deportations as soon as he took office.",
      "DHS did not immediately respond to questions about how the funds would be provided or what proof would be required to show the person had returned to their home country.",
      "DHS spokesperson\u00a0Tricia McLaughlin said in late March that those who are self-deporting can use biographical data, documents, facial images and geo location in the app to prove that they have left the country. \u201cThe alien must be at least three miles outside of the United States\u00a0to successfully utilize this feature,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile the use of the verify departure functionality is optional, if the alien chooses to use it, they must submit a facial image. It's required.\u201d",
      "In a press release, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said self-deportations are \"the best, safest and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest.\"",
      "A single deportation costs U.S. taxpayers $17,121, according to DHS. The federal agency expects self-deportations to decrease that cost by 70%, even after factoring in the stipend.",
      "So far this year, at least 5,000 immigrants have reportedly used CBP Home to say that they were voluntarily leaving the country, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington think tank.",
      "DHS has declined to say how many unauthorized immigrants have used the app so far to self-deport.",
      "According to Appfigures, a company that tracks app downloads, CBP Home app has recently been downloaded about 1,500 times per day.\u00a0Since the start of 2025, the app was downloaded about 300,000 times, according to the company\u2019s CEO, Ariel Michaeli.",
      "In March, the Trump administration repurposed the Biden-era CBP One app that\u00a0allowed migrants to enter the U.S. legally as asylum-seekers, changing it into the CBP Home app. This version of the mobile application has a self-deportation reporting feature.",
      "The Trump administration has spent $200 million in revamping the app and creating an accompanying advertising campaign featuring Noem to promote the app's use.",
      "The\u00a0ads, which have aired in English and Spanish across the U.S. and Mexico, encourage immigrants who are not legally present in the U.S. to leave the country.",
      "As part of their announcement Monday, DHS said that undocumented immigrants who \"submit their intent to voluntarily self-deport in CBP Home will also be deprioritized for detention and removal ahead of their departure as long as they demonstrate they are making meaningful strides in completing that departure.\"",
      "The agency also said that self-deportation through the app \"may help preserve the option for an illegal alien to re-enter the United States legally in the future,\" echoing key points Noem touts in her ads.",
      "Immigration experts and advocates have previously warned of Noem\u2019s self-deportation message and the possibility of being able to legally return to the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe operative word in that quote from the secretary is \u2018may,\u2019\u201d Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute,\u00a0told NBC News in March.",
      "\u201cFor many people who leave the United States, there may never be a lawful option for return to the United States, or reentry may be barred for many years,\u201d Heidi Altman, the vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy organization, told NBC News in a statement in March. \u201cForcing or coercing people into leaving their homes and their loved ones carries political, moral, and economic costs.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "In its heyday, Alcatraz Island housed more than 260 prisoners, with notorious gangsters such as Al Capone, George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly and James \"Whitey\" Bulger serving time on the rocky outpost.",
      "With its closing in 1963 after it fell into disrepair, the federal prison off San Francisco found a new life as a popular tourist destination \u2014 one that continues to draw more than a million visitors a year as a national historic landmark.",
      "That could all change again if President Donald Trump gets his way. Trump wrote Sunday on social media that he is directing the federal Bureau of Prisons, the Justice Department and other agencies to \"reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt Alcatraz\" to the most \"ruthless and violent offenders.\"",
      "But federal corrections experts and historians caution that while such a project may be especially \"symbolic\" to Trump, any plan would be incredibly expensive and inefficient, particularly when the federal government's mission is to slash spending and prisons remain strained by staffing shortages.",
      "\"You'd be going in and basically removing a national landmark just to set up a prison that literally would be for the optics mostly, because it doesn't make the most sense financially to establish something like that there,\" said Michael Esslinger, who has written five books about Alcatraz's history and estimates he has visited the island at least 500 times.",
      "The National Park Service manages Alcatraz.",
      "J. Elizabeth Peace, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of the Interior, said in an email that \"the President's statement speaks for itself,\" and declined to comment further.",
      "Before Alcatraz was closed, it was determined that it would take at least $4 million to renovate it and that the physical isolation of the island was a major reason it cost so much to maintain. For example, fresh water had to be barged to the island every week.",
      "In a news release issued in 1962, BOP Director James Bennett said it was not an \"economically sound policy\" to invest millions of dollars to rehab Alcatraz. Housing an inmate in Alcatraz cost more than three times what it cost in Atlanta, the BOP said.",
      "It's unclear how much it would cost to build a new prison on Alcatraz from scratch. The BOP's newly installed director, William Marshall III, said in a statement Monday that he has ordered an assessment on \"next steps\" for a reopened U.S. penitentiary.",
      "\"USP Alcatraz has a rich history,\" Marshall said. \"We look forward to restoring this powerful symbol of law, order, and justice. We will be actively working with our law enforcement and other federal partners to reinstate this very important mission.\"",
      "For comparison, a new federal prison that would hold 1,400 inmates in Letcher County, Kentucky, near the Virginia border, is estimated to cost more than $500 million.",
      "Walter Pavlo, president of the consulting firm Prisonology LLC,\u00a0whose experts include former BOP case managers and wardens, said he could easily see the price of rebuilding a prison on Alcatraz surpassing that of the Kentucky facility. In addition, there are other costs associated with operating a maximum-security facility that requires state-of-the art technology and infrastructure, particularly for a property that has had a long and colorful history of escape attempts.",
      "Federal prisons are typically built in isolated and rural communities. Having one in the San Francisco Bay Area, one of the most expensive places to live in the country, would require competitive salaries, as well, Pavlo said. He said those corrections officers and staff members would need to be experienced in dealing with dangerous offenders.",
      "The BOP currently houses such prisoners at its \"Supermax\" in Florence, Colorado, south of Colorado Springs.",
      "Trump \"wants a showplace for high-profile criminals that people can see,\" Pavlo said. \"And there's no higher-profile place than Alcatraz.\"",
      "Some elected officials in California are downplaying Trump's plan to revert Alcatraz into a working prison.",
      "\"It is now a very popular national park and major tourist attraction,\" Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the former House speaker, whose district includes the island, said on X. \"The President's proposal is not a serious one.\"",
      "The idea began taking shape after Trump took office for his second term. His son Donald Trump Jr. posted on X that \"maybe we should also reopen Alcatraz?!?!\" in response to his father's announcing preparations for a facility at the U.S. military camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, to house thousands of migrants.",
      "In 1981, the Reagan administration also examined Alcatraz as a place to hold detainees fleeing Cuba via the Mariel boatlift, but the idea was rejected because the island did not have the proper resources and, by then, it was a magnet for tourists.",
      "Alcatraz's operations began in the mid-19th century, first as a military fort to house prisoners, until the federal government transferred it to the Justice Department. The federal prison opened in 1934. Over the years, Alcatraz \u2014 nicknamed The Rock \u2014 was the scene of dramatic escapes and a deadly siege by inmates.",
      "Its purpose was \"really a way to isolate inmates from the news and from society,\" Esslinger said. \"It was kind of like this iron curtain where no information was going in or out.\"",
      "But Alcatraz was ultimately not worth maintaining. In 1962, ahead of the prison's closing, the BOP determined the salt air was severely corroding the building. Meanwhile, the lack of a sewage system meant wastewater was being dumped directly into the bay.",
      "The island gained national attention again in 1969 when a group of Native American activists occupied it until 1971.",
      "David Widner, whose uncles, convicted bank robbers John and Clarence Anglin, escaped from Alcatraz in 1962, said that given the island's lore and public fascination, \"it would make sense for it to remain the way it is.\"",
      "\"But do I think Trump's capable of turning it around? Sure,\" Widner said. \"With the right kind of money, it could be redone.\""

      "\u201cBlack style is really related to thinking about how fashion and power connect,\u201d Miller said in a YouTube video about making Vogue\u2019s Met Gala issue. \u201cThe way that people are styled or fashioned or fashioned themselves in response to the degree of agency that they feel.\u201d",
      "Miller, who curated the Costume Institute\u2019s spring exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, is bringing Black dandyism into focus.",
      "While the dandy was an 18th century term for a man who is meticulously dressed and appreciates the finer things in life, these days dandyism inspires myriad definitions. The dozens of Black actors, athletes, entertainers and other celebrities in the Vogue video described dandyism as everything from \u201cBlack excellence\u201d to \u201cconfidence\u201d to \u201cexpression.\u201d",
      "Black dandyism, which reaches at least as far back as the Harlem Renaissance from 1918 to the mid-1930s, celebrated life in times that were not socially or politically celebratory for Black people. Miller\u2019s book illuminates that transformational power.",
      "Follow along for live coverage of the 2025 Met Gala.",
      "\u201cWhen the dandy is Black, we get to see the dandy as a figure that really encapsulates a kind of matrix in identity: race, gender, class, sexuality and sometimes nation,\u201d she said.",
      "At the Met Gala, the fashion world will take in and celebrate Black dandyism and its many contributions to high fashion, a departure for an industry where Black culture has historically been underrepresented.",
      "The spotlight on Black men \u201cmeans everything\u201d to so many people who have plied their trade in fashion for decades, celebrity stylist Avon Dorsey said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s everything we could want,\u201d said Dorsey, who has dressed A-list talent including Michael B. Jordan, Winston Duke and Jay Ellis. \u201cWe know that Black men throughout history have always come and shown up and shown out, whether it was a church suit or whether it\u2019s with a top hat or fashion like how our uncles and grandfathers used to wear. So, knowing that this exhibit focuses on Black men specifically and the style of Black men, is an amazing thing, especially with the way that the world is right now.\u201d",
      "Jonathan McCrory, executive artistic director of the National Black Theatre, said in a Vogue article that the Met Gala opportunity is \u201can important nexus that we\u2019re in \u2014 society-wise \u2014 and our clothing allows us to create protection to be radically soft in a brittle world that wants us to be hard,\u201d McCroy said.",
      "And while it is not a political event, Dorsey said the Met Gala \u2014 intentionally or not \u2014 is making a statement about the power and necessity of diversity, equity and inclusion, a set of practices the Trump administration has weaponized by deeming them \u201cillegal.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is something that comes to mind, because the Met Gala has these themes that emphasizes all three of those touch points of DEI,\u201d said Dorsey, who is launching Brother, a Black men\u2019s fashion magazine, next month. \u201cTo highlight the importance of Black culture, specifically Black men, is something that\u2019s needed in the world to stand up against the stereotypes and misinformation and push forward our reality.\u201d",
      "Dapper Dan, a fashion icon in Harlem who grew up underprivileged, said dressing up in clothes purchased from Goodwill was his first introduction to the power of dandyism.",
      "\u201cEven if the clothes weren\u2019t mine, nobody knew how poor my family was,\u201d he said in the Vogue video. \u201cAnd for me, that was the birth of dandyism, because I saw the power of transformation that could take place with your clothes.\u201d",
      "Dapper Dan, 80, has made a name for himself in the last several decades by bringing this resourcefulness to others. A trip to Africa in 1974 inspired him to make fashion his life. After he returned to New York, he opened a 24-hour store in Harlem in 1982 and built enough credibility to begin making custom clothes for celebrities and community members alike. He and Gucci opened an invitation-only studio that provided fabrics for his new creations.",
      "This year\u2019s Met Gala co-chairs are actor Colman Domingo, Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, and entertainers A$AP Rocky and Pharrell Williams, with NBA star LeBron James as the honorary chair. This year\u2019s committee members include musicians Andr\u00e9 3000, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Teyana Taylor, Usher, and Tyla, actors Ayo Edebiri, Audra McDonald and Jeremy Pope, and athletes including Simone Biles and Angel Reese. The directive for attendees is to don an outfit \u201ctailored to you.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of the designers and the stars and the celebrities really can\u2019t talk about what they are going to wear beforehand,\u201d Dorsey said. \u201cBut I\u2019m excited to see Colman Domingo; he always wears a great suit. A$AP Rocky perfectly merges street style with high fashion, a men\u2019s version of couture. I\u2019m excited to see what Rihanna is going to wear next to him.\u201d",
      "The late Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley, the first Black creative director at Vogue, who died in 2022, battled stereotypes and exclusion in leading the iconic fashion publication\u2019s vision. Monday night will also be about Talley, Dorsey said.",
      "\u201cThis Met Gala in particular,\u201d Dorsey said, \u201cAndr\u00e9 will be looking down with so much pride and joy, knowing how much he had to endure for us to get to this special moment. He did so much for Black men in fashion, and Monday is sort of the fruits of all his work.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Nearly three dozen New\u00a0Yorkers were questioned Monday about what they knew about the federal sex trafficking case against Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs as jury selection got underway in a Manhattan courtroom.",
      "Prospective jurors were also shown a list of more than 100 places and people whose names may come up at trial\u00a0and were asked whether they knew any of the people and whether it would affect their ability to be impartial. The list included celebrities such as Michael B. Jordan, Mike Myers and Kanye West, none of whom are implicated in the case.",
      "The names of women who have filed civil lawsuits against Combs also appeared on the list, including his former girlfriend Casandra Ventura, whose suit paved the way for the sex trafficking and racketeering charges, and Dawn Richard, a member of two now-defunct musical groups Combs had formed.",
      "Richard\u00a0alleged in a suit filed last year that he had groped and threatened her and that she had witnessed him assaulting Ventura. Combs has denied her allegations, and her suit is pending.",
      "The attorneys did not provide an explanation for the list, and representatives for Jordan, Myers and West did not immediately return requests for comment.",
      "Also Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey said prosecutors have had trouble getting in touch with the attorney for a woman identified only as Victim-3 in the indictment against Combs and that they were unsure whether she would show up to court even if they tried to enforce a subpoena.",
      "Twelve jurors will ultimately decide whether Combs used his power and influence to sexually exploit women for more than two decades, as federal prosecutors allege in the five-count indictment.",
      "Sporting a goatee, Combs, who has been detained at a federal prison in Brooklyn since his September 2024 arrest, arrived for the first day of jury selection dressed in a white collared shirt, black crewneck sweater and charcoal-colored pants. U.S. District Judge Arun\u00a0Subramanian gave Combs permission to wear his own clothes during the trial.",
      "He hugged and shook hands with his attorneys before Subramanian issued various rulings, including that Dr. Elie Aoun, a clinical psychiatrist, can testify as an expert for the defense about drugs Combs may have taken and their combined effects. Subramanian said Aoun could also testify about blackouts and other episodes in which Combs may have been intoxicated.",
      "At the heart of the government\u2019s case are allegations that Combs forced women \u2014\u00a0including his former girlfriend Ventura \u2014 to participate in drug-fueled sexual encounters with male sex workers that Combs directed and filmed and called \u201cfreak offs.\u201d",
      "The indictment does not name any victims, but the allegations of Victim-1 closely align with those Ventura made in a 2023 civil lawsuit that she and Combs settled within a day without him admitting any wrongdoing.",
      "The public first learned about the alleged sexual encounters from her lawsuit, which alleged Combs had abused her for years. Combs has vehemently denied the allegations, and his attorneys have said the sex was consensual.",
      "But prosecutors say those encounters amounted to sex trafficking and allege Combs kept recordings of the encounters and silenced victims through blackmail and violence.",
      "Central to the prosecution\u2019s case is a video from March 5, 2016, showing Combs attacking and dragging Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel hallway.\u00a0Prosecutors have said that Ventura, who was signed to Combs\u2019 music label as Cassie, had been trying to escape the hotel room and that the events of that day \u201care powerful evidence of trafficking\u201d and of Combs\u2019 \u201cuse of force in connection with a freak off,\u201d which they allege preceded the assault.",
      "Combs was wearing only a towel in the video and Ventura did not have shoes on. After CNN aired the video last year, Combs apologized publicly, saying his behavior in it was \u201cinexcusable\u201d and that he took full responsibility for his actions.",
      "According to prosecutors, Combs bribed hotel security with $100,000 to obtain the footage and cover up what he had done. Combs\u2019 attorneys had sought to exclude the video from evidence, arguing\u00a0it\u00a0\u201cis wholly inaccurate, having been altered, manipulated, sped-up, and edited to be out of sequence\u201d \u2014 claims\u00a0CNN has forcefully denied.",
      "When questioned by Subramanian on Monday, a number of prospective jurors said they had seen the video, with one woman referring to it as \u201cdamning.\u201d The woman was excused.",
      "Another woman, who said she works for HBO, said she found the video \u201cdisturbing\u201d and \u201cupsetting\u201d but that she could be impartial. Combs\u2019 lead attorney, Marc Agnifilo, expressed concern because HBO released a documentary about Combs titled \u201cThe Fall of Diddy\u201d that the woman said she was unaware of.",
      "After another prospective juror said she had been caught stealing a wand from a Harry Potter store, Combs nodded in apparent approval to his attorneys. Throughout the day, as potential jurors were questioned, he appeared to express his approval or disapproval, either with a nod or by shaking his head no.",
      "Another woman disclosed she had liked a video on social media of a comedian who made a joke about Combs and baby oil because she thought it was funny. Prosecutors have said that\u00a0when Combs\u2019 homes in Los Angeles and Miami Beach, Florida, were raided last year, federal agents seized\u00a0more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant.",
      "Both women were allowed to stay.",
      "When the defense asked for a quick bathroom break, Subramanian suggested they wait and continue questioning jurors.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a machine,\u201d Subramanian said, to which Combs responded: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, your honor, I\u2019m a little nervous today.\u201d Subramanian granted the break.",
      "Subramanian said last week that he hoped to seat a jury of 12 people and six alternates in three days for the trial, which is expected to last eight weeks. Defense attorney Teny Geragos told NBC News earlier Monday that she was confident they could choose a jury in three days.",
      "Her father, high-profile defense lawyer Mark Geragos, was also in court Monday.",
      "\u201cCan\u2019t I just watch my daughter? I\u2019m a helicopter parent,\u201d he said jokingly as he entered court.",
      "A source familiar with the case told NBC News that Mark Geragos will help throughout the trial in an unofficial role and will advise Combs\u2019 legal team this week on which jurors to choose. He was seen Monday in court conferring with the defense\u2019s jury consultant.",
      "Mark Geragos had no further comment, and Combs\u2019 legal team did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The jurors will remain anonymous."

    "story": [
      "TeleMessage, the app that President Donald Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Mike Waltz, appeared to use to archive his group chats, has suspended all services after hackers claimed to have stolen files from it.",
      "A spokesperson for Smarsh, the company that owns TeleMessage, said Monday that the company \u201cis investigating a potential security incident. Upon detection, we acted quickly to contain it and engaged an external cybersecurity firm to support our investigation.\u201d",
      "\u201cOut of an abundance of caution, all TeleMessage services have been temporarily suspended,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "The app, which uses encryption technology similar to that of the popular messaging service Signal but also offers government agencies and companies a way to back up copies of chats for compliance purposes, first came under public scrutiny after Waltz appeared to be using it during a Cabinet meeting last week.",
      "His use of the app reignited concerns about the security of his communication methods that were sparked by the \u201cSignalgate\u201d controversy, in which he accidentally invited a journalist into a Signal chat of top administration officials as it planned military strikes on Houthis in Yemen.",
      "Customs and Border Protection has paused its use of the app, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said.",
      "\u201cFollowing the detection of a cyber incident, CBP immediately disabled TeleMessage as a precautionary measure. The investigation into the scope of the breach is ongoing,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Signal automatically encrypts messages as they travel between users. But the details around TeleMessage\u2019s encryption and security protocols aren\u2019t fully clear.",
      "Signal is highly regarded by cybersecurity experts, but the federal government has specific systems and protocols for transmitting sensitive information and messages. Officials are expected to use highly monitored intranet systems that are almost entirely closed off from the rest of the digital world for sensitive military planning to reduce the chance that outside parties can snoop on them.",
      "The use of encrypted messaging apps in the U.S. government has grown significantly in recent years, but it poses a problem for officials subject to laws that require them to save their correspondence \u2014\u00a0creating a tension between the need for secrecy and archiving. TeleMessage had boasted in a blog post on its website that it was conceived for just such a reason, though it has since taken that post down.",
      "But archives of sensitive information inherently make targets for hackers.",
      "On Sunday evening, a hacker credibly claimed to NBC News to have broken into a centralized TeleMessage server and downloaded a large cache of files. As evidence, the hacker provided a screenshot of TeleMessage\u2019s contact list of employees at the cryptocurrency broker Coinbase, which uses TeleMessage.",
      "A Coinbase spokesperson confirmed to NBC News that the screengrab was authentic, but stressed that Coinbase had not been hacked and that none of its customers\u2019 data had been affected.",
      "\u201cAt this time, there is no evidence any sensitive Coinbase customer information was accessed or that any customer accounts are at risk, since Coinbase does not use this tool to share passwords, seed phrases, or other data needed to access accounts,\u201d the Coinbase spokesperson said.",
      "The hacker told NBC News they have not fully sifted through the hacked files yet, and it is unclear if they include sensitive conversations from the U.S. government.",
      "Several government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Treasury Department and the U.S. International Development Finance Corp., appear to have active contracts with TeleMessage or other companies to use TeleMessage\u2019s services, according to government records reviewed by NBC News.",
      "Separately, a different hacker told the tech news publication 404 Media that they had also hacked TeleMessage and provided significant evidence. NBC News has not interacted with that hacker.",
      "It was not immediately clear if additional hackers have accessed TeleMessage files."

      "Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., ran for the coveted position in December but was defeated by a more senior member of the committee, Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va. Last week, though, Connolly said that because his esophageal cancer had returned he would not seek re-election to Congress and would be stepping back from his day-to-day responsibilities on the Oversight panel.",
      "After speaking to colleagues, Ocasio-Cortez said Monday that she believed another bid for the post would be an uphill climb against another more senior member.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually clear to me that the underlying dynamics in the caucus have not shifted with respect to seniority as much as I think would be necessary, and so I believe I\u2019ll be staying put at Energy and Commerce,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told reporters, referring to a separate committee.",

      "If Democrats retake the House in 2026, the Oversight chairman's gavel could have provided her with an enormous platform and authority to investigate the Trump administration.",
      "Because she previously left the Oversight panel to take a seat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Ocasio-Cortez would have needed a waiver from the Democratic Caucus to return to Oversight. But several colleagues said they believed she would have been the prohibitive favorite for the job had she decided to run.",
      "In December, Connolly beat back a challenge from Ocasio-Cortez in a 131-84 vote by House Democrats. She said Monday that she doesn't believe the result would be much different if she squared off against a different member with more seniority.",
      "Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., is the third most senior member on the panel, and is filling in for Connolly on an interim basis. Lynch announced last week that he will run for the Oversight job and that Connolly has endorsed him.",

      "In an exclusive interview with NBC News, Miles Taylor said that he is prepared to \u201cfight back\u201d in court and that his repeated warnings that Trump would use presidential power to retaliate against perceived political enemies have proved accurate.",
      "\u201cMy concern was he would turn the government into a revenge machine, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening,\u201d Taylor said.",
      "Since the president signed a memorandum\u00a0last month calling for a review of Taylor\u2019s conduct as a Department of Homeland Security official during Trump\u2019s first term, government authorities have contacted former high school classmates and others associated with him, Taylor said.",
      "\u201cI have seen indications that they are out there, rummaging through my past, talking to people as far back as high school, and trying to comb through my life,\u201d\u00a0he said.",
      "It was unclear what the focus of the federal investigation was or which government agency was carrying it out, Taylor and his lawyer said.",
      "The Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security declined to comment.",
      "During his tenure in Trump\u2019s first administration, Taylor wrote an\u00a0anonymous op-ed\u00a0saying many senior administration officials were trying to limit Trump\u2019s worst impulses and protect the country\u2019s democratic institutions from a president he said lacked a moral compass. Taylor later wrote an anonymous memoir before he went public and opposed Trump\u2019s re-election in 2020.",
      "In a December interview with Welker, Trump said that he would not direct the Justice Department to investigate his political foes. Asked by Welker in an interview that aired Sunday what has changed, Trump replied, \"Well, no, I just look at people, and I\u2019m not directing anybody.\"",
      "Taylor denied any wrongdoing and said he is being singled out for expressing his opinion.",
      "\u201cI know I\u2019ve never broken the law. I know that I\u2019ve assiduously upheld my national security obligations,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWhat\u2019s really important for people to know is you don\u2019t need a permission slip in the United States to criticize the president.\u201d",
      "Given his track record criticizing Trump, Taylor said he expected to be called out by the president at some point. But he said the memorandum has turned his family\u2019s life upside down, forcing him to effectively stop working as a cybersecurity consultant and requiring his wife to go back to work earlier than planned after the birth of their baby.",
      "They have adopted additional safety precautions due to online threats and vitriol directed at Taylor, and updated their wills on the advice of security experts, he said. \u201cMy wife has to read online about people saying that they\u2019ll put me in front of a firing squad,\u201d Taylor said.",
      "Meanwhile, some friends are now reluctant to be associated with him to avoid any blowback.\u00a0\u201cPeople are scared to even talk to you because they\u2019re worried they\u2019ll lose their livelihoods,\u201d he said.",
      "Although Taylor said his public stance against Trump has come at a personal and professional cost, he said he and his wife have not considered trying to seek a discreet settlement with the administration.",
      "\u201cOf course, it never crossed our minds that we would try to go settle,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cAnd what I worry about is that they will try to use this tactic, this bludgeon of the bully pulpit of the presidency, to go shut people up by threatening them and getting them to settle with the White House, like they\u2019ve gotten businesses to settle, like they\u2019re trying to get universities to settle.\u201d",
      "Taylor added: \u201cThat is insidious, that is un-American. You can\u2019t threaten Americans to not exercise their First Amendment rights because they\u2019re fearful the president of the United States will prosecute them.\u201d",
      "Another former senior official who served in Trump\u2019s first term and was the subject of a similar presidential memo, Chris Krebs, is under an unspecified federal law enforcement investigation, the Department of Homeland Security\u00a0said last week.\u00a0Krebs declined to comment.",
      "Trump targeted Taylor and Krebs in two memos issued on April 9, revoking their security clearances and ordering the attorney general to carry out a review of their actions while in government. Krebs, as a top cybersecurity official,\u00a0refuted Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was \u201crigged\u201d and said at the time that there was no evidence of major fraud or vote tampering.",
      "In his memorandum, Trump described Taylor as an \u201cegregious leaker\u201d whose actions were possibly \u201ctreasonous\u201d and potentially a violation of the Espionage Act. But Taylor said he has always abided by the law, upheld national security and that criticizing the president was not a crime.",
      "Taylor\u2019s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said the president\u2019s memo represents an unprecedented, unconstitutional attempt to use executive authority to target an American citizen. He and Taylor\u2019s legal team were weighing a legal response and would not necessarily wait for the government to take the first step in court, Lowell said.",
      "\u201cI think what we\u2019ve seen across the last 100 days is that people are finding that they can ask the courts to be the protectors of the rule of law when it is appropriate,\u201d Lowell told NBC News. \u201cThey\u2019re becoming proactive and asking the courts to rule in advance. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at. \u201c",
      "Lowell, who has represented an array of clients including Hunter Biden and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, said that he hopes that judges will protect his client\u2019s civil liberties and be wary of any potentially improper request from administration investigators.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it stops with Miles, but I think Miles is a good test case if the system works,\u201d he said."

    "summary": "A disagreement over alleged LGBTQ book censorship has resulted in the resignation of five employees from Bodacious Bookstore & Caf\u00e9 in Pensacola, Florida.",
    "story": [
      "Staff members at Bodacious Bookstore & Caf\u00e9, an independent bookstore in Pensacola, Florida, say that when they were instructed to remove LGBTQ titles from the shelves, some refused, while others resigned in protest or quietly hid queer books to protect them.",
      "\u201cI started working at Bodacious because I love books and being surrounded by stories and knowledge,\u201d said a former employee, who asked to remain anonymous because she fears retaliation from the bookstore\u2019s owners. She said she began crying when Beth O\u2019Connor, the bookstore\u2019s interim manager, directed her to remove LGBTQ books. When she refused, the former employee said, O\u2019Conner sent her home and told her to re-evaluate whether she wanted to work at the store.",
      "\u201cIt was heartbreaking to see us removing them \u2014 especially starting with LGBTQ+ titles,\u201d the former employee said.",
      "O\u2019Connor didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Book censorship has reached historic highs over the past several years, with titles centered on LGBTQ issues and queer characters among the most banned and challenged in public schools and libraries. Independent bookstores have been dependable holdouts amid the growing conservative push, with many proudly featuring \u201cBanned Book\u201d sections, but in Florida\u2019s Escambia County \u2014\u00a0arguably ground zero for the country\u2019s book censorship battle \u2014 even a beloved indie bookstore isn\u2019t immune.",
      "Bodacious Bookstore & Caf\u00e9 is in Pensacola, the largest city in Escambia, Florida\u2019s westernmost county, which is on the Alabama border. The county, which made headlines last year after its school district pulled 1,600 book titles from shelves, also sits at the center of two federal lawsuits on book censorship.",
      "The first suit \u2014 filed in May 2023 by the nonprofit organization PEN America, Penguin Random House and a group of authors and parents \u2014 argues that the Escambia County School District\u2019s initial removal of over 150 books, many of them addressing topics related to LGBTQ issues or race, violates students\u2019 First Amendment rights. The suit is ongoing. The second lawsuit, also filed in 2023, challenges the school district\u2019s removal of the children\u2019s book \u201cAnd Tango Makes Three,\u201d about two male penguins who raise a chick together. In September, the school district in that suit agreed to return three dozen books related to race and the LGBTQ community to shelves as part of a settlement agreement.",
      "Now, many of the same stories are under scrutiny at Bodacious Bookstore & Caf\u00e9, owned by businessman and philanthropist Quint Studer and his wife, Mary \u201cRishy\u201d Studer.",
      "According to one current and three former employees, management began reviewing all store materials after receiving a complaint from a customer against profanity on a greeting card. They said that what began as a purge of purportedly profane materials, including greeting cards, stickers and book titles with swear words, quickly escalated into the quiet removal of more than 60 books from the store.",
      "Roughly half of the books that were removed, the current and former employees said, featured queer stories or authors, including celebrity memoirs like Billie Jean King\u2019s \u201cAll In\u201d and Elliot Page\u2019s \u201cPageboy,\u201d as well as young adult novels like Casey McQuiston\u2019s \u201cI Kissed Shara Wheeler\u201d and Alice Oseman\u2019s popular \u201cHeartstopper\u201d series. Others included sex education books, popular young adult romances that don\u2019t feature romance between LGBTQ main characters, such as \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty\u201d by Jenny Han, and even books about the history of book banning.",
      "Quint Studer and Studer Entertainment & Retail President Jonathan Griffith declined an interview. On Monday, Travis Peterson, a spokesperson for the Studers, said in a statement on behalf of the bookstore that it removed greeting cards that featured profanity because they were \u201cinconsistent with our brand values.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe also began a thorough review of our inventory to ensure that books with explicit or graphic sexual content were not easily accessible to young children,\u201d the statement read, adding that the review is ongoing.",
      "The statement continued: \u201cAt no time were any books removed because of LGBTQ+ (or any other) subject matter, authorship, or genre. Any assertion to the contrary is not true, especially if made by former employees who are no longer involved with our operations. We stand by our decision as a privately owned bookstore to determine what titles and merchandise are suitable for our shelves or easily accessible by young children. Our goal is to be a welcoming place for every child and every family, and we believe that means not prominently displaying books and merchandise with profanity or explicit content.\u201d",
      "Bodacious Bookstore denied in a statement on Instagram last week that any specific categories are being banned. However, it said it \u201cdid temporarily pull some titles for review.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile many have returned to the shelves or been relocated to more appropriate sections, some will not return as we adjust our offerings,\u201d the statement read.",
      "Nichole Murphy had been a volunteer at Bodacious Bookstore since 2023 helping to facilitate book clubs and community events. She had just begun working at the store on April 2 when, just six days later, the book removals started, she said.",
      "Murphy said she was on the floor the day management began pulling LGBTQ titles from the shelves. She refused to participate in the removals themselves, she said, but was then directed to delete the titles from the store\u2019s inventory system, which she reluctantly did. She spoke out, informing management that the exclusive removal of LGBTQ titles was discriminatory and that it violated the company\u2019s own core mission, vision and values of inclusion and integrity, she said. In resistance, she hid queer books and documented each title removed from the system.",
      "\u201cI refused to pull any books from the shelves. There were never criteria for the books being removed,\u201d she said. \u201cManagement started pulling anything that looked queer \u2014 books with pictures of two girls kissing on the cover or romance books with main characters that have the same pronouns. These were not sexually explicit or profane materials.\u201d",
      "Murphy, the former employee who asked to remain anonymous, and a current employee who requested anonymity due to fears of retaliation from the Studers, said O\u2019Connor told them that she had a meeting with Rishy Studer, who, O\u2019Connor said, told her to remove the LGBTQ books. O\u2019Conner told the employees that Studer also directed her to then pull the witchcraft books, which the former employees say was an attempt to disguise the targeted queer removals. Murphy resigned on April 22, and books were still being removed up until her last day, she said. At least five of the bookstore\u2019s 10 staff members, including Murphy, told NBC News they have resigned since the books began to be removed.",
      "Regarding the meeting between O\u2019Connor and Rishy Studer, Quint Studer said in an email that Rishy \u201cnever mentioned any specific titles or categories\u201d and that \u201call conversations regarded language in the children\u2019s area.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Connor didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about the meeting.",
      "According to Melissa Smith, the former manager of Bodacious Bookstore who resigned on April 28 over the store\u2019s alleged censorship practices, it isn\u2019t the first time LGBTQ books have been targeted.",
      "Smith, who joined Bodacious in 2021, took pride in building its book club community and ensuring the store offered diverse and representative reading materials. She wasn\u2019t in the store when the most recent removals began, as she had been on family and medical leave since early March. However, in July 2022, while she was out on vacation, she said, the store implemented a stealthy policy to exclude LGBTQ books from the children\u2019s section after a customer complaint about the book \u201cMelissa\u201d by Alex Gino, about a young transgender girl. Despite the policy, one book, \u201cMy Mommies Love Me,\u201d was mistakenly ordered for Mother\u2019s Day and quickly pulled last month during the broader removal of queer titles, according to Murphy and the two former staffers.",
      "\u201cI even created a banned-book section in the store in February because of customers\u2019 demand for these titles,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point of books: to either see yourself represented or understand someone else\u2019s experience.",
      "While the bookstore maintains it isn\u2019t banning books or LGBTQ content, vetting books only to create a \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d space, Murphy and the two employees who asked to be anonymous also reported the removal of queer greeting cards and pride stickers, including a Mother\u2019s Day card that was mistakenly identified as representing a queer family. Several former employees, authors and community members have questioned whether the definition of \u201cfamily friendly\u201d includes LGBTQ families.",
      "Young adult author Ginny Myers Sain was scheduled to visit the store on April 26 for National Independent Bookstore Day to promote her new release, \u201cWhen the Bones Sing.\u201d However, she canceled her appearance after the store failed to clarify which books were being targeted for removal and what qualified as \u201cfamily friendly,\u201d later posting a widely shared statement on Facebook condemning the shop for censorship.",
      "\u201cWe expect independent bookstores to be leading the charge against this sort of thing, not leaning into it,\u201d she told NBC News. \u201cReaders are counting on us. As someone who writes for teens, I feel that obligation particularly deeply. All kids deserve to be able to walk into their local bookstore and see themselves reflected and celebrated in the books they find there. And everyone knows that, in history, the people banning books have never been the good guys.\u201d",
      "According to former employees, bookstore management is using the nonprofit organization Common Sense Media to vet titles for removal or potential return to the shelves. While educators, librarians and families commonly use the platform to evaluate age ratings in books and media, Murphy and one of the employees who asked to be anonymous argue that it was never intended as a tool to restrict access to books. It remains unclear whether employees will be permitted to special-order queer books or other titles no longer carried in the store, as many report that all orders now require management approval.",
      "\u201cMy manager told me that as a private business, they don\u2019t have to sell or cater to certain people, implying queer families can shop elsewhere,\u201d said the current employee who requested anonymity. \u201cFrom both a political and business standpoint, I think it was a stupid decision to pull the books, because that\u2019s actually more political than not pulling them.\u201d",
      "The employee said none of the removed titles have been returned to shelves, though the Studers contradicted that both in their public statements and to NBC News."

      "\u201cThese young generations of whites are sick of the bullying, intimidation and being made to shut up about race issues,\u201d WhiteTexasMommy wrote on the fundraising page while contributing $50. NBC News captured the comment in a screenshot before it was removed.",

They\u2019ve been allowed into our schools and neighborhoods, forced upon us at every turn, and they still aren\u2019t happy,\u201d donor Heywildrich wrote on another since-removed post before contributing $88.",
      "Jacob Wells, a co-founder of the Christian crowd-funding platform GiveSendGo, said on social media that comments on the fundraiser had been disabled \u201cdue to the unacceptable volume of racist and derogatory remarks.\u201d",

      "The Rochester branch of the NAACP also held a fundraiser to benefit the family of the child in the incident. \u201cTogether, we raised $341,484. Love wins!\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cIn response to the family\u2019s wishes, we have now closed the GoFundMe page.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe stand in full solidarity with the child and his family\u2014and with all those who believe in building a community where dignity, justice, and love prevail,\u201d the statement added.",
      "On Monday, the Rochester Police Department said it had completed its investigation into the altercation and submitted its findings to the city attorney\u2019s office for review.",
      "The video, shot by Sharmake Omar, 30, and verified by NBC News, quickly gained traction online last week.",
      "Omar said that he intervened when he saw the woman berating the child and that she began using the slur repeatedly, which was captured in the video.",
      "In the video, the woman, apparently carrying her child away, answers, \u201cYeah,\u201d when she is asked whether she called the youth the slur. \u201cHe took my son\u2019s stuff,\u201d she says.",

      "The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put on hold a judge\u2019s order halting the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s move to cut short a two-year \u201cparole\u201d granted to the migrants under Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.",
      "The administration\u2019s action marked an expansion of the Republican president\u2019s hardline crackdown on immigration and push to ramp up deportations, including of noncitizens previously granted a legal right to live and work in the United States.",
      "The administration argued Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had discretion to categorically end the migrants\u2019 status and that the judge\u2019s order was forcing the U.S. government to \u201cretain hundreds of thousands of aliens in the country against its will.\u201d",
      "But a three-judge panel comprised entirely of appointees of Democratic presidents said Noem \u201chas not at this point made a \u2018strong showing\u2019 that her categorical termination of plaintiffs\u2019 parole is likely to be sustained on appeal.\u201d",
      "Karen Tumlin, a lawyer whose immigrant rights group Justice Action Center pursued the case, welcomed the court\u2019s decision. She called the administration\u2019s actions \u201creckless and illegal.\u201d",

      "While the case was pending, the Homeland Security Department on March 25 announced in a Federal Register notice that it had decided to terminate the two-year parole granted to about 400,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelan migrants.",
      "U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, on April 25 halted the agency\u2019s action, which she said revoked previously granted parole and work authorizations for migrants on a categorical basis and without a necessary case-by-case review.She said the department\u2019s sole basis for declining to allow the migrants\u2019 parole status to naturally expire was based on a legal error, as it wrongly concluded doing so would foreclose the department\u2019s ability to legally expedite their deportations."

      "Jon Voight has submitted a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d to President Donald Trump mapping out ways to boost domestic film and television production, the Oscar-winning actor\u2019s manager announced Monday.",
      "Voight and his manager, Steven Paul, met with Trump over the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, according to a news release. Voight and Paul pitched their suite of ideas, including federal tax incentives, changes to various tax codes, co-production treaties with foreign countries and infrastructure subsidies for production companies and theater owners.",
      "The meeting took place before Trump called for duties on \u201cany and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,\u201d decrying other nations for offering financial incentives that have lured producers away. Trump's Truth Social post Sunday night was met with a mix of confusion and fear by the entertainment industry.",
      "White House officials clarified Monday that \u201cno final decisions\u201d had been made and that they were \u201cexploring all options.\u201d It was not immediately clear whether Trump\u2019s proposal would also apply to TV productions or and exactly what part of physical production would be tariffed.",
      "Voight and Paul\u2019s proposal includes what the two characterize as \u201ctariffs in certain limited circumstances.\u201d The news release otherwise does not mention tariffs.",
      "Voight is one of three stars Trump tapped to be \u201cspecial ambassadors to Hollywood,\u201d which Trump has called a \u201cgreat but very troubled place.\u201d The two others are Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone.",
      "In a statement, Voight said in part: \u201cThe President loves the entertainment business and this country, and he will help us make Hollywood great again.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe look forward to working with the administration, the unions, studios, and streamers to help form a plan to keep our industry healthy and bring more productions back to America,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cBy creating the right environment through smart incentives, updated policies, and much-needed support, we can ensure that American production companies thrive, more jobs stay here at home, and Hollywood once again leads the world in creativity and innovation.\"",
      "In recent years, the American film industry has suffered a series of economic blows. Covid and two labor strikes upended the content pipeline. Physical production has declined in California amid budget cuts and more generous tax incentives elsewhere.",
      "Voight is known for his conservative political views. He is one of Trump\u2019s highest-profile celebrity backers, having once called him \u201cthe greatest president since Abraham Lincoln.\u201d",
      "Voight won the Academy Award for best actor for the Vietnam war drama \u201cComing Home\u201d (1978) and starred in the best picture winner \u201cMidnight Cowboy\u201d (1969).

      "Welcome to the online version of\u00a0From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "In today\u2019s edition, we break down a key development in the 2026 battle for the Senate majority. Plus, campaign season may still be a ways away but, as Ben Kamisar notes, the Trump administration is spending massive sums of money on the airwaves touting its immigration crackdown efforts.",

      "GOP dealt a blow in the battle for the Senate",
      "Republicans were dealt a major blow in their bid to expand their Senate majority on Monday, with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp passing a run against the party\u2019s top target for defeat, Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff.",
      "As Bridget Bowman and Sahil Kapur report, Kemp was viewed as the GOP\u2019s leading recruit in Georgia, one of two states President Donald Trump carried in 2024 with a Democratic-held Senate seat that\u2019s up in 2026. The other is Michigan, where Democratic Sen. Gary Peters is retiring.",
      "The background: Kemp has shown a rare ability to appeal to both conservative and middle-of-the-road voters.",
      "After Kemp opposed efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia, Trump backed former Sen. David Perdue in the 2022 GOP gubernatorial primary. But Kemp easily defeated Perdue before going on to win re-election by nearly 8 points over Stacey Abrams, just two years after Joe Biden became the first Democrat to carry Georgia in a presidential election since 1992.",
      "Plan B: It\u2019s unclear what Kemp\u2019s next steps will be, as he\u2019s unable to seek re-election next year due to term limits. But his decision to forgo a Senate run will likely spark a crowded and competitive GOP primary to take on Ossoff.",
      "Multiple members of Georgia\u2019s congressional delegation \u2014 including Reps. Buddy Carter, Rich McCormick, Mike Collins and Marjorie Taylor Greene \u2014 have suggested they would consider a bid if Kemp did not run.",
      "Greene indicated to NBC News last week that she\u2019s weighing a Senate run. \u201cI have just a lot of options open to me,\u201d she said.",
      "Among other statewide elected Republicans, Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper and Insurance Commissioner John King are also seen as potential candidates.",
      "The map: Ultimately, the Georgia seat will likely be more important to Democrats as they try to eat into the GOP\u2019s 53-47 majority. In addition to Michigan, Democrats also have open seats to defend in Minnesota and New Hampshire. And the party\u2019s offensive opportunities are relatively limited, with Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina seen as the most vulnerable Republicans.",
      "Read more from Bridget and Sahil \u2192",
      "Over in the House: Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., announced she will not seek re-election next year after serving 14 terms in the House. Kat Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old internet personality, had already entered the race for Schakowsky\u2019s safe Democratic seat.",
      "Kristi Noem is the face of the Trump administration's massive deportation ad campaign",
      "The Department of Homeland Security is spending big bucks \u2014 almost $21 million so far, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact \u2014 on an ad campaign featuring Secretary Kristi Noem heaping praise on President Donald Trump and calling on immigrants in America illegally to \u201cleave now.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s an amount of money that\u2019s in line with what a prominent statewide campaign might spend, according to AdImpact. By comparison, liberal candidate Susan Crawford spent $28 million on ads while conservative candidate Brad Schimel spent $15 million during last month\u2019s closely watched Wisconsin Supreme Court election. In last year\u2019s election, Pennsylvania Republican Dave McCormick spent $21 million on ads in one of the most competitive Senate races on the battleground map.",
      "The vast majority of the DHS spots feature Noem speaking directly to the\u00a0camera, touting Trump and warning, \u201cIf you are here illegally, we will find you and we will deport you. You will never return. But if you leave now, you may have an opportunity to return.\u201d",
      "Other variations include Noem blasting \u201cweak politicians\u201d for leaving \u201cour borders wide open,\u201d while others feature her speaking in English with Spanish subtitles.",
      "Other more targeted ads show Noem detailing a list of \u201cillegal aliens caught because of President Trump\u2019s leadership.\u201d Some spots also feature footage of arrests and from her visit to the El Salvador prison where deported Venezuelans are being held.",
      "The ads are broadly targeted to newscasts like morning and nightly news shows on major broadcast networks, and Spanish-language channels.",
      "The federal government has spent billions in taxpayer funds over the years on advertising campaigns, including on those to highlight government programs or encourage recruitment.",
      "Healthcare.gov, the federal health care exchange, has benefitted from tens of millions of dollars in advertising over the years, with the Obama administration running ads to encourage sign-ups (including in red states). The Biden administration also spent $50 million to note how the 2021 Covid relief law created new subsidies for health insurance.",
      "But what\u2019s particularly notable about the new DHS ad campaign is how heavily Noem, a former South Dakota governor who, at 53, could have a long political career ahead of her, is featured.",
      "And soon, Noem won\u2019t be the only Trump administration official whose agency spends tens of millions of dollars to broadcast its message on the airwaves. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to launch his own public relations effort, according to a document obtained by NBC News that says the campaign would include up to three ads a day across major TV networks.",

      "\u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\u201d is described on The Met\u2019s website as examining the \u201cimportance of style to the formation of Black identities in the Atlantic diaspora, particularly in the United States and Europe.\u201d",
      "The museum explains how Black style has evolved for over 300 years and is rooted in the idea of Black dandyism, which was birthed by \u201cthe intersection of African and European style traditions.\u201d During the style's origins in the 18th century, there was more access to clothing and goods as a result of the transatlantic slave trade, which began in 16th century, in addition to colonialism and imperialism.",
      "The Met Gala 2025 theme of \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\u201d will also be showcased in the museum\u2019s corresponding exhibit.",

      "The museum also revealed that the exhibit will feature photos of civil rights activist W.E.B. DuBois, writings by authors Zora Neale Hurston and Nikki Giovanni \u2014 who died in December 2024 \u2014 and archival pieces from leaders in Black media, like Jet magazine. Clothing worn by pioneers in Black history like Frederick Douglass and the late Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley, will be on display, too.",
      "Dandy Wellington, a bandleader, presenter and creative consultant who embraces the dandy lifestyle, tells TODAY.com he will be featured in the exhibition\u2019s catalog where he penned an essay about zoot suits. He also recently spoke on a panel with Miller and more to discuss the importance of Harlem in Black fashion and culture.",
      "In his interview with TODAY.com, Wellington opens up about being raised in Harlem and how he became inspired by Black dandyism after watching films featuring Harry Belafonte, the Nicholas Brothers, Lena Horne and other icons.",
      "\u201cI grew up in Harlem where fashion is always on display in the community and in the culture,\u201d he says.",
      "He says growing up in a neighborhood with a rich history and consuming so many classic Hollywood films made him enamored with the \u201cundeniable\u201d artistry that Black dandyism represents.",
      "What is Black dandyism?",
      "Wellington tells TODAY.com he was \u201cbeyond excited\u201d when he heard about the 2025 Met Gala theme and is looking forward to the interpretations he hopes to see on the red carpet.",
      "\u201cThere are so many unique, profound and inspiring examples of Black style,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m really excited that the exhibit is going to be covering everything, from enslavement to hip-hop. We\u2019re talking about three centuries of Black cultural expression.\u201d",
      "The bandleader adds, \u201cWhen it comes to the Met Gala theme I\u2019m really excited to see how people engage with tailoring for their bodies \u2014 for different body types, for different genders \u2014 and then how black expression also comes through in a very potent, polished way.\u201d",
      "Black dandyism is confidence. It\u2019s culture. Clothing is armor. It\u2019s taking clothing and using it as a way to fully express who you are.\u201d",
      "Dandy Wellington, Bandleader",
      "Miller details the rise and significance of Black dandyism in her book \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity.\u201d The novel tracks the early days of Black dandyism to Enlightenment England \u2014 a period between the 17th and 18th centuries that emphasized logic and freedom of thought \u2014 and touches on historical figures, like the formerly enslaved Julius Soubise, a musician who became involved in London\u2019s 18th century social scene, and more modern artists such as Yinka Shonibare, a British scholar whose work discusses the relationship between Africa and Europe.",
      "In February, the Council of Fashion Designers of America published a story about Black dandyism that highlighted some current day examples, including co-chair Colman Domingo and Met Gala host committee member Andr\u00e9 3000.",
      "The not-for-profit association, which includes over 450 American fashion and accessory designers as members, spoke to Darnell-Jamal Lisby, fashion historian and assistant curator of The Cleveland Museum of Art, about how Black dandyism separates itself from dandyism.",
      "\u201cBlack dandyism aligns with traditional dandyism but carries an organic self-expression that transcends societal norms,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the African American context, it began with respectability in politics before evolving into a revolutionary statement. Figures like Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Du Bois used refined imagery to challenge racist narratives. By the 1920s, Black men reinterpreted Eurocentric fashion through their own lens, blending respectability with rebellion, a dynamic that continues to shape Black menswear today.\u201d",
      "Lisby mentioned zoot suits in particular, which feature high-waisted, billowy pants.",
      "\u201cInitially, they were not a political act, but became one when mainstream society criminalized the look. Black men\u2019s bodies have long been policed, and deviating from white norms only heightened that scrutiny. Yet, they embraced the style as their own,\u201d he said.",
      "Speaking about the eras of Black dandyism that he showcases in his personal style, Wellington shares in his TODAY.com interview that he dresses in the style and feel of the 1920s and \u201830s.",
      "\u201cA saying that I hold dear, and I sort of live is: Vintage style, not vintage values. What that means to me is that we have to look back, but we have to do so in order to move forward,\u201d he says about the celebration of Black dandyism.",
      "\u201cBlack dandyism is confidence. It\u2019s culture. Clothing is armor,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s taking clothing and using it as a way to fully express who you are. It\u2019s rare for a lot of people in their day to day life to feel like they are fully expressing themselves through clothing. It\u2019s intention\u2026and I look forward to it inspiring others to bring a little bit of that into their lives and to learn more about it.\u201d",
      "What are some examples of Black dandyism?",
      "In 2017, Paper Magazine spoke to author Shantrelle P. Lewis about her book \u201cDandy Lion: The Black Dandy and Street Style,\u201d which shines a light on designers, tailors and events that have shaped contemporary Black dandyism.",
      "After referencing how Miller\u2019s book chronicled the trajectory of Black dandyism, Lewis noted in the interview how Frederick Douglass and W.E.B. Du Bois were early examples of Black dandyism.",
      "\u201cI think in an earlier era, it was deeply rooted in respectability,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt then reflected scholastic rigor and self- respect \u2014 think Malcolm X and his sharp suits or James Baldwin.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cToday, dandyism is a more recent manifestation of hip hop culture. Black dandies are using hip hop methods of sampling to mix styles and articles of clothing from different eras and cultures to articulate statements of Black masculinity and individuality.\u201d",
      "What might some celebs wear at the 2025 Met Gala?",
      "Fashion fans should expect this year\u2019s 2025 Met Gala red carpet to be decorated with colorful menswear.",
      "One of the great things about this particular theme is that it\u2019s an opportunity for women and members of the LGBT community to embrace tailoring as they always have.\u201d",
      "Dandy Wellington",
      "As Lewis explained to Paper Magazine, color is reflected in dandy culture all over the world.",
      "\u201cWithin the Black community, color serves as a continuum of expressiveness and meaning present in the African aesthetic. You see pops of color that reflects the vibrancy of African Diasporan people internationally,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s loud, it\u2019s disruptive, it\u2019s flamboyant and filled with self respect and pride. It takes a lot of confidence to strut down the street dressed in a bright sky blue ankara fabric jacket. That color is often pleasurable for the wearer as it is for the observer.\u201d",
      "Wellington teases what else fashionistas should look out for while tuning into fashion's biggest night. \u201cWe\u2019ll see different interpretations of black tie and white tie, the formal versions of classic dress and traditional menswear,\u201d he tells TODAY.com.",
      "When it comes to his personal interests, the bandleader says he is most looking forward to seeing different types of hats. \u201cAs somebody who wears hats every day and feels like an outfit isn\u2019t complete without a hat, I\u2019m very excited to see classic millinery and inventive, dynamic millinery on display,\u201d he says.",
      "He also predicts there will be plenty of African prints to show a connection between continents and how Black culture reflects the African Diaspora.",
      "Wellington believes guests will go all out with their accessories, too.",
      "\u201cI am very excited to see how jewelry gets incorporated into these tailored looks. Double breasted waistcoats, dynamic lapels, some of the seaming, belt backs, box pleats and all kinds of things, that stuff is so core to tailoring. But these finishing touches are what make outfits dynamic. It\u2019s what makes them sing,\u201d he explains, noting that wooden jewelry, which is common in West Africa, will likely be on display and in some A-listers\u2019 bracelets and earrings.",
      "When it comes to the designers and milliners who will help highlight Black dandyism, Wellington says he hopes that Black creatives will be at the forefront.",
      "\u201cI think that there are many Black designers who have not gotten their due when it comes to being showcased in such a public setting,\u201d he says.",
      "I think that the bar is set so high, I have confidence that even those who might not naturally gravitate to this theme will take it as an opportunity to step it up because this isn\u2019t just a fashion moment. It\u2019s a cultural moment.\u201d",
      "Dandy Wellington",
      "So who is the bandleader most excited to see on the Met Gala red carpet? His eyes will be on Domingo and fellow Harlemite A$AP Rocky. \u201cOne of the great things about this particular theme is that it\u2019s an opportunity for women and members of the LGBT community to embrace tailoring as they always have,\u201d he notes. \u201cYou know, folks like Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Audra McDonald and, of course, fellow dapper man, Dapper Dan.\u201d",
      "Wellington says he isn\u2019t worried about how some celebrities will interpret the theme.",

      "A U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity said that U.S. forces were not actively involved in Monday\u2019s strikes, but there is general coordination between the two allies, the official said.",
      "Meanwhile, an oil company operated by the Houthis announced it has begun operating an emergency system for supplying cars with fuel, owing to difficulties in unloading cargo at the oil port of Ras Isa.",
      "The company, in a statement, attributed the decision to U.S. strikes on the country, including the port.",

      "The war in Gaza started after Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. Israel\u2019s offensive on Gaza has killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, Gaza health officials have said, and destroyed much of the enclave.",
      "Netanyahu said in a video message the operation would be \u201cintensive\u201d and would see more Palestinians in Gaza moved \u201cfor their own safety.",
      "He said\u00a0Israeli troops would not follow previous tactics based on short raids by forces based outside Gaza. \u201cThe intention is the opposite,\u201d he said, echoing comments from other officials who have said\u00a0the country would hold on to the ground it has seized.",
      "Israeli troops have already taken over an area amounting to around a third of Gaza, displacing the population and building watchtowers and surveillance posts on cleared ground the military has described as security zones, but the new plan would go further."

    "story": [
      "Before this week's federal election in Canada, Derek Ouellette and his wife, Yecenia Ouellette, could never have imagined voting for anyone but a Conservative.",
      "\u201cWe were both raised Conservative and we both kind of thought, Conservative is just what you do,\u201d Derek Ouellette, a 46-year-old insurance broker from Belle River, near Windsor, Ontario, said in a phone interview late Tuesday.",
      "But Ouellette said he was proud to have done the once unthinkable, voting for Liberal leader and Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is projected to have secured a minority victory in this week's poll.",
      "Across social media, a number of once-dedicated Conservatives said that they would be casting their ballots for the Liberal Party this week for the first time in their lives. Many described their vote as a rejection of \"Canada's Trump\" \u2014 Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre \u2014 and his aggressive campaign, which experts say appeared to pull from the playbook of President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cThere were some elements of his campaign that echoed Trump,\u201d Roland Paris, director of the University of Ottawa\u2019s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, said Wednesday.",
      "That included talking \u201cabout eliminating wokeism\u201d and \u201creferring to his political opponents with nasty nicknames,\u201d Paris added. \u201cNone of these features of his campaign helped him once Trump came to be seen by many Canadians as an enemy of Canada.\u201d",
      "Just weeks ago, the pugnacious approach of Poilievre, who had previously allied himself with the so-called Freedom Convoy that protested vaccine mandates for truck drivers, appeared to be working.",
      "His campaign, during which he focused on small-government and libertarian issues, combined with dissatisfaction at the scandal-hit Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's handling of the economy to see the Conservatives move 24 points ahead of the Liberals in January, according to a poll tracker run by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.",
      "But within a matter of weeks, everything changed: Trudeau announced his resignation Jan. 6, while Trump swept back to power in the U.S., threatening to use economic pressure to annex Canada as the \u201c51st state,\u201d before imposing sweeping 25% tariffs on goods from America\u2019s northern neighbor and sparking outrage across the country.",
      "Trump's bellicose remarks gave a huge boost to Canadian nationalism, with many vowing to boycott the U.S. and its products.",
      "As anti-Trump sentiment grew across Canada, Poilievre's own bullish rhetoric rapidly lost its sheen for many Canadian Conservatives.",
      "When Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, was named Canada\u2019s interim prime minister and the Liberal candidate for the 2025 election, distaste for Trudeau and worries about the Liberals' ability to handle the economy quickly evaporated.",
      "When it did, a new way forward emerged for those who had felt politically homeless.",
      "Poilievre, now the former leader of the opposition, even lost the parliamentary seat he had held for two decades to a Liberal neophyte Monday.",
      "'Maple MAGA'",
      "\u201cListening to Poilievre speak, it\u2019s like talking points from Trump,\u201d Ouellette said. \u201cIt just reeks of what\u2019s happening south of the border.\u201d",
      "By comparison, he added, Carney \u201chas shown himself to be very decisive in dealing with Trump\u201d by billing himself as candidate who could stand up to the president.",
      "\u201cI just cannot support the hate rhetoric ... and this \u2018Maple MAGA\u2019 movement that\u2019s happening here in Canada,\u201d said Chantal Dugdale, 57, another Conservative who voted Liberal for the first time in her life Monday.",
      "Dugdale said she found parallels between Poilievre\u2019s campaign and support base, and Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement particularly off-putting.",
      "\u201cWe need unity. We need to be together. We need positive messaging,\u201d said Dugdale, who is from Barrie, just north of Toronto, and works in marketing and sales.",
      "Trump appeared aware of his likely impact on Canada\u2019s election, saying in an interview conducted last week and published Monday by The Atlantic that until he \u201ccame along, remember, that the Conservative was leading.\u201d",
      "\u201cThen I was disliked by enough of the Canadians that I\u2019ve thrown the election into a close call, right?\u201d he said.",
      "A close call indeed, with Ouellette, Dugdale and political experts noting that Carney\u2019s victory was far from a landslide, with the next Liberal government projected to fall short of winning the majority of seats in Parliament.",
      "And while lifelong Conservatives may have helped propel the Liberal leader forward, Paris said he believed \u201cMark Carney would likely not have won if not for Donald Trump.\u201d",
      "\u201cCanadians were tired of the Liberal Party after 10 years, but they were even more concerned about Trump\u2019s threats,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, Dugdale pointed out, the election\u2019s projected outcome was a far cry from the Conservative victory that felt increasingly certain just weeks ago, with Poilievre now out of a job.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so ironic. Paul [Poilievre] was shouting, \u2018we need change,\u2019\u201d Dugdale said. \u201cHe got change alright.\u201d"

      "Australia\u2019s incumbent Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second term in a close general election Saturday, local broadcasters projected, in a defeat for the\u00a0conservative coalition\u00a0that was undermined at the ballot box by its\u00a0association with President Donald Trump.",
      "The Labor Party pulled ahead of the\u00a0conservative Liberal-National coalition, led by Peter Dutton, with the Australian Electoral Commission\u2019s early projections suggesting at least 70\u00a0of the 150 House seats for Labor, according to the Australian broadcaster ABC.",
      "\u201cNot the night we wanted,\u201d Dutton said at his party headquarters, adding that he had congratulated Albanese on his win.",
      "Independent candidates and minor parties are projected to take about 13 seats in parliament, which means Albanese may have to form a coalition if the final count shows that his party ultimately falls short of a parliamentary majority.",
      "Concerns among Australians over the soaring cost of living and the lack of affordable housing dominated the election at a time when interest rates remain high. Geopolitical relations with China, Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, were also front of mind for voters.",
      "But voters in this election were more concerned by Trump\u2019s shake-up of the global order with a new trade regime that slapped a 10% tariff on all Australian exports to the U.S.",
      "A survey published Wednesday by Australian think tank the Lowy Institute found that over 60% of Australians did not have any level of trust in the U.S. to act responsibly.",
      "Albanese, 62, rose to the top job in 2022, ending nine years of conservative rule. Spotlighting his working-class credentials, his party in this election promised\u00a0tax cuts,\u00a0help for young homebuyers, and a pledge of $5.5 billion more for health care.",
      "Until recently, the Australian leader\u00a0faced the prospect of becoming the country\u2019s first single-term prime minister in almost a century, bogged down by high inflation, a slowing economy, and a housing crisis put into sharp relief by Albanese\u2019s ill-timed purchase of a multimillion-dollar cliff-top home.",
      "After Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, Dutton, 54, who was leading the polls against his rival Albanese, saw a turnaround in popularity after many of his party\u2019s campaign promises, including on immigration, were seen as widely emulating Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).",
      "In the lead-up to the election, Liberal Party insiders told Reuters that the anti-Trump sentiment was spurring risk-averse voters to move away from Dutton at the ballot box.",
      "Trump had been \u201ca wrecking ball\u201d for Australia\u2019s conservative coalition, said Andrew Carswell, the former press secretary to Liberal Party Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who lost office in the previous\u00a0election, according to Reuters.",
      "Albanese, meanwhile, refrained from mentioning Trump on the campaign trail, instead telling voters on Monday, \u201cThe last thing you need is a volatile government.\u201d",
      "He has avoided direct criticism of the president in favor of a security alliance with the U.S., though he was notably absent from Trump\u2019s inauguration and has yet to visit Washington.",
      "A YouGov poll released on Thursday predicted a Labor majority, saying the party would likely win up to\u00a085 seats\u00a0in the 150-seat lower house, with the opposition facing a net loss of 11 seats, which would be its worst performance since 1946.",
      "Albanese\u2019s win comes after Canada\u2019s election earlier this week saw Prime Minister Mark Carney stage a major political comeback, fueled by a backlash against Trump\u2019s comments on making Canada the 51st U.S. state.",
      "Australia is one of a few countries where voting is compulsory for all citizens ages 18 years and older. Around 4.8 million of 18 million eligible voters began casting their votes as early as Thursday, with most postal votes expected to be counted after\u00a0election\u00a0day."

    "story": [
      "SINGAPORE \u2014 Singapore\u2019s long-ruling People\u2019s Action Party won another landslide in Saturday\u2019s general elections, extending its 66-year unbroken rule in a huge boost for Prime Minister Lawrence Wong who took power a year ago.",
      "The Election Department announced the PAP won 82 Parliamentary seats after vote counting ended. The party had earlier won five seats uncontested, giving it 87 out of a total 97 seats. The opposition Workers Party maintained its 10 seats.",
      "The PAP\u2019s popular vote rose to 65.6%, up from a near-record low of 61% in 2020 polls. Jubilant supporters of the PAP, which had ruled Singapore since 1959, gathered in stadiums waved flags and cheered in celebration.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful once again for your strong mandate. We will honor the trust you have given to us by working even harder for all of you,\u201d Wong said in a speech earlier to his constituency before the full results were out.",
      "Eugene Tan, a law professor at the Singapore Management University, said the opposition\u2019s failure to make further inroads after 2020 was a surprise. \u201cSingapore voters played their cards close to their chest. Today, they indicated that their trust is with a party that has delivered over the years,\u201d he said.",
      "A U.S.-trained economist who is also finance minister, Wong\u2019s appeal for a resounding mandate to steer trade-reliant Singapore through economic turbulence following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff hikes has hit home. The government has lowered its growth forecast and warned of a possible recession.",
      "Wong, 52, succeeded Lee Hsien Loong to become the city-state\u2019s fourth leader. Lee stepped down in May 2024 after two decades at the helm but remained in the Cabinet as a senior minister. His retirement as premier ended a family dynasty started by his father, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore\u2019s first leader, who built the former colonial backwater into one of the world\u2019s richest nations during 31 years in office.",
      "The PAP is seen as a beacon of stability and prosperity, but tight government control and the rising cost of living in one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities also has led to growing unhappiness, especially among younger voters. Widening income disparity, increasingly unaffordable housing, overcrowding and restrictions on free speech have loosened the PAP\u2019s grip on power.",
      "The opposition says giving it a stronger presence in Parliament will allow a more balanced political system and greater accountability. But they face an uphill task, often hamstrung by a lack of resources, fragmented support and a lack of unity. Critics said gerrymandering also gives the PAP an advantage.",
      "Pritam Singh, leader of the Workers Party, acknowledged it was a tough contest and vowed to continue the fight for a more balanced Parliament. \u201cThe slate is wiped clean, we start work again tomorrow, and we go again,\u201d he said.",
      "While the Workers Party failed to expand its presence, it had consolidated its support with increased share vote in some areas, said Southeast Asia political analyst Bridget Welsh. Other smaller opposition parties however, failed to make a breakthrough.",
      "Welsh said voters opted for stability amid concerns over global volatility due to sweeping U.S. tariffs. Wong\u2019s more approachable leadership in engaging younger voters and efforts to renew PAP by bringing in about a-third of new faces also helped swung votes, she said.",
      "\u201cI call this the Wong and Trump effect,\u201d she said. \u201cThe issue of economic insecurity really did reinforce his mandate.\u201d"

He added artificial white doves to the arrangement, saying they were in honor of the late Pope Francis, who had led a radical shift in the Catholic Church\u2019s treatment of LGBTQ people.",
      "\u201cPope Francis is a testament that God is alive,\u201d Concepcion, a devout Catholic who works as a street vendor, told NBC News. \u201cHe accepted everyone, including us gay people who have long been marginalized.\u201d",
      "Francis\u2019 death on April 21 has opened the eternal tension between choosing a successor that represents continuity, or one who will bring change, including a possible return to the church\u2019s recent past of more conservative positions on issues like homosexuality.",
      "Luis Antonio Tagle, a Filipino cardinal often dubbed the \u201cAsian Francis\u201d for his emphasis on poor and marginalized people, has emerged as a possible leading contender, or papabile, when the conclave meets on May 7 to elect Francis\u2019 replacement.",
      "If chosen as pope, Tagle could carry with him some lessons from the Philippines. Despite being the biggest Catholic nation in Asia \u2014 about 80% of Filipinos are Catholic \u2014 and the third-largest in the world, it is also one of the more LGBTQ-friendly countries in the region.",
      "Many gay Catholics, like Concepcion, remain active and visible members of the church, and he says Tagle offers the possibility of continuing Francis\u2019 embrace of gay Catholics into the next papacy.",
      "\u201cBeing gay is not wrong because we were also created by God and all things that God created are beautiful,\u201d Concepcion added.",
      "The Philippine Catholic Church has become more open to gay Catholics in recent years, including in a 2024 position paper in which the church acknowledged the LGBTQ community\u2019s \u201cimportant role in the life of the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines.\u201d",
      "And while Tagle, who is known for avoiding provocative rhetoric and controversial issues, has rarely spoken publicly about homosexuality in his statements and homilies, he has lamented the church\u2019s \u201charsh words\u201d in the past about gay and divorced people. Filipino Catholics say they have felt supported by some of his actions and see them as potential signs of his approach to the community if he were to be elected pope.",
      "Edwin Valles, former president of Courage Philippines, an LGBTQ organization under the Archdiocese of Manila, says he is certain that Tagle would continue embracing the gay community.",
      "In 2014, Valles said he approached Tagle, then head of the Archdiocese of Manila, to request a priest to be assigned to guide their members, a request Tagle granted.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a commitment on his part,\u201d Valles said. \u201cHe puts money where his mouth is. So I like to think that he will also do the same if and when he becomes pope.\u201d",
      "Valles tells a story from a 2018 event they both attended, when a young faithful asked the cardinal about the status of LGBTQ Catholics.",
      "\u201cAnd his answer was something like: All of us are Catholics, all of us are parishioners, all of us are children of God. So why make that label and distinction? That just serves to separate or put people in boxes,\u201d Valles recalled Tagle saying.",
      "A man of the people",
      "The Jesuit-educated Tagle, 67, was born to a Filipino father and a Filipino Chinese mother who were both bankers, and Tagle grew up in a well-to-do family. He was ordained as a priest in 1982 at the age of 24, and like Francis, adopted a simple life.",
      "From 2001 to 2011, he served as the bishop of the Diocese of Imus, a city south of Manila, and his hometown. There, Tagle took to walking the streets, greeting street vendors and motorcycle taxi drivers. Residents affectionately recalled how Tagle would sit on a wooden bench outside a humble neighborhood barbershop, Bible in hand, his presence so regular that it earned Roland, the shopkeeper, the nickname, \u201cHoly Barber.\u201d",
      "Tagle then became Manila\u2019s archbishop in 2011 and was made a cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012. In 2015, he was elected president of Caritas Internationalis, the humanitarian and development organization of the Catholic Church, and was re-elected again in 2019. That year, he moved to the Vatican after Francis appointed him head of the Dicastery for Evangelization, the church\u2019s missionary arm.",
      "He would fly back to the Philippines, unannounced and without fanfare, to check on his ailing parents, have his hair cut by Roland, and make surprise visits to neighbors and relatives eager to receive a blessing from a cardinal back home from the Vatican.",
      "He \u2018does not possess a prophetic voice\u2019",
      "Tagle is highly respected in the Philippines, where he is widely perceived as \u201cwarm, gentle, approachable, humble and at times funny,\u201d just like Francis, Noel Asiones, an academic researcher from the University of Santo Tomas, a Catholic university in Manila, told NBC News.",
      "As a top cleric, Tagle\u2019s pastoral approach \u201creflects a leader eager to serve and emphasize meeting the needs of his flock,\u201d Asiones said.",
      "But the similarities seemed to end there. Unlike Francis, who spoke with forceful, moral authority on worldly issues like exploitative capitalism or the injustices of war, Asiones said, Tagle \u201clacks or does not possess a prophetic voice.\u201d",
      "Tagle has been criticized for his inaction on sexual abuse by priests, and his silence on the extrajudicial killings ordered by the Philippines\u2019 former President Rodrigo Duterte, in a crackdown on drugs that left tens of thousands, including children, dead. Duterte openly attacked and threatened the church, which in the Philippines has historically stood up against political power.",
      "In the face of the flagrant human rights abuses, however, Tagle responded with statements Duterte\u2019s opponents criticized as vague and unchallenging.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Tagle will be entirely Francis 2.0. For one, he opts for political correctness, often avoiding confrontational language, and seems reticent, if not afraid, to hold truth to power,\u201d Asiones said.",
      "A good theologian, but a poor administrator",
      "Tagle has had significant experience in the Vatican, but observers say it has been far from stellar.",
      "In 2022, Francis dismissed Tagle and the rest of the leadership team of Caritas Internationalis after a Vatican-led audit found \u201creal deficiencies\u201d in management and procedures.",
      "What the Roman Curia needs is a pope who is also a good administrator, said Charles Collins, managing editor of Crux, an international publication focusing on the Catholic Church.",
      "\u201cTagle is considered intelligent, a good theologian and a good communicator. But in many ways he has not been a very good administrator in some of the jobs he\u2019s had in the Vatican,\u201d Collins said. \u201cHe has not proven himself in that role.\u201d",
      "Francis had shaken things up in the Vatican and the cardinals may look to someone who could provide stability to replace him.",
      "\u201cI think the conclave is going to look at a European cardinal to become pope,\u201d Collins said.",
      "Three issues are expected to hound the next pope: clerical abuse, poor finances of the Vatican and the ongoing cultural war between progressives and conservatives.",
      "Tagle might be one of the more popular papabili, but Collins cautioned that in every conclave, \u201cthere are always people who are being promoted more in the media than among the cardinals.\u201d",
      "\u201cA pope from Asia or Africa is a good news story, but that does not reflect the views of the cardinal electors.\u201d",
      "Camille Elemia reported from Manila and Imus, Philippines."

      "ROME \u2014 Next week\u2019s\u00a0conclave\u00a0to\u00a0elect the successor\u00a0to\u00a0Pope Francis\u00a0as leader of the world\u2019s 1.4 billion Catholics is a solemn affair steeped in\u00a0centuries-old traditions.",
      "But far from the\u00a0Sistine Chapel\u00a0where\u00a0cloistered cardinals\u00a0will cast votes, people are placing bets on who will be chosen as the next pope. From cash bets on websites to online games modeled after\u00a0fantasy football leagues\u00a0and casual wagers among friends and families, the popularity of guessing and gambling on the future of the papacy is increasing worldwide, experts and participants say.",
      "It\u2019s even topped the Europa League soccer tournament and Formula One drivers\u2019 championship, said Sam Eaton, U.K. manager for Oddschecker, a leading online platform analyzing odds across sports, events and other betting markets.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge level of interest globally,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had a market like this where we\u2019ve had so many countries interested in seeing odds.\u201d",
      "Around the world, thousands of bets on the next pope",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people from some 140 countries have visited Oddschecker to review each cardinal\u2019s chances of becoming the next pope, Eaton said. He noted special eagerness in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States.",
      "In the U.K., about 30,000 pounds (almost $40,000) have been wagered with one leading online betting platform as of this week, Eaton said \u2014 a far cry from 1.2 million pounds on the singing contest Eurovision but still noteworthy as a trend, with the conclave days away.",
      "\u201cBetting on the next pope is definitely a niche market in the grand scheme of things, but it generates global interest,\u201d said Lee Phelps, a spokesman for William Hill, one of the U.K.\u2019s biggest bookmakers.",
      "\u201cSince April 21, we\u2019ve taken thousands of bets, and it\u2019s the busiest of all our non-sports betting markets,\u201d said Phelps, who expects a surge in interest once the conclave begins Wednesday.",
      "Betting on elections, papal conclaves and all manner of global events is almost a tradition of its own in the U.K., but such betting is not legal in the United States. BetMGM, one of the world\u2019s top sports-betting companies, said it would not have any bets up.",
      "But Eaton noted that in the unregulated, illegal space, one of the biggest sites has $10 million wagered so far in pope bets.",
      "Fantasy \u2018teams' of cardinals",
      "In Italy, betting on the papal election \u2014 and all religious events \u2014 is forbidden.",
      "Some people in Rome are making friendly, informal wagers \u2014 the equivalent of $20 on a favorite cardinal, with the loser pledging to host a dinner or buy a pizza night out.",
      "Others are turning to an online game called Fantapapa, or Fantasy Pope, which mimics popular fantasy football and soccer leagues. More than 60,000 people are playing, each choosing 11\u00a0cardinals\u00a0\u2014 as if for a soccer team \u2014 whom they believe have the best shot at becoming the next pope.",
      "They also draft the\u00a0top contender, or captain. As with online wagers, the No. 1 choice for fantasy players has been Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin, closely followed by Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really fun game to play with friends and have a laugh,\u201d Italian student Federico La Rocca, 23, said. \u201cInitially my dad sent it to me ironically, but now that it\u2019s going to be the conclave, I decided to have a go and try it.\u201d",
      "La Rocca said he chose Tagle because \u201che looks like a nice guy and fun person.\u201d",
      "Players\u2019 selections determine the number of points they rake in. But what\u2019s the jackpot?",
      "\u201cEternal glory,\u201d joked Mauro Vanetti, who created the game when\u00a0Francis was hospitalized\u00a0earlier this year.",
      "Vanetti said he and his co-founder are against gambling, but they wanted to create something fun around the event.",
      "\u201cIt seems like in Italy there\u2019s a certain inquisitiveness about the mechanisms of the Catholic hierarchy, but it\u2019s a critical curiosity, a sarcastic and playful curiosity, so we were interested in this jesting spirit for such a solemn event,\u201d Vanetti said. \u201cIn some ways it deflates the sacredness, in a nonaggressive way.\u201d",
      "Some concerns about betting on a solemn event",
      "Beyond simply picking who the next pope will be, players and gamblers also can guess how many tries it will take the cardinals to choose the leader, which day of the week he\u2019ll be elected, what new name he will decide on, or where his priorities will land on the progressive-conservative scale.",
      "While the game and some of the bets have a novel or fun nature, anti-gambling advocates have raised overall concerns about legal gaming and the growing popularity of wagering on all manner of events.",
      "A study published last fall found that 10% of young men in the U.S. show behavior that indicates a\u00a0gambling problem, which is a\u00a0rising concern in other parts of the world, too.",
      "And for gambling around the papacy in general, some have raised religious concerns. Catholic teaching doesn\u2019t go so far as to call games of chance or wagers sinful, but its Catechism warns that \u201cthe passion for gambling risks becoming an enslavement.\u201d",
      "It says gambling becomes \u201cmorally unacceptable\u201d if it gravely affects a person\u2019s livelihood."

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said in comments broadcast Sunday that the need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine had not arisen and that he hopes it will not.",
      "In a preview of an upcoming interview with Russian state television, published on Telegram, Putin said Russia has the strength and the means to bring the conflict in Ukraine to a \u201clogical conclusion.\u201d",
      "Responding to a question about Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory, Putin said: \u201cThere has been no need to use those (nuclear) weapons ... and I hope they will not be required.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have enough strength and means to bring what was started in 2022 to a logical conclusion with the outcome Russia requires,\u201d he said.",
      "Putin\u00a0signed\u00a0a revamped version of Russia\u2019s\u00a0nuclear doctrine\u00a0in November 2024, spelling out the circumstances that allow him to use Moscow\u2019s atomic arsenal, the world\u2019s largest.",
      "That version lowered the bar, giving him that option in response to even a conventional attack backed by a nuclear power.",
      "Russia and Ukraine are at odds over competing ceasefire proposals.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday, in comments made public Saturday, that Moscow\u2019s announcement of a 72-hour ceasefire next week in Ukraine to mark Victory Day in World War II is merely an attempt to create a \u201csoft atmosphere\u201d ahead of Russia\u2019s annual celebrations.",
      "Zelenskyy instead renewed calls for a more substantial\u00a030-day pause in hostilities,\u00a0as the U.S. had initially proposed. He said the proposed ceasefire could start anytime as a meaningful step toward ending the war.",
      "Putin on Monday declared a unilateral 72-hour ceasefire in Ukraine to mark Victory Day in World War II, as the U.S. presses for a deal to end the\u00a03-year-old war. The Kremlin said the truce, ordered on \u201chumanitarian grounds,\u201d will run from the start of May 8 and last through the end of May 10 to mark Moscow\u2019s defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 \u2014\u00a0Russia\u2019s biggest secular holiday.",
      "Meanwhile, 11 people were wounded in a Russian drone attack overnight on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, Ukraine\u2019s State Emergency Service said Sunday. Two children were among the wounded.",
      "The attack woke up Valentyna Fesiuk, an 83-year-old resident of Kyiv\u2019s Obolon district.",
      "\u201cI was just sleeping when the house shook. It was at 12:30. An apartment on the 12th floor caught fire,\u201d she told The Associated Press.",
      "The car of another resident, Viacheslav Khotab, caught fire.",
      "\u201cI saw my car burning. I was covered with broken glass,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d",
      "The 54-year-old was frustrated with stalled peace negotiations: \u201cThey can\u2019t agree on anything, and we are the ones who suffer the consequences.\u201d",
      "Russia fired a total of 165 exploding drones and decoys overnight, Ukraine\u2019s air force said. Of those, 69 were intercepted and a further 80 lost, likely having been electronically jammed. Russia also launched two ballistic missiles.",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said its air defenses shot down 13 Ukrainian drones overnight."

      "Germany rebuked Secretary of State Marco Rubio after he slammed the country\u2019s intelligence agency for classifying the far-right political party Alternative for Germany a \u201cproven-right wing extremist organization.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have learnt from our history that right-wing extremism needs to be stopped,\u201d Germany\u2019s foreign office wrote on X, in direct reply to Rubio.",
      "AfD, whose staunch supporters include Vice President JD Vance and billionaire Elon Musk, was already under surveillance for suspected extremism by Germany\u2019s intelligence services, which on Friday classified the party as a \u201cproven right-wing extremist organization.\u201d",
      "Rubio, who on Friday became the acting national security adviser for President Donald Trump, pushed back on the designation, calling the move \u201ctyranny in disguise,\u201d in a post on X Friday. \u201cGermany just gave its spy agency new powers to surveil the opposition.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not democracy,\u201d Rubio said.",
      "To that, Germany\u2019s foreign office replied, \u201cThis is democracy.\u201d",
      "The rise of AfD, which made huge gains in Germany\u2019s general elections in February and finished second, has been part of a surge of the far right in Europe, whose proponents have forged close ties with Trump\u2019s White House.",
      "AfD's co-leader, Alice Weidel, called her party's electoral gains a \u201cglorious success,\u201d alarming large swaths of a country deeply aware of its Nazi past.",
      "Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz, the country\u2019s intelligence agency, said the party \u201caims to exclude certain population groups from equal participation in society.\u201d AfD also does not consider German nationals with a history of migration from Muslim countries as equal to German people, the agency said in its Friday statement.",
      "Weidel's response to the designation aligned with Rubio's criticism, accusing the agency of advancing the ruling government's political interests.",
      "\u201cSince the AfD is the strongest party in polls now, they want to suppress the opposition & freedom of speech,\u201d she said in a post on X.",
      "The German foreign office said the classification was a result of a\u00a0\"thorough & independent investigation to protect our Constitution & the rule of law.\"",
      "Under Weidel, AfD has moved from the fringes to a swift-rising movement winning its first regional elections and garnering support from the Trump administration.",
      "The party promotes a populist economy policy of large tax cuts and steep public spending, fosters strong anti-immigrant sentiments, and champions traditional family values, including opposing gay marriange though Weidel herself raises two sons with her Sri Lankan-born female partner, Sarah Bossard.",
      "Weidel has been able to harness a nationalist, anti-E.U sentiment along with hostilities against Muslims and foreigners, to build a stronghold for the party in the regions that once made up East Germany, where skepticism for NATO and Germany's support for Ukraine are among the strongest in the country.",
      "Vance, and Musk followed Rubio in his criticism, with the Vice President saying the AfD was the \"most popular party in Germany and by far the most representative of East Germany.\"",
      "\u201cThe West tore down the Berlin Wall together. And it has been rebuilt \u2014 not by the Soviets or the Russians, but by the German establishment,\u201d Vance said in a post on X.",
      "Banning the AfD \"would be an extreme attack on democracy,\u201d Musk in a post on X said, calling the party \"centrist\" and repeating Vance's claims that it was Germany's \"most popular party.\"",
      "AfD, and Weidel herself, have denied allegations of extremism, though the party's co-founder Alexander Gauland once dismissed Hitler's dictatorship as a \u201cspeck of bird poop\u201d and its top candidate, Maximilian Krah, said the SS, the Nazis\u2019 main paramilitary force, were \u201cnot all criminals.\u201d"
