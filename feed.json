      "Fernando D\u00e1vila, a 72-year-old artist in Florida, paints vibrant works despite being colorblind",
      "DORAL, Fla. -- When Fernando D\u00e1vila was 8 years old in Colombia, he failed a drawing class because he painted donkeys red.",
      "There was a reason for that: He is colorblind.",
      "Now the 72-year-old D\u00e1vila is an established and respected artist whose vibrant paintings have been exhibited in South America, Europe and the United States.",
      "\u201cI have the most wonderful job in the world, which is painting every morning,\u201d D\u00e1vila said from his studio in a Miami suburb. \u201cTo mix colors. To have joy to share with the world, that's really my passion.\u201d",
      "He started off painting only in black and white until he was around 30 years old because of his colorblindness, a congenital condition which makes it difficult for people to tell the difference between certain colors, particularly red and green, and shades of color. There is no cure for the condition, which for D\u00e1vila also makes the colors pink, violet, turquoise and yellow-green confusing.",
      "Since the mid-1980s, D\u00e1vila has painted in color through the help of glasses developed by an ophthalmologist in New York, where D\u00e1vila was living at the time. One lens is transparent and the other is shaded red, and they help him discriminate between contrasting shades that normally blur together. With the lenses, he can see almost two-thirds of the colors, but without them he only sees around 40% of the colors.",
      "D\u00e1vila compared his condition to having a box of chocolates but only being able to eat a sample of the selection. He says he has such a strong desire to see every color.",
      "\u201cIt's something that I miss in my life, that if somebody says, \u2018Look at this flower,\u2019 which is bright, bright pink, I want to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's something that comes from my heart so passionately. I can feel the vibration of color.\u201d",

      "Christian music is growing in popularity while other genres struggle to grow new listenership",
      "NEW YORK -- It is one of the most surprising music stories of the year. While streams of new music \u2014 releases from the last 18 months \u2014 were down from last year, one genre is on the rise: Christian and gospel music, according to industry data and analytics company Luminate\u2019s 2025 Midyear Report.",
      "Jaime Marconette, Luminate\u2019s vice president of music insights and industry relations, said the shift is led by acts like Forrest Frank, Brandon Lake and Elevation Worship, who are connecting with a \u201cyounger, streaming-forward fan base\u201d that's 60% female and 30% millennial. In fact, for the first time in 11 years, two contemporary Christian music songs \u2014 Frank\u2019s \u201cYour Way\u2019s Better\u201d and Lake\u2019s \u201cHard Fought Hallelujah\u201d with Jelly Roll \u2014 broke through the Billboard Hot 100's all-genre Top 40, placing them in direct competition with mainstream artists.",
      "It's also why traditionally secular artists like Jelly Roll, Killer Mike and T.I. are nominated in Christian music categories at the forthcoming 2026 Grammys \u2014 the lines are blurring.",
      "\u201cChristian music (is) unlike any other genre that\u2019s defined by a sonic component. Christian music is defined by its lyrical component,\u201d says Holly Zabka, the president of Provident Entertainment, a Sony Christian music subsidiary. \u201cIt\u2019s not limited to a narrow definition. It\u2019s a lyrical component that can appeal to anyone\u2019s musical preference.\u201d",
      "From a label perspective, she\u2019s interested in pursuing artists that \u201cdon\u2019t have to fit within that narrow lane of Christian bookstore and Christian radio. It can be rap, hip-hop, it can be rock, it can be country, and that\u2019s appealing to a broader audience because it\u2019s what they\u2019re already listening to,\u201d she says. \u201cVery few people listen in a vacuum and only listen to one genre.\u201d",
      "But for many years, CCM jas held a reputation for being unimaginative \u2014 what writer John Jeremiah Sullivan infamously referred to as \u201cexcellence-proof\u201d \u2014 for its tendency to mimic and water down popular, contemporary mainstream sounds for a religious audience.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely there\u2019s been an improvement in quality,\u201d says Zabka. \u201cWhen all the music has to live side by side on these streaming platforms, we can\u2019t just be the cheap alternative. \u2018Oh, you like Taylor Swift? You will like this lesser version offering in the Christian genre.\u2019 We want to be the greatest art.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have to imitate before you innovate,\u201d Chris Brown, singer and worship leader at Elevation Worship, jokes. \u201cThere\u2019s not as many rigid lines stylistically within Christian music as maybe there was 10 years ago or certainly like 20, 30 years ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was a period of time where people idealized Christian music as like, \u2018OK, we\u2019re going to have this look, we\u2019re going to sound like this,\u2019\u201d says two-time Grammy-winning Christian and pop musician Lauren Daigle. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more artistry now. People are very expressive. They\u2019re able to share their creativity. And that also comes with different types of people represented.\u201d",
      "Zabka says her genre is experiencing \u201ca special moment and \u2026 a perfect storm.\u201d Streaming and the ability to connect on social media have democratized music discovery, she says, allowing CCM to compete with secular music. That, partnered with what she views as \u201ca resurgence of faith\u201d in young people, is responsible for the interest.",
      "The number of Americans who identify as Christian has declined steadily for years, but that drop shows signs of slowing, according to a 2025 survey from the Pew Research Center. A new class of millennial and Gen Z Christian influencers, too, are aiming to connect with young people.",
      "\u201cChristian music has also shifted in its authenticity of the lyrics,\u201d Zabka adds, making the music more relatable than previous iterations of the genre, which often featured a neat message of \u201ceverything is going to be OK, just follow Jesus\u201d in 3 \u00bd minutes. Now, she says, \u201ctheir songs are much more authentic and real and honest. \u2018Life is hard. Breakups are hard. Bad things happen,\u2019 and that provides a level of hope that other music doesn\u2019t provide for the listener.\u201d",
      "Daigle points out that artists like Lake are performing in huge stadiums \u2014 categorical proof that Christian artists are growing in popularity.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of people are looking at the world and \u2026 they find fortitude in this music, and they find a sense of strength in this music, and they find truth in this music,\u201d she says.",

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 King Charles III led his family to church on foot Thursday, hours before his annual Christmas Day speech to the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth was expected to focus on the theme of pilgrimage.",
      "Charles and Queen Camilla, along with the Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Kate, and their children, Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte, and extended family walked to St. Mary Magdalene Church on the king's private Sandringham Estate.",
      "The location is about 100 miles north of London, where Charles recorded the address from Westminster Abbey, the landmark known for the lavish coronations and royal weddings it has hosted for more than 1,000 years.",
      "The abbey is also the focus of an annual pilgrimage to the tomb of Edward the Confessor, which lies at the heart of the church. Edward, a monk-like monarch, was canonized as a saint in 1161.",
      "The monarch\u2019s annual holiday message is watched by millions of people in the U.K. and across the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of 56 independent nations, most of which have historic ties to Britain. The prerecorded speech is broadcast at 3 p.m., when many families are enjoying their traditional Christmas lunch.",
      "The speech is one of the rare occasions when Charles, 77, is able to voice his own views and doesn\u2019t seek guidance from the government. It usually has a strong religious framework, reflects current issues and sometimes draws on the monarch\u2019s personal experiences.",

      "A planned Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center has been canceled",
      "NEW YORK -- A planned Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center, a holiday tradition dating back more than 20 years, has been canceled. The show's host, musician Chuck Redd, says that he called off the performance in the wake of the White House announcing last week that President Donald Trump's name would be added to the facility.",
      "As of last Friday, the building's facade reads The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. According to the White House, the president's handpicked board approved the decision, which scholars have said violates the law. Trump had been suggesting for months he was open to changing the center's name.",
      "\u201cWhen I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\u201d Redd told The Associated Press in an email Wednesday. Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player who has toured with everyone from Dizzy Gillespie to Ray Brown, has been presiding over holiday \u201cJazz Jams\u201d at the Kennedy Center since 2006, succeeding bassist William \u201cKeter\u201d Betts.",
      "The Kennedy Center did not immediately respond to email seeking comment. The center's website lists the show as canceled.",
      "President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and Congress passed a law the following year naming the center as a living memorial to him. Kennedy niece Kerry Kennedy has vowed to remove Trump's name from the building once he leaves office and former House historian Ray Smock is among those who say any changes would have to be approved by Congress.",

      "Trump, a Republican, has been deeply involved with the center named for an iconic Democrat after mostly ignoring it during his first term. He has forced out its leadership, overhauled the board while arranging for himself to head it, and personally hosted this year's Kennedy Center honors, breaking a long tradition of presidents mostly serving as spectators. The changes at the Kennedy Center are part of the president's larger mission to fight \u201cwoke\u201d culture at federal cultural institutions.",

      "Lawyers for hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs are asking a federal appeals court in New York to order his immediate release from prison",
      "NEW YORK -- Lawyers for hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs urged a federal appeals court in New York late Tuesday to order his immediate release from prison and reverse his conviction on prostitution-related charges or direct his trial judge to lighten his four-year sentence.",
      "The lawyers said in a filing with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan that Combs was treated harshly at sentencing by a federal judge who let evidence surrounding charges he was acquitted of unjustly influence the punishment.",
      "Combs, 56, incarcerated at a federal prison in New Jersey and scheduled for release in May 2028, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking at a trial that ended in July. Combs was convicted under the Mann Act, which bans transporting people across state lines for any sexual crime.",
      "Lawyers for Combs said Judge Arun Subramanian acted like a \u201cthirteenth juror\u201d in October when he sentenced Combs to four years and two months in prison. They said he erred by letting evidence surrounding the acquitted charges influence the sentence he imposed.",
      "They noted that Combs was convicted of two lesser counts, prostitution offenses that didn\u2019t require force, fraud, or coercion. They asked the appeals court, which has not yet heard oral arguments, to acquit Combs, order his immediate release from prison or direct Subramanian to reduce his sentence.",
      "\u201cDefendants typically get sentenced to less than 15 months for these offenses \u2014 even when coercion, which the jury didn\u2019t find here, is involved,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",
      "\u201cThe judge defied the jury\u2019s verdict and found Combs \u2018coerced,\u2019 \u2018exploited,\u2019 and \u2018forced\u2019 his girlfriends to have sex and led a criminal conspiracy. These judicial findings trumped the verdict and led to the highest sentence ever imposed for any remotely similar defendant,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",

      "At the trial, former girlfriend Casandra \u201cCassie\u201d Ventura testified that Combs ordered her to have \u201cdisgusting\u201d sex with strangers hundreds of times during their decade-long relationship that ended in 2018.

      "At sentencing, Subramanian said he \u201crejects the defense\u2019s attempt to characterize what happened here as merely intimate, consensual experiences, or just a sex, drugs, and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll story.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cYou abused the power and control that you had over the lives of women you professed to love dearly. You abused them physically, emotionally, and psychologically. And you used that abuse to get your way, especially when it came to freak-offs and hotel nights.\u201d",

      "It's the second best global debut of the year.",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d opened with $345 million in worldwide sales, according to studio estimates Sunday, notching the second-best global debut of the year and potentially putting James Cameron on course to set yet more blockbuster records.",
      "Sixteen years into the \u201cAvatar\u201d saga, Pandora is still abundant in box-office riches. \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d the third film in Cameron\u2019s science-fiction franchise, launched with $88 million domestically and $257 million internationally. The only film to open bigger in 2025 was \u201cZootopia 2\u201d ($497.2 million over three days). In the coming weeks, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d will have the significant benefit of the highly lucrative holiday moviegoing corridor.",
      "But there was a tad less fanfare to this \u201cAvatar\u201d film, coming three years after \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water.\u201d That film launched in 2022 with a massive $435 million globally and $134 million in North America. Domestically, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d fell a hefty 35% from the previous installment. Reviews for \u201cFire and Ash\u201d were also more mixed, scoring a series-low 68% \u201cfresh\u201d score on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "Yet those quibbles are only a product of the lofty standards of \u201cAvatar.\u201d The first two films rank as two of the three biggest box-office films of all time. To reach those heights, the \u201cAvatar\u201d films have depended on legs more than huge openings.",
      "\u201cAvatar\u201d (2009), opened with $77 million domestically but held the top spot for seven weeks. It ultimately grossed $2.92 billion worldwide. \u201cThe Way of Water\u201d also held strong to eventually tally $2.3 billion globally.",
      "\u201cThe openings are not what the \u2018Avatar\u2019 movies are about,\u201d said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers. \u201cIt\u2019s what they do after they open that made them the no. 2 and no. 3 biggest films of all time.\u201d",
      "For \u201cFire and Ash\u201d to follow in those footsteps, it will need robust ticket sales to continue for weeks. Working in its favor so far: strong word-of-mouth. Audiences gave it an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "In interviews, Cameron has repeatedly said \u201cFire and Ash\u201d needs to perform well for there to be subsequent \u201cAvatar\u201d films. (Four and five are already written but not greenlit.) These are exceptionally expensive movies to make. With a production budget of at least $400 million, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is one of the costliest movies ever made.",
      "\u201cJames Cameron is not known for his low budget movies,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cYou can\u2019t exactly create the world of Pandora on the cheap. If you\u2019re going to have a 3D movie, an epic film that\u2019s three hours and 17 minutes, it\u2019s a huge buy-in of money, time, resources, and then you have to hope the audience wants to once again go along on that ride.\u201d",
      "\u201cFire and Ash\u201d was especially boosted by premium format showings, which accounted for 66% of its opening weekend. A narrow majority of moviegoers (56%) chose to watch it in 3D.",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films have always been especially popular overseas. \u201cFire and Ash\u201d was strongest in China, where its $57.6 million opening weekend surpassed the two previous movies.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash\u201d didn\u2019t have the weekend entirely to itself. A trio of other new wide releases made it into theaters in hopes of offering some counterprogramming: Lionsgate\u2019s \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d Angel Studios\u2019 \u201cDavid\u201d and Paramount Pictures\u2019 \u201cThe SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants.\u201d",
      "In the race for second place, \u201cDavid\u201d came out on top. The animated tale of David and Goliath collected $22 million from 3,118 theaters, notching the best opening weekend for Angel Studios, the Christian-oriented studio that emerged with 2023\u2019s surprise hit \u201cSound of Freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d Paul Feig\u2019s twisty psychological thriller starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, opened with $19 million 3,015 theaters. The Lionsgate release, which cost about $35 million to make, is set up well to be one of the top R-rated options in theaters over the holidays. Based on Freida McFadden\u2019s bestselling novel, it stars Sweeney as a woman with a troubled past who becomes a live-in maid for a wealthy family.",
      "Trailing the pack was \u201cThe SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants,\u201d which collected $16 million from 3,557 theaters. The G-rated film, based on the Nickelodeon TV series, is the first \u201cSpongeBob\u201d theatrical movie since 2015\u2019s \u201cThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water.\u201d",
      "All of this weekend\u2019s new films will hope the ticket sales keep rolling in over the upcoming Christmas break. Starting Dec. 25, they\u2019ll need to contend with some new wide releases, including A24\u2019s \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet; Focus Features\u2019 \u201cSong Sung Blue,\u201d with Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson; and Sony\u2019s \u201cAnaconda,\u201d with Jack Black and Paul Rudd.",

      "The Grammys' country album category has been split into two for the 2026 award show",
      "NEW YORK -- Flashback to February. It's the 2025 Grammys, and Beyonc\u00e9 has made history. Not only was she finally awarded the top prize of album of the year, but she also became the first Black woman to win best country album, for \u201cCowboy Carter.\u201d Recent changes by the Recording Academy have made it even more monumental: She might be the last person to ever win the award.",
      "In June, the Academy announced that the Grammys' country album title was splitting into two categories. A new award was created, traditional country album. The preexisting country album category has been redefined and is now contemporary country album, reflecting the genre's ongoing sonic evolutions.",
      "The decision was divisive: Some viewed it as backlash to Beyonc\u00e9's win. Others welcomed the addition of a new award and the creative doors it might open. Some questioned how the categories would be defined in a genre where the word \u201ctraditional\u201d is loaded.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about the change \u2014 and what it could signify in the future.",
      "Charles L. Hughes, Rhodes College professor and author of \u201cCountry Soul,\u201d says Beyonc\u00e9's victory was a welcomed surprise, despite being obviously worthy. That's because her album inspired a larger conversation about reclamation, standing in opposition to the music industry's rigid power structures and \u201cindicated how significant this historical question remains of whether or not Black folks have equal access to success in a genre of music that bears such strong Black influences and has from the very beginning,\u201d Hughes said.",
      "He believes the decision to alter the country album categories was not in direct response to her win \u2014 \u201cI think it is a more complicated story,\u201d he says \u2014 but the timing might've been less than ideal, emboldening fans to view it as reactionary. He hopes the changes will open the category to more diversity of sounds and \u201cwhether this leads to a broader opening and opportunity for Black artists, especially Black women in country music,\u201d he posits.",
      "Francesca T. Royster, a DePaul University professor and author of \u201cBlack Country Music: Listening for Revolutions,\u201d views Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s victory as positively connected to this change. She wonders if artists \u2014 particularly artists of color, who never had their music recognized in country music categories, think of artists like \u201cMillie Jackson or Candi Staton, Bobby Womack\u201d \u2014 would now see their work recognized. \u201cHaving these two categories just allows for more experimentation and maybe less of a double standard,\u201d she says, \u201cin terms of artists who are often held to higher standards to conform to, or be recognizable as, meeting an idea about what country music is.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt makes sense that the Grammy categories for country would become a little bit more expansive,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I think the music is more expansive and the audience is also more expansive than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d",
      "According to the Recording Academy's rule book, the traditional country category is defined by \u201ccountry recordings that adhere to the more traditional sound structures of the country genre, including rhythm and singing style, lyrical content, as well as traditional country instrumentation.\u201d",
      "Those are: acoustic guitar, steel guitar, fiddle, banjo, mandolin, piano, electric guitar and live drums. This is also where subgenres like outlaw country, Western and Western swing would fit.",
      "The contemporary country category description is a bit more conceptual. The rule book states that albums eligible in this category \u201cutilize a stylistic intention, song structure, lyrical content, and/or musical presentation to create a sensibility that reflects the broad spectrum of contemporary country style and culture.\u201d",
      "The hope is that those titles are \u201crelevant to the legacy of country music\u2019s culture, while also engaging in more contemporary music forms.\u201d",
      "The questions Hughes poses: \u201cWhose tradition are we talking about?\u201d And how is \u201ccountry music's culture\u201d defined?",
      "\u201cIt's almost tautology. \u2018Well, it\u2019s traditional country if it sounds like traditional country,'\u201d he says.",
      "In that reading, contemporary country could simply account for everything else.",
      "Royster says both categories seem to \u201cspeak to an aesthetic as well as political agenda, many agendas.\u201d To her, the traditional category would appeal to artists who believe that \u201cthis is a past form that needs to ... continue to be recognized and respected.\u201d Similarly, the contemporary category is \u201clinked to the culture of country but is also expansive.\u201d",

      "It didn't stay stagnant from there: In 2021, the Academy changed the best urban contemporary album category to best progressive R&B album, to spotlight those records that weave R&B with other genres.",
      "In the contemporary country album category, Kelsea Ballerini's \u201cPatterns\u201d faces off against Tyler Childers' \u201cSnipe Hunter,\u201d Eric Church's \u201cEvangeline vs. the Machine,\u201d Jelly Roll's \u201cBeautifully Broken,\u201d and Miranda Lambert's \u201cPostcards from Texas.\u201d",

      "Royster wonders if with this first year of nominees, \u201cthere's less risk in terms of recognizing the kind of \u2018country-ness\u2019 of these artists.\u201d Royster views the lineup as \u201cartists (whose) country creds would still be recognized even if they\u2019re also bringing in other elements. I would hope in the future there might be more room in the category.\u201d",
      "For Hughes, the nominees further confuse the distinctions. Consider this example: Zach Top's album borrows heavily from George Strait's sound, which emerged in the \u201870s as a mesh of honky-tonk traditions and contemporary country. Hip-hop also emerged in the \u201970s. They were simultaneous. \u201cBut I have a feeling we won\u2019t be seeing a lot of hip-hop-inspired artists in the traditional category,\u201d he says.",
      "But that doesn't mean it might not evolve in the future. \u201cIf the Grammys fundamentally exist to give people recognition,\u201d he says, \u201cThe more, the merrier.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnytime the pipe widens, more water gets through. And this was the pipe widening, baby,\u201d Jelly Roll, who is nominated in the inaugural best contemporary country album category, told The Associated Press. \u201cI love it. I'm happy. I\u2019m a fan of both sides. It encourages me to maybe make a traditional country album one day, you know? So, this is cool.\u201d",
      "Three-time Grammy award winner Brad Paisley has a similar stance: There's a benefit to having more country music recognitions.",
      "\u201cAwards are really tools to sort of get awareness for something that you made, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re never the goal. It\u2019s always more like, \u2018Oh, cool, this might make more people listen to it.\u2019 \u2026 If this means they got to make more little gold gramophone statues to give out, and two people get them versus one, great.\u201d",
      "That said: Paisley's not sure which category he would fall into, or if the division could color an artist's creative decisions. \u201cI\u2019d almost have to think it through like, \u2018No, no, we\u2019re going for the Grammy on this. I better not do this on this record or something.\u2019 But hopefully that doesn\u2019t ever enter into it,\u201d he says.",
      "Hopefully, it's just a panel decided who belongs in which category, \u201cand then two people get to go home happy versus one. And that\u2019s good in my book,\u201d he said.",

The show is now back on for one special episode \u2014 this time with Ukrainian wartime heroes as the stars, underscoring the nation's resilience in difficult times.",
      "Many still remember how President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u2014 then an actor \u2014 won the dance competition in 2006, the year that \u201cTantsi z zirkamy\u201d as the show is known in Ukrainian, first debuted.",
      "In the new, special episode, the dancers perform with prosthetic limbs, showcasing their strength in overcoming adversity. The lineup of participants includes public figures who rose to prominence since Russia's full-out war on Ukraine was launched in February 2022.",
      "But like all of present-day Ukraine, the show \u2014 which is part of an international franchise \u2014 has had to deal with a multitude of wartime challenges, including frequent power outages.",
      "All the proceeds will go to the Superhumans Center, a specialist clinic for the treatment and rehabilitation of war-wounded victims.",
      "During a prerecording last week, dancers spun, leapt and glided under the sparkle of lights, some seamlessly integrating their prosthetic limbs into the choreography.",
      "For creative producer Volodymyr Zavadiuk, every segment of the show is precious, creating something special during tough times.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about our resilience and it\u2019s about our future,\u201d said Zavadiuk, who also heads Big Brave Events and the Big Entertainment Shows department at 1+1 Media.",

      "Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be resentful you\u2019re not part of any of them, not even the one where Tom Waits plays Adam Driver\u2019s dad. To be fair, all the groupings are pretty cool on paper. In the first chapter, siblings Jeff (Driver) and Emily (Mayim Bialik) drive together to visit their father (Waits) for the first time in a while. In the second, a mother (Charlotte Rampling) awaits her grown daughters Tim ( Cate Blanchett ) and Lilith ( Vicky Krieps ) for their annual tea. And in the third, all that\u2019s left of Skye (Indya Moore) and Billy\u2019s (Luka Sabbat) parents are things.",
      "But these are awkward and strained hangouts, none connected to one another literally, and all in different parts of the world. Yet there are little threads throughout \u2014 Rolex watches, toasting with water, red clothing, and the idiom \u201cbob\u2019s your uncle,\u201d for instance. And then there\u2019s the more cosmically haunting realization that familiarity and closeness are not always in the cards when it comes to family. In \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother,\u201d everyone would rather be anywhere but where they are. Same same, but different, you know?",
      "The film opens with \u201cFather,\u201d and siblings Jeff and Emily reluctantly doing a kind of wellness check on theirs. They\u2019re both very buttoned up and formal, both in appearance (blazers, sweaters, combed hair) and demeanor. Waits, as their father, is very much the opposite \u2014 one might imagine that he doesn\u2019t even own a blazer, or a comb for that matter. His home is as rumpled as his zip up hoodie sweatshirt and he is a little bumbling himself, rattling off all the drugs he\u2019s not taking (anymore). The chasm between him and his children is vast and growing. Besides the death of their mother, it doesn\u2019t even seem like there was even some inciting incident that might explain some level of estrangement \u2014 they\u2019re just very, very different. And the father might not be as helpless and destitute as he\u2019s presenting to his children. After they leave, he tidies the place up and calls a friend to go out to a nice dinner.",
      "Blame it on the age of the people who get to make the movies, but the parents are often the afterthoughts, the supporting characters in the children\u2019s stories. Jarmusch slyly inverts this in the \u201cFather\u201d segment, which perfectly tees up expectations for his next entry, \u201cMother,\u201d in which Rampling is on the phone, presumably with a therapist, mentally preparing for her daughters to arrive. They all live around Dublin, but rarely see one another, making this tea a bit of a dreaded ritual. Blanchett\u2019s Tim, a quintessential first born, is very stressed about being late. Krieps\u2019 Lilith, meanwhile, is all about posturing \u2014 bragging about material things and accomplishments that she doesn\u2019t have the receipts for and knows on some level no one believes anyway. These women aren't connecting either.",
      "In the final segment, the parents are gone. They\u2019ve died and left behind only mementos in a Parisian apartment that\u2019s three months overdue on rent. This is both a puzzle and a mess that their children now have to clean up and make sense of. \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother\u201d is in some ways deeply cynical about family bonds and the possibility of ever really knowing ones' parents. It\u2019s devoid of warm, fuzzy sentiment and trite revelations, just the crushing idea that no matter what bloodlines might exist, we\u2019re all fundamentally strangers.",

He's eager for the season to start but unprepared for the amount of cyclical collapse \u2014 familial, economic, even existential \u2014 that Park has in store.",
      "Man-su pronounces the very thing no movie protagonist ever should: \u201cI've got it all.\u201d He lives with his wife, Miri (Son Ye-jin), and two children (Kim Woo Seung, Choi So Yul) in a handsome modernist house in the woods, with two golden retrievers. But almost as soon as he says that, Man-su's fortunes turn. After 25 years at a paper mill, Man-su is laid off, as are many others, with little fanfare or apology. Desperation begins to set in. He's forced to sell the home he loves so dearly, including the attached greenhouse where he tends to plants and bonsai trees. They even have to, horror of horrors, cancel Netflix.",
      "Another movie might have sunk with Man-su into bankruptcy and midlife struggle, following his quest to find a new line of work and restart his life. This is not that movie. Man-su, considering his prospects, decides he needs to better his odds of new employment. After posting a fake job listing and comparing all the incoming resumes, he decides he's about the fifth best option for any new paper mill managerial jobs. He decides to kill the ones with better credentials.",
      "The concept, a Grade-A barnburner of a movie idea, is not new. \u201cNo Other Choice,\u201d South Korea's Oscar submission, is based on Donald Westlake\u2019s 1997 crime novel \u201cThe Ax,\u201d which Costa-Gavras also made into a film in 2005. But Park, the filmmaker of such diabolical movies as \u201cOldboy,\u201d \u201cThe Handmaiden\u201d and \u201cDecision to Leave,\u201d is exquisitely suited to the material. This is a director capable of conjuring menacing brutality with nothing but a hallway and hammer.",
      "And in \u201cNo Other Choice,\u201d he remains at the peak of his powers, archly and elegantly spinning a yarn about a murderous rampage that accumulates wider and wider reverberations. \u201cHitchcockian\u201d is a term that often, understandably, finds Park. He is, like Hitch, a seemingly polite and erudite man with a latently dark imagination. But for more than two decades, Park has cut his own bloody, unyieldingly meticulous path in movies that are rarely predictable, very funny and sneakily revelatory.",

He is probably the preeminent filmmaker of putting wild, outrageous happenings into cleverly formal, eminently stylish imagery. As Man-su bumbles from target to target, each potential murder is a window into another family reckoning with unemployment. The way Man-su spies on them (or worse) adds delicious layers of satire. Relish, especially, the way Park uses reflections and trees.",
      "How \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d puts capitalism in the crosshairs, with a handsome house in the center, will no doubt bring to mind another Korean satire: Bong Joon Ho's \u201cParasite.\u201d Park had been wanting to make his film for almost two decades. Either way, the two movies would make one hell of a destabilizing double feature.",
      "If \u201cParasite\u201d was the feat of an ensemble, \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d belongs to Lee. His Man-su is no killer at heart, and his attempts to become one are as comical as they are Dostoyevskian. The tone is so farcical that the gruesomeness of some of Man-su's acts come slyly. How many movies have we seen about a parent driven, heroically, to extremes to defend their family? Man-su's circumstance is frightfully understandable. \u201cOur family is in a war,\u201d he says. To keep them happy \u2014 in particular Miri \u2014 Man-su thinks whatever it takes is necessary.",
      "But what makes \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d brilliant is how it shows that perceived predicament as a ubiquitous mistake of modern life. I won't spoil the incredible final minutes of Park's film, but they expand the notion of necessary termination \u2014 of a job, of a life \u2014 to automation, AI and beyond. The leaves falling in \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d aren't coming back in the spring.",

      "Since his breakthrough performance in 2017\u2019s \u201cCall Me By Your Name,\u201d Chalamet has been on an ever-ascending path that seemed to reach a culmination when he, soon after finishing shooting on \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d declared that he\u2019s \u201cin pursuit of greatness\u201d while accepting the best actor award from the Screen Actors Guild for his performance as Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d",
      "But \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d is yet another new level for Chalamet. His Marty, far from a period-piece study, is a blur of forward motion. (To shoot the film\u2019s sprinting poster, Safdie closed down two blocks, so Chalamet would be up to full speed.) To make his dreams a reality, Marty uses every desperate scheme and every bit of grandiose swagger. He's a quintessentially American hustler, and it\u2019s probably the defining performance of Chalamet\u2019s young career. A year after he came so close, it may win him his first Academy Award.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like a long arc thing for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m chasing a feeling.\u201d",
      "\u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d which opens wide Thursday, is a big test. A24 spent some $70 million on it, making it one of the indie studio\u2019s biggest budgeted movies ever. To build the hype, Chalamet has unveiled some very Marty-esque stunts, including an 18-minute video of a pseudo-Zoom call about the movie\u2019s marketing. That led to a real orange blimp, emblazoned with \u201cDream Big,\u201d flying over Los Angeles.",
      "When The Associated Press caught up with Safdie at his Chelsea office, he had recently returned from promoting the movie in London, Brazil and Los Angeles. For him, \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d could hardly be more personal. Pingpong paddles filled his office, as did an old piece of awning scrounged from Rodney Dangerfield\u2019s New York comedy club. Safdie once tried to turn pro at table tennis, himself, before moviemaking became his obsession.",
      "\u201cMy dad is the ultimate dreamer,\u201d Safdie says. \u201cHe still dreams to this day. When I was a kid, I\u2019d ask him where I came from. And he\u2019d say, \u2018You came from the stars.\u2019 It put this intense feeling inside me that there was huge future ahead of me.\u201d",
      "When Safdie and his brother, Benny, set out to make films, they had a New York hustler mentality. For their second feature, \u201cDaddy Longlegs,\u201d they approached the filmmaker Ronald Bronstein, then working as a projectionist, and told him he had to star in the film. Bronstein wasn't even an actor.",
      "\u201cI thought: This guy is made out helium and I\u2019ve had my feet stuck in lead for six years,\u201d recalls Bronstein, who co-wrote \u201cMarty Supreme.\u201d",
      "The hardscrabble life of independent filmmaking made Safdie accustomed to giving everything to get his movies made. To convince a potential financier to pay for the basketball portions of 2019's \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d Safdie, a non-drinker, remembers downing half a dozen whiskies during a meeting.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re in a position where you\u2019re at their beck and call,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll do whatever it takes.\u201d",
      "When Safdie and his brother finished \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d years of pouring everything into Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler\u2019s character in the film) left him feeling purposeless. \u201cYou start to ask yourself: What is the purpose of a dream?\u201d",

      "Safdie and Chalamet first met back in 2017, at the premiere of \u201cGood Time,\u201d just months before the release of \u201cCall Me By Your Name.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about the guy. Some agent told me he was the next big superstar. And you hear that a lot from agents,\u201d says Safdie. \u201cBut you got the sense that he saw it. And he had a vision for it. He had this energy to him. He was Timmy Supreme.\u201d",
      "Safdie sent Chalamet a video of table tennis players from 1948 set to Peter Gabriel\u2019s \u201cI Have the Touch.\u201d The suggestion was: This is a period movie told with contemporary topspin. For years, while working on other movie sets, Chalamet built up his table tennis skills.",
      "\u201cJosh wanted me to tap into a period of my life when my audacity was all I had,\u201d Chalamet says. Immediately, he saw himself in Marty. \u201cI was singularly driven starting at 14.\u201d",
      "Safdie and Chalamet are now launching something almost anathema in theaters this holiday season: a wholly original, big-budget, R-rated movie fronted by star power. Signs suggest audiences aren\u2019t just ready, they\u2019re hungry for it. The limited opening of \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d in six cinemas, set per-screen records. There were 92 sellouts.",
      "\u201cI said this when I went to (former high school) LaGuardia last year: Don\u2019t act for other actors. Act for real audiences,\u201d Chalamet says. \u201cWhile we were shooting \u2018Dune 3\u2019 over the summer, Denis (Villeneuve) said at some point he realized it was more about pleasing real people. You look at the business structure of the film industry, how it\u2019s been contracting since the \u201980s, it\u2019s ludicrous to be focused on anything but real audiences.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to see more original movies made,\u201d adds Chalamet. \u201cThey\u2019re the most exciting ones to see. Every original film I\u2019ve seen this year, I like it before I even start it. That\u2019s a whole new mentality I\u2019ve had, just feeling like we\u2019re all in this together.\u201d",
      "\u201cMarty Supreme\u201d is also a part of the proud lineage of New York movies, and self-consciously crafted in an American movie tradition. It may feel like a millennial watershed, but its production design is by a legend of an earlier era, Jack Fisk. The 74-year-old Bronx filmmaker Abel Ferrara appears in it. They're veterans of a grittier, more handcrafted time stretching back to the 1970s that's been particularly influential to Safdie. Robert Altman\u2019s 1902-set 1971 film \u201cMcCabe and Mrs. Miller,\u201d he notes, is the exact same time difference between when it takes place and when it was shot as \u201cMarty Supreme.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe tradition, particularly of New York filmmaking, movies like \u2018French Connection,\u2019 I try to let them seep into me,\u201d Safdie says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m casting Abel Ferrara. I\u2019m trying to at least cultivate those influences.\u201d",
      "That \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d is a deeply New York film, and maybe a new classic one, is also a special point of pride for Chalamet, who grew up in Hell's Kitchen. Leaning forward as the afternoon winter light brightens the waterfront, Chalamet remembers he used to play soccer as a kid on this pier.",
      "\u201cJust to be here, back where I\u2019m from. What a dream,\u201d Chalamet says. \u201cI also feel like my artistry has grown, not as a talking point or as hyperbole, but as a humble fact of foundation.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the kind of thing Marty might say. Indeed, some of Chalamet\u2019s recent declarations have struck some like he\u2019s still in character. Asked whether he\u2019s sincere or engaging in a little Method marketing, Chalamet takes a long pause and smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s both.\u201d",

      "But here\u2019s the thing: everybody may want to rule the world, but not everybody truly believes they CAN. This, one could argue, is what separates the true strivers from the rest of us.",
      "And Marty \u2014 played by Chalamet in a delicious synergy of actor, role and whatever fairy dust makes a performance feel both preordained and magically fresh \u2014 is a striver. With every fiber of his restless, wiry body. They should add him to the dictionary definition.",
      "Needless to say, Marty is a New Yorker.",

      "And so is Safdie, a writer-director Chalamet has called \u201cthe street poet of New York.\u201d So, where else could this story be set?",
      "It\u2019s 1952, on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side. Marty Mauser is a salesman in his uncle\u2019s shoe store, escaping to the storeroom for a hot tryst with his (married) girlfriend. Suddenly we\u2019re seeing footage of sperm traveling \u2014 talk about strivers! \u2014 up to an egg. Which morphs, of course, into a pingpong ball.",
      "This witty opening sequence won\u2019t be the only thing recalling \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d co-directed by Safdie with his brother Benny before the two split for solo projects. That film, which feels much like the precursor to \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d began as a trip through the shiny innards of a rare opal, only to wind up inside Adam Sandler\u2019s colon, mid-colonoscopy.",
      "Sandler\u2019s Howard Ratner was a New York striver, too, but sadder, and more troubled. Marty is young, determined, brash \u2014 with an eye always to the future. He\u2019s a great salesman: \u201cI could sell shoes to an amputee,\u201d he boasts, crassly. But what he\u2019s plotting to unveil to the world has nothing to do with shoes. It\u2019s about table tennis.",
      "How likely is it that this Jewish kid from the Lower East Side can become the very face of a sport in America, soon to be \u201cstaring at you from the cover of a Wheaties box?\u201d",
      "To Marty, perfectly likely. Still, he knows nobody in the U.S. cares about table tennis. He\u2019s so determined to prove everyone wrong, starting at the British Open in London, that when there\u2019s a snag obtaining cash for his trip, he brandishes a gun at a colleague to get it.",
      "Shaking off that sorta-armed robbery thing, Marty arrives in London, where he fast-talks his way into a suite at the Ritz. Here, he spies fellow guest Kay Stone (Gwyneth Paltrow, in a wise, stylish return to the screen), a former movie star married to an insufferable tycoon (\u201cShark Tank\u201d personality Kevin O\u2019Leary, one of many nonactors here.)",
      "Kay\u2019s skeptical, but Marty finds a way to woo her. Really, all he has to say is: \u201cCome watch me.\u201d Once she sees him play, she\u2019s sneaking into his room in a lace corselet.",

      "Elsewhere on the creative team, composer Daniel Lopatin succeeds in channelling both Marty\u2019s beating heart and the ricochet of pingpong balls in his propulsive score.

      "Is there something else for Marty, besides his obsessive goal? If so, he doesn\u2019t know it yet. But the lyrics of another song used in the film are instructive here: \u201cEverybody\u2019s got to learn sometime.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- A coalition of 19 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and its inspector general over a declaration that could complicate access to gender-affirming care for young people.",
      "The declaration issued last Thursday called treatments like puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries unsafe and ineffective for children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria, or the distress when someone\u2019s gender expression doesn\u2019t match their sex assigned at birth. It also warned doctors that they could be excluded from federal health programs like Medicare and Medicaid if they provide those types of care.",
      "The declaration came as HHS also announced proposed rules meant to further curtail gender-affirming care for young people, although the lawsuit doesn't address those as they are not final.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon, alleges that the declaration is inaccurate and unlawful and asks the court to block its enforcement. It's the latest in a series of clashes between an administration that's cracking down on transgender health care for children, arguing it can be harmful to them, and advocates who say the care is medically necessary and shouldn't be inhibited.",
      "\u201cSecretary Kennedy cannot unilaterally change medical standards by posting a document online, and no one should lose access to medically necessary health care because their federal government tried to interfere in decisions that belong in doctors\u2019 offices,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the lawsuit, said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that HHS\u2019s declaration seeks to coerce providers to stop providing gender-affirming care and circumvent legal requirements for policy changes. It says federal law requires the public to be given notice and an opportunity to comment before substantively changing health policy \u2014 neither of which, the suit says, was done before the declaration was issued.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS declined to comment.",
      "HHS's declaration based its conclusions on a peer-reviewed report that the department conducted earlier this year that urged greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than broad gender-affirming care for youths with gender dysphoria.",

      "JEFFERSONVILLE, Ind. -- Inside a storage room at the Clark County Health Department are boxes with taped-on signs reading, \u201cDO NOT USE.\u201d They contain cookers and sterile water that people use to shoot up drugs.",
      "The supplies, which came from the state and were paid for with federal money, were for a program where drug users exchange dirty needles for clean ones, part of a strategy known as harm reduction. But under a July executive order from President Donald Trump, federal substance abuse grants can\u2019t pay for supplies such as cookers and tourniquets that it says \u201conly facilitate illegal drug use.\u201d Needles already couldn\u2019t be purchased with federal money.",
      "In some places, the order is galvanizing support for syringe exchange programs, which decades of research show are extremely effective at preventing disease among intravenous drug users and getting them into treatment.",
      "In others, it\u2019s fueling opposition that threatens the programs' existence.",
      "Republican-led Indiana passed a law allowing exchanges a decade ago after the tiny city of Austin became the epicenter of the worst drug-fueled HIV outbreak in U.S. history. Unless lawmakers extend it, that law is scheduled to sunset next year, and the number of exchanges has been dwindling. State officials told remaining programs to comply with Trump's order \u2014 and even to discard federally funded supplies such as cookers and tourniquets.",
      "For now, Clark County health workers have found a way to keep distributing cookers and other items: buy them with private money and package them in \u201cmystery bags,\u201d assembled by employees who aren\u2019t paid with state or federal funds.",
      "Democratic-led California, meanwhile, has continued using state funds for supplies such as pipes and syringes. California is home to a rising number of exchanges, with 70 of the more than 580 listed by the North American Syringe Exchange Network.",
      "Some public health experts lament that syringe services programs have become subject to growing politicization and dissent.",
      "Clark County Health Officer Dr. Eric Yazel says IV drug users will likely inject themselves with or without clean supplies. Exchanges prevent people from sharing needles and spreading disease, he said, \u201cdecreasing the public health risk for the whole population.\u201d",
      "But Curtis Hill, a Republican former Indiana attorney general, is among critics who raise the same concern Trump\u2019s order does: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get into a situation where we\u2019re promoting drug use.\u201d",
      "When participants arrive at the Clark County health department, they look down at a list of services and say they are there for \u201cNo. 1.\u201d",
      "They choose from a cart with needles, bandages, sharps containers and the overdose reversal drug naloxone. They can receive testing for HIV and hepatitis C; information on drug treatment; and flyers on food banks, housing, and job placement. There are even handmade knit hats with encouraging notes like, \u201cYou\u2019ve got this!\u201d",
      "\u201cWe spend a half hour, 45 minutes or so talking to them about where they are, if they want treatment, if they\u2019re ready,\u201d Program Director Dorothy Waterhouse said. \u201cThese are our brothers, our sisters, our mothers, our fathers. \u2026 We need compassion to make sure they\u2019re getting into treatment.\u201d",
      "It's the closest exchange to Austin, a 35-minute drive away. Scott County, where Austin is located, already ended its program.",
      "Joshua Gay lived in an apartment across the street when he used the Clark County exchange. He shot up meth daily.",

      "A new Department of Health and Human Services report reveals Medicaid programs made over $200 million in improper payments to health care providers between 2021 and 2022 for people who had already died",
      "WASHINGTON -- Medicaid programs made more than $200 million in improper payments to health care providers between 2021 and 2022 for people who had already died, according to a new report from the independent watchdog for the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "But the department's Office of Inspector General said it expects a new provision in Republicans\u2019 One Big Beautiful Bill requiring states to audit their Medicaid beneficiary lists may help reduce these improper payments in the future.",
      "These kinds of improper payments are \u201cnot unique to one state, and the issue continues to be persistent,\u201d Aner Sanchez, deputy regional inspector general in the Office of Audit Services told The Associated Press. Sanchez has been researching this issue for a decade.",
      "The watchdog report released Tuesday said more than $207.5 million in managed care payments were made on behalf of deceased enrollees between July 2021 to July 2022. The office recommends that the federal government share more information with state governments to recover the incorrect payments \u2014 including a Social Security database known as the Full Death Master File, which contains more than 142 million records going back to 1899.",
      "Sharing the Full Death Master File data has been tightly restricted due to privacy laws which protect against identity theft and fraud.",
      "The massive tax and spending bill that was signed into law by President Donald Trump this summer expands how the Full Death Master File can be used by mandating Medicaid agencies to quarterly audit their provider and beneficiary lists against the file, beginning in 2027. The intent is to stop payments to dead people and improve accuracy.",

      "The government had some success using the Full Death Master File to prevent improper payments earlier this year. In January, the Treasury Department reported that it had clawed back more than $31 million in federal payments that improperly went to dead people as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave Treasury temporary access to the file for three years as part of the 2021 appropriations bill.",
      "Meanwhile, the SSA has been making unusual updates to the file itself, adding and removing records, and complicating its use. For instance, the Trump administration in April moved to classify thousands of living immigrants as dead and cancel their Social Security numbers to crack down on immigrants who had been temporarily allowed to live in the U.S. under programs started during the Biden administration.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s government said it plans to end its waning foreign adoptions of Korean children, while United Nations investigators voiced \u201cserious concern\u201d over what they described as Seoul\u2019s failure to ensure truth-finding and reparations for widespread human rights violations tied to decades of mass overseas adoptions.",
      "The announcement Friday came hours after the United Nations human rights office released South Korea\u2019s response to investigators urging Seoul to spell out concrete plans to address the grievances of adoptees sent abroad with falsified records or abused by foreign parents.",
      "The issue had rarely been discussed at the U.N. level, even as South Korea faces growing pressure to confront widespread fraud and abuse that plagued its adoption program, particularly during a boom in the 1970s and 1980s when it annually sent thousands of children to the West.",
      "The country will phase out foreign adoptions over a five-year period, aiming to reach zero by 2029 at the latest as it tightens welfare policies for children in need of care, Vice Minister of Health and Welfare Lee Seuran said during a briefing.",
      "South Korea approved foreign adoptions of 24 children in 2025, down from around 2,000 in 2005 and an annual average of more than 6,000 during the 1980s.",
      "In the health ministry\u2019s briefing and response to the U.N., officials focused on future improvements rather than past problems.",
      "\u201cAdoptions were mainly handled by private adoption agencies before, and while they presumably prioritized the best interests of the child, there may have also been other competing interests,\u201d Lee said.",
      "\u201cNow, with the adoption system being restructured into a public framework, and with the Health Ministry and the government having a larger role in the process for approving adoptions, we have an opportunity to reassess whether international adoption is truly a necessary option,\u201d she added, citing efforts to promote domestic adoptions.",
      "U.N. investigators, including special rapporteurs on trafficking, enforced or involuntary disappearances and child abuse, raised the adoption issue with Seoul after months of communication with Yooree Kim. The 52-year-old was sent to a French family in 1984 without her biological parents\u2019 consent, based on documents falsely describing her as an abandoned orphan.",
      "Kim said she endured severe physical and sexual abuse by her adopters and petitioned the U.N. as part of a broader effort to seek accountability from governments and adoption agencies in South Korea and France.",
      "Citing broader systemic issues and Kim\u2019s case, U.N. investigators criticized South Korea for failing to give adoptees effective access to remedies for serious abuses and for the \u201cpossible denial of their rights to truth, reparations, and memorialization.\u201d",
      "They also voiced concern over the suspension of a government fact-finding investigation into past adoption abuses and fraud, despite reports of grave violations including cases that may amount to enforced disappearances.",
      "In its response, South Korea highlighted past reforms focused on abuse prevention including a 2011 law that reinstated judicial oversight of foreign adoptions, which ended decades of control by private agencies and resulted in a significant drop in international placements.",

      "Choi Jung Kyu, a human rights lawyer representing Kim, called South Korea\u2019s response \u201cperfunctory.\u201d He noted promises of stronger reparations, which were meant to reduce the need for victims to litigate, are not clearly spelled out in draft bills proposing a relaunch of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses.",
      "The government also vetoed a bill in April that would have removed the statute of limitations for state-related human rights violations, although that was before President Lee Jae Myung took office in June. Lee issued an apology in October over past adoption problems, as recommended by the truth commission.",

      "Following a nearly three-year investigation into complaints from 367 adoptees in Europe, the U.S. and Australia, the truth commission in March recognized Kim and 55 other adoptees as victims of human rights violations including falsified child origins, lost records and child protection failures.",
      "That was weeks before the commission halted its adoption investigation following internal disputes among commissioners over which cases warranted recognition as problematic. The fate of the remaining 311 cases, either deferred or incompletely reviewed, hinges on whether lawmakers establish a new truth commission through legislation.",
      "The commission\u2019s findings acknowledged state responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse. The program was driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children\u2019s backgrounds and origins. The findings largely aligned with previous reporting by The Associated Press.",
      "The AP investigation, in collaboration with Frontline (PBS), detailed how South Korea\u2019s government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to send some 200,000 Korean children overseas despite evidence that many were procured through questionable or unscrupulous means.",

      "The United States airstrikes targeting militants affiliated with the Islamic State in northwestern Nigeria are a major escalation of an offensive that Nigeria\u2019s overstretched military has struggled with for years",
      "ABUJA, Nigeria -- ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) \u2014 The United States airstrikes that targeted Islamic State militants in northwestern Nigeria's on Thursday marked a major escalation in an offensive that Nigeria's overstretched military has struggled with for years.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump said on social media that the \u201cpowerful and deadly\u201d strikes in Sokoto state were carried out against Islamic State militants \u201ctargeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians.\u201d Residents and security analysts have said Nigeria\u2019s security crisis affects both Christians, predominant in the south, and Muslims, who are the majority in the north.",
      "Nigeria, which is battling multiple armed groups, said the U.S. strikes were part of an exchange of intelligence and strategic coordination between the two countries.",
      "The Associated Press could not confirm the extent of the strikes' impact. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in a post on X about the airstrikes, said: \u201cMore to come...\u201d",
      "The armed groups in Africa\u2019s most populous country include at least two affiliated with the Islamic State \u2014 an offshoot of the Boko Haram extremist group known as the Islamic State West Africa Province in the northeast, and the lesser-known Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP) known locally as Lakurawa and prominent in the northwest.",
      "Although officials did not say exactly which group was targeted, security analysts said the target, if indeed against Islamic State militants, was likely members of Lakurawa, which became more lethal in border states like Sokoto and Kebbi in the last year, often targeting remote communities and security forces.",
      "The Nigerian military has said in the past that the group has roots in neighboring Niger and that it became more active in Nigeria's border communities following a 2023 military coup.

      "Amr Al Bidh, a foreign affairs special representative for the Council, said in a statement to The Associated Press that its fighters had been operating in eastern Hadramout on Friday after facing \u201cmultiple ambushes\u201d from gunmen.

      "IDLIB, Syria -- A bombing at a mosque in the Syrian city of Homs during Friday prayers killed at least eight people and wounded 18 others, authorities said, as long-standing sectarian, ethnic and political fault lines continue to destabilize the country, even as large-scale fighting has subsided.",
      "Images released by Syria\u2019s state-run Arab News Agency showed blood on the mosque\u2019s carpets, holes in the walls, shattered windows and fire damage. The Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib Mosque is located in Homs, Syria's third-largest city, in an area of the Wadi al-Dhahab neighborhood dominated by the Alawite minority.",
      "SANA, citing a security source, said that preliminary investigations indicate that explosive devices were planted inside the mosque. Authorities were searching for the perpetrators, who have not yet been identified, and a security cordon was placed around the building, Syria\u2019s Interior Ministry said in a statement.",
      "A little-known group calling itself Saraya Ansar al-Sunna claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted on its Telegram channel. The same group had previously claimed a suicide attack in June in which a gunman opened fire and then detonated an explosive vest inside a Greek Orthodox church in Dweil\u2019a, on the outskirts of Damascus, killing 25 people as worshippers prayed on a Sunday.",
      "The Syrian government blamed the church attack on a cell of the Islamic State group, saying IS had also planned to target a Shiite Muslim shrine. IS did not claim responsibility for the attack. The group follows an extreme interpretation of Sunni Islam and considers Shiites to be infidels.",
      "Syria recently joined the global coalition against IS and has launched a crackdown on IS cells, particularly after an attack on U.S. forces earlier this month that killed two service members and a civilian translator.",
      "The country has experienced several waves of sectarian clashes since the fall of President Bashar Assad last year. Assad, himself an Alawite, fled the country to Russia. Members of his sect have been subjected to crackdowns.",

      "Hearing about the Ariana Cinema's destruction was \u201cvery painful and sad news for me,\u201d said Talash, who has been active in Afghanistan's film industry since 2004 but has been living in France since the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he would be willing to withdraw troops from the country\u2019s eastern industrial heartland as part of a plan to end Russia\u2019s war, if Moscow also pulls back and the area becomes a demilitarized zone monitored by international forces.",
      "The proposal offered another potential compromise on control of the Donbas region, which has been a major sticking point in peace negotiations.",
      "Zelenskyy said the U.S. proposed the creation of a \u201cfree economic zone,\" which he said should be demilitarized. But it was unclear what that idea would mean for governance or development of the region.",
      "A similar arrangement could be possible for the area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is currently under Russian control, Zelenskyy said. He said any peace plan would need to be put to a referendum.",
      "Zelenskyy spoke to reporters Tuesday to describe an overarching 20-point plan that negotiators from Ukraine and the U.S. hammered out in Florida in recent days, though he said many details are still being discussed.",
      "Russia has given no indication that it will agree to any kind of withdrawal from land it has seized. In fact, Moscow has insisted that Ukraine relinquish the remaining territory it still holds in the Donbas \u2014 an ultimatum that Ukraine has rejected. Russia has captured most of Luhansk and about 70% of Donetsk \u2014 the two areas that make up the Donbas.",
      "Asked about the plan, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that Moscow would decide its position based on information received by Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who met with U.S. envoys in Florida over the weekend. Peskov declined to share further details.",
      "American negotiators have engaged in a series of talks with Ukraine and Russia separately since U.S. President Donald Trump presented a plan to end the war last month \u2014 a proposal widely seen as favoring Moscow, which invaded its neighbor nearly four years ago. Since then, Ukraine and its allies in Europe have worked to pull the plan closer to Kyiv's position.",
      "Zelenskyy said figuring out control of the Donbas region is \u201cthe most difficult point.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the U.S. has proposed creating a consortium with Ukraine and Russia, in which each party would have an equal stake.",

      "Zelenskyy acknowledged that the U.S. has not yet accepted Ukraine's counter-proposals.",
      "\u201cBut we have significantly brought most of the positions closer together,\" Zelenskyy said. \"In principle, all other consensus in this agreement has been found between us and them.\u201d",
      "Creating the demilitarized economic zone in the Donbas would require difficult discussions on how far troops would be required to move back and where international forces would be stationed, Zelenskyy said, adding that it should discussed at the leaders level.",
      "The working U.S.-Ukraine draft also proposes that Russian forces withdraw from the Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Sumy and Kharkiv regions. Zelenskyy envisions that international forces could be located along certain points of the contact line within the zone to monitor the implementation of the agreement.",
      "Ukraine also proposes that the occupied city of Enerhodar, which is the closest city to the Zaporizhzhia power plant, become a demilitarized free economic zone, Zelenskyy said.",
      "This point required 15 hours of discussions with the U.S., he said, and no agreement was reached.",
      "For now, the U.S. proposes that the plant be jointly operated by Ukraine, the U.S. and Russia, with each side controlling a 33% stake in the enterprise \u2014 a plan Zelenskyy called \u201cnot entirely realistic.\"",

    "story": [
      "The month after Christmas has been dubbed \u201cReturnuary\u201d for good reason",
      "The holiday season will soon come to a close, but the busiest time of the year for product returns is just beginning.",
      "The National Retail Federation estimates 17% of holiday purchases will be sent back this year. More retailers are reporting extended return windows and increased holiday staff to handle the rush this year.",
      "A major driver for returns is uncertainty. When we buy for other people, finding what they want is a bit of a guessing game. Online purchases have higher return rates because finding the right size and color is tough when you're just staring at images on screens.",
      "\u201cClothing and footwear, as you can imagine, because fit is such an important criteria, they have higher rates of returns,\u201d said Saskia van Gendt, chief sustainability officer at Blue Yonder, which sells software designed to improve companies' supply chain management.",
      "Returns come with an environmental cost, but there's a lot consumers and companies are doing to minimize it.",
      "If a company sells a thing, it's probably packaged in plastic. Plastic is made from oil, and oil production releases emissions that warm the planet. If that thing is bought online, it's put on a plane or a train or a truck that usually uses oil-based fuel.",
      "If you buy a thing and return it, it goes through most or all of that all over again.",
      "And once those products are back with the retailer, they may be sent along to a refurbisher, liquidator, recycler or landfill. All these steps require more travel, packaging and energy, ultimately translating to more emissions. Joseph Sarkis, who teaches supply chain management at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, estimates that returning an item increases its impact on the planet by 25% to 30%.",
      "Roughly a third of the time, those returns don't make their way to another consumer. Because frequently, it's not worth reselling.",
      "If, for example, you get a phone, but you send it back because you don't like the color, the seller has to pay for the fuel and equipment to get the phone back, and then has to pay for the labor to assess whether it has been damaged since leaving the facility.",
      "\u201cIt can be quite expensive,\u201d said Sarkis. \u201cAnd if you send it out to a new customer and the phone is bad, imagine the reputational hit you\u2019ll get. You\u2019ll get another return and you\u2019ll lose a customer who\u2019s unhappy with the product or material. So the companies are hesitant to take that chance.\u201d",
      "Something as expensive as a phone might get sold to a secondary or refurbishment market. But that $6 silicone spatula you got off Amazon? Probably not worth it. Plus, some stuff \u2014 think a bathing suit or a bra \u2014 is less attractive to customers if there's a chance it's been resold. The companies know that.",
      "And that's where the costs of returns are more than just environmental \u2014 and consumers wind up paying. Even free returns aren't really free.",
      "\u201cRefurbishment, inspection, repackaging, all of these things get factored into the retail price,\u201d said Christopher Faires, assistant professor of logistics and supply chain management at Georgia Southern University.",
      "If you want to reduce the impact of your returns, the first move is to increase their chances of resale. Be careful not to damage it, and reuse the packaging to send it back, said Cardiff University logistics and operations management lecturer Danni Zhang.",
      "If you have to return something, do it quickly. That ugly Christmas sweater you got at the white elephant office party has a much better chance of selling on Dec. 20 than it does on Jan. 5. Zhang said it's not worth the cost to the company to store that sweater once it's gone out of season.",

Zhang said it reduces landfill waste. Sarkis said it reduces emissions because companies with brick-and-mortar locations spread out across the country and closer to consumers thus move restocked goods shorter distances.",
      "\u201cIf I can return in-store, then I definitely will,\" Zhang said. \u201cThe managers can put that stuff back to the market as soon as possible.\u201d",

      "\u201cBut I don\u2019t know if they want to send a negative message,\" he said. \u201cIf you're telling someone to stop something because of negative results, that's not going to sell.\u201d",
      "Sarkis and Zhang both say charging for returns would help. Already Amazon is requiring customers pay in certain situations.",
      "On the tech side, Blue Yonder\u2019s recent acquisition of Optoro, a company that provides a return management system for retailers and brands, uses a software to quickly assess the condition of returned products and route them to stores that are most likely to resell them.",
      "\u201cHaving that process be more digitized, you can quickly assess the condition and put it back into inventory,\u201d said van Gendt. \u201cSo that\u2019s a big way to just avoid landfill and also all of the carbon emissions that are associated with that.\u201d",
      "Clothing is returned most often. Many sizes do not reflect specific measurements, like women's dresses, so they vary a lot between brands. Zhang said better sizing could help reduce the need for returns. On top of that, Sarkis said more 3D imaging and virtual reality programs could help customers be more accurate with their purchases, saving some returns.",

      "Dominion's project has been under construction since early 2024 and was scheduled to come online early next year, providing enough energy to power about 660,000 homes. The company said the delay was costing it more than $5 million a day in losses solely for the ships used in round-the-clock construction, and that customers or the company would eventually bear the cost.",
      "Dominion called this week's order \u201cthe latest in a series of irrational agency actions attacking offshore wind and then doubling down when those actions are found unlawful.\u201d",

      "Holiday spending using cash or cards through Sunday has topped last year's haul, according to data released this week by Visa's Consulting & Analytics division and Mastercard SpendingPulse.",
      "But growing unease over the U.S. economy and higher prices in part due to President Donald Trump's tariffs have altered the behavior of some Americans. More are hitting thrift stores or other discounters in place of malls, according to data from Placer.ai. The firm tracks people\u2019s movements based on cellphone usage.",
      "And they're sticking more closely to shopping lists and doing more research before buying. That may explain why returns so far are down compared with last year, according to data from Adobe Analytics.",

      "That's likely forcing traditional retailers such as department stores to fight harder for customers, Placer.ai said.",
      "Clothing and electronics that traditionally dominate holiday sales did have a surge but struggled to grow, according to Placer.ai. Both goods are dominated by imports and thus, vulnerable to tariffs.",
      "For example, traffic doubled in department stores during the week before Christmas, from Dec. 15 through Sunday, compared with the average shopping week this year. But traffic in the week before Christmas this year fell 13.2% compared with 2024.",
      "Traffic surged 61% at traditional sellers of only clothing in the week before the holiday compared with the rest of the year. But again, compared with the runup to Christmas last year, sales slid 9%.",
      "Some of that lost traffic may have migrated to the so-called off-price stores\u2014 chains like TJ Maxx. That sector had a sharp seasonal traffic bump of 85.1% and a gain of 1.2% in the week before the holiday.",
      "But it was thrift stores that were red hot, with traffic jumping nearly 11% in the week before Christmas compared with last year.",
      "\u201cWhether hunting for a designer deal or uncovering a one-of-a-kind vintage piece, consumers increasingly favored discovery-driven experiences over the standardized assortments of traditional retail,\u201d Shira Petrack, head of content at Placer.ai, said in a blog post Friday.",

That suggests that environmental concerns as well as economic issues are luring more Americans to second-hand stores, Placer.ai said. Visits to thrift stores generally do not take off during the holidays, yet in the most recent Black Friday weekend, sales jumped 5.5%, Placer.ai. reported.",

      "This is the first year that Adobe has tracked returns.",
      "Still, the last week of December sees the greatest concentration of returns: one out of every eight returns in the 2024 holiday season took place between Dec. 26 and Dec 31, a trend expected to persist this year, Adobe said.",

      "When you\u2019re shopping for a high-quality vehicle, the idea of acquiring one with a luxury badge that\u2019s packed with features can be appealing. But it can also be an expensive proposition in today\u2019s market when the average price of a new car is approximately $50,000. Thankfully, there is an alternative: Buy a used one.",

When considering a used model, know that this seventh-generation version rolled into BMW dealerships for the 2019 model year. It brought added power from the standard turbocharged four-cylinder engine, improved handling and a slightly larger trunk. Rear-wheel drive is standard, although all-wheel drive is available as an option to provide better traction in winter weather.",

      "Introduced beginning with the 2020 model year, the Mercedes-Benz GLB is a savvy choice for a subcompact luxury SUV. Initially, it was available solely with a 221-horsepower four-cylinder engine and front- or all-wheel drive. In 2021, Mercedes added a sportier 302-horsepower variant called the AMG GLB 35. Additional highlights include a roomy cabin and good outward visibility. There is an optional third row, though keep in mind it\u2019s tiny and only suitable for small kids.",

Having made its debut for the 2022 model year, this first-generation GV70 looks sharp and gets down the road quickly thanks to its choice of a 300-horsepower four-cylinder engine or an available 375-horsepower V6. The V6, in particular, provides the GV70 with impressive acceleration for merging onto the highway or passing slower vehicles.

A redesign for the 2022 model year brought a more energetic-looking exterior, more legroom for all three rows, and improved technology features. The base engine is a 290-horsepower V6 and offers a choice of front- or all-wheel drive. A punchier 335-horsepower Type S model is available, yet used models could be significantly more expensive.",

      "GiveDirectly got $50 gift cards out to SNAP recipients during last month\u2019s shutdown through a new approach to cash assistance",
      "Finances already looked tight for Jade Grant and her three children as she entered the year's final months.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s birthday is back-to-back,\u201d the 32-year-old certified nursing assistant said. \u201cYou have holidays coming up. You have Thanksgiving. Everything is right there. And then, boom. No (food) stamps.\u201d",
      "Grant is among the nearly 42 million lower-income Americans who get help buying groceries from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. When the federal shutdown began in October, she wasn't worried about losing her benefits \u2014 she said she is used to government \u201cfoolishness.\u201d",
      "But circumstances got dicey when the budget impasse entered its second month and President Donald Trump took the unprecedented step of freezing November SNAP payments. With one child who eats gluten free and another with many allergies, specialty items already drove up her grocery bill. Now Grant wondered how she'd put food on the table \u2014 especially with her youngest's 6th birthday approaching.",
      "Then Grant logged into Propel, an app used by 5 million people to manage their electronic benefits transfers, where she saw a pop-up banner inviting her to apply for a relief program. Within a minute she'd completed a survey and about two days later she got a virtual $50 gift card.",
      "The total didn't come close to her monthly SNAP allotment. But the Palm Bay, Florida, resident said it was enough to buy a customized \u201c Bluey \u201d birthday cake for her son.",
      "Nearly a quarter of a million families got that same cash injection from the nonprofit GiveDirectly as they missed SNAP deposits many need to feed their households. The collaboration with Propel proved to be the largest disaster response in the international cash assistance group's history outside of COVID-19; non-pandemic records were set with the $12 million raised, more than 246,000 beneficiaries enrolled and 5,000 individual donors reached.",
      "Recipients are still recovering from the uncertainty of last month's SNAP delays. Company surveys suggest many are dealing with the long-term consequences of borrowing money in early November when their benefits didn\u2019t arrive on time, according to Propel CEO Jimmy Chen. At a time when users felt the existing safety net had fallen through, they credit the rapid payments for buoying them \u2014 both financially and emotionally.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a lot. But at the same time, it is a lot,\u201d Grant said. \u201cBecause $50 can do a lot when you don\u2019t have anything.\u201d",
      "It's not the first partnership for the antipoverty nonprofit and for-profit software company. They have previously combined GiveDirectly's fast cash model with Propel's verified user base to get money out to natural disaster survivors \u2014 including $1,000 last year to some households impacted by Hurricanes Milton and Helene.",
      "\u201cThis particular incident with the shutdown we saw as akin to a natural disaster,\" Chen said, \u201cin the sense that it created a really sudden and really acute form of hardship for many Americans across the country.\u201d",
      "The scope differed this time. The \u201cman-made disaster,\u201d as GiveDirectly U.S. Country Director Dustin Palmer put it, was not geographically isolated. The benefits freeze impacted more people than they usually serve. SNAP costs almost $10 billion a month, Palmer said, so they never expected to raise enough money to replace the delayed benefits altogether.",
      "But 5,000 individual donors \u2014 plus $1 million gifts from Propel and New York nonprofit Robin Hood, as well as other major foundations' support \u2014 provided a sizable pot. Palmer found that the issue resonated more than he expected.",
      "GiveDirectly reports that the median donation was $100. Palmer took that response as a sign the issue hit close for many Americans.",
      "\u201cYou and I know SNAP recipients. Maybe we\u2019ve been SNAP recipients,\" Palmer said. \"So that was not a disaster in Central Texas where I\u2019ve never been, but something in our communities.\u201d",
      "The greatest question revolved around the total sum of each cash transfer. Should they reach more people with fewer dollars or vice versa? Los Angeles wildfire survivors, for example, got $3,500 each from a similar GiveDirectly campaign. But that's because they wanted to provide enough to cover a month's worth of lodging and transit to those who lost their houses.",

Propel's software allowed them to send money as soon as the app detected that a family's benefits hadn't arrived at the usual time of the month.",
      "Recipients decided whether their prepaid debit cards arrived physically, which might allow them to take cash out of an ATM, or virtually, which could be used almost immediately. The split is usually pretty even, according to Palmer, but this time more than 90% of recipients went with the virtual option.",

One week they gave far more than expected, she said, but the following week they were \u201cso overwhelmed\u201d that it almost wasn't worth visiting.",
      "She said it's \u201cscary\u201d the government \u201ccan just decide to not feed so many people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt least I have my safety net but not everybody\u2019s lucky,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never trusted the government and that\u2019s just a new solid reason why I don\u2019t trust them.\u201d",
      "Chen, the Propel CEO, said his company's research suggests that November's freeze damaged many recipients' confidence in the government. Even with SNAP funded through the next fiscal year, Chen said, many respondents are concerned about another shutdown.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s introduced this seed of doubt for people that this really fundamental thing that they use to pay for food may not be there when they need it,\u201d Chen said.",
      "The gap persists for many. Propel estimates that just over half of SNAP recipients got their benefits late last month. GiveDirectly launched an additional \u201cmop-up\u201d campaign to distribute cash retroactively for more than 8,000 people still reeling.",

      "Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell said that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring.",

      "The Federal Communications Commission says it will ban new foreign-made drones, a move that will keep new Chinese-made drones out of the U.S. market",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission on Monday said it would ban new foreign-made drones, a move that will keep new Chinese-made drones such as those from DJI and Autel out of the U.S. market.",
      "The announcement came a year after Congress passed a defense bill that raised national security concerns about Chinese-made drones, which have become a dominant player in the U.S., widely used in farming, mapping, law enforcement and filmmaking.",
      "The bill called for stopping the two Chinese companies from selling new drones in the U.S. if a review found they posed a risk to American national security. The deadline for the review was Dec. 23.",
      "The FCC said Monday the review found that all drones and critical components produced in foreign countries, not just by the two Chinese companies, posed \u201cunacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and to the safety and security of U.S. persons.\" But it said specific drones or components would be exempt if the Pentagon or Department of Homeland Security determined they did not pose such risks.",
      "The FCC cited upcoming major events, such as the 2026 World Cup, America250 celebrations and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, as reasons to address potential drone threats posed by \u201ccriminals, hostile foreign actors, and terrorists.\"",
      "Michael Robbins, president and chief executive officer of AUVSI, the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International, said in a statement that the industry group welcomes the decision. He said it's time for the U.S. not only to reduce its dependence on China but build its own drones.",
      "\u201cRecent history underscores why the United States must increase domestic drone production and secure its supply chains,\" Robbins said, citing Beijing's willingness to restrict critical supplies such as rare earth magnets to serve its strategic interests.",

      "DJI said it was disappointed by the FCC decision. \u201cWhile DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "\u201cConcerns about DJI\u2019s data security have not been grounded in evidence and instead reflect protectionism, contrary to the principles of an open market,\u201d the company said.",
      "In Texas, Gene Robinson has a fleet of nine DJI drones that he uses for law enforcement training and forensic analyses. He said the new restrictions would hurt him and many others who have come to rely on the Chinese drones because of their versatility, high performance and affordable prices.",

We need to suck it up, and let\u2019s not have it happen again.\"",
      "Also in Texas, Arthur Erickson, chief executive officer and co-founder of the drone-making company Hylio, said the departure of DJI would provide much-needed room for American companies like his to grow. New investments are pouring in to help him ramp up production of spray drones, which farmers use to fertilize their fields, and it will bring down prices, Erickson said.",
      "But he also called it \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cunexpected\u201d that the FCC should expand the scope to all foreign-made drones and drone components. \u201cThe way it's written is a blanket statement,\u201d Erickson said. \u201cThere's a global allied supply chain. I hope they will clarify that.\u201d",

      "According to the coalition, between 2008 and 2016 the German automaker equipped more than 211,000 diesel passenger cars and vans with software devices that optimized emission controls during tests but reduced the controls during normal operations. The devices enabled vehicles to far exceed legal limits for nitrogen oxides, a pollutant that can cause respiratory illnesses and contributes to smog.",

    "story": [
      "In a breathless year of tariffs unleashed by the administration of President Donald Trump, perhaps no one has had to live the reality of every fluctuation of trade policy than customs brokers",
      "NEW YORK -- After a half-century immersed in the world of trade, customs broker Amy Magnus thought she\u2019d seen it all, navigating mountains of regulations and all sorts of logistical hurdles to import everything from lumber and bananas to circus animals and Egyptian mummies.",
      "Then came 2025.",
      "Tariffs were imposed in ways she\u2019d never seen. New rules left her wondering what they really meant. Federal workers, always a reliable backstop, grew more elusive.",
      "\u201c2025 has changed the trade system,\u201d says Magnus. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect before, but it was a functioning system. Now, it is a lot more chaotic and troubling.\u201d",
      "Once hidden cogs in the international trade machine, customs brokers are getting a rare spotlight as President Donald Trump reinvents America\u2019s commercial ties with the world. If this breathless year of tariffs amounts to a trade war, customs brokers are its front lines.",
      "Few Americans have been exposed as exhaustively to every fluctuation of trade policy as the customs broker. They were there in the opening days of Trump\u2019s second term, when tariffs were announced on Canada and Mexico, and two days later, when those same levies were paused. They were there through every rule on imports of steel and seafood, on cars and copper, on polysilicon and pharmaceuticals, and on and on. For every tariff, for every carve-out, for every order, brokers have been left to translate policy into reality, line by line and code by code, in a year when it seemed every passing week brought change.",
      "\u201cWe were used to decades of a certain way of processing, and from January to now, that universe has been turned kind of upside-down on us,\u201d says Al Raffa, a customs broker in Elizabeth, New Jersey, who helps shepherd containerloads of cargo into the U.S. packed to the brim with everything from rounds of brie to boxes of chocolate.",
      "Each arrival of products imported to the country requires filings with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and often, other agencies. Importers often turn to brokers to handle the regulatory legwork and, with a spate of new trade rules unleashed by the Trump administration, they\u2019ve seen their demand grow alongside their workloads.",
      "Many shipments that entered duty free now are tariffed. Other imports that had minimal levies that might cost a company a few hundred dollars have had their bills balloon to thousands. For Raffa and his crew, the ever-expanding list of tariffs means a given product could be subjected to taxes under multiple separate tariff lines.",
      "\u201cThat one line item of cheese that previously was just one tariff, now it could be two, three, in some cases five tariff numbers,\u201d says 53-year-old Raffa, who has had jobs in trade since he was a teenager and who has a button emblazoned with \u201cMake Trade Boring Again.\u201d",
      "Government regulations have always been a reality for brokers, and the very reason for their existence. When thick tomes of trade rules changed in the past, though, they typically were issued long ahead of their effective dates, with periods for comment and review, each word of policy crafted in an attempt to project clarity and definition.",
      "With Trump, word of a major change in trade rules might come in a Truth Social post or an oversized chart clutched by the president in a Rose Garden appearance.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019d be remiss not to be looking at the White House website on a daily basis, multiple times a day, just to see what executive order is going to be announced,\u201d Raffa says.",
      "Each announcement sends brokerage firms into a scramble to attempt to dissect the rules, update their systems to reflect them and alert their customers who may have shipments en route and for whom any shift in tariffs could mean a major hit to their bottom line.",
      "JD Gonzalez, a third-generation customs broker in Laredo, Texas, and president of the National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Association of America, says the volume and speed of changes have been challenging enough. But the wording of White House orders has often left more unanswered questions than brokers are accustomed to.",
      "\u201cThe order is kind of vague sometimes, the guidance that\u2019s being provided is sometimes murky, and we\u2019re trying to make the determination,\u201d 62-year-old Gonzalez says.",

      "Gonzalez rattles off 10-digit tariff codes for alcohol and doors and recites the complicated web of rules that determine the duties on a chair with a frame made of steel produced in the U.S. but processed in Mexico. As brokers\u2019 work has grown tougher, he says some of their firms have begun charging customers more for their services because each item they\u2019re responsible for tracking on a bill of lading takes longer.",
      "\u201cYou double the time,\u201d he says.",
      "Brokers can\u2019t help but see the imprints of their work everywhere they go. Gonzalez looks at a T-shirt tag and thinks of what a broker did to get it into the country. Magnus sees Belgian chocolate or Chinese silk and is awed, despite all the things that could have kept something from landing on a store shelf, that it still arrived. Raffa walks through the supermarket, picks up a can of artichoke hearts, and considers every possible regulation that might apply to secure its import into the country.",
      "It has been heartening for brokers, who existed in the gray arcana of hidden bureaucracy unseen by most Americans, to now earn a bit more recognition.",
      "\u201cIt was maybe taken for granted how that wonderful piece of gourmet cheese got on the shelf, or that Gucci bag,\u201d says Raffa. \u201cUp until this year, people were clueless what I did.\u201d",
      "Magnus, who is in her 70s and based on Marco Island, Florida, spent 18 years at U.S. Customs before starting at a brokerage in 1992. She came to find comfort in the precision of rules governing every import she cleared the way for, from crude oil to diamonds.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t like to have any doubt, we don\u2019t like to leave anything up to interpretation,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we ourselves are struggling, trying to interpret and understand the meaning of some of these things, it is a very unsettling place to be.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just the White House orders that have complicated her work.",
      "The Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting blitz under billionaire Elon Musk led to layoffs and retirements of trusted government workers that brokers turn to for guidance. A shutdown slowed operations at ports. And fear of being out of step with the administration has some federal employees cautious about decoding trade orders, making answers on interpretation of tariff rules sometimes tough to come by.",
      "Magnus was befuddled by moves that seemed at odds with everything she knew of trade policy. Canada as adversary? Switzerland subjected to 39% tariffs? It defied how she had come to see the choreography of cargo and what it says about the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like an incredible ballet to be able to trade with all these countries all over the world,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my own mind, I always felt that as long as we were trading and we were friendly with each other, we were reducing the chance of war and killing each other.\u201d",
      "Work has been so hectic this year that Magnus hasn\u2019t managed to take a vacation. Weekends have so frequently been upended by Friday afternoon edicts announcing a tariff is going into effect or being taken away that it has become an inside joke with colleagues.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Friday afternoon,\u201d she says. \u201cIs everybody watching?\u201d",
      "A couple hours after Magnus repeats this, the next White House order is posted, undoing a slew of tariffs on agricultural products and sending brokers into another scurry.",

      "Competition among retailers for a slice of the $129 billion U.S. beauty and personal care market is fiercer than ever due to the ease of e-commerce and the advice shoppers seek on social media instead of in stores",
      "NEW YORK -- It\u2019s shoppers like Quinn Kelsey who keep department store executives up at night.",
      "The 38-year-old Denver resident gets makeup ideas from TikTok videos and other social media content, not salespeople at beauty counters. She uses an AI chatbot to get product recommendations that fit her budget and to see how a certain foundation or lipstick would look on her. When she buys, it\u2019s usually from Amazon.",
      "\u201cI use Chat GPT as my personal beauty consultant,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cDepartment stores? I\u2019ll walk through one for the decor, but they\u2019ve basically lost me unless I can get the same product-research experience there that I can get scrolling through my phone at home.\u201d",
      "Once the ultimate beauty destination, department stores lost sales and their authority as skincare and makeup trendsetters starting in the late 1990s. That was when the growth of Sephora and Ulta Beauty made shopping for cosmetics more of a playful, self-service experience.",
      "But fast-changing consumer preferences have all types of retailers racing to outdo each other for a slice of the $129 billion U.S. beauty and personal care market. The competition is fiercer than ever due to the ease of e-commerce. Amazon, which has slowly added premium beauty brands to its massive selection, is the nation\u2019s largest online seller of beauty and personal care products, according to market research company Euromonitor International.",
      "Social media also has provided new sources of beauty guidance. Instead of store advisers, many consumers look to videos by influencers, beauty brand founders or dermatologists for advice. Shoppers also turn to TikTok and Instagram for information about \u201cdupes\" \u2014 drugstore versions of more expensive products.",
      "\u201cStores are more of the showroom, but the spark itself is happening in TikTok,\u201d Jake Bjorseth, founder of the Generation Z advertising agency Trndsttrs, said.",
      "To keep up, companies with both physical and online stores are investing in upgrades that are meant to give beauty fans like Kelsey an experience they can\u2019t get anywhere else. Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom, for example, renovated the beauty floors of their flagship New York stores to add more space, ultra-luxury brands and cutting-edge technology. At Nordstrom, customers can book an appointment to get robot-applied eyelash extensions for $170.",
      "The makeovers were launched in time for the holiday shopping season, which accounts for about one-quarter of all U.S. \u201cprestige\u201d beauty sales, according to market research firm Circana.",
      "Department stores chasing beauty sales are introducing some of the serve-yourself features of Sephora \u2014 Nordstrom put in a \u201cbeauty bar\u201d with brightly lit mirrors where customers are allowed to take makeup from different counters \u2014 while trying to distinguish themselves from specialty and online rivals.",
      "Executives from Macy's and Nordstrom said the latest changes were designed to create an engaging atmosphere that encourages shoppers to stay longer and spend more. The overhaul at Macy's Herald Square included comfortable seating and skin analysis devices that help make the case for lotions and potions costing hundreds of dollars.",
      "In the Parfums de Marly section, customers sample scents while wearing a virtual reality headset meant to immerse them in an 18th century chateau the French fragrance maker cites as its inspiration.",
      "\u201cThis is the future of beauty,\u201d Nicolette Bosco, Macy's vice president of beauty, said, referring to the interactive technology the department store considers central to offering shoppers an elevated experience.",
      "The company expects to redesign the beauty departments of 40 more stores. The facelifts are intended to draw shoppers of all ages, Macy\u2019s Inc. CEO Tony Spring said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying very hard to take the idea of a department store and make it intimate and friendly and convenient,\u201d he said.",
      "Since becoming chief executive of the department store's parent company last year, Spring has focused on reviving Macy's by trying to attract the higher-spending customers who power sales at Bloomingdale's and upscale beauty retailer Bluemercury, both of which Macy's owns.",

      "Fragrances of all kinds and prices also have taken off as a popular purchase, outperforming sales of makeup and skincare in the first nine months of the year, the firm said.",
      "However, many shoppers don't want to get spritzed while wandering through a department store and don't want a salesperson's help picking out a perfume for loved ones or themselves. They may know what they want from hearing about social media trends like \u201cfragrance layering.\u201d Some enthusiasts collect scents like they might handbags and trust their own noses.",

      "Here are four things I learned:",
      "Always smile at shoppers as they walk by and try complimenting them on what they're wearing, Dervil said. If they moved on, I knew enough not to follow them. Remember the old sales adage about the importance of direct eye contact. It's more crucial than ever since many customers will be wearing earbuds or headphones and might not hear a spoken invitation to sample products.",
      "If customers stop by the counter, ask if they want help. If they say no, let them explore and don't be pushy. They often start asking questions if you let them linger a while, Dervil said.",

      "Ask shoppers what they are looking for once they indicate they want help, Dervil said. \u201cAre they looking for themselves or is it a gift for someone?\u201d is a standard approach, she said.

      "Always direct customers first to the fragrance in the middle of the spectrum between subtle and strong. The midpoint is typically the most popular. In Dior's J'Adore line, the favorite version is the \u201ceau de parfum,\" Dervil said. If a customer think that's too strong or too light, direct them accordingly, she advised.",
      "I also learned that going up or down the spectrum doesn't always mean a more diffused or intense version of the same scent. It may lead to a different smell altogether.",
      "For example, the \u201cparfum d\u2019eau\u201d form of J'Adore smelled like a lighter version of the \u201ceau de parfum.\u201d But the line's lightest scent, J'Adore Eau Lumiere, had a citrusy scent that was totally different.",
      "Don't spray or dab on shoppers. Instead, spritz three times on a paper test strip and let it sit for a few seconds before the customer smells it, Dervil advised. Otherwise, the initial whiff may be too overwhelming, she said.",
      "Start asking open-ended questions about what they like or don't like about the scent. If they want to try other products, fold the strip and place it next to the just-sampled fragrance as a reminder of which one it was.",
      "If they're switching from scent to scent, ask them to sniff their arm or the back of their hand to clear their nostrils for the next one, Dervil said.",
      "If a customer likes a scent, discuss prices and bottle sizes, and hope to complete the sale.",

      "The data, which exclude sales from auto dealerships, gas stations, and restaurants, are not adjusted for inflation including the impact from President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "When adjusted, retail sales rose a more modest 2.2% for that time frame, according to Visa's principal U.S. economist Michael Brown. That compares to the inflation-adjusted 3% sales gain last year.",
      "\u201cIt's certainly not a spectacular season,\u201d Brown told The Associated Press. \"It's sort of an average holiday season given concerns about macro economic growth, inflation. There's still a lot of uncertainty among the consumer population.\"",
      "Retailers have described shoppers as being selective when making holiday purchases, choosing to focus on gifts for under the tree instead of holiday decor like ornaments for the tree, for example. Many households are struggling with higher prices in groceries, rent and imported goods hit by tariffs. The latest job report, released by the Labor Department last week, also shows a souring employment picture.",
      "As a result, consumers' mood has been gloomy, though it improved last month as worries about inflation eased a bit, according to the University of Michigan.",

      "Predicting the shopping season has been challenging as the 43-day federal government shutdown delayed economic reports including those covering monthly retail sales figures. The federal government is gradually catching up.",
      "Last week, the Commerce Department reported that sales at U.S. retailers and restaurants were unchanged in October from September in a report delayed by more than a month. A big drag on October data was a drop in sales at motor vehicles and auto parts dealerships, hurt by the expiration of federal government subsidies that sliced demand for battery-powered electric cars.",

      "Clothing and accessories sales accelerated at a 5.3% pace from Nov. 1 through Dec. 21 from a 4.1% increase last year. The category wasn't as affected by tariffs as other areas like holiday home decor, which is predominantly made in China, Brown said. That category saw a slim 0.8% sales gain.",
      "And a still weak housing market hurt sales of home improvement items like building materials and garden accessories, which recorded a 1% sales increase, Visa said.",

      "A Pakistani investment firm-led consortium has acquired a 75% stake in Pakistan International Airlines",
      "ISLAMABAD -- A consortium led by a Pakistani investment firm acquired a 75% stake in state-run Pakistan International Airlines on Tuesday during a televised auction, marking a major step in the government\u2019s long-delayed effort to privatize the loss-making national carrier.",
      "The Arif Habib consortium submitted a winning bid of 135 billion rupees ($482 million) for the majority shareholding in PIA, which was once regarded as among the region\u2019s top airlines but has suffered decades of financial losses and mismanagement.",
      "Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, speaking at the bidding ceremony, said the privatization process was transparent and competitive. He hoped that the new owners would help revive the airline.",
      "The sale fulfills a long-standing demand by the International Monetary Fund, which has repeatedly urged Pakistan to privatize the airline as part of broader economic reforms tied to bailout programs.",

      "The auction comes two months after PIA resumed direct flights to Europe following a decision by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency to lift a four-year ban imposed over safety concerns. The ban was introduced in 2020, after 97 people were killed when a PIA aircraft crashed in Karachi.",
      "Once seen as a model airline, PIA has deteriorated over the years due to political interference and chronic overstaffing. The airline employs about 300 workers per aircraft across its 32 fleet \u2014 one of the highest employee-to-aircraft ratios in the industry. Most airlines operate with fewer than 200 employees per aircraft, a common benchmark of productivity.",

Hawaii had the highest average of about $4.44 a gallon on Tuesday, per AAA \u2014 followed by $4.30 in California and $3.92 in Washington. Meanwhile, Oklahoma had the lowest average at about $2.30 per gallon, followed by nearly $2.42 in both Arkansas and Iowa.",
      "Still, nationwide, unleaded gasoline is down more than 18 cents than it was at this time last year, and 21 cents from a month ago. So far, AAA says that prices seen this month mark the cheapest December for gas prices since 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic roiled the economy.",

      "Travis Kelce tried to make Thursday night a memorable one if it is his last game at Arrowhead Stadium",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- If Thursday night was the last game Travis Kelce played inside Arrowhead Stadium, he sure tried to make it a memorable one.",
      "The Chiefs tight end only had five catches for 36 yards against Denver, playing alongside third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun while his good buddy Patrick Mahomes and backup Gardner Minshew were out with knee injuries. But several of those catches came in the closing minutes, nearly rallying Kansas City in what would have been a stunning upset of the Broncos.",
      "Kelce and Co. wound up losing 20-13 in a game in which they were nearly two-touchdown underdogs.",
      "But it was a gutsy display by him in a career filled with them.",
      "The four-time All-Pro, who is expected to announce soon after the season whether he is retiring, could have hung up the cleats a couple of weeks ago, when the reigning AFC champions were eliminated from playoff contention for the first time in a decade.",
      "Instead, after going to five Super Bowls \u2014 including the last three \u2014 and winning three championship rings, the 36-year-old Kelce showed that he had too much pride to quit on a lost season. He played in a humiliating loss to lowly Tennessee last week, and he was one of the few bright spots Thursday night for an offense that finished with 139 yards in all.",
      "\u201cA whole lot of emotions,\u201d Kelce said afterward. \u201cYou've got everybody in the world watching you. You get to go out there with the young guys on primetime television. Young guys getting an opportunity to taste what this NFL life is like.\u201d",
      "As for retirement?",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll let that be a decision I\u2019ll make with my family, friends, the Chiefs organization when the time comes,\u201d Kelce said.",
      "He was the final player introduced Thursday night, following Oladokun out of the tunnel in the corner of Arrowhead Stadium. As red lights flashed across the field, Kelce emerged from the fog with his signature bow-and-arrow entrance gesture toward a festive holiday crowd, and it predictably roared in delight \u2014 perhaps for the last time \u2014 as No. 87 took the field.",
      "\u201cYou only get a few of those (moments) where you get to stand there and appreciate 60, 70-thousand Chiefs fans cheering for you,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cI always embrace that moment.\u201d",

      "Kelce has played 97 games inside the stadium over the course of a 13-year career. He caught 645 passes there, including playoffs, the third-most by any player inside a single stadium behind Jerry Rice and Larry Fitzgerald since the AFL-NFL merger.",
      "Now, the question is whether Kelce will play next week in the Chiefs' season finale in Las Vegas.",

He could also go out with a win, rather than having lost five straight and seven of his last eight games, which is the slide the Chiefs find themselves on now.",

      "DENVER -- Nikola Jokic's magnitude is matched only by his modesty.",
      "\u201cI mean, I had a good game,\u201d Denver's superstar center said in his typical understated fashion after setting an NBA record by scoring 18 points in overtime, leading the Nuggets past Minnesota 142-138 on Thursday night.",
      "Those 18 points came in the final 2:53 of overtime, no less, and Jokic finished with 56 points along with 16 rebounds and 15 assists for his 179th career triple-double.",
      "No player in NBA history ever had a 55-15-15 triple-double before Jokic's masterpiece capped the league's five-game Christmas Day slate.",
      "Every bit of it was necessary for the short-handed Nuggets, playing without three opening night starters, to overcome a 44-point performance by Anthony Edwards, who sent the game to overtime with a twisting 3-pointer from the left corner with a second to go in regulation.",
      "Edwards scored 11 points in OT but picked up two technical fouls in the final minute, one for knocking the ball out of Jokic's hands on a dead ball following a basket.",
      "Edwards scored seven quick points at the start of overtime as the Wolves used a 9-0 run to take a 124-115 lead and silence the sell-out crowd at Ball Arena.",
      "The Nuggets looked cooked. And coach David Adelman called timeout with 2:59 remaining.",
      "That's when Jokic took over.",
      "The Nuggets' 27 points from that point on set an NBA record for most points scored in a five-minute overtime, and it started with a 3-pointer from Jokic at the 2:53 mark.",
      "Jamal Murray, who added 35 points, blocked Rudy Gobert's putback and dished to Tim Hardaway for a 3. After Julius Randle made two free throws, Jokic hit another 3-pointer, then tied it 126-all with a floating jump shot with 1:26 remaining.",
      "Over the final 56 seconds, Jokic made 10 of 11 free throws, giving him 18 points in the extra period, breaking Steph Curry's record of 17 points in a single overtime set in 2016.",

      "\u201cThe best player in the world,\u201d Adelman marveled, rattling off what he called a \u201ccrazy stat line\u201d and terrific efficiency by Jokic, who made 15 of 21 shots, including 4 of 6 from beyond the arc, sank 22 of 23 free throws and had a 3-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio.",
      "\u201cI'll just keep saying: Don't get tired of this,\" Adelman said. \"He's the best player in the world, just the bottom line. And what he does nightly it's important to the game of basketball. It's good for sports \u2014 it's good for his head coach.\u201d",
      "The Nuggets certainly are accustomed to historic performances from their Serbian superstar and three-time MVP.",
      "Told that Jokic broke Curry's individual record of 17 points in an overtime, Murray said, \"Seems about right.\u201d",
      "With the Wolves so focused on Jokic, Murray shot a career-high 18 3-pointers and sank half of them, including a key 3 in overtime when he was being guarded by Edwards and Jaden McDaniels.",
      "\u201cYeah, I just told the bench I was going to shoot a pull-up because of the way they were guarding Jokic,\u201d Murray said. \u201cThe way he was scoring, they were so focused on him. I don't think I shot for most of the fourth and overtime.\u201d",
      "The Nuggets are accustomed to Jokic's superlative performances, but this one stood out given that Denver blew a late 15-point late lead in regulation and fell behind by nine in overtime.",
      "Edwards scored seven of those points and finished with 44 before his ejection for picking up two quick technical fouls in overtime as the Nuggets closed on a 27-14 spurt.",
      "\u201cThey're gonna show this game 20 years from now, I'll crack open a beer and watch it,\" Adelman said. \u201cThere's other ones that I flip on NBA TV and I immediately turn the channel. So, this was one of those crazy NBA games with two really good teams, top-tier teams, so just proud that we found a way.\u201d",

      "Masashi \u201cJumbo\u201d Ozaki, whose 113 worldwide victories were the most of any player from Japan, died Wednesday in his home country after a battle with colon cancer, the Japan Golf Tour said. He was 78.",
      "Ozaki was revered in Japan, a big hitter with a sense of style who won 94 times over 29 years on the Japan Golf Tour, the last one coming at the 2002 ANA Open when he was 55.",
      "He rose to No. 5 in the world ranking in 1996 at age 49. Ozaki often got overlooked for never winning outside Japan except for the New Zealand PGA Championship. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2011.",
      "\u201cHe is an indispensable, one-of-a-kind figure in discussing men\u2019s golf, both now and in the future,\u201d the tour said in a social media post.",
      "Ozaki competed in 49 majors, his best finish coming in the 1989 U.S. Open at Oak Hill when he finished three shots behind Curtis Strange. He played the Masters for the 19th and final time in 2000 when he was 53 and tied for 28th.",
      "Isao Aoki was the first Japanese player in the World Golf Hall of Fame, and Hideki Matsuyama became the first to win a major at the 2021 Masters. Both were inspired in some fashion by Ozaki, the pioneer in a nation now obsessed with golf.",
      "Ozaki won the Japan Open five times and the Japan PGA Championship six times. He led the Japan Golf Tour money list a record 12 times, including five in a row from 1994 through 1998. He won his final money title in 2002, when he was 55.",
      "When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, Ozaki said his one regret was not playing more outside of Japan.",
      "\u201cBut I dedicated my life to Japanese golf and am extremely grateful the voters thought I was worthy of this honor,\u201d he said upon his election. He received 50% of the vote on the International ballot.",
      "Ozaki was looked upon as the Arnold Palmer of golf in Japan with his powerful swing, charisma and sense of style, often wearing silk shirts and baggy pants. And his skill was not limited to just golf. He played the guitar and had three songs reach the pop charts in Japan, according to the Hall of Fame.",
      "His first love was baseball, and he spent three years pitching professionally before turning to golf. That was evident when Ryo Ishikawa, who won his first Japan Golf Tour title at age 15, spoke of Ozaki\u2019s influence. Ishikawa said he would visit Ozaki about 10 times a year to get advice.",

      "Ozaki traveled with an entourage when he did play outside Japan in the majors, usually renting a house and brining a sushi chef so his people would feel at home.",
      "He has two younger brothers who also played on tour, Naomichi (Joe) and Tateo (Jet).",

      "Lawyers for Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier are asking a judge to throw out sports gambling charges that have kept him off the court this season",
      "NEW YORK -- Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier \u2019s lawyers are asking a judge to throw out sports gambling charges that have kept him off the court this season, arguing that the government overreached by turning a private dispute over bettors\u2019 use of nonpublic information into a federal case.",
      "In a motion to dismiss made public on Tuesday, Rozier\u2019s lawyers argued that the government\u2019s theory of the case \u2014 that he prevented sportsbooks from making informed decisions about accepting certain bets \u2014 runs afoul of a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that narrowed the federal wire fraud statute.",
      "Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn allege that Rozier, 31, helped gamblers cash in by tipping off a friend that he would leave a March 2023 game early because of a supposed injury. The friend, Deniro \u201cNiro\u201d Laster, who is also charged, shared or sold the information to others, who placed more than $250,000 in prop bets, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cThe government has billed this case as involving \u2018insider betting\u2019 and \u2018rigging\u2019 professional basketball games,\" Rozier\u2019s lawyers, James M. Trusty and A. Jeff Ifrah, wrote in the motion. \u201cBut the indictment alleges something less headline-worthy: that some bettors broke certain sportsbooks\u2019 terms of use against wagering based on non-public information and \u2018straw betting.\u2019\u201d",
      "Rozier was on the Charlotte Hornets at the time and the information about his early exit was not listed on the team\u2019s injury report, nor was it shared with the public or the sportsbooks that accept wagers on NBA games and player performances, prosecutors said.",
      "Rozier pleaded not guilty on Dec. 8 to wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy charges. He was released on $3 million bond and is due back in court for a hearing before U.S. District Judge LaShann DeArcy Hall on March 3.",
      "His charges were part of a sweep of more than 30 other people in a takedown of two sprawling gambling operations: one that authorities said leaked inside information about NBA athletes and another involving rigged, Mafia-backed poker games.",
      "The charges have raised questions about the integrity of NBA games in an era of legalized betting and myriad prop bets, prompting the league to tweak its injury reporting requirements.",
      "A spokesperson for the federal prosecutors' office in Brooklyn declined to comment on Rozier\u2019s motion.",

      "In the motion, Rozier\u2019s lawyers wrote that under the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling in United States v. Ciminelli, prosecutors can't make a wire fraud case out of allegations that defendants conspired to deprive a person \u2014 or, in this case, sportsbooks \u2014 of the right to information needed to make discretionary economic decisions.",
      "They also questioned whether federal prosecutors have the authority to bring such a case, since sportsbooks are regulated at the state level, not the federal level.",
      "\u201cThis is not to say that sports betting platforms are without recourse when their terms of use are violated \u2014 they can void bets, pursue civil remedies, or seek state prosecutor involvement,\u201d Trusty and Ifrah wrote in the motion, which was dated Dec. 12 but only posted to the case docket on Tuesday. \u201cBut Ciminelli puts to rest the notion that federal prosecutors are here to enforce contractual agreements between bettors and platforms.\u201d",
      "Rozier has earned about $160 million over a 10-year NBA career. He was a first-round pick for the Boston Celtics in 2015 after starring at the University of Louisville. Charlotte traded him to the Heat last year.",
      "In the game in question, Rozier played the first nine minutes and 36 seconds against the New Orleans Pelicans before leaving, citing a foot issue. He did not play again that season.",
      "Rozier\u2019s lawyers noted that the indictment does not allege that he ever placed a bet on any NBA game, nor does it allege that he knew Laster intended to sell his tip to others or that using it to place wagers would violate the sportsbooks\u2019 terms of service. And, they said, he really was injured.",
      "\u201cThe government\u2019s cynicism as to whether Mr. Rozier was injured is belied by a variety of witnesses and medical professionals who were aware of Rozier\u2019s injury, in many cases before the Pelicans game,\u201d Trusty and Ifrah wrote.",

      "Here\u2019s the catch: They each have one more fight and need to avoid a surprise before their expected showdown.",
      "Inoue (31-0, 27 KOs) is the undisputed super bantamweight (122 lbs) champion and the headliner Saturday in Saudi Arabia. He faces Mexico\u2019s Alan David Picasso (32-0-1, 17 KOs). Nakatani (31-0, 24 KOs), moving up in weight to make his debut in the division, faces Sebastian Hernandez Reyes (20-0, 18 KOs) \u2014 also Mexican \u2014 on the same card, a showcase of Japanese fighters.",

      "The buildup to the Riyadh event, billed as the \u201cNight of the Samurai,\u201d has been as much about Inoue-Nakatani as it has about their respective opponents Saturday. At a press event last month, promoters sat Inoue and Nakatani next to each other and made sure they were the last two off the stage during the photo session. The pair didn\u2019t exchange chitchat or handshakes.",
      "\u201cPersonally, I have no contact or connection with him,\u201d the 32-year-old Inoue said. \u201cOf course, I value his boxing, that\u2019s why I\u2019m looking forward to fighting him.\u201d",

Luis Nery stunned a Tokyo Dome crowd in May 2024 when he sent Inoue to the canvas in the first round. One year later, Ramon Cardenas dropped Inoue in the second round in Las Vegas.",
      "Inoue's promoters made sure the Las Vegas fight was on ESPN rather than pay-per-view to expose him to a wider US audience. Bob Arum, Inoue\u2019s promoter at Top Rank, had said he wants Inoue to reach Shohei Ohtani-level fame.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t view it as a budding rivalry,\u201d San Antonio coach Mitch Johnson said of Oklahoma City. \u201cOur group\u2019s been together 25-some-odd games. That team won 16 games in the playoffs (last season) to win a championship. I don\u2019t want to disrespect their program and what they\u2019ve built. We are trying to build something and we\u2019re chasing every other single team in this league.\u201d",

      "\u201cI think it would have been a great game to watch,\u201d Spurs star Victor Wembanyama said. \u201cI\u2019ll watch it again.\u201d",
      "Wembanyama almost watched the game from the best seat in sold-out Frost Bank Center.",
      "The 7-foot-3 center was downgraded to questionable on Monday as he continues to rehabilitate from a strained left calf that kept him out for 12 games. He was cleared to play a half hour before tipoff and came off the bench for the sixth straight time since returning.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a really, really good player, but he\u2019s not their whole team at all,\u201d Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of good guys, they\u2019ve got good balance, they\u2019re well coached. They were super sharp tonight. They played with a great sense of purpose and they executed really well.\u201d",
      "The Spurs have had seven different players lead the team in scoring during their longest winning streak since 2015.",
      "\u201cWe get it done by committee,\u201d Keldon Johnson said. \u201cEach night it could be somebody different and it has been someone different each and every night. Knowing we have that luxury, that we can have multiple guys that can have a night, but we all understand the team aspect of it that if someone has it going, we\u2019ve got to get him the ball.\u201d",

      "A virtual trip to her childhood neighborhood in New York City's Queens borough helped sell Sue Livingstone, 84, on the merits of the VR technology even though she still is able to get out more often than many residents of The Terraces, which is located in Silicon Valley about 55 miles south of San Francisco.",
      "\u201cIt isn't just about being able to see it again, it's about all the memories that it brings back,\u201d Livingstone said. \u201cThere are a few people living here who never really leave their comfort zones. But if you could entice them to come down to try out a headset, they might find that they really enjoy it.\u201d",
      "Adrian Marshall, The Terraces' community life director, said that once word about a VR experience spreads from one resident to another, more of the uninitiated typically become curious enough to try it out \u2014 even if it means missing out on playing Mexican Train, a dominoes-like board game that's popular in the community.",
      "\u201cIt turns into a conversation starter for them. It really does connect people,\u201d Marshall said of Rendever's VR programming. \u201cIt helps create a human bridge that makes them realize they share certain similarities and interests. It turns the artificial world into reality.\u201d",
      "Rendever, a privately owned company based in Somerville, Massachusetts, hopes to build upon its senior living platform with a recent grant from the National Institutes of Health that will provide nearly $4.5 million to study ways to reduce social isolation among seniors living at home and their caregivers.",
      "Some studies have found VR programming presented in a limited viewing format can help older people maintain and improve cognitive functions, burnish memories and foster social connections with their families and fellow residents of care facilities. Experts say the technology may be useful as an addition to and not a replacement for other activities.",
      "\u201cThere is always a risk of too much screen time,\" Katherine \u201cKate\u201d Dupuis, a neuropsychologist and professor who studies aging issues at Sheridan College in Canada, said. \u201cBut if you use it cautiously, with meaning and purpose, it can be very helpful. It can be an opportunity for the elderly to engage with someone and share a sense of wonder.\u201d",

      "VR headsets may be an easier way for older people to interact with technology instead of fumbling around with a smartphone or another device that requires navigating buttons or other mechanisms, said Pallabi Bhowmick, a researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who is examining the use of VR with older adults.",
      "\u201cThe stereotypes that older adults aren\u2019t willing to try new technology needs to change because they are willing and want to adapt to technologies that are meaningful to them,\u201d Bhowmick said. \"Besides helping them to relieve stress, be entertained and connect with other people, there is an intergenerational aspect that might help them build their relationships with younger people who find out they use VR and say, \u2018Grandpa is cool!\u2019\"",
      "Rendever CEO Kyle Rand's interest in helping his own grandmother deal with the emotional and mental challenges of aging pushed him down a path that led him to cofound the company in 2016 after studying neuroengineering at Duke University.",
      "\u201cWhat really fascinates me about humans is just how much our brain depends on social connection and how much we learn from others,\u201d Rand said. \u201cA group of elderly residents who don't really know each other that well can come together, spend 30 minutes in a VR experience together and then find themselves sitting down to have lunch together while continuing a conversation about the experience.\u201d",
      "It's a large enough market that another VR specialist, Dallas-based Mynd Immersive, competes against Rendever with services tailored for senior living communities.",
      "Besides helping create social connections, the VR programming from both Rendever and Mynd has been employed as a possible tool for potentially slowing down the deleterious effects of dementia. That's how another Silicon Valley retirement village, the Forum, sometimes uses the technology.",
      "Bob Rogallo, a Forum resident with dementia that has rendered him speechless, seemed to be enjoying taking a virtual hike through Glacier National Park in Montana as he nodded and smiled while celebrating his 83rd birthday with his wife of 61 years.",

      "In another session at the Forum, 93-year-old Almut Schultz laughed with delight while viewing a virtual classical music performance at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado and later seemed to want to play with a puppy frolicking around in her VR headset.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday it was replacing its longstanding lottery system for H-1B work visas with a new approach that prioritizes skilled, higher-paid foreign workers.",
      "The change follows a series of actions by the Trump administration aimed at reshaping a visa program that critics say has become a pipeline for overseas workers willing to work for lower pay, but supporters say drives innovation.",
      "\u201cThe existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by U.S. employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,\u201d said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Matthew Tragesser.",
      "Earlier this year, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 annual H-1B visa fee on highly skilled workers, which is being challenged in court. The president also rolled out a $1 million \u201cgold card\u201d visa as a pathway to U.S. citizenship for wealthy individuals.",
      "A press release announcing the new rule says it is \u201cin line with other key changes the administration has made, such as the Presidential Proclamation that requires employers to pay an additional $100,000 per visa as a condition of eligibility.\u201d",
      "Historically, H-1B visas have been awarded through a lottery system. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient, with more than 10,000 visas approved, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, Microsoft, Apple and Google. California has the highest concentration of H-1B workers.",

It will go into effect Feb. 27, 2026, and will apply to the upcoming H-1B cap registration season.",

      "Critics argue that the visas often go to entry-level positions rather than senior roles requiring specialized skills. While the program is intended to prevent wage suppression or the displacement of U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay lower wages by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even when the workers hired have more experience.",

      "NATO-nation intelligence services believe Russia is developing a weapon to target Starlink satellites",
      "Two NATO-nation intelligence services suspect Russia is developing a new anti-satellite weapon to target Elon Musk's Starlink constellation with destructive orbiting clouds of shrapnel, with the aim of reining in Western space superiority that has helped Ukraine on the battlefield.",
      "Intelligence findings seen by The Associated Press say the so-called \u201czone-effect\u201d weapon would seek to flood Starlink orbits with hundreds of thousands of high-density pellets, potentially disabling multiple satellites at once but also risking catastrophic collateral damage to other orbiting systems.",
      "Analysts who haven't seen the findings say they doubt such a weapon could work without causing uncontrollable chaos in space for companies and countries, including Russia and its ally China, that rely on thousands of orbiting satellites for communications, defense and other vital needs.",
      "Such repercussions, including risks to its own space systems, could steer Moscow away from deploying or using such a weapon, analysts said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t buy it. Like, I really don\u2019t,\u201d said Victoria Samson, a space-security specialist at the Secure World Foundation who leads the Colorado-based nongovernmental organization\u2019s annual study of anti-satellite systems. \u201cI would be very surprised, frankly, if they were to do something like that.\u201d",
      "But the commander of the Canadian military's Space Division, Brig. Gen. Christopher Horner, said such Russian work cannot be ruled out in light of previous U.S. allegations that Russia also has been pursuing an indiscriminate nuclear, space-based weapon.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve been briefed on that type of system. But it\u2019s not implausible,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the reporting on the nuclear weapons system is accurate and that they\u2019re willing to develop that and willing to go to that end, well it wouldn\u2019t strike me as shocking that something just short of that, but equally damaging, is within their wheelhouse of development.\u201d",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov didn't respond to messages from the AP seeking comment. Russia has previously called for United Nations efforts to stop the orbital deployment of weapons and President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow has no intention of deploying nuclear space weapons.",
      "The intelligence findings were shown to the AP on condition that the services involved were not identified and the news organization was not able to independently verify the findings' conclusions.",
      "The U.S. Space Force didn't respond to e-mailed questions. The French military's Space Command said in a statement to the AP that it could not comment on the findings but said, \u201cWe can inform you that Russia has, in recent years, been multiplying irresponsible, dangerous, and even hostile actions in space.\u201d",
      "Russia views Starlink in particular as a grave threat, the findings indicate. The thousands of low-orbiting satellites have been pivotal for Ukraine\u2019s survival against Russia's full-scale invasion, now in its fourth year.",
      "Starlink's high-speed internet service is used by Ukrainian forces for battlefield communications, weapons targeting and other roles and by civilians and government officials where Russian strikes have affected communications.",
      "Russian officials repeatedly have warned that commercial satellites serving Ukraine's military could be legitimate targets. This month, Russia said it has fielded a new ground-based missile system, the S-500, which is capable of hitting low-orbit targets.",
      "Unlike a missile that Russia tested in 2021 to destroy a defunct Cold War-era satellite, the new weapon in development would target multiple Starlinks at once, with pellets possibly released by yet-to-be launched formations of small satellites, the intelligence findings say.",
      "Canada's Horner said it is hard to see how clouds of pellets could be corralled to only strike Starlink and that debris from such an attack could get \u201cout of control in a hurry.\u201d",
      "\"You blow up a box full of BBs,\u201d he said. Doing that would \u201cblanket an entire orbital regime and take out every Starlink satellite and every other satellite that\u2019s in a similar regime. And I think that\u2019s the part that is incredibly troubling.\u201d",
      "The findings seen by the AP didn't say when Russia might be capable of deploying such a system nor detail whether it has been tested or how far along research is believed to be.",
      "The system is in active development and information about the timing of an expected deployment is too sensitive to share, according to an official familiar with the findings and other related intelligence that the AP did not see.

      "After such an attack, pellets and debris would over time fall back toward Earth, possibly damaging other orbiting systems on their way down, analysts say.",
      "Starlink's orbits are about 550 kilometers (340 miles) above the planet. China\u2019s Tiangong space station and the International Space Station operate at lower orbits, \u201cso both would face risks,\u201d according to Swope.",
      "The space chaos that such a weapon could cause might enable Moscow to threaten its adversaries without actually having to use it, Swope said.",

      "Instacart is ending a program where customers saw different prices for the same product ordered at the same time from the same store",
      "NEW YORK -- Instacart said Monday that it\u2019s ending a program where some customers saw different prices for the same product ordered at the same time from the same store when using the delivery company\u2019s service.",
      "The program was meant to help grocers and other retailers learn more about what kinds of prices customers would pay for items, similar to how stores offer different prices for the same products at different locations. But it raised alarms after a report from Consumer Reports and two progressive advocacy groups, Groundwork Collaborative and More Perfect Union, said Instacart offered nearly three out of every four grocery items to shoppers at multiple prices in an experiment.",
      "\u201cAt a time when families are working exceptionally hard to stretch every grocery dollar, those tests raised concerns, leaving some people questioning the prices they see on Instacart,\u201d the company said in a Monday blog post. \u201cThat\u2019s not okay \u2013 especially for a company built on trust, transparency, and affordability.\u201d",
      "Retailers will continue to set their own prices on the delivery website and they may still offer different prices at different brick-and-mortar locations, Instacart said, but \u201cfrom now on, Instacart will not support any item price testing services.\u201d",
      "Instacart said these services were neither \u201c dynamic pricing,\u201d a system where the price for something can go up when demand is high, nor \u201csurveillance pricing,\u201d where prices can be set based on a user's income, shopping history or other personal information. Instead, the company said it was offered to customers at random.",
      "Some customers would simply see a slightly higher price for an item, while others would see a slightly lower price. The experiment by Consumer Reports and the two progressive advocacy groups, for example, found that Instacart customers saw one of five different prices for the same dozen of Lucerne eggs from a Safeway store in Washington, D.C.: $3.99, $4.28, $4.59, $4.69, or $4.79.",

      "Christian influencers are reaching hundreds of thousands of young people online",
      "ATLANTA -- Millennial and Generation Z Christian influencers are increasingly filling a void in American religion, growing audiences across digital platforms by steering young people to biblical answers to tough questions that aren't always answered in Sunday sermons.",
      "\u201cI can be that in-between \u2014 Monday to Saturday help \u2014 to give you practical things to make you feel like you\u2019re not walking this walk alone,\u201d said Megan Ashley, 35, sitting cross-legged in sweats on the couch where she records her \u201cIn Totality\u201d podcast.",
      "From myriad backgrounds, these influencers talk candidly to their listeners about everything from anxieties and doubts to dating and culture, delving into the Bible\u2019s complexities. Those of faith say Christian influencers are galvanizing young people looking for meaning in a culture that lacks it at a time when years of declining church attendance has slowed.",
      "\u201cWhat they\u2019re making accessible is a truth that transforms people,\u201d said Lecrae Moore, a Christian rapper and podcaster. \u201cThere\u2019s something that\u2019s happening existentially \u2014 supernaturally \u2014 that I can\u2019t explain.\u201d",
      "Ashley and Moore are among a half-dozen popular influencers who described their work for this story. With and without formal theological they training, they describe themselves as churchgoers who don\u2019t want their messages boxed in by denominational labels.",
      "Some grew up in church; others didn\u2019t, but they commonly describe experiencing a spiritual transformation that came out of hardship or a sense of emptiness they pin on secular lifestyles.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re like, listen, we\u2019re two mess-ups too. It\u2019s OK,\u201d said Arielle Reitsma, 36, co-host of podcast \u201cGirls Gone Bible,\u201d which gets more than a million listens or streams each month.",
      "These algorithm-savvy podcasters fit comfortably in a long tradition of Christian celebrities, said Zachary Sheldon, a Baylor University lecturer on media, religion and culture who cited televangelist Billy Graham as an example. Working independently, they can harness audiences more easily than established congregations and media organizations can.",
      "\u201cExposing people to the faith and challenging them to ask questions and search for something more\u201d are really good things to do, Sheldon said. But he pointed to \u201cpotential dangers in granting them too much authority on the basis of their celebrity and their acumen with social media.\u201d",
      "These influencers encourage church attendance and describe reaching a variety of people, including those who have been particularly disconnected from religion, which polls show is a growing number of young Americans. Only 41% of people ages 18-35 surveyed in 2023-24 said they believe in God with certainty, down from 65% in 2007, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "\u201cPeople are spiritually hungry, emotionally hungry, and I think for the first time ever \u2026 people are encountering Jesus even through online platforms, and they\u2019re realizing, this is true life and fulfillment,\u201d said Angela Halili, 29, Reitsma's co-host.",
      "The pair now draws live crowds since starting the podcast more than two years ago. At an event in Atlanta, they warned hundreds of fans against idolizing work or relationships, Bibles in hand, and recounted their days as Hollywood actors battling addiction, heartbreak and mental health disorders. Halili said God brought them \u201cradical healing,\u201d and they want listeners to know that God can perform \u201cmiracles\u201d in their lives, too.",
      "Afterward, they hugged and prayed for people in the audience, where Anna Williams, 17, said she considers both Reitsma and Halili to be \u201ca big sister\u201d in her life.",
      "Even as they espouse biblical principles as guidance toward true joy, influencers say that being Christian can be hard.",
      "God \u201cdoes make everything better, but that doesn\u2019t always come in the way that we think it\u2019s gonna come,\u201d said \u201cIn Totality\u201d host Ashley.",
      "Her current obsession, which she teaches with fervor, is a biblical passage about living as a sacrifice. God asks people to give up certain wants and behaviors so they can grow closer to him, Ashley says. She said her intensity grew after a healing encounter with God\u2019s \u201cseverity\u201d as a freshly divorced single mom plagued by suicidal thoughts and depression.",
      "Bible passages, day-to-day plights and heavier challenges are covered on \u201cWith the Perrys,\u201d a podcast led by husband and wife authors and spoken-word artists who also run a streetwear brand.",

      "She is an admired speaker who is working towards her seminary degree and wrote a book about leaving behind same-sex relationships. She and husband Preston Perry, 39, started podcasting in 2019. Followers already resonated with Perry's theological debates and story of growing up around poverty and violence before finding faith and becoming a Christian evangelist.",
      "\u201cGod calls us to ruffle feathers sometimes, to speak to culture,\u201d Perry said.",
      "In a recent episode, the Perrys urged listeners to be honest with God about struggling to trust him. Through focused prayer, obedience and Bible reading, God brings lasting peace, answers and growth during hard circumstances, they say, but this requires more than quick fixes like scrolling and sex.",
      "At just 22, Bryce Crawford teaches Bible chapters on his self-named podcast and posts videos of himself talking to people about Christianity at Pride parades, the Burning Man counter-culture festival and a satanic temple.",
      "Rather than shout \u201crepent,\u201d Crawford\u2019s street evangelism aims to change minds through kindness. His followers say they're attracted by his empathetic yet bold demeanor while delivering talking points against lifestyles such as same-sex marriage.",
      "\u201cMy issue with \u2018repent or burn in hell\u2019 is that people get frustrated because they don\u2019t know why you\u2019re telling them that,\u201d said Crawford, who describes being severely anxious and bitter toward God until God healed him at a Waffle House. \u201cOur tactics have been one-on-one conversations, calmly listening, asking questions because we care about them, and in that explaining our worldview.\u201d",
      "These influencers acknowledge that online Christianity has its challenges.",
      "A hyperfocus on online drama and Christianity's more esoteric beliefs can miss the basics, such as love and Christ's sacrifice, Hill Perry said. She worries that \u201csimply talking about gentleness or respect or kindness or patience is gonna be boring\u201d to people.",
      "And the deep political and cultural rifts among Christians emerge online too.",
      "For example, Halili and Reitsma got pushback for taking the opportunity to pray at a pre-inauguration rally for President Donald Trump. The Perrys have been criticized by conservatives for talking about police brutality and racial injustice, and liberals for expressing opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion.",
      "Some followers say these influencers provide a welcome alternative to the buttoned-up pastors they grew up with who spoke of God as a faraway deity that would reject them for breaking too many rules.",
      "\u201cI really needed someone who was a younger Black female portraying something that wasn\u2019t super traditional,\u201d said Olivia Singleton, 24. She's involved with her church and likes her pastor, but feels like these influencers are like \u201cone of the girls \u2026 walking out the faith with you.\u201d",

      "A federal judge's ruling allows Hawaii's new tourist tax, which includes a levy on cruise ship passengers, to take effect in 2026",
      "HONOLULU -- A federal judge\u2019s ruling has cleared the way for Hawaii to include cruise ship passengers in a new tourist tax to help cope with climate change, a levy set to go into effect at the start of 2026.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jill A. Otake denied a request Tuesday that sought to stop officials from enforcing the new law on cruises.",
      "In the nation\u2019s first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually.",
      "The levy increases rates on hotel room and vacation rental stays but also imposes a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship\u2019s passengers, starting next year, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports.",
      "Cruise Lines International Association challenged the tax in a lawsuit, along with a Honolulu company that provides supplies and provisions to cruise ships and tour businesses out of Kauai and the Big Island that rely on cruise ship passengers. Among their arguments is that the new law violates the Constitution by taxing cruise ships for the privilege of entering Hawaii ports.",
      "Plaintiff lawyers also argued that the tax would hurt tourism by making cruises more expensive. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",
      "\u201cCruise tourism generates nearly $1 billion in total economic impact for Hawai\u2018i and supports thousands of local jobs, and we remain focused on ensuring that success continues on a lawful, sustainable foundation,\u201d association spokesperson Jim McCarthy said in a statement.",

      "The judge declared a mistrial on the final charge, alleging Weinstein raped former actor Jessica Mann, after the jury foreperson declined to deliberate further.",
      "Weinstein has not yet been sentenced as a judge weighs a defense request to throw out the verdict after two jurors told Weinstein\u2019s lawyers that other jurors had bullied them into convicting him. Judge Curtis Farber is expected to rule on Jan. 8.",

After they chatted, she testified, Weinstein told her he had a script to show her in his hotel room, and she went up with him. There, she said, Weinstein pushed her onto a bed and assaulted her.",
      "After the trial, Kaja Sokola criticized her sister's testimony, saying that though she was called as a prosecution witness, she ended up serving Weinstein's cause by providing his lawyers with a journal in which she wrote about the men who had sexually assaulted her in her life but did not include Weinstein.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Kaja Sokola repeatedly characterized her sister's testimony as a personal \u201cbetrayal\" and falsely accused her of omitting journals in which she described what happened with Weinstein.",
      "The lawsuit also said Kaja Sokola had falsely accused Ewa Sokola of homicide, theft, falsification of medical records, sexual impropriety and immoral conduct, and of colluding with Weinstein's defense team.",
      "The lawsuit said Kaja Sokola's false claims have cost Ewa Sokola referrals and led to a reduction in patients and employees for her medical practice while damaging her professional reputation and her standing within the medical community.",

      "The men have repeatedly said they were physically and psychologically tortured while at the notorious Salvadoran prison.",

    "story": [
      "Hawaii's Big Island is banning people from feeding feral cats in an effort to protect native species, including an endangered goose",
      "KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii -- Throngs of feral cats emerge from the shade of parked trucks and bushes as soon as the familiar Subaru Forester pulls into a dump on Hawaii's Big Island. They run after the vehicle to a certain meal \u2014 a gravy train that might not be around much longer.",
      "A Hawaii County law set to take effect at the start of the new year bans feeding feral animals on county property. It's an effort to protect native species, such as an endangered goose called the nene, from a super predator introduced to the islands by Europeans in the 18th century.",
      "But the measure doesn't sit well with many cat lovers, including the driver of the Subaru, Liz Swan, who has been feeding feral felines on the Big Island for 33 years.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe the cats should be exterminated at the expense of the nene,\u201d Swan said. \u201cThey\u2019re both living creatures.\u201d",
      "It's unclear how many feral cats \u2014 abandoned pets and their descendants \u2014 live on the Big Island. Estimates range well into the tens of thousands, with pockets of dense colonies supported by people. Opponents of the ban say it will hamper their efforts to contain the population by trapping and neutering the animals \u2014 and that hungry cats will then have to hunt for food.",
      "About 200 cats live at the Kealakehe Transfer Station and Recycling Center, not far from the bustling tourist district of Kona. Swan shows up every late afternoon with water and kibble, and says she's never seen a nene anywhere near the dump. Despite living amid trash, the cats there generally appear robust, most of them missing the tip of an ear, indicating they\u2019ve been spayed or neutered.",
      "The cats threaten the native species directly \u2014 by killing them \u2014 and indirectly, biologists say. Food left out for the cats can attract native animals, bringing them into closer contact with humans. Cat feces can also spread a parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, a disease that has killed endangered Hawaiian monk seals and native birds.",
      "Last year, a male nene \u2014 pronounced \u201cneh-neh\u201d \u2014 was struck and killed by a car as it crossed a road in Hilo, on the eastern side of the island, to reach a cat feeding station. The goose's surviving mate, which also had a gosling die of toxoplasmosis in 2024, has recently taken on another partner and is nesting in a Hilo park, the state Department of Land and Natural Resources announced this month.",
      "The county's feeding ban will help protect them, the department said.",
      "State wildlife biologist Raymond McGuire recently checked for nene nesting sites among the barren black-rock fields near a shopping center at the Waikoloa resort. It's not their traditional habitat, but he has seen the geese fly in to grab food \u2014 risking getting hit by cars \u2014 and last year some nested there.",
      "As he approached, a pair of feline eyes peered out of a crack in the lava rock. Cats emerged from their nooks, perhaps mistaking him for someone who might offer food.",
      "McGuire was relieved to see there were no nene nearby \u2014 but frustrated with evidence the cats are being fed: empty water bowls and aluminum pans.",
      "He's a cat owner \u2014 \"my favorite animal is a cat\" \u2014 but as a Hawaiian whose love of nature inspired him to pursue conservation work, he believes there is no room for them where native species are struggling to survive.",
      "\u201cThere's so many birds that my kids will never see, that I got to see,\u201d he said, referring to native forest birds. \u201cI think about my ancestors and I do wonder: Are we honoring them well in what we do? Because they did take steps to protect them.\u201d",
      "Feral cats are a problem in many places, but Hawaii's sensitive ecosystem is full of species that evolved without mammalian predators, making them especially vulnerable, McGuire said.",
      "Hawaiian culture is closely tied to Hawaii\u2019s animals; aumakua, or ancestral spirit guides, can take animal form, noted Big Island Mayor Kimo Alameda. His family's aumakua is the shark, he said.",

      "The patriotic touches at this year's Times Square gathering, including a second confetti drop, will offer an early glimpse of what\u2019s ahead: hundreds of events and programs, big and small, planned nationwide to mark the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m telling you right now, whatever you\u2019re imagining, it\u2019s going to be much more than that,\u201d said America250 Chair Rosie Rios, who oversees the bipartisan commission created by Congress in 2016 to organize the semiquincentennial anniversary. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be one for the ages, the most inspirational celebration this country and maybe the world has ever seen.\u201d",
      "Rios and her group worked with the Times Square Alliance business district and One Times Square, the building from where the ball is dropped, to make the changes to this year's ceremonies. They're also planning a second ball drop July 3, the eve of the nation's birthday, \u201cin the same beautiful style that Times Square knows how to do it,\" Rios said.",
      "It will mark the first time in 120 years there will be ball drop in Times Square that doesn't occur on New Year's Eve, she said.",
      "A New Year\u2019s Eve ball was first dropped in Times Square in 1907. Built by a young immigrant metalworker named Jacob Starr, the 700-pound (318-kilogram), 5-foot- (1.5-meter-) diameter ball was made of iron and wood and featured 100 25-watt light bulbs. Last year, the Constellation Ball, the ninth and largest version, was unveiled. It measured about 12 feet (3.7 meters) in diameter and weighs nearly 12,000 pounds (5,400 kilograms).",
      "The only years no ball drop occurred were 1942 and 1943, when the city instituted a nightly \u201cdimout\u201d during World War II to protect itself from attacks. Crowds instead celebrated the new year with a moment of silence followed by chimes rung from the base of One Times Square.",

      "A federal judge is halting the enforcement of a March presidential memorandum that revoked the security clearance of a prominent Washington attorney",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a March presidential memorandum to revoke the security clearance of prominent Washington attorney Mark Zaid, ruling that the order \u2014 which also targeted 14 other individuals \u2014 could not be applied to him.",
      "The decision marked the administration\u2019s second legal setback on Tuesday, after the Supreme Court declined to allow Trump to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area, capping a first year in office in which President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to impose a sweeping agenda and pursue retribution against political adversaries have been repeatedly slowed by the courts.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali in Washington granted Zaid's request for a preliminary injunction, after he sued the Trump administration in May over the revocation of his security clearance. Zaid's request called it an act of \u201cimproper political retribution\u201d that jeopardized his ability to continue representing clients in sensitive national security cases.",
      "The March presidential memorandum singled out Zaid and 14 other individuals who the White House asserted were unsuitable to retain their clearances because it was \u201cno longer in the national interest.\u201d The list included targets of Trump\u2019s fury from both the political and legal spheres, including former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, New York Attorney General Letitia James, former President Joe Biden and members of his family.",
      "The action was part of a much broader retribution campaign that Trump has waged since returning to the White House, including directing specific Justice Department investigations against perceived adversaries and issuing sweeping executive orders targeting law firms over legal work he does not like.",
      "In August, the Trump administration said it was revoking the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials. Ordering the revocation of clearances has been a favored retributive tactic that Trump has wielded \u2014 or at least tried to \u2014 against high-profile political figures, lawyers and intelligence officials in his second term.",
      "Zaid said in his lawsuit that he has represented clients across the political spectrum over nearly 35 years, including government officials, law enforcement and military officials and whistleblowers. In 2019, he represented an intelligence community whistleblower whose account of a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy helped set the stage for the first of two impeachment cases against Trump in his first term.",

      "Zaid said in a statement, \u201cThis is not just a victory for me, it\u2019s an indictment of the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to intimidate and silence the legal community, especially lawyers who represent people who dare to question or hold this government accountable.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- Lawyers for hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs urged a federal appeals court in New York late Tuesday to order his immediate release from prison and reverse his conviction on prostitution-related charges or direct his trial judge to lighten his four-year sentence.",
      "The lawyers said in a filing with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan that Combs was treated harshly at sentencing by a federal judge who let evidence surrounding charges he was acquitted of unjustly influence the punishment.",
      "Combs, 56, incarcerated at a federal prison in New Jersey and scheduled for release in May 2028, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking at a trial that ended in July. Combs was convicted under the Mann Act, which bans transporting people across state lines for any sexual crime.",
      "Lawyers for Combs said Judge Arun Subramanian acted like a \u201cthirteenth juror\u201d in October when he sentenced Combs to four years and two months in prison. They said he erred by letting evidence surrounding the acquitted charges influence the sentence he imposed.",
      "They noted that Combs was convicted of two lesser counts, prostitution offenses that didn\u2019t require force, fraud, or coercion. They asked the appeals court, which has not yet heard oral arguments, to acquit Combs, order his immediate release from prison or direct Subramanian to reduce his sentence.",
      "\u201cDefendants typically get sentenced to less than 15 months for these offenses \u2014 even when coercion, which the jury didn\u2019t find here, is involved,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",
      "\u201cThe judge defied the jury\u2019s verdict and found Combs \u2018coerced,\u2019 \u2018exploited,\u2019 and \u2018forced\u2019 his girlfriends to have sex and led a criminal conspiracy. These judicial findings trumped the verdict and led to the highest sentence ever imposed for any remotely similar defendant,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",

      "In a rare public exchange between diplomats from the two countries, U.S. Mission counselor Morgan Ortagus, a Trump ally and former State Department spokesperson, said, \u201cThe United States remains available for formal talks with Iran but only if Tehran is prepared for direct and meaningful dialogue.\u201d",
      "Ortagus said Trump extended \u201cthe hand of diplomacy\u201d to Iran during both of his administrations.",
      "\u201cBut instead of taking that hand of diplomacy, you continue to put your hand in the fire,\u201d she said, looking directly at Iravani. \u201cStep away from the fire, sir, and take President Trump\u2019s hand of diplomacy. It\u2019s extended to you.\u201d",
      "She stressed, however, that the Trump administration has been clear that there can be no enrichment of nuclear material inside Iran, a major point of contention.",

      "NEW YORK -- A federal judge gave a green light Tuesday to New York\u2019s so-called Green Light Law, rejecting the Trump administration\u2019s bid to stop the state from giving people driver's licenses without having them prove they are in the country legally.",
      "U.S. District Judge Anne M. Nardacci in Albany ruled that the Republican administration \u2014 which challenged the law under President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration \u2014 had failed to support its claims that the state law usurps federal law or that it unlawfully regulates or unlawfully discriminates against the federal government.",
      "The Justice Department sued the state over the law in February, naming Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state\u2019s attorney general, Letitia James, as defendants. At a news conference announcing the lawsuit, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi accused the officials, both Democrats, of prioritizing \u201cillegal aliens over American citizens.\u201d",

      "A message seeking comment was left for the Justice Department.",
      "Nardacci, appointed to the bench by President Joe Biden, a Democrat, wrote that her job was not to evaluate the desirability of the Green Light Law as a policy matter. Rather, she said in a 23-page opinion, it was to assess whether the Trump administration\u2019s arguments established that the law violates the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause, which gives federal laws precedence over state laws.",

      "The Green Light Law was enacted partly to improve public safety on the roads, as people without licenses sometimes drove without one, or without having passed a road test. The state also makes it easier for holders of such licenses to get auto insurance, thus cutting down on crashes involving uninsured drivers.",
      "Under the law, people who don\u2019t have a valid Social Security number can submit alternative forms of ID that include valid passports and driver\u2019s licenses issued in other countries. Applicants must still get a permit and pass a road test to qualify for a \u201cstandard driver\u2019s license.\u201d It does not apply to commercial driver\u2019s licenses.",
      "The Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit sought to strike down the law as \u201ca frontal assault on the federal immigration laws, and the federal authorities that administer them.\u201d It highlighted a provision that requires the state\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner to inform people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information.",
      "In 2020, during Trump\u2019s first term, his administration sought to pressure New York into changing the law by barring anyone from the state from enrolling in trusted traveler programs, meaning they would spend longer amounts of time going through security lines at airports.",
      "The governor at the time, Andrew Cuomo, offered to restore federal access to driving records on a limited basis, but said he wouldn\u2019t let immigration agents see lists of people who had applied for the special licenses available to immigrants who couldn\u2019t prove legal residency in the U.S. The administration ultimately restored New Yorkers\u2019 access to the trusted traveler program after a brief legal fight.",
      "In the lawsuit rejected Tuesday, the administration argued that it could be easier to enforce federal immigration priorities if federal authorities had unfettered access to New York\u2019s driver information. Nardacci, echoing a 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in a county clerk\u2019s earlier challenge to the law, wrote that such information \u201cremains available to federal immigration authorities\u201d through a lawful court order or judicial warrant.",

      "GiveDirectly got $50 gift cards out to SNAP recipients during last month\u2019s shutdown through a new approach to cash assistance",
      "Finances already looked tight for Jade Grant and her three children as she entered the year's final months.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s birthday is back-to-back,\u201d the 32-year-old certified nursing assistant said. \u201cYou have holidays coming up. You have Thanksgiving. Everything is right there. And then, boom. No (food) stamps.\u201d",
      "Grant is among the nearly 42 million lower-income Americans who get help buying groceries from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. When the federal shutdown began in October, she wasn't worried about losing her benefits \u2014 she said she is used to government \u201cfoolishness.\u201d",
      "But circumstances got dicey when the budget impasse entered its second month and President Donald Trump took the unprecedented step of freezing November SNAP payments. With one child who eats gluten free and another with many allergies, specialty items already drove up her grocery bill. Now Grant wondered how she'd put food on the table \u2014 especially with her youngest's 6th birthday approaching.",
      "Then Grant logged into Propel, an app used by 5 million people to manage their electronic benefits transfers, where she saw a pop-up banner inviting her to apply for a relief program. Within a minute she'd completed a survey and about two days later she got a virtual $50 gift card.",
      "The total didn't come close to her monthly SNAP allotment. But the Palm Bay, Florida, resident said it was enough to buy a customized \u201c Bluey \u201d birthday cake for her son.",
      "Nearly a quarter of a million families got that same cash injection from the nonprofit GiveDirectly as they missed SNAP deposits many need to feed their households. The collaboration with Propel proved to be the largest disaster response in the international cash assistance group's history outside of COVID-19; non-pandemic records were set with the $12 million raised, more than 246,000 beneficiaries enrolled and 5,000 individual donors reached.",
      "Recipients are still recovering from the uncertainty of last month's SNAP delays. Company surveys suggest many are dealing with the long-term consequences of borrowing money in early November when their benefits didn\u2019t arrive on time, according to Propel CEO Jimmy Chen. At a time when users felt the existing safety net had fallen through, they credit the rapid payments for buoying them \u2014 both financially and emotionally.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a lot. But at the same time, it is a lot,\u201d Grant said. \u201cBecause $50 can do a lot when you don\u2019t have anything.\u201d",
      "It's not the first partnership for the antipoverty nonprofit and for-profit software company. They have previously combined GiveDirectly's fast cash model with Propel's verified user base to get money out to natural disaster survivors \u2014 including $1,000 last year to some households impacted by Hurricanes Milton and Helene.",
      "\u201cThis particular incident with the shutdown we saw as akin to a natural disaster,\" Chen said, \u201cin the sense that it created a really sudden and really acute form of hardship for many Americans across the country.\u201d",
      "The scope differed this time. The \u201cman-made disaster,\u201d as GiveDirectly U.S. Country Director Dustin Palmer put it, was not geographically isolated. The benefits freeze impacted more people than they usually serve. SNAP costs almost $10 billion a month, Palmer said, so they never expected to raise enough money to replace the delayed benefits altogether.",
      "But 5,000 individual donors \u2014 plus $1 million gifts from Propel and New York nonprofit Robin Hood, as well as other major foundations' support \u2014 provided a sizable pot. Palmer found that the issue resonated more than he expected.",
      "GiveDirectly reports that the median donation was $100. Palmer took that response as a sign the issue hit close for many Americans.",
      "\u201cYou and I know SNAP recipients. Maybe we\u2019ve been SNAP recipients,\" Palmer said. \"So that was not a disaster in Central Texas where I\u2019ve never been, but something in our communities.\u201d",
      "The greatest question revolved around the total sum of each cash transfer. Should they reach more people with fewer dollars or vice versa? Los Angeles wildfire survivors, for example, got $3,500 each from a similar GiveDirectly campaign. But that's because they wanted to provide enough to cover a month's worth of lodging and transit to those who lost their houses.",

      "Recipients decided whether their prepaid debit cards arrived physically, which might allow them to take cash out of an ATM, or virtually, which could be used almost immediately. The split is usually pretty even, according to Palmer, but this time more than 90% of recipients went with the virtual option.",

      "Chen, the Propel CEO, said his company's research suggests that November's freeze damaged many recipients' confidence in the government. Even with SNAP funded through the next fiscal year, Chen said, many respondents are concerned about another shutdown.",

      "Heavy rain and gusty winds from a powerful winter storm system are bringing flash floods and mudslides to parts of Southern California",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A powerful winter storm swept across California on Wednesday, with heavy rains and gusty winds bringing mudslides and debris flows that has led to some water rescues and evacuation orders.",
      "Forecasters said Southern California could see its wettest Christmas in years and warned about flash flooding and mudslides. Areas scorched by January\u2019s wildfires were under evacuation warnings, and Los Angeles County officials said the previous day that they delivered about 380 evacuation orders to especially vulnerable homes.",
      "San Bernardino County firefighters said they rescued people trapped in their cars when mud and debris rushed down a road leading into Wrightwood, a mountain resort town in the San Gabriel Mountains about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles. It was not immediately clear how many were rescued.",
      "Firefighters also went door to door to check on residents, and the area was under a shelter-in-place order, officials said. Lytle Creek, also in the San Gabriel Mountains, was under evacuation orders in the afternoon as rains continued to pummel the area.",
      "Debris and mud were seen cascading down a road in Wrightwood in a video posted by county fire officials. Another video showed fast-moving water rushing through the front porch of several homes.",
      "The storm stranded Dillan Brown with his wife and 14-month-old daughter at a rented cabin in Wrightwood with almost no food and only enough diapers for about another day. By the morning, roads leading off the mountain and to a grocery store were blocked by rocks and debris, Brown said.",
      "\u201cI came across (a road) where there was a car sucked away by the water and realized we were trapped here,\u201d he said.",
      "A resident learned of his situation and posted a call for help in a Facebook group, and in less than an hour, neighbors showed up with more than enough supplies to ride out the storm, including bread, vegetables, milk, diapers and wipes.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re a little sad and upset that we\u2019re not going to be home with our families,\u201d Brown said, but the \u201ckindness shown is definitely an overwhelming feeling.\u201d",
      "Janice Quick, president of the Wrightwood Chamber of Commerce and a resident of the mountain town for 45 years, said a wildfire in 2024 left much of the terrain without tree coverage and \u201call this rain is bringing down a lot of debris and a lot of mud from the mountain area.\u201d",
      "Residents around the burn scar zones from the Airport Fire in Orange County were also ordered to evacuate.",
      "Areas along the coast including Malibu were under flood warnings until the evening, and much of the Sacramento Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area were also under wind and flood advisories.",
      "Several roadways including a part of Interstate 5 near the Burbank Airport were closed due to flooding.",
      "Conditions could worsen with multiple atmospheric rivers during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year.",
      "The rain began tapering off in the evening in Los Angeles, but another storm system was on the horizon with showers and possible thunderstorms Christmas Day.",
      "James Dangerfield, an 84-year-old resident of Altadena, said his family and neighbor helped place sandbags in his backyard earlier this week. A flash flood warning was issued for the neighborhood, but he wasn't too worried because his house is on a hill.",

      "Perry Archangelo Bamonte, longtime guitarist and keyboardist for the influential goth band The Cure, has died. He was 65.",
      "The band announced\u00a0his death on their official website on Friday.",
      "\"It is with enormous sadness that we confirm the death of our great friend and bandmate Perry Bamonte, who passed away after a short illness at home over Christmas,\" the band wrote.",
      "\"Quiet, intense, intuitive, constant and hugely creative, 'Teddy' was a warm hearted and vital part of The Cure story,\" the statement continued. \"Our thoughts and condolences are with all his family. He will be very greatly missed.\"",
      "Bamonte worked with the band in various roles from 1984 to 1989, including as a roadie and guitar tech. He officially joined the band in 1990, when keyboardist Roger O'Donnell quit. It was then that he became a full-time member of the group, playing guitar, six-string bass and keyboard.",
      "Having joined just after the band's mainstream breakthrough, 1989's \"Disintegration,\" Bamonte is featured on a number of The Cure's albums, including 1992's \"Wish\" - which features the career-defining hits \u2033Friday I'm in Love\u2033 and \"High\" - as well as the 1996's \"Wild Mood Swings,\" 2000's \"Bloodflowers\" and 2004's self-titled release.",

      "In 2019, Bamonte was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame alongside the rest of The Cure. He joined The Cure on their North American tour in 2024 when the band reduced tickets to as low as $20 after pledging to make the shows affordable for fans following complaints about exorbitant fees. \u00a0Lead singer Robert Smith said at the time he was \"sickened\" by the Ticketmaster fee debacle.",
      "His last performance with the band was on Nov. 1, 2024 in London for a special one-off event to launch their latest album and first in 16 years, \"Songs of a Lost World.\" The concert was filmed for \"The Cure: The Show of a Lost World,\" a film released in cinemas globally this month.

      "King Charles III and members of the royal family \u2014 minus his disgraced brother, the former Prince Andrew \u2014 gathered for Christmas at the king's private Sandringham Estate, where they traditionally spend the holiday. In the king's annual Christmas speech, broadcast across Britain and the Commonwealth, he stressed the importance of both unity and diversity.",
      "In the morning, Charles and Queen Camilla, along with the Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Kate, their children and extended family members, walked to services at St. Mary Magdalene Church at Sandringham, in Norfolk, about 100 miles north of London.",
      "Members of the royal family also stopped to greet people in the crowd outside.",
      "Andrew was not present for the holiday gathering, BBC News reported, in the wake of the\u00a0scandal over his ties to the late sex offender\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein. He\u00a0did not attend last year either. In October, he was\u00a0stripped of his remaining titles and honors, including prince, and is now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.",
      "Later in the day, the king's annual Christmas Day speech was watched by millions of people in the U.K. and across the Commonwealth, an association of 56 nations with historic ties to Britain.",
      "\"As I meet people of different faiths, I find it enormously encouraging to hear how much we have in common, a shared longing for peace and a deep respect for all life,\" Charles said in his address, which was recorded earlier this month at Westminster Abbey.",
      "Amid \"division both at home and abroad,\" he said, there are \"values of which we must never lose sight.\"",
      "\"With the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong.\"",
      "Westminster Abbey, in the heart of London, is where monarchs have been crowned since William the Conqueror in 1066, and it has also been the site of numerous royal weddings.",
      "The speech was accompanied by a video of members of the royal family, including scenes from the king's historic trip to the Vatican, where he prayed with\u00a0Pope Leo XIV in an effort to forge closer relations between the Church of England and the Catholic Church.",
      "The speech is one of the rare occasions when Charles, 77, can voice his own views and doesn't seek guidance from the government. The remarks typically have a strong religious framework, reflect current issues and sometimes draw on the monarch's personal experiences.",
      "The king's speech was followed by a performance by a Ukrainian choir and London's Royal Opera Chorus, in a sign of support for Ukraine in its war against Russia's invasion.",
      "This was Charles' fourth Christmas speech since ascending to the throne after his mother,\u00a0Queen Elizabeth II, died in September 2022.",
      "The address comes just two weeks after Charles made a deeply personal television appearance in which he said \"good news\" from his doctors meant that he would be able to reduce his treatment for cancer in the new year.",
      "The king was diagnosed with a still undisclosed form of cancer in early 2024. Buckingham Palace says his treatment is now moving to a \"precautionary phase\" and his condition will be monitored to ensure his continued recovery.",
      "During last year's Christmas address, Charles honored care workers around the country and gave a special thanks to the doctors and nurses who supported him after his cancer diagnosis.",

    "story": [
      "A planned Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center, a holiday tradition at the Washington, D.C., performing arts center dating back more than 20 years, has been canceled.",
      "The show's host, musician Chuck Redd, told The Associated Press he called off the performance after the White House announced last week that President Trump's name would be added to the facility \u2014 drawing pushback from Democratic lawmakers and some scholars, who say the change violates the law. According to the White House, the president's handpicked board approved the decision to rename the institution the Trump-Kennedy Center. The revised name later appeared on the building's facade.",
      "\"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" Redd told The Associated Press in an email Wednesday. Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player who has toured with everyone from Dizzy Gillespie to Ray Brown, has been presiding over holiday \"Jazz Jams\" at the Kennedy Center since 2006, succeeding bassist William \"Keter\" Betts.",
      "The Kennedy Center did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The center's website lists the show as canceled.",
      "President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and Congress passed a law naming the center as a living memorial to him.\u00a0The law explicitly prohibits the board of trustees adding any additional memorials to the site.",
      "The decision to rename the center has drawn steep criticism from congressional Democrats and some members of Kennedy's family. Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio sued over the renaming Monday, calling it a \"flagrant violation of the rule of law\" and noting that the name can't be changed without an act of Congress.",
      "The center's president, Richard Grenell, who was appointed by Mr. Trump,\u00a0has argued that the center's status as a memorial to Kennedy wasn't changed.",
      "Mr. Trump, a Republican, has been deeply involved with the center named for an iconic Democrat after mostly ignoring it during his first term. He has forced out its leadership, overhauled the board while arranging for himself to head it and personally hosted this year's Kennedy Center honors, breaking a long tradition of presidents mostly serving as spectators.",
      "Numerous artists have called off Kennedy Center performances since Mr. Trump returned to office, including Issa Rae and Peter Wolf. Lin-Manuel Miranda canceled a planned production of \"Hamilton.\"",

      "The multiplatinum artist has won dozens of awards from the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association, as well as a Grammy for best country album. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2006.",
      "When Strait received a lifetime achievement award from the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in 2021, he said his father taught him the ways of the cowboy life and that he's tried to hold on to his Western heritage throughout his career. But he also said he was challenged early on to stay true to himself.",

      "Gloria Gaynor's 1978 hit \"I Will Survive\" has stood the test of time, surviving far longer than disco did and crowning the New Jersey singer as the genre's queen.",
      "The song won a Grammy for best disco recording. When it was added to the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry in 2016, the library said \"I Will Survive\" became known as an \"emblem of women's empowerment\" and an anthem in the LGBTQ community.",
      "\"That song taps into the inherent survival instinct and it taps into the tenacity of the human spirit,\" Gaynor told CBS News in 2016.",
      "As she recalled recently, when she recorded the hit, she was paralyzed from the waist down while recovering from a serious spinal injury after a fall onstage.",
      "\"I had been in hospital for over three months, hoping I'd survive, you know, this trauma that I was going through, hoping that I'd survive the fact that my mother had just passed away a few years prior,\" Gaynor said. \"Yeah, I was living that song, and I was certain that I wouldn't be the only one.\"",
      "Legendary rock band Kiss",
      "This year's celebration is a bittersweet moment for the founding members of Kiss. Ace Frehley, the band's original lead guitarist, died in October, just a few weeks after he, Peter Criss, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley were named among this year's honorees.",

      "Kiss is known as much for their hits like \"Rock and Roll All Nite,\" \"I Was Made for Lovin' You\" and \"Detroit Rock City\" as they are for their signature black-and-white face paint. The group rode the glam rock wave to stardom, selling more than 100 million records worldwide and entering the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.",

      "Crawford's career has also included roles in movies and on television, but he considered those to be auditions for his next part. For him, playing the Phantom was a gift.",
      "\"So, you want to do the eight shows a week,\" Crawford said. \"You don't want to miss one.\"",

      "For Stallone, who received Oscar nominations for playing Rocky Balboa and writing the screenplay for what was named 1976's best picture, the film was about the love between Rocky and Talia Shire's Adrian.",
      "\"This movie will rise and fall on love, not fights,\" Stallone said. \"Everyone can sort of go, oh my God, it's the little things in life, it's the love, it's the nurturing \u2014 that's the victory.\"",
      "Stallone calls the movie his biography when at the time he felt like he couldn't win. He went into acting in his 20s after growing up with his father, who Stallone said was emotionally and physically abusive. Movies were a way for Stallone to cope, and he said the mythic heroes he saw on screen changed his life.",
      "\"I said, 'I'm going to be that guy,'\" Stallone said. \"I don't want to be what's at the house, but I do want to be this noble creature.\"",

      "O'Day sat down with CBS News for her first network interview since Netflix's new documentary, \"Sean Combs: The Reckoning,\" was released. A clip from the documentary shows O'Day reading from an affidavit that describes an alleged sexual assault involving her, Combs, and another man while she was \"looking very inebriated.\" She says she has no memory of the alleged incident, but it has left her with questions.",
      "O'Day left with questions after shocking affidavit",
      "\"Does this mean I was raped? Is that what this means? I don't even know if I was raped. And I don't want to know,\" said O'Day in the documentary, which has received a reported 40 million views globally in its first two weeks.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a spokesman for Combs said that the music mogul \"categorically denies the allegations in the Netflix documentary,\" saying that \"he has never sexually assaulted anyone.\" Combs plans to address these matters \"in the appropriate legal forum\" rather than \"speculation from anonymous affidavits,\" the statement continued. Combs is currently serving a 50-month sentence in a New Jersey federal prison after being\u00a0convicted on prostitution-related charges.",
      "O'Day once worked closely with Combs, who helped found\u00a0Danity Kane\u00a0on his reality show \"Making the Band\" in 2005 before he ultimately disbanded the group in 2009. Speaking about Combs in the documentary brought up a lot of painful moments for O'Day, who said she's still processing the information.",
      "She wanted to make sure the person who wrote the affidavit is \"100 percent certain\" it was her and that they didn't confuse her with another bandmate or doppelg\u00e4nger.",
      "\"The story that they have told has been consistent for two years in every area that they've been in,\" O'Day said. To this day, O'Day still doesn't know what happened.",
      "O'Day has previously emphasized the role of forgiveness in her journey through the entertainment industry, saying that it starts with forgiving yourself.",
      "\"I forgive myself. That was the hard one,\" she said. \"The feelings that I've had throughout all of this really come down to, like, forgiving myself for misplacing abuse, or attention, or acknowledgment as love. Those weren't one in the same. And so I had to forgive myself first.\"",
      "Living her purpose",
      "When it comes to forgiving Combs, O'Day said it doesn't really matter.",
      "\"Do I forgive him? I don't think that matters to the bigger picture. I think that he needs to do the work to forgive himself,\" O'Day said.",
      "Right now, O'Day said her focus is going to remain on the survivors and pushing for systematic change.",
      "\"I want to be helping people, and speaking for the underdogs, and speaking for the voices that aren't being heard. And I didn't necessarily get to spend the majority of my life yet being able to live in my purpose,\" she said.",
      "Combs is expected to be\u00a0released from prison in May 2028, according to online prison records. While some rumors have swirled about the possibility of a presidential pardon, a senior White House official called the reports \"speculation\" and told CBS News any decisions on pardons would come directly from President Trump.",
      "Marc Agnifilo, the lead attorney for Combs,\u00a0told \"CBS Mornings\" in August\u00a0that he hasn't had any conversations about a possible pardon: \"I have not spoken to the president. I have not spoken to anybody who speaks to the president about Sean Combs. I have not.\"",
      "O'Day doesn't believe Mr. Trump would pardon Combs.",
      "\"I think the only reason, in my opinion, that the president would pardon 'Diddy' is if it worked well for him in midterms, in regards to gathering a certain voting base,\" she said. \"The moves are always strategic, and the moves right now are about midterms.\"",

      "He's perhaps best known for his breakout role at age 23 as Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic in the hit 1970s sitcom \"All in the Family,\" though others may know him more recently as Bob Day, the father of the quirky Jess Day in \"New Girl.\" Reiner also directed iconic films such as \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026,\" \"This is Spinal Tap,\" \"Stand By Me\" and \"A Few Good Men.\"",

      "Albert Brooks said he's still in disbelief over the death of his good friend, who he's known since the pair attended drama class together at Beverly Hills High School more than 60 years ago. He said he was heartbroken, but he loves to talk about his friendship with Reiner because it's \"genuine and it's rare.\"",
      "\"Rob was my oldest friend. It's that simple. He's the person that I've known the longest. I met him when I was 14 years old. So I'm still in that not believing it stage,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Brooks said he still finds himself dialing his pal's number to chat, and then freezes when he realizes what he's done.",
      "\"I know it happened, but, you know, I'm driving around and all of a sudden \u2014 I actually two days ago, I called his number,\" he recalled.",
      "Kathy Bates",
      "Oscar-winning actress Kathy Bates has credited Reiner with changing \"the course of [her] life\" by directing her unforgettable performance as Annie Wilkes in \"Misery\" in 1990.",
      "\"If I hadn't done 'Misery,' it would be like George Bailey going back and seeing what his life would have been like if he had never been there,\" she said. \"I wouldn't have had some of the friends that I have now. I wouldn't have had the richness in my life. I quite frankly probably would have stayed in the theater and I doubt I would have had a movie career. I might have dropped out altogether.\"",
      "She recalled Reiner's enthusiasm when she walked on stage to accept her Oscar for Best Actress in 1991.",
      "\"When they called my name, I looked over and Rob was standing and he was just pounding his fist together going, 'Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!'\" she recalled.",
      "Kiefer Sutherland",
      "Kiefer Sutherland who played Lt. Jonathan Kendrick in the 1992 legal drama \"A Few Good Men\" said Reiner had an unforgettable presence on set as director. He recalled the tense courtroom scene where Jack Nicholson \u2013 Colonel Nathan Jessup \u2013 had to deliver his now famous line, \"You can't handle the truth!\"",
      "After the first moving take, Sutherland recalled Reiner asking Nicholson if he wanted to go again.",
      "\"No one said a word, and Rob went up to Jack Nicholson and whispered in his ear, 'Do you want to do another one?' And Jack Nicholson said, 'Well, we're here,'\" Sutherland recalled. \"So they did another one, and it was just as extraordinary.\"",
      "The actors planned a marathon filming day, but Sutherland said Reiner was so blown away by Nicholson's performance that day that he sent everyone home early.",
      "\"They had planned to shoot the whole day, and Rob looked at everybody and said, 'I couldn't ask for anything more, so you guys all have the rest of the day off,\" Sutherland said.",
      "Annette Bening",
      "Annette Bening played Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist and love interest of widower President Andrew Shepherd, portrayed by Michael Douglas in the 1995 political romantic comedy, \"The American President.\" During filming, Bening said Reiner made it a priority as the movie's director to ensure the cast and crew could spend quality time with their families.",
      "\"On the set, he had that kind of enthusiasm that is infectious. The leader sets the tone, right? So he was wonderful that way. And a real avid family man,\" Bening said.",
      "She added, \"He would insist that the day ended at a sane time, which in show business is kind of unusual. But, he said, 'No, we want everyone to be able to have dinner with their kids.'\"",
      "Michael Douglas",
      "Like Reiner, Michael Douglas was also born to Hollywood royalty, the son of Kirk Douglas.",
      "\"Well, my experience was, watching him, that I could never be the man that my father was. He could do everything, you know, I mean he was Spartacus. Once you go into the same business, it stares you in the face,\" Douglas said. \"And, in Rob's case, are you as funny as your father? But that I think is also what created his tenacity, his strength, and that's something that's not really talked about enough with Rob, about his endurance.\"",
      "Douglas said Reiner was \"spectacular\" to work with in \"The American President.\" \"He was looking out for you,\" he said.",
      "Jerry O'Connell",
      "When Jerry O'Connell was 11, he was cast as the shy but loyal Vern Tessio in the 1986 coming-of-age drama \"Stand by Me.\" He met Reiner for the first time at his audition for the film, and recalled Reiner putting him at ease. He said Reiner was like a father figure to him during that time, and the years after.",
      "Months after the movie came out, when he was 12 years old, O'Connell said Reiner took him out to lunch in Los Angeles.",
      "\"He took me out to lunch, man. He didn't have to do that, You know what I'm saying? It was months after the movie came out. He was a busy man, and he took a 12-year-old me out to lunch. Just to be like, 'Thanks so much. What a great movie,'\" O'Connell recalled, with tears in his eyes. \"That lunch meant so much to me, you know? It's just stuff that kids need to hear.\"",
      "Mandy Patinkin",
      "Mandy Patinkin played Inigo Montoya, a Spanish swordsman, in Reiner's 1987 film adaptation of \"The Princess Bride.\" It was the role of a lifetime.",
      "After wrapping up filming, Patinkin said the cast was invited to come out to Los Angeles to see the first rough cut together. When the film was over, Patinkin turned in the screening room and said he \"never dreamed\" he would get to be in something like this.",
      "\"I didn't even have time to dream it. And he made that dream for me. And I don't go anywhere, where some child or adult or grandfather comes up to me and says, 'Say the line,'\" said Patinkin of his famous line, \"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father. Prepare to die.\"",
      "The word that came to min when Patinkin heard the news about Reiner and his wife, Michele: \"Inconceivable.\" He said he doesn't know how to process it and he's not looking to understand how to process it.",
      "\"Rob worked hard to try to get me the best human being I could be. One time he said to me, 'I just wish you could get out of your own way.' And I haven't been able to achieve that to this day, but I won't quit trying. He cared about my nature. He showed it to me over and over again,\" Patinkin said. \"I believe that we can connect with Rob and Michele. And every time we're thinking about this or talking about it or anybody tells a story, he's here. He's here with you. He will not be forgotten.\"",

    "story": [
      "In the aftermath of the deaths last weekend of filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife Michele, Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz offers an appreciation of Reiner's unparalleled career and life in the movies:",
      "Rob Reiner entered America's collective consciousness in 1971, playing Mike Stivic, Archie Bunker's son-in-law, and politically liberal foil, on \"All in the Family.\"",
      "Mike: \"It's getting like politics in American is only for the rich.\" Archie: \"Who's been feeding you that commie crapola?\" Mike: \"President Eisenhower said that.\" Archie: \"He did not! Eisenhower was a great president who never said nothing.\"",
      "Even then, Reiner knew that, as good as he was in front of the camera, he wanted to direct. His feature debut as a director came in 1984 with \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" a parody of a documentary that delivered one of the funniest scenes in movie history:",
      "Nigel (Christopher Guest): \"This is very, very special. Because as you can see, the numbers all go to 11. Look, right across the board, 11, 11, 11, 11.\"  Marty: (Reiner): \"And most amps go up to 10?\"Nigel: \"Exactly. \u2026 What we do is, if we need that extra push over the cliff, you know what we do?\"Marty: \"Put it up to 11?\"Nigel: \"Exactly. One louder.\"Marty: \"Why don't you just make 10 louder, and make 10 be the top number, and make that a little louder?\"Pause.Nigel: \"These go to 11!\"",
      "\"Spinal Tap\" began an extraordinary run that rivals the best directors in Hollywood history: Seven classic films in just 11 years, each standing the test of time, each possessing some piece of authentic humanity.",
      "In \"Stand By Me,\" an aching moment of friendship between two boys.",
      "In \"The Princess Bride,\" a combination of everlasting love \u2026 and revenge.",
      "Inigo (Mandy Patinkin): \"My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\"",
      "Three of the movies Reiner made during that run of success contain scenes so perfectly shot, they've become part of our shared cinematic language. First came the diner scene in \"When Harry Met Sally.\" The scene required Meg Ryan to mimic a woman faking an orgasm. After one take, Reiner went to Ryan and explained what he wanted: louder, more hand movements, table pounding. The button on the scene came from Reiner's mother, Estelle: \"I'll have what she's having.\"",
      "Next came Kathy Bates, giving an Oscar-winning performance in \"Misery.\" For the hobbling scene, Reiner gives us James Caan's perspective, tied to the bed, looking up at the benevolent mania of Bates' face.",
      "Finally, in \"A Few Good Men,\" Reiner did the seemingly impossible: directing Jack Nicholson to a performance as memorable as \"Chinatown,\" \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" or \"The Shining.\" Reiner gave us a courtroom drama for the ages, and Nicholson an opportunity to shine in front of a new generation of movie lovers.",
      "Col. Jessup (Jack Nicholson): \"You want answers.\" Lt. Kaffee (Tom Cruise): \"I think I'm entitled.\" Jessup: \"You want answers?\" Kaffee: \"I want the truth.\" Jessup: \"You can't handle the truth.\"",
      "The truth about Rob Reiner is that, for many Americans, his politics were as well-known as his films, but not always as popular. A fierce critic of President Trump, there's no doubt millions of Americans disagreed (many strongly) with Reiner.",
      "But here's the thing we can all understand about him: Rob Reiner was a patriot, an American who believed deeply in humanity; who believed in trying to make his country work as well as possible for as many human beings as possible.",
      "You can see that aspirational political nature in the last movie of his remarkable run, \"The American President,\" in 1995:",
      "President Shepherd (Michael Douglas): \"You want to claim this land is the land of the free? Then the symbol of your country cannot just be a flag. The symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest. Now show me that, defend that, celebrate that in your classrooms. Then you can stand up and sing about the land of the free.\"",
      "There is no easy way to process the family tragedy that took Rob and Michele Reiner. It is awful. Period.",
      "The sense of loss is heightened by Rob's lofty standing in Hollywood. In a business that can induce backstabbing and produce enemies, Rob was nearly universally loved in the entertainment industry. I didn't know him as well as I would've liked, but he always made me feel like we'd been pals for decades.",
      "His character was defined by his kindness, his humor, his compassion, by his own humanity.",
      "Those are qualities that all of us love in his movies, films that maybe, in some small way, can help us find something that unites us in these unbelievably fractured times.",

      "Under a \"no tax on tips\" provision, employees may deduct up to $25,000 earned in tips before Dec. 31. To qualify for the deduction, it's important that workers track their earnings closely because of the IRS's\u00a0reporting requirements, experts say.",
      "\"Document the numbers,\" Vargas said, noting that the same applies to individuals who work overtime.",
      "Some seniors are also eligible for an enhanced senior deduction beginning in 2025. Individuals who are 65 and older may claim an additional deduction of $6,000, or $12,000 per couple, if they qualify.",
      "Because the deduction phases out for single earners with modified adjusted gross income above $75,000 or $150,000 for joint filers, seniors should check that income measure to assess whether or not they are eligible for the deduction, according to Vargas.",
      "Modified adjusted gross income is calculated by finding your AGI, which is on line 11 of your Form 1040, with some deductions and non-taxable items added back in.",
      "Make a budget that will stick",
      "Affordability is a top concern for Americans, whose paychecks aren't keeping pace with inflation. Making a budget that you can realistically follow is a good way to ensure you aren't wasting any money, financial experts say.",
      "It's essential, though, that any kind of budget you design \"matches the way you live,\" Alexa von Tobel, founder and managing director of Inspired Capital, told CBS News.",
      "\"Most budgets fail because they're too aspirational. The ones that stick are automated and grounded in your real patterns,\" she said.",
      "Von Tobel said she prefers the 50/30/20 budgeting rule, which portions half of your take-home pay to essentials; one-third to lifestyle expenses; and 20% to goals such as paying off debt or saving for a vacation.",
      "\"A new year is a perfect time to readdress how your budget aligns with this framework and see where you need to adjust,\" she said.",
      "If the 50/30/20 rule doesn't work for you, there are plenty of other budgeting approaches, including the envelope system and zero-based budgeting. The envelope system sets spending limits for categories like dining out, with that amount placed in cash and used throughout the month.",
      "Zero-based budgeting assigns every dollar of your take-home pay to a specific category \u2014 such as rent, groceries or savings \u2014 until there's nothing left unallocated.",
      "AI tools can remove the self-discipline part of the equation for people and automate savings processes, von Tobel noted.",
      "\"Money management is becoming less about discipline and more about system design. Automate what you can, use tools that give you back time and clarity, and let your financial plan run even when your schedule gets chaotic,\" she said.",
      "Pay down high-interest credit card debt",
      "It's important to prioritize paying down high-interest debt like credit card balances because it's the most expensive to carry and \"can get out of control quickly,\" Vanguard's Vargas said.",
      "When it comes to shedding debt, von Tobel recommends tackling credit card balances with the highest annual percentage rates (APRs) first.",
      "\"Line up your balances by APR, automate all minimum payments and aggressively target the highest-interest line first. Structure beats willpower every time,\" she said.",
      "Another popular strategy for paying down debt is the so-called snowball method. It involves listing your debts by balance and paying off the smallest ones first, regardless of interest rates, to build momentum and stay motivated as balances disappear.",
      "Borrowers have other options for tackling credit card debt as well. One approach is to move balances to a 0% balance transfer card, which can eliminate interest for as long as 21 months. Another is to contact your credit card issuer to ask for a lower annual percentage rate, or APR.",
      "Lock in savings rates before they fall",
      "The Federal Reserve last week cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, its third consecutive cut this year, and hinted at an additional rate cut in 2026.",
      "With at least one additional rate cut expected next year, it may make sense to open a certificate of deposit or a high-yield savings account before rates fall further, said Sam Taube, a lead writer with financial advice site NerdWallet.",
      "Online financial institutions are offering some of the highest rates, with annual percentage yields around 4%.",
      "\"If the Fed lowers rates further from here, they will offer lower fixed yields, so it might make sense to open up a CD of fixed-yield savings instrument like that sooner rather than later,\" he said.",
      "Make sure you're getting the full employer match",
      "If you have a tax-advantaged savings account through your employer, such as a 401(k), financial professionals say it's important to make the most of it. If your company matches employee contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match.",
      "Vargas said a good starting point is to find out what level of contribution your employer will match \u2014 typically it's between 3% to 6% of your salary\u2014 and to contribute at least that much to your account.",
      "\"Work toward maximizing that employer match, so you're not leaving money on the table,\" he said.",
      "Setting up an automatic payroll deduction is an easy way to ensure you're contributing to your 401(k), Von Tobel said, adding that \"small, consistent increases create enormous long-term compounding.\"",
      "Before year-end, you can also make a last-minute extra contribution to your 401(k), according to CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger.",
      "Because retirement contributions lower your taxable income, \"you may also reduce your tax bill in April,\" she noted.",

    "summary": "Here are the top 20 largest Powerball and Mega Millions jackpots, and the odds of winning them.",
    "story": [
      "Lottery jackpots have exploded in size over the last decade.",
      "When Powerball launched in 1992, the first jackpot was $5.9 million, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association. Now, the largest Powerball jackpot on record is the $2.04 billion prize won on Nov. 7, 2022.",
      "Mega Millions followed a similar path. Its first jackpot winner in 2002 took home $28 million. Its record prize \u2014 a $1.602 billion jackpot won on Aug. 8, 2023 \u2014 ranks as the fifth-largest jackpot won in U.S. lottery history.",
      "Thirteen of the 20 largest jackpots have occurred since 2023.",
      "The bigest one this year, Christmas Eve's $1.817 billion Powerball jackpot, is now the\u00a0second-largest U.S. jackpot ever won.",
      "Here are the biggest U.S. jackpot wins before that:",
      "Only five states don't sell lottery tickets: Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada and Utah.",
      "While the prizes are huge, the odds of winning still remain extremely low. Over the last three decades, both games have been redesigned multiple times. Changes have pushed jackpots higher while also adding more ways for players to win smaller prizes.",
      "Powerball players choose five numbers from 1 to 69 and one Powerball number from 1 to 26. In 2015, Powerball increased its number of white balls from 59 to 69 and its number of red balls decreased from 35 to 26.",
      "Before the change, the odds of winning the jackpot were 1 in 175.2 million and the overall odds of winning any prize were 1 in 31.85. After the redesign, the jackpot odds became steeper, 1 in 292.2 million, while the overall odds of winning a prize improved to 1 in 24.9, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.",
      "Mega Millions requires players to pick five different numbers from one to 70 and one Mega Ball number from one to 24. A ticket wins the jackpot by matching all six numbers in a drawing.",
      "In 2025, Mega Millions changed its games to a larger starting jackpot ($50 million vs. $20 million), which \"improved odds to win the jackpot and improved overall odds,\" according to Dan Miller, a spokesperson for Mega Millions.",
      "\"Everyone who wins is winning more because of the embedded multiplier in the new game that takes all non-jackpot prizes and multiplies them by 2X, 3X, 4X, 5X or 10X,\" Miller said in an email. Through Friday, Dec. 5, he said, \"there have been 70 drawings in the new game. In that time, players have won $531 million in non-jackpot prizes. In the old game, those same prizes would have been valued at $119.8 million. That's a 343% increase in player winnings.\"",
      "For example, under the old rules, matching just the Mega Ball was a break-even outcome: a $2 ticket earned a $2 prize. Under the new game, that same match now comes with a built-in multiplier. The minimum prize is $5, which is then multiplied \u2014 meaning a player can now win $10, $15, $20, $25 or even $50 instead of just $2.",
      "The odds to win the jackpot improved from 1 in 302.6 million to\u00a01 in 290.5 million. This is because of Mega Millions removing the one gold Mega Ball from the game, Miller said.",
      "The new game has 24 Mega Balls instead of 25, which improves the odds of picking the right combinations of numbers to win the jackpot. The overall odds to win any prize went from 1 in 24 to 1 in 23.",
      "There's more money in play as well: Powerball increased the price of a ticket from $1 to $2 in 2012. Mega Millions increased its ticket prices from $1 to $2 in 2017 and from $2 to $5 in April of this year.",

    "summary": "The new tourist tax imposes an 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passengers to address climate change threats to Hawaii.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge's ruling clears the way for Hawaii to include cruise ship passengers in a new tourist tax to help pay for the impacts of climate change, a levy set to go into effect at the start of 2026.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jill A. Otake on Tuesday denied a request seeking to stop officials from enforcing the new law on cruises.",
      "In the nation's first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually.",
      "The levy increases rates on hotel room and vacation rental stays but also imposes a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passengers, starting next year, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports.",
      "Cruise Lines International Association challenged the tax in a lawsuit, along with a Honolulu company that provides supplies and provisions to cruise ships and tour businesses out of Kauai and the Big Island that rely on cruise ship passengers. Among their arguments is that the new law violates the Constitution by taxing cruise ships for the privilege of entering Hawaii ports.",

    "title": "We asked experts to rate the U.S. economy in 2025. Here's what they said.",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/economists-grade-us-economy-2025/",
    "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 14:27:44 -0500",
    "summary": "The economy remained on track this year, defying the gloomiest predictions. That doesn't mean Americans are thrilled with how things are going.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy has been tested by a barrage of challenges in 2025, from sharply higher U.S. tariffs that drove up inflation and rattled consumer confidence, to rising unemployment amid a slowdown in hiring.",
      "Despite those headwinds, the economy has continued to chug along, defying early-year warnings from some economists that the nation could be headed for a recession or that the Trump administration's tariffs would reignite runaway inflation.",
      "The biggest surprise of the year has been the economy's durability, according to experts. Economic growth has surged\u00a0to its fastest pace in two years, inflation has risen less than feared and the stock market has climbed to\u00a0fresh highs.",
      "\"This has been another year of resilience for the economy,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Michael Pearce told CBS News. \"The economy has grown at a pretty steady pace.\"",
      "Yet Pearce hastens to add that the economy, although it has navigated some tricky waters, is \"not spectacular\" as the year comes to a close, assigning it a grade of a B or B-. Other experts who spoke with CBS News also graded the economy in the B range.",
      "That may strike many consumers as generous. Three-quarters of Americans surveyed by CBS News earlier this month said they would give the U.S. economy a C, D or F, while just 25% assigned it an A or a B. Recent consumer confidence surveys also indicate that many Americans are downbeat about the economy, mainly due to stubbornly high prices.",
      "The disconnect partly reflects the differences in how consumers and economists tend to judge the nation's economic performance. While financial pros tend to focus on macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, inflation and unemployment, consumers are more likely to assess the economy based on pocketbook issues like food prices and health care costs \u2014 both of which have risen in 2025.",
      "The White House said the economy has improved from last year under former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"Although much work remains, the American economy is leaps... better now than it was a year ago under Joe Biden: cooled inflation, private-sector job growth, cheaper essentials like gas, lower taxes, and trillions in investments flowing in to make and hire in America,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "He added, \"As President Trump's economic agenda continues taking effect, Americans can rest assured that 2026 will be even better.\"",
      "A turbulent year",
      "The economy has been marked by pronounced volatility and uncertainty in 2025, ranging from the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs to an\u00a0alarming downturn in growth\u00a0in the first three months of the year.",
      "\"It's rare that we've seen a president come in and, with a unified Congress, have such immediate impacts on the economy,\" Pearce said. \"Not all of those are impacting the economy right away, but we've seen a lot of those policies generate a lot of uncertainty.\"",
      "For instance, the Republicans' \"big beautiful bill\" act, signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, will likely impact the economy in 2026, with consumers expected to receive juicier tax refunds.",
      "Other effects of the new law could work against some consumers. Perhaps most concerning is the expiration of Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits, which experts warn will sharply drive up health insurance premiums for millions of Americans.",
      "Meanwhile, it's been a banner year for investors as the boom in artificial intelligence pushed the stock market to a succession of record highs. At the same time, the bullish sentiment on Wall Street has fueled questions about whether a possible\u00a0AI bubble\u00a0could turn to bust if the enormous investment in the technology fails to deliver the promised gains in productivity and corporate profits.",
      "Life on the \"K\"",
      "Economic turmoil often impacts consumer sentiment, making people feel less confident about their finances, economists have long noted. That dynamic has led experts to describe the economy this year as \"K-shaped,\" in which higher-income consumers spend robustly \u2014 thanks in part to the\u00a0strong stock market\u00a0\u2014 even as lower- and middle-income consumers\u00a0pull back.",
      "And it's no wonder. Although inflation has cooled since peaking at a 40-year high in 2022, prices remain elevated, squeezing many Americans and making it hard for them to cover even basic expenses, Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott, told CBS News.",
      "It isn't just routine purchases that are straining consumers \u2014 it's also the barriers in the way today of reaching once ordinary financial goals, such as buying a first home, saving for retirement or even just paying off debt, added Chen Zhao, head of economic research at online real estate firm Redfin.",
      "When it comes to homeownership, evidence of that barrier is visible in the median age of first homebuyers today \u2014 that hit 40 this year, a record high, according to the National Association of Realtors. With home values near all-time highs and mortgage rates hovering around 6.3%, many younger Americans are feeling priced out, she said.",
      "\"This situation that we're in right now, where [housing] affordability has gotten to be the worst it's really ever been in recent memory \u2014 and significantly worse than before the pandemic \u2014 it's really unfortunate for the younger generation,\" Zhao said. \"It means delaying the American dream for a lot of folks.\"",
      "In 160 U.S. cities, at least one-fifth of middle-class residents can't afford to live in that area, after factoring in local income levels and price differences, according to Brookings, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Hiring slowdown",
      "Another pressure point is the labor market, where hiring has slowed throughout 2025. The U.S. unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November, its highest level in four years.",
      "Layoffs also\u00a0jumped to 1.1 million this year through November, up 54% from a year earlier and the highest level since 2020, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "While job seekers are finding it tougher to get a foothold in today's labor market, it's proving particularly challenging for young people, who are facing a decline in job listings and competition from more experienced workers, experts said.",
      "Cooling job growth in the second half of the year is partially a reflection of persistent economic uncertainty, which has led many businesses to throttle hiring. Some businesses are also trimming jobs as they invest in AI, which can perform some tasks previously handled by employees.",
      "\"Any type of uncertainty is going to lead to slower business decisions, whether it's hiring or investment,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS News.",
      "Labor market headwinds in 2025 have prompted the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate three straight times since September. By lowering borrowing costs, the Fed is aiming to encourage businesses to expand and hire.",
      "Slower hiring and rising layoffs could pose a risk to consumer spending, which drives nearly two-thirds of economic activity, economists note.",
      "\"A slower labor market leads to slower income growth, which eventually ends up pulling consumer spending lower,\" Daco said.",
      "Muted tariff impact",
      "One of the biggest economic surprises of 2025 came with President Trump's sweeping tariffs, announced in April on what he termed \"liberation day.\" The plan caused U.S. stocks to plunge\u00a0and stoked fears that the levies would reignite inflation.",
      "Yet despite such concerns, tariffs so far have had a more muted impact on inflation than initially feared. That's partly because U.S. companies, which pay the import duties to the federal government, stockpiled goods before the tariffs kicked in and absorbed some of the costs rather than passing them on to consumers.",
      "\"Generally speaking, the economy outperformed expectations in the face of several large supply shocks,\" Daco said.",
      "Still, inflation remains sticky. The Consumer Price Index, which stood at 3% in January, remains near the same level as of November. Oxford Economics' Pearce estimates that the stepped-up import duties added 0.5 percentage points to the nation's inflation rate this year.",

      "Rising energy costs are adding to the affordability issues facing millions of U.S. consumers, with nonprofit group PowerLines recently estimating that more than 100 million Americans could see heftier bills this year because of rate hikes.",
      "The average household is expected to pay an average of $995 on home heating this winter, a 9.2% increase from last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association (NEADA). Those who use electricity for heating were projected to see an even steeper jump of 12.2%, with the average bill swelling from $1,090 to $1,233, the group found.",
      "\"Millions of households are being pushed deeper into utility debt and closer to shutoffs simply because they cannot afford to keep their homes warm,\" Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, said in a statement.",

      "Get a home energy audit. An inspector can help you detect where cold air might be seeping into your house and recommend energy efficiency improvements. Audits are performed by certified home energy auditors, according to energystar.gov. Look to local government agencies or your utility company for home energy assessment tips.",
      "Tackle obvious leaks. Justin Castronova, a lead inspector at First Choice Inspectors in Illinois, told CBS News consumer correspondent Ash-har Quraishi that the best place to start is with doors and windows. Castronova recommends using caulk to seal gaps, maintaining weather stripping for doors and windows, and using spray foam around electrical outlets (make sure to turn off your power first).",
      "Invest in energy-efficient appliances. That can save you from $10 to $50 a month, depending on the size of the appliance and how many you have, Castronova said.",

For example, the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program provides financial assistance to low-income households to weather-proof their homes and even deal with energy-related home repairs.

    "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 08:03:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Department of Homeland Security says it's replacing its longstanding lottery system for H-1B work visas with an approach that prioritizes skilled, higher-paid foreign workers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday it was replacing its longstanding lottery system for H-1B work visas with a new approach that prioritizes skilled, higher-paid foreign workers.",
      "The change follows a series of actions by the Trump administration aimed at reshaping a visa program that critics say has become a pipeline for overseas workers willing to work for lower pay, but supporters say drives innovation.",
      "\"The existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by U.S. employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,\" said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Matthew Tragesser.",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 annual H-1B visa fee on highly skilled workers, which was challenged in court.",
      "At least one federal judge has upheld it, French news agency AFP reports. In a 56-page opinion Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell wrote that the president has \"broad statutory authority\" to address \"a problem he perceives to be a matter of economic and national security.\"",
      "At least two additional suits against the fee are ongoing.",
      "The president also rolled out a $1 million \"gold card\" visa as a pathway to U.S. citizenship for wealthy individuals.",
      "A press release announcing the new rule says it is \"in line with other key changes the administration has made, such as the Presidential Proclamation that requires employers to pay an additional $100,000 per visa as a condition of eligibility.\"",
      "Historically, H-1B visas have been awarded through a lottery system. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient, with more than 10,000 visas approved, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, Microsoft, Apple and Google. California has the highest concentration of H-1B workers.",
      "The new system will \"implement a weighted selection process that will increase the probability that H-1B visas are allocated to higher-skilled and higher-paid\" foreign workers, according to Tuesday's press release. It will go into effect Feb. 27, 2026, and will apply to the upcoming H-1B cap registration season.",
      "Supporters of the H-1B program say it is an important pathway to hiring healthcare workers and educators. They say it drives innovation and economic growth in the U.S. and allows employers to fill jobs in specialized fields.",
      "Critics argue that the visas often go to entry-level positions rather than senior roles requiring specialized skills. While the program is intended to prevent wage suppression or the displacement of U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay lower wages by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even when the workers hired have more experience.",
      "The number of new visas issued annually is capped at 65,000, plus an additional 20,000 for people with a master's degree or higher.",

    "summary": "A prominent California farmer was arrested in the shooting death of his estranged wife in a remote mountain community in Arizona, authorities said.",
    "story": [
      "A prominent California farmer was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of murder in the shooting death of his estranged wife in a remote mountain community in Arizona, the Navajo County Sheriff's Office said.",
      "Michael Abatti, 63, was arrested in El Centro, Calif. and booked into jail on a first-degree murder charge. He is awaiting extradition to Arizona.",
      "Authorities say they believe he drove to Arizona on Nov. 20 and fatally shot Kerri Ann Abatti, 59, before returning home to California. She was found dead in her family's tree-shrouded vacation home in Pinetop, Arizona, where she moved after splitting with her husband.",
      "An attorney for Michael Abatti didn't immediately respond to an email and text message seeking comment.",
      "Authorities searched his home in far Southern California on Dec. 2 as part of the investigation into his wife's death.",
      "A Navajo County grand jury indicted Michael Tuesday and deputies got an arrest warrant for him, CBS Phoenix affiliate KPHO-TV reported.",
      "El Centro is a city of 44,000 people just minutes from the Mexican border in the crop-rich Imperial Valley, which is the biggest user of Colorado River water and known for growing leafy greens, melons and forage crops.",
      "Michael Abatti comes from a long line of farmers in the region bordering Arizona, and his grandfather, an Italian immigrant, was among the region's early settlers. His father, Ben, helped start the Imperial Valley Vegetable Growers Association, and the Abatti name is known throughout the region and tied to farming enterprises, scholarship funds and leadership in local boards and groups.",
      "Michael Abatti has grown onions, broccoli, cantaloupes and other crops in the Imperial Valley and served on the board of the powerful Imperial Irrigation District from 2006 to 2010.",
      "Michael and Kerri Abatti were married in 1992 and had three children.",
      "Kerri Abatti is a descendant of one of the first Latter-day Saints families to settle Pinetop in the 1880s. The community, located 190 miles northeast of Phoenix in the White Mountains, was briefly called Penrodville after Kerri's forbearers before adopting the Pinetop name.",
      "The couple split in 2023 and Kerri Abatti filed for divorce in proceedings that were pending in California at the time of her death.",
      "The Abattis were sparring over finances, with Kerri telling the court the couple had lived an upper-class lifestyle during more than three decades of marriage. They owned a large home in California, a vacation home in Pinetop and ranch land in Wyoming and vacationed in Switzerland, Italy and Hawaii while sending their children to private school, she said.",
      "After the split, Kerri was granted $5,000 a month in temporary spousal support but last year asked for an increase to $30,000, saying she couldn't maintain her standard of living as she quit her job as a bookkeeper and office manager for the family farm in 1999 to stay home with the couple's three children. Kerri, who previously held a real estate license in Arizona, also asked for an additional $100,000 in attorney's fees, court filings show.",
      "\"I am barely scraping by each month, am handling all of the manual labor on our large property in Arizona and continuing its upkeep,\" she wrote in court filings earlier this year, adding she was living near her elderly parents. Kerri said she also needed to buy a newer car because her 2011 vehicle had more than 280,000 miles on it and sorely needed repairs.",
      "Michael Abatti said in a legal filing that he couldn't afford the increase after two bad farming years took a toll on his monthly income. He said European shifts in crop-buying to support war-plagued Ukrainian farmers and rising shipping costs were to blame along with an unusually cold and wet winter.",
      "He said in mid-2024 it cost $1,000 to grow an acre of wheat that he could sell for $700 and that he was receiving about $22,000 a month to run the farm as the business struggled to pay its creditors in full.",
      "\"The income available at this time does not warrant any increase in the amount to which the parties stipulated, let alone an increase to $30,000 per month,\" Lee Hejmanowski, Michael Abatti's family law attorney, wrote in court papers.",
      "Days later, Michael Abatti agreed to increase temporary spousal support payments to $6,400 a month, court filings show.",
      "He studied in the agricultural business management program at Colorado State University in Fort Collins before returning to California, according to a 2023 book about water issues written by his college friend, Craig Morgan, titled \"The Morality of Deceit.\"",
      "In 2009, Michael Abatti almost died from an infection caused by a flesh-eating bacteria and was hospitalized and placed in a medically induced coma for treatment, Morgan wrote in the book.",

    "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 19:48:03 -0500",
    "summary": "The Food and Drug Administration has approved a pill version of the weight-loss drug Wegovy.",
    "story": [
      "Regulators at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday gave the green light to a pill version of the blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy, the first daily oral medication to treat obesity.",
      "The FDA's approval handed drugmaker Novo Nordisk an edge over rival Eli Lilly in the race to market an obesity pill. Lilly's oral drug, orforglipron, is still under review.",
      "Both pills are GLP-1 drugs that work like widely used injectables to mimic a natural hormone that controls appetite and feelings of fullness.",
      "In recent years, Novo Nordisk's injectable Wegovy and Lilly's Zepbound have revolutionized obesity treatment globally and in the U.S., where 100 million people have the chronic disease.",
      "The Wegovy pills are expected to be available within weeks, company officials said. Availability of oral pills to treat obesity could expand the booming market for obesity treatments by broadening access and reducing costs, experts said.",
      "\"I do think that having an oral option would be really helpful, one for improving access, but also as another tool that we can offer patients,\" Dr. Reshmi Srinath, director of the Mount Sinai Weight and Metabolism Management Program in New York, told CBS News.",
      "About 1 in 8 Americans have used injectable GLP-1 drugs, according to a survey from KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group. But many more have trouble affording the costly shots.",
      "\"There's an entire demographic that can benefit from the pills,\" said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, a Massachusetts General Hospital obesity expert. \"For me, it's not just about who gets it across the finish line first. It's about having these options available to patients.\"",
      "The Novo Nordisk obesity pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide. That's the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic and in Rybelsus, a lower-dose pill approved to treat diabetes in 2019.",
      "How much weight did people lose?",
      "In a clinical trial, participants who took oral Wegovy lost 13.6% of their total body weight on average over about 15 months, compared with a 2.2% loss if they took a placebo, or dummy pill. That's nearly the same as injectable Wegovy, with an average weight loss of about 15%.",
      "Chris Mertens, 35, a pediatric lung doctor in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, joined the Novo Nordisk trial in 2022 and lost about 40 pounds using the Wegovy pill.",
      "\"It was a great option, especially when I know I had tried to do things [in] what people may term 'the right way,' with diet and exercise alone,\" Mertens told CBS News.",
      "The daily medication worked to decrease his appetite and invasive thoughts of food, he said. \"If there were days where I missed a meal, I almost didn't realize it.\"",
      "Before he lost weight, Mertens said, \"I was also seeing effects with things like my blood pressure, with one of my doctors telling me I might need to start medicine for my blood pressure because it was getting high enough, as well as cholesterol being elevated.\"",
      "Participants in the\u00a0clinical trial who took the highest dose of Lilly's orforglipron lost 11.2% of their total body weight on average over nearly 17 months, compared with a 2.1% loss in those who took a placebo.",
      "Both pills resulted in less weight loss than the average achieved with Lilly's Zepbound, or tirzepatide, which targets two gut hormones, GLP-1 and GIP, and led to a 21% average weight loss.",
      "All the GLP-1 drugs, oral or injectable, have similar side effects, including nausea and diarrhea.",
      "Both daily pills promise convenience, but the Wegovy pill must be taken with a sip of water in the morning on an empty stomach, with a 30-minute break before eating or drinking.",
      "That's because Novo Nordisk had to design the pill in a way that prevented the drug from being broken down in the stomach before it could be absorbed by the bloodstream. The drugmaker added an ingredient that protects the medication for about 30 minutes in the gut and makes it easier to take effect.",
      "By contrast, Lilly's orforglipron has no dosing restrictions. That drug is being considered under the FDA's new priority voucher program aimed at cutting drug approval times. A decision is expected by spring.",
      "How much will the Wegovy pills cost?",
      "Producing pills is generally cheaper than making drugs delivered via injections, so the cost for the new oral medications could be lower. The Trump administration earlier this year said officials had worked with drugmakers to negotiate lower prices for the GLP-1 drugs, which can cost upwards of $1,000 a month.",
      "The company said the starting dose would be available for $149 per month from some providers. Additional information on cost will be available in January.",
      "It's not clear whether daily pills or weekly injections will be preferred by patients. Although some patients dislike needles, others don't seem to mind the weekly injections, obesity experts said. Mertens turned to injectable Zepbound when he regained weight after the end of the Wegovy pill clinical trial.",
      "He said he liked the discipline of the daily pill.",
      "\"It was a little bit of an intentional routine and a reminder of today I'm taking this so that I know my choices are going to be affected for the day,\" he said.Dr. Angela Fitch, an obesity expert and chief medical officer of knownwell, a health care company, said whatever the format, the biggest benefit will be in making weight-loss medications more widely accessible and affordable.",
      "\"It's all about the price,\" she said. \"Just give me a drug at $100 a month that is relatively effective.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is set to resume garnishing the wages of some student loan borrowers who are in default beginning in early 2026, and a leading advocacy group for student loan borrowers is raising concerns.",
      "Wage garnishment notices are expected to go out to about 1,000 borrowers in default beginning the week of Jan. 7, according to The Associated Press, with the number of notices expected to increase on a monthly basis after that.",
      "The Education Department said in a statement to The AP that it would begin involuntary collection \"only after student and parent borrowers have been provided sufficient notice and opportunity to repay their loans.\"",
      "It was not immediately clear how much of their wages those in default could see garnished.",
      "\"At a time when families across the country are struggling with stagnant wages and an affordability crisis, this Administration's decision to garnish wages from defaulted student loan borrowers is cruel, unnecessary, and irresponsible,\" said Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel of the student borrower advocacy group Protect Borrowers. \"As millions of borrowers sit on the precipice of default, this Administration is using its self-inflicted limited resources to seize borrowers' wages instead of defending borrowers' right to affordable payments.\"",
      "Federal student loan borrowers are considered in default after missing payments for at least 270 days. Borrowers in default must be given at least 30 days' notice before their wages can be garnished.",
      "Student loan repayments were paused, with no interest accruing, by the first Trump administration in March 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. After several extensions under the Biden administration, payments were required to resume in Oct. 2023 after Congress blocked further extensions.",
      "In May of this year, the Education Department signaled it would move to resume wage garnishment, among other forms of involuntary collection, for those in default.",
      "More than 5 million borrowers were in default when the Education Department said in May it would begin involuntary collections through the Treasury Department's offset program, which uses measures such as withholding tax refunds, federal salaries and Social Security benefits. The department predicted 4 million more could be in default in the months that followed, which would mean nearly 25% of all student loan borrowers would be in default.",
      "Former President Joe Biden attempted to forgive student loan debt for tens of millions of people during his term, but the effort was repeatedly\u00a0rejected by courts, including a\u00a02023 ruling by the Supreme Court. The Biden administration was able to wipe out student loan debt for more than 5 million borrowers through\u00a0other forgiveness programs.",
      "In May's announcement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said, \"Going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment \u2014 both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation's economic outlook,\" she said in a statement Monday.",
      "\"There will not be any mass loan forgiveness,\" the announcement said.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" that President Trump\u00a0signed into law on July 4\u00a0also overhauled the federal student loan system, phasing out several repayment plans, including the SAVE, PAYE, IBR and ICR, capping the amount individuals can borrow for higher education, and eliminating deferment provisions for borrowers facing economic hardship.",

    "summary": "Job listings for store Santas have plunged in recent years as more families shop online and retailers look to contain costs, a new analysis found.",
    "story": [
      "As if donning an itchy red suit and entertaining kids all day weren't a tough enough gig, the nation's professional Santa Clauses face another cheer-sapping challenge this holiday season: getting a job.",
      "Job listings for store Santas are down 35% this year, compared with 2024, according to Revelio Labs. Indeed, the number of postings at malls, stores and other outlets has fallen sharply since 2022, the workforce research firm found.",
      "The reasons: Employers are cutting budgets, more malls are closing their doors, and many parents these days choose to avoid the crowds \u2014 and the experience of plopping an unsuspecting toddler on a store Santa's lap \u2014 in favor of online shopping.",
      "The drop in Santa job postings comes amid generally soft holiday-season hiring this year as retailers look to contain costs. The nation's unemployment rate surged to 4.6% in November, the highest in more than four years.",
      "The news isn't all bad for Santa wannabes. Although fewer places are hiring, pay is improving \u2014 the median hourly wage for Santa jobs is now $25, up from $21.89 in 2022, Revelio found.",
      "Then again, employers want only the most qualified candidates. Roughly 70% of listings for store Santas this year require a real beard, according to the firm, up from only 14% three years ago.",
      "\"Economists call this a composition effect: The average salary is changing, not because the actual pay is rising, but because of who's left in the hiring pool,\" Revelio said. \"As employers require real beards for most positions, they're hiring only from the higher-paid tier. Average wages climb, but it's not a story of rising pay. It's a shrinking labor market dressed up as good news.\"",
      "And to all a good night!",

    "summary": "Instacart had drawn criticism for testing an AI-based system that enabled retailers to charge different prices for the same grocery items.",
    "story": [
      "Instacart said Monday that it would halt the use of an AI-powered tool that allowed retailers to charge customers different prices for identical items on the grocery delivery platform.",
      "\"Effective immediately, Instacart is ending all item price tests on our platform,\" an Instacart spokesperson told CBS News in an email statement. \"Retailers will no longer be able to use Eversight technology to run item price tests on Instacart.\"",
      "The announcement comes after a recent investigation by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, a nonprofit advocacy group, found evidence that retailers such as Albertsons, Costco, Kroger, Safeway and Sprouts Farmers Market were testing the AI pricing system.",
      "The organizations based their findings on data gathered from more than 400 volunteers during online shopping sessions in September. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins varied by as much as 23%.",
      "\"Once we pulled back the curtain on Instacart's hidden pricing experiments, the company had no choice but to close the lab,\" Groundwork Collaborative's executive director Lindsay Owens said in a statement on Monday.",
      "The investigation also found\u00a0that Instacart was conducting algorithmic pricing tests using product information from Target. The retail giant told CBS News it has no commercial relationship with Instacart and that it was not involved in the pilot.",
      "Instacart acquired Eversight, an AI-enabled pricing platform, in 2022, and began offering pricing software to retail companies in 2023.",
      "Instacart claims the AI pricing tests did not include customers' personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral characteristics. The decision to end the use of its pricing tool was made in response to feedback from Instacart customers, a company spokesperson said Monday.",
      "Retailers will continue to set their own prices on the delivery website, and they may still offer different prices at different brick-and-mortar locations, Instacart said Monday in a blog\u00a0post.",
      "Reuters reported\u00a0on Dec. 17 that the Federal Trade Commission was probing Instacart over its AI pricing tests. The FTC declined to comment on the report, but said in a statement that it was \"disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart's alleged pricing practices.\"",
      "The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Instacart shelving its AI pricing technology.",
      "In a separate case last week, Instacart agreed to pay $60 million in customer refunds to settle federal allegations of deceptive practices after the FTC accused Instacart of falsely advertising free deliveries and not clearly disclosing service fees.",

    "summary": "Concerns about inflation, tariffs and politics weighed on consumer sentiment in December, The Conference Board said.",
    "story": [
      "American consumers in December remained downbeat about the state of the economy, a new survey shows.",
      "The Conference Board, a nonprofit group representing businesses, said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 3.8 points to 89.1 in December, from November's upwardly revised reading of 92.9. The latest figures are close to the group's reading in April, when President Trump announced tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"Despite an upward revision in November related to the end of the shutdown, consumer confidence fell again in December and remained well below this year's January peak. Four of five components of the overall index fell, while one was at a level signaling notable weakness,\" Dana Peterson, chief Economist at The Conference Board, said in a statement.",
      "A measure of Americans' short-term expectations for their income, business conditions and the job market remained stable at 70.7, but still well below 80, the marker that can signal a recession ahead. It was the 11th consecutive month that reading has come in under 80.",
      "Consumers' assessments of their current economic situation tumbled 9.5 points to 116.8. Write-in responses to the survey showed that prices and inflation remained consumers' biggest concern, along with tariffs.",
      "Perceptions of the job market also declined this month. The conference board's survey reported that 26.7% of consumers said jobs were \"plentiful,\" down from 28.2% in November. Also, 20.8% of consumers said jobs were \"hard to get,\" up from 20.1% last month.",
      "\"Consumers' write-in responses on factors affecting the economy continued to be led by references to prices and inflation, tariffs and trade and politics,\" Peterson said. \"However, December saw increases in mentions of immigration, war and topics related to personal finances \u2014 including interest rates, taxes and income, banks, and insurance.",
      "Americans remain generally sour about the economy, with most grading the nation's economic performance this year as either a \"C\" or \"D\" or worse, according to a\u00a0recent CBS News poll.",
      "\"Consumer confidence continued to tumble at the end of the year, as higher prices, a weaker labor market and the waning impact of the government shutdown weighed on household perceptions of the economy,\" Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at investment adviser Oxford Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"Consumers' perceptions of the current state of the economy are at their lowest point in five years,\" he added.",
      "Consumers still spending",
      "Consumer sentiment continued to ebb last month even as the economy accelerated. Federal data released on Tuesday showed the nation's gross domestic product expanded at a blistering 4.3% annual pace in the third quarter, up from 3.8% in the previous quarter and the strongest rate of growth in two years.",
      "\"The latest GDP data confirm that even though consumer confidence is slipping, consumers are still spending,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a report. \"The disconnect must mean that incomes are rising briskly. \u00a0But the payroll report says incomes are slowing. So the data are not sending a clear message right now.\"",
      "Consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of economic activity.",
      "Last week, the Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy gained a healthy 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October. The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the year ended in March.",

The latest figure, released by the Commerce Department, also reflects a healthy jump from the second quarter's annualized growth of 3.8%.",
      "An acceleration in consumer spending, along with an upswing in exports and government outlays, helped propel economic growth in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said. Despite widespread public concerns about the economy, consumers are continuing to open their wallets, government data shows.",
      "\"While worries surrounding the jobs market, tariffs and inflation continue to swirl, the economy continues to defy its doubters by chugging higher,\" said Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, in an email.",
      "Exports grew at an 8.8% rate, while imports, which subtract from GDP, fell another 4.7%.",
      "Inflation ticks higher",
      "Although GDP growth was surprisingly strong, inflation ticked higher from the previous quarter. Tuesday's data shows that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, a key barometer of inflation and consumer spending, rose at a 2.8% annual pace in the third quarter, compared with 2.1% between April and June.",
      "Core PCE, which excludes the more volatile food and energy categories, grew 2.9%, up from 2.6% in the previous quarter. Both are above the Federal Reserve's annual inflation target of 2%.",
      "The economy has shown resilience this year. While inflation remains higher than the Fed would like, consumer prices have not risen as much as many economists initially feared after President Trump unveiled tariffs earlier this year. Some retailers have cushioned the blow for shoppers by absorbing the added costs, while others have passed them on through higher prices.",
      "The labor market remains a weak spot, with employment numbers showing a slowdown in hiring during the second half of 2025. In November, the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, the highest since 2021.",
      "Will the momentum last?",
      "Economists expect GDP growth to slow in the fourth quarter, citing the impact of the 43-day government shutdown.",

    "summary": "Analysts point to rising geopolitical tensions and softer monetary policy as driving the year-end surge.",
    "story": [
      "Gold prices soared above $4,400 on Monday to reach a new all-time high, as analysts pointed to rising geopolitical tensions and softer monetary policy as key drivers of the surge.",
      "The price of the precious metal traded at\u00a0 $4,475 per ounce at 4 p.m. EDT after hitting a high of $4,477 per ounce earlier in the day. The asset has risen more than 70% since the start of this year. Gold is viewed as a safe-haven investment and typically acts as a hedge against inflation.",
      "\"The metals trade has been strong all year, and particularly for gold,\" Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, told CBS News. \"As its fundamentals remain intact, gold digested its recent rally to all-time highs quite well.\"",
      "Silver prices were also rallying on Monday, reaching $69 by 4 p.m. EDT. The metal is up 130% since the start of the year.",
      "Both gold and silver are on pace to reach all-time closing highs today, according to analysts. The rally comes amid expectations for a strong finish in the\u00a0stock market, where tech gains have helped boost performance.",
      "What's driving the surge in gold prices?",
      "Investors are moving money into gold due to a swirl of geopolitical factors, analysts note.",
      "Bond yields around the world floated higher at the same time major global currencies like the yen weakened, Alex Kuptsikevich, the chief market analyst at online brokerage platform FxPro, said in a statement. The combination is reviving interest in the so-called \"debasement trade\" \u2014 a strategy of moving money out of fiat currencies in favor of hard assets like gold, he noted.",
      "Other geopolitical risks, including the U.S. blockade of oil supplies from Venezuela and Ukraine's attack on a Russian shadow fleet tanker in the Mediterranean, were also pushing investors toward gold on Monday, Kuptsikevich added.",
      "Softer monetary policy may also be driving the upswing in gold prices this year, with investors more bullish after three consecutive rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Many on Wall Street expect the central bank to continue to ease monetary policy in 2026, while President Trump is set to nominate a new central bank chief before Fed chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.",
      "\"The latest leg of the rally has been driven by the market pricing in an increasingly gold-friendly 2026 outlook, with lower rates and a potentially softer dollar acting as tailwinds for the bullion,\" said Trevor Yates, senior investment analyst at Global X ETFs, a New York-based investment company.",
      "Central banks in multiple countries are also buying more gold, Yates added, helping drive up the asset's price.",
      "Demand for the precious metal from monetary authorities like the National Bank of Poland has risen in recent months, according to the World Gold Council, a trade association for the gold industry. Central bank gold purchases through October totaled 254 tonnes, a slower pace than the previous three years, the World Gold Council said earlier this month.",
      "Yates said central bank holdings are still far below their historical levels.",
      "What's the forecast for gold in 2026?",
      "Despite investor exuberance this year, the gold rally may not continue its run in 2026, according to Capital Economics. The investment advisory firm predicted in a Monday research note that the price of the precious metal could fall to $3,500 by the end of next year \u2014 and that the drop will act as a drag on silver prices.",
      "\"So goes gold, so goes silver: the end of the speculative boom in the former will also kill off the rally in the latter,\" Capital Economics said in the research note.",
      "Other analysts hold a more optimistic outlook. Yates said he expects lower interest rates and a potentially weak U.S. dollar to help boost the case for hard assets like silver into next year.",
      "\"Overall, we continue to believe we are in the early innings of a broader precious metals rally and remain constructive on both gold and silver,\" he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 07:39:06 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Communications Commission says it's banning new foreign-made drones, a move that will keep new Chinese-made drones out of the U.S. market.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Federal Communications Commission on Monday said it would ban new foreign-made drones, a move that will keep new Chinese-made drones such as those from DJI and Autel out of the U.S. market.",
      "The announcement came a year after Congress passed a defense bill that raised national security concerns about Chinese-made drones, which have become a dominant player in the U.S., widely used in farming, mapping, law enforcement and filmmaking.",
      "The bill called for stopping the two Chinese companies from selling new drones in the U.S. if a review found they posed a risk to American national security. The deadline for the review was Dec. 23.",
      "The FCC said Monday the review found that all drones and critical components produced in foreign countries, not just by the two Chinese companies, posed \"unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and to the safety and security of U.S. persons.\" But it said specific drones or components would be exempt if the Pentagon or Department of Homeland Security determined they didn't pose such risks.",
      "The FCC cited upcoming major events, such as the 2026 World Cup, America250 celebrations and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, as reasons to address potential drone threats posed by \"criminals, hostile foreign actors, and terrorists.\"",
      "Michael Robbins, president and chief executive officer of AUVSI, the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International, said in a statement that the industry group welcomes the decision. He said it's time for the U.S. not only to reduce its dependence on China but build its own drones.",
      "\"Recent history underscores why the United States must increase domestic drone production and secure its supply chains,\" Robbins said, citing Beijing's willingness to restrict critical supplies such as rare earth magnets to serve its strategic interests.",
      "A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, Lin Jian, said Tuesday that Beijing opposed the U.S. setting up \"discriminatory\" lists and urged the Trump administration to \"correct its wrong practices\" and provide a fair environment for Chinese companies, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "DJI said it was disappointed by the FCC decision. \"While DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination,\" it said in a statement.",
      "\"Concerns about DJI's data security have not been grounded in evidence and instead reflect protectionism, contrary to the principles of an open market,\" the company said.",
      "In Texas, Gene Robinson has a fleet of nine DJI drones that he uses for law enforcement training and forensic analyses. He said the new restrictions would hurt him and many others who have come to rely on the Chinese drones because of their versatility, high performance and affordable prices.",
      "But he said he understands the decision and lamented that the U.S. had outsourced the manufacturing to China. \"Now, we are paying the price,\" Robinson said. \"To get back to where we had the independence, there will be some growing pains. We need to suck it up, and let's not have it happen again.\"",
      "Also in Texas, Arthur Erickson, chief executive officer and co-founder of the drone-making company Hylio, said the departure of DJI would provide much-needed room for American companies like his to grow. New investments are pouring in to help him ramp up production of spray drones, which farmers use to fertilize their fields, and it will bring down prices, Erickson said.",
      "But he also called it \"crazy\" and \"unexpected\" that the FCC should expand the scope to all foreign-made drones and drone components. \"The way it's written is a blanket statement,\" Erickson said. \"There's a global allied supply chain. I hope they will clarify that.\"",

    "summary": "Mercedes-Benz USA and parent company Daimler AG agreed to settle allegations the automaker secretly installed devices in hundreds of thousands of vehicles to pass emission tests.",
    "story": [
      "Mercedes-Benz USA and parent company Daimer AG have agreed to pay $149.6 million to settle allegations that the automaker secretly installed devices in hundreds of thousands of vehicles to pass emission tests, a coalition of attorneys general announced Monday.",
      "According to the coalition, between 2008 and 2016 the German automaker equipped more than 211,000 diesel passenger cars and vans with software devices that optimized emission controls during tests but reduced the controls during normal operations. The devices enabled vehicles to far exceed legal limits for nitrogen oxides, a pollutant that can cause respiratory illnesses and contributes to smog.",
      "The states alleged that Mercedes installed the devices because it couldn't reach design and performance goals such as fuel efficiency while complying with emissions standards. The automaker allegedly concealed the devices from state and federal regulators and the public while marketing the vehicles as \"environmentally friendly\" and compliant with emissions standards.",
      "The agreement is still subject to court approval.",
      "Daimler AG and Mercedes-Benz USA already agreed in 2020 to pay $1.5 billion to the U.S. government and California state regulators to resolve the emissions cheating allegations.",
      "Mercedes-Benz issued a statement saying the deal announced Monday will resolve all remaining legal proceedings tied to diesel emissions in the United States, but the company still considers the accusations unfounded and denies any liability. The automaker has made \"sufficient provisions\" for the cost of the settlement, the statement said.",
      "Fifty attorneys general, including the attorneys general of the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, made up the coalition announced Monday. California was not part of the group.",
      "The settlement calls for the automaker to pay the attorneys general $120 million with another $29 million payment suspended and potentially waived pending completion of a consumer relief program.",
      "That effort will extend to the roughly 40,000 vehicles with the devices that hadn't been repaired or permanently removed from the road by Aug. 1, 2023. The owners of those vehicles would get $2,000 per vehicle if they install approved emissions modification software and an extended warranty.",
      "The settlement also calls for Mercedes to comply with reporting requirements and refrain from any further unfair or deceptive marketing or sale of diesel vehicles.",
      "Volkswagen also ended up paying $2.8 billion to settle a criminal case due to emissions cheating.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ivf-treatments-aetna-same-sex-couples-settlement/",
    "published": "Mon, 22 Dec 2025 15:21:16 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge has approved a preliminary agreement for a class action lawsuit requiring Aetna to cover fertility treatments for same-sex couples as they do with heterosexual couples.",
    "story": [
      "Like many young girls, Mara Berton and June Higginbotham both knew from an early age they wanted families and to become mothers. But as lesbians, they were excluded from accessing the same fertility treatment insurance benefits offered to heterosexual peers.",
      "Instead, like many other same-sex couples, Berton and Higginbotham, who live in California, had to pay $45,000 out of pocket to conceive while heterosexual colleagues with the same insurance plan had many of those costs covered.",
      "\"We knew it wasn't right,\" Berton said in an exclusive interview with CalMatters. She joined a class action lawsuit challenging the policy. \"What we're fighting for is about family building and having kids ... It was really important to both of us, I think, that other couples not have to do this.\"",
      "Last week, in a landmark settlement, U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of California Haywood Gilliam Jr. approved a preliminary agreement for the class action lawsuit requiring Aetna to cover fertility treatments for same-sex couples \u2014 like artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization \u2014 as they do with heterosexual couples. It is the first case requiring a health insurer to apply this policy nationally across all of its enrollees. An estimated 2.8 million LGBTQ members will benefit, including 91,000 Californians.",
      "Under the settlement, Aetna will also pay at least $2 million in damages to California-based members who qualify. Those who may be eligible must submit a claim by June 29, 2026.",
      "\"I truly hope that this is the first of many insurers to change their policy,\" said Alison Tanner, senior litigation counsel for reproductive rights and health at the National Women's Law Center. \"We were looking at that as an issue of inequality \u2014 that folks who were in same-sex relationships were being treated differently.\"",
      "Roughly 9 million additional Californians will soon have access to mandated fertility benefits under a new law taking effect in January. The law applies to state-regulated plans \u2014 which Aetna is not in this case \u2014 and amends the definition of infertility to include same-sex couples and single people.",
      "Previously, Aetna's policy required enrollees to engage in six to 12 months of \"unprotected heterosexual sexual intercourse\" without conceiving before qualifying for fertility benefits, according to the class action complaint. The policy allowed for women \"without a male partner\" to access benefits only after undergoing six to 12 cycles of artificial insemination unsuccessfully depending on age.",
      "Lawyers argued that the policy fundamentally treated LGBTQ members differently and effectively denied them access to the benefit, which can be prohibitively expensive for many people.",
      "In an email, Aetna spokesperson Phillip Blando said the plan provides infertility benefits in accordance with each member's plan, coverage rules and applicable law.",
      "\"Aetna is committed to equal access to infertility coverage and reproductive health coverage for all its members, and we will continue to strive toward improving access to services for our entire membership,\" Blando said.",
      "Berton, who was the lead plaintiff in the case, said she was blindsided by the policy. She had consulted with a fertility clinic and decided to move forward with donor sperm and artificial insemination, when a representative from Aetna called and said she did not meet the definition of infertility.",
      "She appealed the decision multiple times; she was rejected. The experience felt \"dehumanizing,\" her wife Higginbotham said.",
      "Insurance had dictated Berton attempt 12 rounds of artificial insemination before she would be eligible for benefits. Her doctors recommended no more than four rounds.",
      "Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy director for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said a policy like that could only be designed to dissuade people from accessing their health benefits. Doctors typically recommend three to four cycles of artificial insemination before IVF, but Tipton said there have also been studies showing it is more efficient and cost effective to go straight to IVF.",
      "In 2023, the society updated its medical definition of infertility to include LGBTQ folks and individuals who don't have partners. They did so in part to stop insurers from denying claims like Berton and Higginbotham's.",
      "\"The driving force was a realization that it takes two kinds of gametes to have kids,\" Tipton said. \"Regardless of the cause of that absence, you have to have access in order to be treated for a fertility issue.\"",
      "Since the definition changed, Tipton said more employers and insurers are covering benefits for LGBTQ folks or single people. They have also leveraged the definition to enact statewide benefits expansions, including California's upcoming fertility benefits mandate.",
      "Berton and Higginbotham said they also worried about running out of donor sperm that matched Higginbotham's Jewish and Native American heritage \u2014 and was limited in supply.",
      "\"I don't feel like your insurance should be involved in those types of decisions and kind of determine your journey,\" Berton said.",
      "The couple pulled together money from family members and decided to proceed even without coverage. After four unsuccessful rounds of intrauterine insemination, they moved on to IVF, partially to give themselves the best chance of conceiving with the donor they chose.",
      "The experience was \"all consuming\" and emotionally difficult as Berton endured hormone injections, egg retrievals and a miscarriage. But today, she and Higginbotham have two healthy twin girls whose favorite thing is to play on the swings and \"take every book off of their shelf\" for their mothers to read.",
      "The couple achieved their family dreams before the lawsuit concluded. Even so, Higginbotham said she hopes the settlement will help other LGBTQ couples across the country.",
      "\"I know people that don't have children, that wanted children, because the stuff isn't covered. I know people that their timeline was delayed and maybe they have fewer kids than they wanted,\" Higginbotham said. \"The settlement is such a huge step forward that is really righting a huge wrong.\"",

      "Called \"clutter,\" this radar interference can make it difficult to identify legitimate moving targets, Interior noted.",
      "The action comes two weeks after a federal judge struck down President Trump's executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was \"arbitrary and capricious\" and violates U.S. law.",
      "Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump's Jan. 20\u00a0executive order\u00a0blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.",

    "summary": "The main distillery will be closed for site enhancements, the company said. The pause comes after whiskey production has dropped amid a challenging year.",
    "story": [
      "The maker of Jim Beam bourbon whiskey said it plans to pause production at its main distillery in Kentucky starting Jan. 1.",
      "Jim Beam, which is owned by a U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Suntory Holdings, said in an email to CBS News that its distillery in Clermont, Kentucky, will temporarily halt production \"while we take the opportunity to invest in site enhancements.\" The company plans to keep its James B. Beam campus open for visitors during that time, the company added.",
      "Jim Beam will continue to distill at its Fred B. Noe craft distillery in Clermont and Booker Noe distillery in Boston, Kentucky.",
      "The pause comes amid several challenges in the wine and spirits industry. Americans overall are drinking less, with Gallup finding that the share of U.S. adults who consume alcohol has fallen to 54%, near a 90-year low.",
      "Exports of U.S.-produced spirits fell 9% in the second quarter, partly due to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, according to an October report from the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group. Exports to Canada were particularly hard hit, declining by 85% during the period, after Canadian retailers pulled U.S. spirits from shelves in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs, the group noted.",
      "Through August, whiskey distillers had produced 55 million fewer proof gallons this year than a year ago, a decline of 28%, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader. A proof gallon is one U.S. gallon of liquid that is 50% proof alcohol.",
      "Whiskey connoisseurs may not have to worry about supplies running low. Kentucky warehouses now hold a record 16.1 million barrels of aging bourbon, according to the Kentucky Distillers' Association. The total \u2014 reported in October \u2014 marks the highest level since the repeal of Prohibition and reflects a 27% increase from 2024, the group said.",
      "The surge in bourbon supplies is partly due to an increase in the number of distillers located in Kentucky, the group said. But the industry is also witnessing a dip in demand due to uncertainty over tariffs, declining exports and shifts in drinking habits, it added.",
      "Bourbon, a type of whiskey, must adhere to U.S. distilling laws to be labeled as such. For instance, the liquor must be aged in new, charred oak containers and the grain recipe must be at least 51% corn, according to whiskey tourism site Bourbon Country.",

    "summary": "A CBS News Confirmed analysis of a dozen skincare influencers' accounts found that many featured ingredients not suitable for kids and were undisclosed brand partnerships or sponsored posts.",
    "story": [
      "In a TikTok video, then-17-year-old actor Symonne Harrison unveils a bathroom counter full of products from the skincare brand Drunk Elephant that would retail for at least $700 total.",
      "\"Guys, I just got the biggest package from them,\" Harrison tells her 3.8 million followers, adding that she's new to the brand's \"family.\" \"I know Drunk Elephant is known for mixing, doing little potion vibes.\"",
      "Those \"potions\" are so-called \"skincare smoothies,\" popular on social media and marketed by the brand, which suggests trios of products to mix together as part of a skincare regimen. They've become a blueprint for some of Generation Alpha's favorite \"get ready with me\" videos as skincare products and adult influencers who promote them have become increasingly trendy among tweens.",
      "But like in Harrison's video \u2014 which features an eye cream containing vitamin C that Drunk Elephant recommends those 12 and under avoid \u2014 many of those social media posts advertise products not suitable for such young skin. (Harrison did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.)",
      "CBS News Confirmed analyzed more than a dozen popular TikTok accounts featuring skincare-obsessed teens and tweens and found that many featured products with anti-aging ingredients that, according to dermatologists, can be harmful to young skin. Often, those were promotions done in partnership with brands.",
      "Nielsen data show that households with children 12 and under spent $2.4 billion in 2023 on skincare and makeup \u2014 more than households with teens.",
      "ALSO READ:\u00a0California bill targeting anti-aging skincare sales to minors dies without vote | \"Sephora kids\" investigation",
      "Dr. Smita Awasthi, director of pediatric dermatology at U.C. Davis Health, said certain skincare products are meant to peel the skin, but removing the outer layer of a child's skin can lead to painful rashes and increased risk of sunburns. While she does prescribe retinoids for acne treatment to children in some rare cases, she stresses there is a stark difference between over-the-counter retinoid acne treatments and the retinol used in cosmetics.",
      "\"When I'm prescribing a retinoid, I know the concentration, and I know exactly what it is and how it's going to work,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Cosmetic retinol products include different ingredients which she said can lead to increased risk of irritation and adverse reactions in young skin.",
      "Packaging for over-the-counter acne retinoids clearly identify that it is an acne treatment, she said. But many popular skincare products that contain retinols and other harsh anti-aging ingredients don't clearly identify what they are intended for or that the ingredients can be harmful to young skin.",
      "Kierstyn McBrayer, a 22-year-old content creator who focuses on makeup and skincare, told CBS News her audience is mostly tweens. Her 16-year-old sister first got into skincare about three years ago, she said, and was using products with retinol and vitamin C until she realized they weren't good for her skin. Other viewers have told her they were doing the same until they learned what was harming their skin.",
      "\"A lot of the problem is just kids watching adults doing skincare content, and I know a lot of these adults are probably not purposely aiming their content at children, but it's kind of hard because it's like [in the] past few years, skincare content has been considered heavily by children,\" she said.",
      "In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would make it illegal to sell certain anti-aging cosmetics to children under 18 years old. The bill was defeated last year and reintroduced in the current legislative session.",
      "But while the proposed law would target retailers, brands could continue to use social media and kid-friendly branding and packaging to market their products to children.",
      "A CBS News review of 240 recent skincare posts from a dozen popular teen influencers on TikTok showed only 15 videos, or just 6% of posts, were tagged as promotional content.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission requires that online influencers disclose when they have a \"material connection\" to a brand, including being paid or receiving free products. The agency's website specifies the disclosure should not be mixed in with a group of hashtags or links.",
      "TikTok instructs creators to turn on the \"content disclosure setting\" when promoting a brand or product; this would add a label to the video that clearly states the footage is \"promotional content\" or a \"paid partnership.\" If the setting is not enabled, TikTok could remove or restrict the video.",
      "Embreigh Courtlyn, 15, often posts \"get ready with me\" TikToks \u2014 chatty, casual videos showing people doing skincare or makeup or getting dressed. In one video, she holds up two face masks from the Korean skincare brand I Dew Care, saying, \"It's my favorite face mask ever.\" At the bottom of the video is a small label that reads \"paid partnership.\"",
      "Courtlyn's manager told CBS News, \"For any brand deal she accepts, she either enables the paid partnership tab or includes #[brand]partner in the caption to ensure compliance with FTC guidelines.\"",
      "Sometimes TikTokers signal promos to their audience in less obvious ways, such as putting #ad or #partner in the caption.",
      "Mar Taylor, a 17-year-old with more than 270,000 TikTok followers, said the skincare brands he's worked with have instructed him on how to stylize and label the footage. Taylor used the hashtag \"glowpartner\" in a TikTok advertising Glow Recipe's new toner. Taylor also said brands can give influencers a custom discount code to share with their audience, and the influencers receive a cut of the money when people use the code.",
      "McBrayer said sometimes brands will ask her not to label her collaboration videos with #ad. Instead, they ask to be referred to as \"partners.\"",
      "She said this may be because videos with #ad don't perform as well, something she has noticed in her own TikTok content.",
      "This means that whether content creators intend to or not, they're advertising products to children who may not realize they're being marketed to.",
      "\"We know that developmentally, they don't recognize ads at the same level that adults do,\" said Drew Cingel, an associate professor at U.C. Davis who studies the intersection of adolescents, psychology and social media marketing. \"And it becomes much more blurred in a social media environment.\"",
      "\"I can't tell you how many tweens that I've spoken to that say, when I grow up, I want to be an influencer,\" he added. \"If they see a teenage influencer getting these products, getting likes and getting all of the social gratification and money, that's what they're going to want to do.\"",
      "As the skincare trend among tweens has grown, some brands launched counter-marketing campaigns to tell kids they don't need elaborate skincare routines. Dove launched a campaign called \"Face of 10\" where dermatologists post videos aiming to inform kids about appropriate skincare. On Instagram, Kiehl's posted an image of a young boy in the sand labeled \"the only exfoliating kids should do,\" and a young girl in a ballet class labeled \"the only 10-step routine kids should learn.\"",
      "At the same time, many skincare brands feature kid-friendly packaging and marketing. While Drunk Elephant advertises \"skincare smoothies,\" Glow Recipe sells a $76 \"glow essentials kit\" in a box made to look like a pink locker and labeled \"back to school.\" The set contains a watermelon toner and strawberry primer with beta hydroxy acid and a lip balm with hyaluronic acid, all ingredients dermatologists say tweens should avoid.",
      "Drunk Elephant and Glow Recipe did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "\"How do you get a child's attention amid all these other products in a store?\" Cingel said. \"You put fruits, you put things that are cute on it, you put bright colors, we know that those things draw and hold children's attention.\"",

    "summary": "The Veterans Affairs Department is reimposing a near total ban on abortions for veterans and their families that was modified in 2022.",
    "story": [
      "The Veterans Affairs Department is reimposing a near total ban on abortions for veterans and their families after a Justice Department memo from the Office of Legal Counsel last week\u00a0asserted that it's against federal law for the VA to provide them in most instances.",
      "VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz told CBS News, \"The Department of Justice's opinion states that VA is not legally authorized to provide abortions, and VA is complying with it immediately. DOJ's opinion is consistent with VA's proposed rule, which continues to work its way through the regulatory process.\"",
      "In 2022, the department modified its 1999 abortion rules\u00a0to allow \"access to abortions when the life or health of the pregnant Veteran would be endangered if the pregnancy were carried to term, or when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest,\"\u00a0the VA website states.",
      "Now, under the guidance given by the Office of Legal Counsel, the VA's proposed rule reinstates \"the full exclusion on abortions and abortion counseling from the medical benefits package.\"",
      "The proposed rule does have one exception, stating that the \"VA has never understood this policy to prohibit providing care to pregnant women in life-threatening circumstances, including treatment for ectopic pregnancies or miscarriages, which were covered under the VA's medical benefits package prior to the 2022. ... For the avoidance of doubt, the proposed rule would make clear that the exclusion for abortion does not apply 'when a physician certifies that the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.'\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington condemned the VA's move in a post on X, saying it \"is yet another attack on reproductive freedom and a profound betrayal of veterans who put their lives on the line for our country.\" And Democratic Rep. Judy Chu of California, said on X that denying veterans \"the freedom to make their own health care decisions\u2014especially survivors of military sexual trauma\u2014is cruel, dangerous, and an insult to all who have served.\"",
      "The VA argued in its proposed rule that it is \"without question that VA has the authority to bar provision of abortion services through the VA medical benefits package to veterans\" and says the Biden administration implemented the changes to the abortion ban in response to the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturning women's abortion rights. \"In doing so, the administration predicted a high demand for VA abortions that never materialized,\" the proposed rule states.",
      "The Center for Reproductive Rights said in a press release that the policy \"is effectively a national abortion ban for veterans, preventing them and their families from receiving abortions at VA health care facilities in all 50 states, including the 14 states that protect abortion rights.\"",

    "summary": "Strikes against ISIS targets in Nigeria come after President Trump spent weeks accusing the West African country's government of failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Thursday that the U.S. launched \"powerful and deadly\" strikes against Islamic State forces in Nigeria, after spending weeks accusing the West African country's government of failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.",
      "\"Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!\" Mr. Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \"I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not provide further details on the strikes, such as how many people were killed, who or what was specifically targeted, or how many strikes were carried out, other than to say they were \"numerous perfect strikes.\"",
      "U.S. Africa Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in Africa, said in a statement that its \"initial assessment is that multiple ISIS terrorists were killed in the ISIS camps.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted on X: \"The President was clear last month: the killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria (and elsewhere) must end. \"The @DeptofWar is always ready, so ISIS found out tonight \u2014 on Christmas. More to come\u2026 Grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation.\"",
      "The Defense Department posted to its X account\u00a0an unclassified 9-second video that appeared to show a missile being launched from a military vessel.",
      ".@POTUS \u201cTonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ct7rUW128t",
      "In its own statement, Nigeria's foreign ministry acknowledged the strikes\u00a0and indicated that it was given advanced notice, saying that \"Nigerian authorities remain engaged in structured security cooperation with international partners, including the United States of America, in addressing the persistent threat of terrorist and violent extremism. This has led to precision hits on terrorist targets in Nigeria by air strikes in the North West.\"",
      "\"Terrorist violence in any form, whether directed at Christians, Muslims or other communities, remains an affront to Nigeria's values and to international peace and security,\" the ministry added.",
      "Nigerian\u00a0 Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar went further, telling a local television network his nation provided the U.S. with intelligence on jihadists before the raids, French news agency AFP reported. It quoted him as saying he spoke by phone with Secretary of State Marco Rubio \"for 19 minutes before the strike and then we spoke again for another five minutes before it went on.\"",
      "Asked if there would be more strikes, Tuggar said: \"It is an ongoing thing, and we are working with the U.S. We are working with other countries as well.\"",
      "In early November, Mr. Trump said that he had instructed the Pentagon to \"prepare for possible action\" in Nigeria after he alleged that Nigeria's government was not doing enough to combat the persecution of Christians there.",
      "\"If we attack, it will be fast, vicious and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians! WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!\" Mr. Trump wrote on Nov. 1.",
      "In response at the time, Hegseth wrote on social media that the Department of War, the Trump administration's preferred term for the Defense Department, was \"preparing for action.\"",
      "This comes about a week after the U.S. conducted a series of strikes on ISIS targets in Syria in response to the killing of two U.S. soldiers and an interpreter.",
      "Mr. Trump in November also said he would be designating Nigeria as a \"country of particular concern.\"",
      "Designating a \"country of particular concern\" under the\u00a01998 International Religious Freedom Act\u00a0is an executive prerogative that normally follows recommendations from both the congressionally mandated U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and the State Department.",
      "The State Department usually releases\u00a0its annual\u00a0Report on International Religious Freedom in the spring, but has not yet done so this year. The report may or may not include \"particular concern\" designations, which can be done at any time. And, such designations, which authorize U.S. penalties, do not necessarily impose sanctions.",
      "The Nigerian government has rejected Mr. Trump's claims that it is not doing enough to protect Christians from violence. Analysts have said that while Christians are among those targeted, the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria's Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur. Earlier Thursday, at least five people were killed and dozens more injured in an explosion at a mosque in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri.",
      "Nigeria's President Bola Ahmed Tinubu previously said on social media that the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality.",
      "\"Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,\" Tinubu said. \"Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.\"",
      "Nigeria was first placed on the \"country of particular concern\"\u00a0list\u00a0by the U.S. in 2020 in what the State Department called \"systematic violations of religious freedom.\" But the designation did not single out attacks on Christians. The designation was lifted in 2023 in what many saw as a way to improve ties between the countries ahead of a visit by then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken.",

    "story": [
      "Talk show host\u00a0Jimmy Kimmel\u00a0took aim at President Trump as he warned Thursday about the rise of fascism in an address to U.K. viewers dubbed \"The Alternative Christmas Message.\"",
      "The message, aired on Channel 4 on Christmas Day, reflected on the impact of the second term in office for Mr. Trump, who Kimmel said acts like he's a king.",
      "\"From a fascism perspective, this has been a really great year,\" he said. \"Tyranny is booming over here.\"",
      "The channel began a tradition of airing an alternative Christmas message in 1993, as a counterpart to the\u00a0British monarch's annual televised address\u00a0to the nation. Channel 4 said the message is often a thought-provoking and personal reflection pertinent to the events of the year.",
      "The comedian has skewered Mr. Trump since returning to the air after ABC suspended\u00a0\"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"\u00a0in September following criticism of comments the host made over the killing of conservative activist\u00a0Charlie Kirk.",

      "Mr. Trump celebrated\u00a0the suspension\u00a0of the veteran late-night comic and his frequent critic, calling it \"great news for America.\" He also called for other late-night hosts to be fired.",
      "The incident, one of Mr. Trump's many disputes and legal battles waged with the media, drew widespread concerns about freedom of speech and freedom of the press.",
      "Hundreds of leading Hollywood stars and others in the entertainment industry urged Americans to \"fight to defend and preserve our constitutionally protected rights.\" The show returned to the air less than a week later.",
      "Kimmel told the U.K. audience that a Christmas miracle had happened in September when millions of people \u2014 some who hated his show \u2014 had spoken up for free speech.",
      "\"We won, the president lost, and now I'm back on the air every night giving the most powerful politician on earth a right and richly deserved bollocking,\" he said.",
      "Channel 4 previously invited whistle-blower Edward Snowden and former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to deliver the alternative Christmas message.",
      "Kimmel, who said he didn't expect Brits to know who he was, warned that silencing critics is not just something that happens in Russia or North Korea.",
      "Despite the split that led to the American Revolution 250 years ago, he said the two nations still shared a special relationship and urged the U.K. not to give up on the U.S. as it was \"going through a bit of a wobble right now.\"",
      "\"Here in the United States right now, we are both figuratively and literally tearing down the structures of our democracy from the free press to science to medicine to judicial independence to the actual White House itself,\" Kimmel said, in reference to the demolition of the building's East Wing. \"We are a right mess, and we know this is also affecting you, and I just wanted to say sorry.\"",

    "summary": "A planned Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center has been canceled.",
    "story": [
      "A planned Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center, a holiday tradition at the Washington, D.C., performing arts center dating back more than 20 years, has been canceled.",
      "The show's host, musician Chuck Redd, told The Associated Press he called off the performance after the White House announced last week that President Trump's name would be added to the facility \u2014 drawing pushback from Democratic lawmakers and some scholars, who say the change violates the law. According to the White House, the president's handpicked board approved the decision to rename the institution the Trump-Kennedy Center. The revised name later appeared on the building's facade.",
      "\"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" Redd told The Associated Press in an email Wednesday. Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player who has toured with everyone from Dizzy Gillespie to Ray Brown, has been presiding over holiday \"Jazz Jams\" at the Kennedy Center since 2006, succeeding bassist William \"Keter\" Betts.",
      "The Kennedy Center did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The center's website lists the show as canceled.",
      "President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and Congress passed a law naming the center as a living memorial to him.\u00a0The law explicitly prohibits the board of trustees adding any additional memorials to the site.",
      "The decision to rename the center has drawn steep criticism from congressional Democrats and some members of Kennedy's family. Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio sued over the renaming Monday, calling it a \"flagrant violation of the rule of law\" and noting that the name can't be changed without an act of Congress.",
      "The center's president, Richard Grenell, who was appointed by Mr. Trump,\u00a0has argued that the center's status as a memorial to Kennedy wasn't changed.",
      "Mr. Trump, a Republican, has been deeply involved with the center named for an iconic Democrat after mostly ignoring it during his first term. He has forced out its leadership, overhauled the board while arranging for himself to head it and personally hosted this year's Kennedy Center honors, breaking a long tradition of presidents mostly serving as spectators.",
      "Numerous artists have called off Kennedy Center performances since Mr. Trump returned to office, including Issa Rae and Peter Wolf. Lin-Manuel Miranda canceled a planned production of \"Hamilton.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump spent part of Christmas Eve bantering with kids about their Christmas lists, updating families about Santa Claus' whereabouts and reminding one child who wavered on leaving out cookies that the big guy has a \"serious appetite.\"",
      "The president and first lady Melania Trump, who are at Mar-a-Lago for the holidays, fielded calls that were routed through the North American Aerospace Defense Command, whose annual Santa-tracking hotline\u00a0received nearly 400,000 calls last year. NORAD also runs an online service that maps\u00a0Santa's route across the globe.",
      "Asked by one 10-year-old from Oklahoma how NORAD keeps track of St. Nick, the president said, \"We track Santa all over the world. We want to make sure that Santa is being good.\"",
      "Mr. Trump continued: \"We want to make sure that he's not infiltrated, that we're not infiltrating into our country a bad Santa. So we found out that Santa is good.\"",
      "That child's 4-year-old sister told the president that she wants a dollhouse for Christmas. Mr. Trump predicted that she'll get what she's looking for, telling her mother, \"I think we can work that out.\"",
      "\"We owe a lot to Santa, so I think Santa will fulfill your wish,\" he said.",
      "Later on, as NORAD showed Santa passing somewhere over Sweden, the president told an 8-year-old from Kansas wondering when St. Nick would arrive at her home that he should \"make it in record time, probably in about 5 hours.\"",
      "The Kansan told the president she didn't want to end up with coal under the Christmas tree. Mr. Trump responded with one of his oft-repeated slogans: \"You mean clean, beautiful coal?\"",
      "A 10-year-old and a 6-year-old told the president they want a Kindle reader and a pinball machine, respectively. The president was impressed by both gifts.",
      "\"You know Elton John? He did 'Pinball Wizard,'\" Mr. Trump said, referencing a tune that was originally performed by The Who, but covered by John\u00a0for the film adaptation of their album \"Tommy.\" \"We'll have to send you a copy of 'Pinball Wizard.'\"",
      "To the reader, Mr. Trump said: \"Oh wow, that's pretty good. You must be a high-IQ person. We need more high-IQ people in the country.\"",
      "Tempting fate, one 8-year-old from North Carolina asked Mr. Trump if Santa will get upset if she doesn't leave out milk and cookies the night before Christmas.",
      "The president's advice? \"I would leave them. I think Santa has a serious appetite.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said earlier in the call: \"He won't get mad, but I think he'll be very disappointed. Santa's \u2014 he tends to be a little bit on the cherubic side. You know what cherubic means? A little on the heavy side. I think Santa would like some cookies.\"",
      "NORAD has tracked Santa's progress every Christmas Eve since 1955, and the past few presidents have joined in taking a handful of calls, which are mostly fielded by volunteers at the Colorado-based military command.",
      "In 2018, Mr. Trump asked one 7-year-old if she still believes in Santa. When she answered in the affirmative, he joked: \"Because at 7, that's marginal, right?\"",
      "And three years later, a father ended his call with former President Joe Biden by saying \"let's go Brandon,\" using a coded insult for the then-president. Biden responded: \"Let's go Brandon, I agree.\"",
      "During this year's event, the president spent about 20 minutes taking calls from families, followed by a series of calls to U.S. military service members who are on duty over the holiday.",
      "Mr. Trump later penned a Christmas Eve message on Truth Social that struck a less conciliatory tone, with attacks on the \"Radical  Left Scum that is doing everything possible to destroy our Country\" and references to this week's stronger-than-expected\u00a0GDP numbers.",
      "Mr. Trump also briefly touted the GDP report at one point between Santa-tracking calls, but he conceded: \"I don't think the kids are too interested in that.\"",

      "Trump-backed candidate Nasry Asfura won Honduras' presidential election, the country's electoral authorities said Wednesday afternoon, ending a weeks-long count.",
      "The election result has continued a swing to the right in parts of Latin America, just a week after Chile chose the far-right politician Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast as its next president.",
      "Asfura, of the conservative National Party, received 40.27% of the vote in the Nov. 30, edging out four-time candidate Salvador Nasralla of the conservative Liberal Party, who finished with 39.39% of the vote.",
      "Asfura won in his second bid for the presidency, after he and Nasralla were neck-and-neck during a long vote count that fueled international concern over the Central American nation's fragile electoral system.",
      "On Tuesday night, a number of electoral officials and candidates were already fighting and contesting the results of the election. Meanwhile, followers in Asfura's campaign headquarters erupted into cheers.",
      "\"Honduras: I am prepared to govern,\" wrote Asfura, the former mayor of Honduras' capital Tegucigalpa, in a post on X shortly after the results were released. \"I will not let you down.\"",
      "The results were a rebuke of the current leftist leader and her governing democratic socialist Liberty and Re-foundation Party, known as LIBRE, whose candidate finished in a distant third place with 19.19% of the vote.",
      "Asfura ran as a pragmatic politician, pointing to his popular infrastructure projects in the capital. President Trump endorsed the 67-year-old conservative just days before the vote, saying he was the only Honduran candidate the U.S. administration would work with.",
      "\"If he doesn't win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Late last month, Mr. Trump also\u00a0pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez \u2014 a National Party member \u2014 on drug trafficking and weapons charges, allowing him to leave a U.S. federal prison. The U.S. president claimed Hernandez was \"treated very harshly and unfairly,\" but his decision drew criticism from some members of both parties.",
      "Nasralla has alleged that the election was fraudulent and called for a recount of all the votes just hours before the official results were announced.",
      "On Tuesday night, he addressed Mr. Trump in a post on X, writing: \"Mr. President, your endorsed candidate in Honduras is complicit in silencing the votes of our citizens. If he is truly worthy of your backing, if his hands are clean, if he has nothing to fear, then why doesn't he allow for every vote to be counted?\"",
      "He and others opponents of Asfura have maintained that Mr. Trump's last-minute endorsement was an act of electoral interference that ultimately swung the results of the vote.",
      "The unexpectedly tumultuous election was also marred by a sluggish vote count, which fueled even more accusations.",
      "The Central American nation was stuck in limbo for more than three weeks as vote-counting by electoral authorities lagged, and at one point was paralyzed after a special count of final vote tallies was called, fueling warnings by international leaders.",
      "Ahead of the announcement, Organization of American States Secretary General Albert Rambin on Monday made an \"urgent call\" to Honduran authorities to wrap up a special count of the final votes before a deadline of Dec. 30. The Trump administration warned that any attempts to obstruct or delay the electoral count would be met with \"consequences.\"",
      "For the incumbent, progressive President Xiomara Castro, the election marked a political reckoning. She was elected in 2021 on a promise to reduce violence and root out corruption.",
      "She was among a group of progressive leaders in Latin American who were elected on a hopeful message of change around five years ago, but are now being cast out after failing to deliver on their vision. Castro said last week that she would accept the results of the elections even after she claimed that Mr. Trump's actions in the election amounted to an \"electoral coup.\"",
      "But Eric Olson, an independent international observer during the Honduran election with the Seattle International Foundation, and other observers said that the rejection of Castro and her party was so definitive that they had little room to contest the results.",
      "\"Very few people, even within LIBRE, believe they won the election. What they will say is there's been fraud, that there has been intervention by Donald Trump, that we we should tear up the elections and vote again,\" Olson said. \"But they're not saying 'we won the elections.' It's pretty clear they did not.\"",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge blocked President Trump's attempt to strip a security clearance from whistleblower attorney Mark Zaid Tuesday, finding that the Trump administration did so in \"retribution\" and without proper due process.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled Tuesday night that \"the government's retribution\" against Zaid was \"carried out by summarily canceling the attorney's security clearance without any of the process that is afforded to others.\" Ali said the administration had not conducted an individualized national security assessment of Zaid's clearance before stripping him of it.",
      "The judge also found that Zaid introduced credible evidence that he \"cannot properly advise current clients because he is precluded from accessing classified material and using classified information\" in their defense.",
      "Zaid sued the Trump administration in May after Mr. Trump rescinded his security clearance, as well as the clearances of prominent Democrats, including former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and several members of the Biden administration. Mr. Trump's order said that it was \"no longer in the national interest\" for Zaid and the other individuals listed to access classified information.",
      "Zaid represented the whistleblower who reported concerns about the president's dealings with Ukraine during his first term, and in Mr. Trump's second term, he's also been retained by many whistleblowers. Zaid had held a security clearance for over two decades.",
      "Ali, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, granted Zaid's motion for a preliminary injunction to \"immediately and fully restore\" his security clearance and access to classified information. The judge put his order on hold for 21 days to allow the Justice Department to consider an appeal. If there is no appeal, the order is set to go into place on Jan. 13.",
      "Ali also rejected a Justice Department motion to dismiss the lawsuit.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sometimes wrecking balls and bulldozers move faster than the legal system.",
      "That's the dilemma facing the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which lost its bid to temporarily halt construction of the White House ballroom last week. A judge sided with President Trump, allowing work to continue on the East Wing site while imposing limited requirements on the administration.",
      "\"The American people own these places. And we, the American people, have a right to weigh in when significant changes to them are proposed,\" Carol Quillen, president and CEO of the Trust, said in an interview with CBS News. \"This project needs to follow the already legally mandated processes.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has overhauled parts of the White House at a sprinter's pace and with virtually no oversight. The East Wing and the corridor connecting it to the main residence were dismantled in a matter of days in October.",
      "Mr. Trump's next architectural adventure is anyone's guess, but it appears there's little standing in his way.",
      "Quillen said she has \"deep concern\" about future projects. The Trust's lawsuit seeks a judicial declaration that would impose pre-demolition requirements on White House construction so that more pieces of the building are not disappeared before experts and the public have a chance to weigh in.",
      "The White House argues the 90,000-square-foot ballroom project is not yet far enough along to require approval from entities that typically have oversight of federal construction in Washington, D.C. Construction plans, government lawyers told the court, have not been finalized.",
      "As for future projects at the executive mansion, a White House official said, \"There are no plans for any demolition of any structures at this time.\"",
      "Quillen said there was a silver lining in Judge Richard Leon's ruling against the Trust.",
      "\"We view the judge's order as really helpful. And we learned a lot and it actually facilitates our aims in the suit,\" Quillen said.",
      "While ruling against the Trust, Leon ordered the government to file construction plans with the National Capital Planning Commission and Commission of Fine Arts by the end of the month \u2014 something the White House had already signaled it intended to do.",
      "The administration has argued that it has no obligation to file construction plans with the NCPC prior to demolition because the commission's authority, it says, only applies to vertical construction \u2014 not demolition.",
      "The government also produced a previously unpublished environmental assessment of the ballroom. That document provided some details about the project's scope, timeline and the steps taken to preserve and prepare White House grounds for the 90,000-square-foot addition. The National Park Service completed the assessment in August, but it was not released until last week in a court filing.",
      "The Trust is also asking the court to enforce a law that would require ballroom construction to obtain congressional approval. The law holds that, \"A building or structure shall not be erected on any reservation, park, or public grounds of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia without express authority of Congress.\"",
      "Congressional Republicans, who hold a majority in both houses, have yet to take a formal interest in the ballroom. The $400 million project is privately financed, and thus far no congressional appropriation or approval resolution is under consideration.",
      "The White House maintains the president has the unilateral authority to build on White House grounds.",
      "Quillen argues that because the White House has so far operated outside the process typically required for other federal construction in Washington, experts and the public have been excluded from providing pre-demolition input, and history could be lost.",
      "\"When projects like this go through these processes, the outcome ends up being better. The people have a voice. You build more support for the project. It becomes a more lasting legacy and improvements can be made to it along the way,\" Quillen said.",
      "The National Capital Planning Commission is slated to hear a presentation on the ballroom on Jan. 8. Another court hearing is scheduled for Jan. 15.",

    "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:04:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The declaration issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services called treatments like puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries unsafe and ineffective for children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria.",
    "story": [
      "A coalition of 19 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and its inspector general over a declaration that could complicate access to gender-affirming care for young people.",
      "The declaration issued last Thursday called treatments like puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries unsafe and ineffective for children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria, or the distress when someone's gender expression doesn't match their sex assigned at birth. It also warned doctors that they could be excluded from federal health programs like Medicare and Medicaid if they provide those types of care.",
      "The declaration came as HHS also announced proposed rules meant to further curtail gender-affirming care for young people, although the lawsuit doesn't address those as they are not final.",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon, alleges that the declaration is inaccurate and unlawful and asks the court to block its enforcement. It's the latest in a series of clashes between an administration that's cracking down on transgender health care for children, arguing it can be harmful to them, and advocates who say the care is medically necessary and shouldn't be inhibited. After taking office in January, President Trump signed an executive order that seeks to cut federal support for certain types of gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy cannot unilaterally change medical standards by posting a document online, and no one should lose access to medically necessary health care because their federal government tried to interfere in decisions that belong in doctors' offices,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the lawsuit, said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that HHS's declaration seeks to coerce providers to stop providing gender-affirming care and circumvent legal requirements for policy changes. It says federal law requires the public to be given notice and an opportunity to comment before substantively changing health policy \u2014 neither of which, the suit says, was done before the declaration was issued.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS declined to comment.",
      "HHS's declaration based its conclusions on a peer-reviewed report that the department conducted earlier this year that urged greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than broad gender-affirming care for youths with gender dysphoria.",
      "The report questioned standards for the treatment of transgender youth issued by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and raised concerns that adolescents may be too young to give consent to life-changing treatments that could result in future infertility.",
      "Major medical groups and those who treat transgender young people have sharply criticized the report as inaccurate, and most major U.S. medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, continue to oppose restrictions on transgender care and services for young people.",
      "The declaration was announced as part of a multifaceted effort to limit gender-affirming health care for children and teenagers \u2014 and built on other Trump administration efforts to target the rights of transgender people nationwide.",
      "HHS on Thursday also unveiled two proposed federal rules \u2014 one to cut off federal Medicaid and Medicare funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children, and another to prohibit federal Medicaid dollars from being used for such procedures.",
      "The proposals are not yet final or legally binding and must go through a lengthy rulemaking process and public comment before becoming permanent. But they will nonetheless likely further discourage health care providers from offering gender-affirming care to children.",
      "Several major medical providers already have pulled back on gender-affirming care for young patients since Mr. Trump returned to office \u2014 even in states where the care is legal and protected by state law.",
      "Medicaid programs in slightly less than half of states currently cover gender-affirming care. At least 27 states have adopted laws restricting or banning the care. The Supreme Court's recent 6-3 decision upholding Tennessee's ban means most other state laws are likely to remain in place. The case, U.S. v. Skrmetti, marked the first time the Supreme Court had waded into the issue of health care for transgender youth.",
      "Tennessee's law prohibits medical treatments like puberty blockers or hormone therapy for transgender adolescents under the age of 18.",
      "The state had argued that it has a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in barring treatments that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "\"Our role is not 'to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic' of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority.",
      "Joining James in Tuesday's lawsuit were Democratic attorneys general from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin, Washington and the District of Columbia. Pennsylvania's Democratic governor also joined.",

    "summary": "The Education Department signaled earlier this year that it would move to resume wage garnishment, among other forms of involuntary collection, for those in default.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is set to resume garnishing the wages of some student loan borrowers who are in default beginning in early 2026, and a leading advocacy group for student loan borrowers is raising concerns.",
      "Wage garnishment notices are expected to go out to about 1,000 borrowers in default beginning the week of Jan. 7, according to The Associated Press, with the number of notices expected to increase on a monthly basis after that.",
      "The Education Department said in a statement to The AP that it would begin involuntary collection \"only after student and parent borrowers have been provided sufficient notice and opportunity to repay their loans.\"",
      "It was not immediately clear how much of their wages those in default could see garnished.",
      "\"At a time when families across the country are struggling with stagnant wages and an affordability crisis, this Administration's decision to garnish wages from defaulted student loan borrowers is cruel, unnecessary, and irresponsible,\" said Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel of the student borrower advocacy group Protect Borrowers. \"As millions of borrowers sit on the precipice of default, this Administration is using its self-inflicted limited resources to seize borrowers' wages instead of defending borrowers' right to affordable payments.\"",
      "Federal student loan borrowers are considered in default after missing payments for at least 270 days. Borrowers in default must be given at least 30 days' notice before their wages can be garnished.",
      "Student loan repayments were paused, with no interest accruing, by the first Trump administration in March 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. After several extensions under the Biden administration, payments were required to resume in Oct. 2023 after Congress blocked further extensions.",
      "In May of this year, the Education Department signaled it would move to resume wage garnishment, among other forms of involuntary collection, for those in default.",
      "More than 5 million borrowers were in default when the Education Department said in May it would begin involuntary collections through the Treasury Department's offset program, which uses measures such as withholding tax refunds, federal salaries and Social Security benefits. The department predicted 4 million more could be in default in the months that followed, which would mean nearly 25% of all student loan borrowers would be in default.",
      "Former President Joe Biden attempted to forgive student loan debt for tens of millions of people during his term, but the effort was repeatedly\u00a0rejected by courts, including a\u00a02023 ruling by the Supreme Court. The Biden administration was able to wipe out student loan debt for more than 5 million borrowers through\u00a0other forgiveness programs.",
      "In May's announcement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said, \"Going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment \u2014 both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation's economic outlook,\" she said in a statement Monday.",
      "\"There will not be any mass loan forgiveness,\" the announcement said.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" that President Trump\u00a0signed into law on July 4\u00a0also overhauled the federal student loan system, phasing out several repayment plans, including the SAVE, PAYE, IBR and ICR, capping the amount individuals can borrow for higher education, and eliminating deferment provisions for borrowers facing economic hardship.",

    "summary": "President Trump invoked a law called Title 10 to bring members of the Illinois National Guard under federal service over the objections of state and local leaders.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a bid by the Trump administration to deploy National Guard members to the Chicago area while a legal challenge moves forward, delivering a setback to President Trump in his effort to use federalized troops in Illinois to ensure enforcement of federal immigration laws.",
      "The high court left untouched a judge's decision blocking the government from putting National Guard members on the streets of Chicago and surrounding areas. The Trump administration had urged the Supreme Court to allow the extraordinary move to deploy the troops over the objection of Illinois' Democratic governor, arguing that federal courts cannot second-guess the president's decision to call the National Guard into federal service.",
      "But the Supreme Court declined the administration's request to freeze that order in a decision that appears to be 6-3. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch dissented.",
      "In an unsigned order, the Supreme Court found that \"at least in this posture\" the Trump administration has not met its burden to show that Title 10, the law Mr. Trump invoked, permits him to federalize the National Guard \"in the exercise of inherent authority to protect federal personnel and property in Illinois.\"",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker issued a statement calling the ruling \"a big win for Illinois and American democracy.\"\u00a0Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson praised the Supreme Court for \"rebuking President Trump's attempts to militarize and demonize our city.\"",
      "The White House said nothing in the high court's ruling detracts from the president's agenda.",
      "\"The president promised the American people he would work tirelessly to enforce our immigration laws and protect federal personnel from violent rioters,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. \"He activated the National Guard to protect federal law enforcement officers, and to ensure rioters did not destroy federal buildings and property. Nothing in today's ruling detracts from that core agenda. The administration will continue working day in and day out to safeguard the American public.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has brought state-run National Guards under federal control in several U.S. cities as his administration has ramped up immigration enforcement operations. Mr. Trump has so far moved to deploy National Guard units in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland and Chicago to protect federal property and personnel, and he has threatened to send troops to other major cities, including Baltimore and San Francisco.",
      "Two West Virginia National Guard members who were sent to Washington, D.C., were shot in an ambush-style attack near the White House last month. One of the victims died and the other was severely wounded.",
      "As for Illinois, the president issued a memo in early October claiming that federal facilities in the state \"have come under coordinated assault by violent groups intent on obstructing federal law enforcement activities,\" which he said hindered the execution of U.S. immigration laws.",
      "The directive came after the processing center for immigrant detainees in Broadview, a suburb of Chicago, saw a rise in protests following the launch of an immigration enforcement campaign called Operation Midway Blitz in early September.",
      "In response, Mr. Trump authorized the federalization of the Illinois National Guard under\u00a0Title 10. The law allows the president to call into federal service members of a state's Guard when he cannot execute U.S. laws with the \"regular forces\" or when there is a \"rebellion or danger of a rebellion\" against the government.",
      "Roughly 300 troops from the Illinois National Guard prepared to mobilize. Federalized members of the Texas and California National Guards also arrived in Illinois in early October but have since left the state.",
      "Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker objected to the president's move, arguing that there was no public safety need that required the deployment of National Guard troops. The state of Illinois and city of Chicago then sued the Trump administration, arguing Mr. Trump's federalization of the National Guard is illegal. They sought a temporary order barring the government from mobilizing and sending troops to the Chicago area.",
      "U.S. District Judge April Perry sided with Illinois officials and issued a temporary order blocking the Trump administration from ordering the federalization and deployment of the National Guard within Illinois. In her October decision, she called information from Department of Homeland Security officials about events in Illinois \"unreliable.\"",
      "\"There has been no showing that the civil power has failed,\" Perry wrote. \"The agitators who have violated the law by attacking federal authorities have been arrested. The courts are open, and the marshals are ready to see that any sentences of imprisonment are carried out. Resort to the military to execute the laws is not called for.\"",
      "A unanimous panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit then allowed the Guard members to remain under federal service, but upheld the portion of Perry's order forbidding them from being sent out to the Chicago area.",
      "In their decision, the 7th Circuit judges found that the Trump administration failed to satisfy the conditions for invoking Title 10 to call the National Guard into federal service in Illinois.",
      "\"Political opposition is not rebellion,\" the 7th Circuit judges wrote. \"A protest does not become a rebellion merely because the protestors advocate for myriad legal or policy changes, are well organized, call for significant changes to the structure of the U.S. government, use civil disobedience as a form of protest, or exercise their Second Amendment right to carry firearms as the law currently allows.\"",
      "The 7th Circuit also found there is \"insufficient evidence\" that the demonstrations in Illinois have hampered the ability of federal officers to enforce immigration laws.",
      "\"Federal facilities, including the processing facility in Broadview, have remained open despite regular demonstrations against the administration's immigration policies,\" the judges said. \"And though federal officers have encountered sporadic disruptions, they have been quickly contained by local, state, and federal authorities.\"",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, the Trump administration argued that courts cannot review the president's decision to call up the National Guard.",
      "\"A federal district court lacks not only the authority but also the competence to wrest control of the military chain of command from the Commander in Chief and to adjudicate whether the Governor of Illinois, rather than the President, should be in ultimate command of particular Guardsmen after the President has called them into federal service,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing.",
      "Sauer also argued violence and threats of violence have impeded immigration enforcement operations and forced the Department of Homeland Security to divert resources away from law enforcement activities to protect federal buildings and officers.",
      "\"The National Guard's deployment would protect lives and federal property, deter acts of violence, free up resources for actual law enforcement, and assist federal law enforcement in carrying out their duties effectively,\" he said.",
      "Illinois officials, meanwhile, argued that state and local law enforcement have effectively handled the protests outside the Broadview facility. They warned that allowing National Guard troops onto the streets in the Chicago area could spark confrontations.",
      "\"[T]he unnecessary deployment of military troops, untrained for local policing, will escalate tensions and undermine the ordinary law enforcement activities of state and local entities, which would need to divert resources to maintain safety and order,\" they wrote in a filing.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene in mid-October, but the high court sought additional information from government lawyers and Illinois officials about whether the term \"regular forces\" refers to the U.S. military.",
      "The Supreme Court's majority concluded that the phrase \"regular forces\" likely means the military, so Title 10 likely applies only where the military can legally execute the laws. Those circumstances are \"exceptional,\" the high court said in its order, since the military is forbidden under a law called the Posse Comitatus Act from engaging in domestic law enforcement, except when authorized by Congress or the Constitution.",
      "\"So before the President can federalize the Guard under [Title 10], he likely must have statutory or constitutional authority to execute the laws with the regular military and must be 'unable' with those forces to perform that function,\" the court said. \"At this preliminary stage, the Government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois.\"",
      "Beyond Illinois, Mr. Trump's use of the National Guard in Los Angeles and Portland has set off legal challenges brought by officials in those states. Two trial court judges in California and Oregon initially blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard units to areas of those states. But separate three-judge panels on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit issued decisions allowing the Trump administration to deploy members of the California National Guard within Los Angeles and the Oregon National Guard in Portland while the legal proceedings continued.",
      "The full 9th Circuit declined to reconsider the panel's decision as to the California National Guard. A district judge in December then again blocked the Trump administration's deployment, and that order has been appealed.",
      "But as to Oregon, a federal judge held a three-day trial and issued a ruling last month finding that the president did not have a lawful basis to federalize the National Guard. She permanently blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to Portland. The Justice Department appealed the decision to the 9th Circuit, and the chief judge for the appeals court allowed the Oregon Guard troops to remain under federal control while proceedings move forward.",
      "While the 9th and 7th Circuits have split on whether Mr. Trump can send National Guard troops into cities, they agree that courts can review the president's use of Title 10 to call the units into federal service.",
      "In Washington, D.C., a federal judge ruled last month that his National Guard deployment there violates federal law. The judge paused her decision for 21 days to allow the Trump administration to appeal.",

      "A federal judge on Monday gave the Trump administration two weeks to submit a plan to either return a group of Venezuelan men previously held at a notorious Salvadoran prison to the U.S., or give them a hearing to contest allegations of gang membership.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg issued the order after finding that 137 Venezuelan men deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and held at the infamous CECOT megaprison had been denied their due process rights. Boasberg determined that the men were in the legal custody of the U.S. during the months they spent detained at CECOT, and that they should've been given a chance to challenge the Trump administration's allegations that they were gang members.",
      "\"On the merits, the Court concludes that this class was denied their due-process rights and will thus require the Government to facilitate their ability to obtain such hearing. Our law requires no less,\" Boasberg wrote in his opinion Monday.",
      "The group of 137 men who could benefit from the ruling is a subset of more than 200 Venezuelan deportees sent to CECOT in March, some of whom were deported to El Salvador under traditional immigration procedures. All of the Venezuelan men held at CECOT were released this summer and returned to Venezuela as part of a U.S.-brokered prisoner swap.",
      "Boasberg said the U.S. government could comply with his order by allowing the men to return to the U.S. or otherwise offering them a hearing. The administration, he wrote, could \"theoretically offer Plaintiffs a hearing without returning them to the United States so long as such hearing satisfied the requirements of due process.\"",
      "Boasberg gave the government until Jan. 5 to file a plan to comply with his order.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said \"Judge Boasberg is way over his skis.\"",
      "\"He has been shut down by appellate courts again and again on this case,\" she added. \"We look forward to continuing to defend our actions in court.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that the men ceased to be in U.S. custody after they were sent to El Salvador, so U.S. courts do not have jurisdiction to hear legal claims challenging their detention. But Boasberg wrote that the U.S. effectively maintained control over the men because El Salvador held them in prison at the U.S.'s behest, and the administration paid for them to be detained at CECOT.",
      "The first group of Venezuelan men sent to CECOT were deported on March 15, soon after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act and declared alleged members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang enemies of the state who could be detained and deported with little to no due process.",
      "At the time, Trump administration officials called the deportees dangerous criminals, terrorists and gangsters.",
      "CBS News was first to obtain and publish the list of the Venezuelan men sent to CECOT on March 15. Using that list, \"60 Minutes\" and CBS News found that many of the deportees did not have any apparent criminal record, in the U.S. or abroad, despite the administration's allegations.",
      "A report released last month by human rights groups determined that the treatment of the Venezuelan deportees imprisoned at CECOT amounted to arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance under international law.",
      "The investigation, by the groups Human Rights Watch and Cristosal, found the detainees were victims of \"constant beatings\" by Salvadoran guards at the notorious maximum security prison, as well as other forms of mistreatment, including cases of sexual abuse.",
      "Lee Gelernt, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing the former CECOT prisoners in court, lauded Monday's order.",
      "\"After enduring months of torture, these men will finally get the due process they deserve, notwithstanding the Trump administration's underhanded attempts to deny them any opportunity to content the accusations that they are gang members,\" he said.",

    "summary": "ICE has filed more than 8,000 requests to toss out asylum claims in immigration court, asking judges to send immigrants to third-party countries.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has mounted a nationwide campaign to void the asylum claims of thousands of immigrants with active cases in immigration court by arguing that they can be deported to countries that are not their own, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "The effort appears to have intensified in recent weeks, targeting asylum-seekers with pending cases in immigration courts in Atlanta, New York, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Texas and elsewhere across the U.S., multiple immigration lawyers and certified legal representatives told CBS News.",
      "Immigration courts are not part of the judicial branch. Instead, they are administrative entities run by the Justice Department, which employs and oversees the judges that adjudicate the cases of people facing deportation. Lawyers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement represent the government in the proceedings.",
      "The administration's new tactic involves ICE attorneys asking the immigration judges to toss out asylum claims without hearing them on the merits. In these requests, known as \"pretermit\" motions, ICE argues that asylum-seekers fearing persecution in their home countries can instead be deported to one of several nations the Trump administration has persuaded to accept deportees who are not their citizens.",
      "As part of the effort, ICE attorneys have asked immigration judges to order asylum-seekers deported to third countries like Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador and Uganda, according to court documents reviewed by CBS News and interviews with immigration lawyers. If granted, those petitions nullify asylum-seekers' claims and clear the way for them to be deported to third countries, absent any appeals.",
      "Previously undisclosed internal government data obtained by CBS News indicates that, as of early December, ICE attorneys had filed more than 8,000 motions in immigration court to toss out asylum claims by citing deportation agreements with third countries.",
      "The campaign is the latest move by President Trump to sharply curtail access to the American asylum system, which his administration has argued is being systematically abused by migrants who came to the U.S. for economic reasons, especially those who entered illegally along the southern border under the Biden administration.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Department of Homeland Security said the Trump administration is \"working to get illegal aliens out of our country as quickly as possible while ensuring they receive all available legal process, including a hearing before an immigration judge.\"",
      "\"DHS is using every lawful tool available to address the backlog and abuse of the asylum system,\" the department added, citing \"lawful bilateral arrangements that allow illegal aliens seeking asylum in the United States to pursue protection in a partner country that has agreed to fairly adjudicate their claims.\"",
      "The Trump administration's strategy rests on a section of immigration law that disqualifies migrants from asylum if the applicant is eligible to request legal protection in another nation that has agreed to a \"safe third country\" arrangement with the U.S.",
      "In late October, the Board of Immigration Appeals, which reviews decisions by immigration courts, issued a ruling that lawyers believe will turbocharge efforts by the government to use \"safe third country\" agreements to cancel asylum cases. That order directed immigration judges to decide the motions by ICE to send immigrants to third-party countries before reviewing their asylum applications. It also placed the burden on asylum-seekers to prove they should not be sent to a third country because of fears of being persecuted there.",
      "\"You just have to give up\"",
      "While the Trump administration has argued its latest effort is meant to curb asylum fraud, multiple immigration lawyers told CBS News the campaign has affected clients with strong asylum claims who fled persecution in countries like Iran, Nicaragua and Russia.",
      "The attorneys argued the government's campaign is designed to eliminate the path to asylum in the U.S. Some said it is meant to coerce asylum-seekers into withdrawing their claims, by scaring them with the prospect of being deported to a country that is not their own.",
      "\"They see the asylum system as a whole as a problem, because it impedes them from deporting people in a quick manner,\" said Pa\u00fal Pirela, an immigration lawyer in Houston.",
      "\"If you want to apply for asylum, we're forcing you to apply in a country that you've never been to,\" Pirela continued. \"You just have to give up and go back to your country or go somewhere else,\" he added later.",
      "Pirela said one of his clients, a Nicaraguan asylum-seeker and political dissident, was ordered deported to Honduras after the government filed a pretermit motion in his case. ICE, he added, is also trying to get another client, an asylum applicant from Guatemala, ordered deported to Honduras.",
      "Atlanta immigration attorney Adriana Heffley got notice that DHS had motioned to pretermit her client's case and deport him to Uganda four days before a hearing, she told CBS News. Her client is from Iran, and was apprehended at the border when he entered the U.S. illegally last December, she said. He has been detained ever since.",
      "Heffley and her client had prepared a case arguing that he would face persecution and danger in Iran as someone who had previously been in same-sex relationships. But they had to switch gears and quickly prove he would also suffer in Uganda. The judge agreed and denied the DHS motion to preempt the case.",
      "\"Immigrants who are coming up on a hearing that will determine the course of the rest of their lives and their fate and their safety are being hit with this left-field motion just a day or two before that final hearing,\" Heffley said.",
      "New York immigration attorney David Treyster is not confident his case will see the same outcome. DHS moved to deport his client, a Russian national, and her 4-year-old child, to Uganda, he told CBS News. The judge initially planned to give Treyster 30 minutes to confer with her before hearing opposing arguments and ruling on the motion. After pleading with the judge, Treyster was able to schedule the hearing for Tuesday.",
      "The judge \"seemed to imply that her hands are being tied,\" he said, given the Board of Immigration Appeals' ruling that the third-country deportations must be considered first. \"We haven't even had our hearing, [but] the judge kept saying, 'you're going to have to appeal this.'\"",
      "\"The person timely and properly applied for asylum and is in line waiting their turn, doing everything that the administration wants people to do, reporting to their court hearings, filing all their papers on time, and here we are just taking that due process away from them,\" Treyster added.",
      "Some immigration attorneys are challenging the tactic in court, including the 2019 regulation that ICE attorneys have been citing in their motions arguing that asylum-seekers can be deported to third countries.",
      "\"I think that this is in line with this administration's attempt to completely eviscerate the availability of asylum and other forms of protection in this country,\" said Blaine Bookey, legal director for San Francisco's Center for Gender and Refugee Studies, one of the groups litigating the case. \"This is, in their view, an easy way to cut off a case at the knees.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Federal Communications Commission on Monday said it would ban new foreign-made drones, a move that will keep new Chinese-made drones such as those from DJI and Autel out of the U.S. market.",
      "The announcement came a year after Congress passed a defense bill that raised national security concerns about Chinese-made drones, which have become a dominant player in the U.S., widely used in farming, mapping, law enforcement and filmmaking.",
      "The bill called for stopping the two Chinese companies from selling new drones in the U.S. if a review found they posed a risk to American national security. The deadline for the review was Dec. 23.",
      "The FCC said Monday the review found that all drones and critical components produced in foreign countries, not just by the two Chinese companies, posed \"unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and to the safety and security of U.S. persons.\" But it said specific drones or components would be exempt if the Pentagon or Department of Homeland Security determined they didn't pose such risks.",
      "The FCC cited upcoming major events, such as the 2026 World Cup, America250 celebrations and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, as reasons to address potential drone threats posed by \"criminals, hostile foreign actors, and terrorists.\"",
      "Michael Robbins, president and chief executive officer of AUVSI, the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International, said in a statement that the industry group welcomes the decision. He said it's time for the U.S. not only to reduce its dependence on China but build its own drones.",
      "\"Recent history underscores why the United States must increase domestic drone production and secure its supply chains,\" Robbins said, citing Beijing's willingness to restrict critical supplies such as rare earth magnets to serve its strategic interests.",
      "A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, Lin Jian, said Tuesday that Beijing opposed the U.S. setting up \"discriminatory\" lists and urged the Trump administration to \"correct its wrong practices\" and provide a fair environment for Chinese companies, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "DJI said it was disappointed by the FCC decision. \"While DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination,\" it said in a statement.",
      "\"Concerns about DJI's data security have not been grounded in evidence and instead reflect protectionism, contrary to the principles of an open market,\" the company said.",
      "In Texas, Gene Robinson has a fleet of nine DJI drones that he uses for law enforcement training and forensic analyses. He said the new restrictions would hurt him and many others who have come to rely on the Chinese drones because of their versatility, high performance and affordable prices.",
      "But he said he understands the decision and lamented that the U.S. had outsourced the manufacturing to China. \"Now, we are paying the price,\" Robinson said. \"To get back to where we had the independence, there will be some growing pains. We need to suck it up, and let's not have it happen again.\"",
      "Also in Texas, Arthur Erickson, chief executive officer and co-founder of the drone-making company Hylio, said the departure of DJI would provide much-needed room for American companies like his to grow. New investments are pouring in to help him ramp up production of spray drones, which farmers use to fertilize their fields, and it will bring down prices, Erickson said.",
      "But he also called it \"crazy\" and \"unexpected\" that the FCC should expand the scope to all foreign-made drones and drone components. \"The way it's written is a blanket statement,\" Erickson said. \"There's a global allied supply chain. I hope they will clarify that.\"",

    "summary": "The Justice Department has disclosed thousands of files and photos related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, following years of pressure from lawmakers and abuse survivors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department began disclosing\u00a0thousands of files and photos\u00a0related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, Dec. 19, with additional batches released in subsequent days, following years of pressure from lawmakers and abuse survivors for more transparency into the government's investigations into the disgraced financier.",
      "The records were released in accordance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which passed last month and required the government to release virtually all Epstein-related files within 30 days.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said more files will be released \"over the next couple of weeks,\" even though the law required the documents to be disclosed by Friday. He later told lawmakers that the Justice Department needed more time to pore through the records and redact victims' names.",
      "Congressional Democrats have accused the Justice Department of failing to comply with the law, arguing that the documents are too heavily redacted and should have been released in full on Friday.",
      "Where to find the Epstein files",
      "The files that have been disclosed under the Epstein Files Transparency Act are available on the Justice Department's website, broken into different data sets. Many of the files are photos, not text documents.",
      "CBS News is also uploading the records to a searchable database, which is available here.",
      "Here are the Justice Department's records:",
      "Data Set 1\u00a0Data Set 2Data Set 3Data Set 4Data Set 5Data Set 6Data Set 7Data Set 8",

      "Data Set 7",
      "Data Set 8",
      "What's in the new Epstein files?",
      "Thousands of the files are images, including photos that were seemingly taken in Epstein's mansion in Manhattan or his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Those include photos of his bedroom in New York, his risque wall art and a taxidermied tiger.",
      "Many photos show Epstein socializing with his convicted associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. Former President Bill Clinton also appears in several of the images \u2014 in some cases, the former president is posing with celebrities like Michael Jackson and Mick Jagger. A spokesperson has acknowledged that Clinton traveled with Epstein on several occasions, but says he was not aware of Epstein's crimes, and accused the Justice Department of trying to scapegoat Clinton on Friday.",
      "Some of the photos are redacted \u2014 in certain cases, they show Epstein posing with people whose faces are obscured.",
      "There are also a number of investigative documents, some of which have heavy redactions. In a few cases, documents are almost entirely redacted.",
      "Why were some of the Epstein files redacted?",
      "The law that requires the Justice Department to release the files only allows redactions under narrow circumstances, including to take out Epstein survivors' personal information, violent images or child sexual abuse material. The government is also allowed to temporarily withhold records that \"would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution.\"",
      "Records cannot be withheld solely because they would cause \"embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.\"",
      "Some redactions in the documents released Friday appeared to omit victims' names, but the exact reasons for every redaction are unclear. The law also requires the department to give Congress a list of its redactions within 15 days.",
      "What was Epstein investigated for and charged with?",
      "The files that were released Friday are expected to stem from the litany of investigations surrounding Epstein and Maxwell, stretching back at least 20 years.",
      "Allegations about Epstein's conduct appeared to emerge on the government's radar as early as the 1990s, when survivor Maria Farmer says she reported to the FBI that Epstein had abused her. In a lawsuit, she has accused the government of failing to look into her allegations.",
      "Epstein was investigated by local police in Florida and federal prosecutors starting in the mid-2000s. That probe ended with a controversial 2007 deal in which federal prosecutors in Miami agreed not to charge him, in exchange for a guilty plea on prostitution charges in state court.",
      "More than a decade later, Epstein was charged in New York federal court with abusing and trafficking dozens of underage girls. Maxwell was charged with sex trafficking conspiracy the following year, and was convicted at trial and sentenced to 20 years in prison.",
      "Files from several other probes could be made public. The government has investigated the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial in 2019, officially ruled a suicide. And it has investigated Miami prosecutors' decision to cut a non-prosecution deal.",
      "Why the Epstein files are being released now",
      "The files are being released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Congress passed and President Trump signed into law in November. The legislation gave the attorney general 30 days to publicly release documents related to Epstein, his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, the government's investigations into both and internal records about the cases.",
      "The legislation was the result of years of pressure from Epstein and Maxwell's survivors, who pushed lawmakers for more transparency about how the government handled both of their cases. Epstein's death fueled conspiracy theories about his connections to high-powered figures in government and the business world.",
      "The calls for transparency reached new heights over the summer. The Justice Department conducted a review of the Epstein files in the government's possession, and concluded that there was no \"client list\" or evidence that he had blackmailed prominent figures. The findings infuriated many of the president's supporters who had been calling for the release of the Epstein files for years, and opened the door for a bipartisan push to unveil the records.",
      "California Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat, was the lead sponsor of the Epstein Files Transparency Act. He introduced the bill in July, and GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky filed a discharge petition aimed at forcing a vote on the measure. The push was delayed by opposition from House Speaker Mike Johnson and the government shutdown in the fall. But in November, the petition received the final signature required to bring the bill up for a vote.",
      "It passed the House by a vote of 427 to 1 and the Senate unanimously approved it. President Trump signed it into law on Nov. 19, despite spending months pressuring Republicans to oppose it, starting the clock on the 30-day deadline.",
      "In the wake of Congress' passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, three separate judges approved Justice Department requests to unseal grand jury transcripts from investigations into Maxwell and Epstein. One of those rulings stemmed from grand jury proceedings in South Florida in 2005 and 2007. Epstein ultimately escaped federal charges there and instead agreed to plead guilty to state prostitution charges.",
      "The other two court orders came from judges in New York, where Epstein and Maxwell were charged in 2019 and 2020, respectively.",
      "When will the next group of Epstein files be released?",
      "It's unclear. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News earlier Friday that the department would release more files \"over the next couple of weeks.\"",
      "\"We are looking at every single piece of paper that we are going to produce making sure every victim \u2014 their name, their identity, their story, to the extent that it needs to be protected \u2014 is completely protected,\" Blanche said.",
      "That timeline does not comply with the law, which required the release of all eligible files by Dec. 19. The department's office of public affairs said before Friday's release that the \"initial deadline is being met as we work diligently to protect victims.\"",
      "Blanche's comments, and the department's failure to release all of the files, angered many Democrats who have harshly criticized the administration for its handling of the documents. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, accused the Trump administration of violating the law and suggested they could take legal action.",
      "\"Donald Trump and the Department of Justice are now violating federal law as they continue covering up the facts and the evidence about Jeffrey Epstein's decades-long, billion-dollar, international sex trafficking ring,\" Raskin and Garcia said in a joint statement. \"For months, Pam Bondi has denied survivors the transparency and accountability they have demanded and deserve and has defied the Oversight Committee's subpoena. The Department of Justice is now making clear it intends to defy Congress itself, even as it gives star treatment to Epstein's convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell.\"",
      "Raskin and Garcia said they are \"examining all legal options\" given Blanche's earlier admission.",
      "\"The survivors of this nightmare deserve justice, the co-conspirators must be held accountable, and the American people deserve complete transparency from DOJ,\" they said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department is facing continued backlash over its partial releases of files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with lawmakers and survivors denouncing the limited scope of the disclosures.",
      "The Trump administration faced a Dec. 19 deadline to release most of the government's records under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Congress passed and President Trump signed into law last month. But Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the files will be released on a rolling basis over the coming weeks due to the volume of the materials and the need to shield the personal information of survivors.",
      "A first tranche of records was made public Friday, followed by a second batch Saturday. Many of the documents contained significant redactions, including whole pages of records that were blacked out.",
      "Early Tuesday, the department released tens of thousands of additional documents from the files. It wasn't immediately clear what impact that release would have on the criticism of the earlier releases.",
      "The Justice Department also removed more than a dozen of the earlier files without an initial explanation. The department said on X on Saturday that files would continue to be \"reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.\"",
      "One of the removed files was an image of a group of framed photos, including two that appeared to show Mr. Trump. The department said on Sunday that the file was \"temporarily removed\" out of an abundance of caution after federal prosecutors in New York flagged it \"for potential further action to protect victims.\" The department reposted the photo after it said a review determined that \"there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph.\" Mr. Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing related to Epstein.",
      "A group of survivors of abuse by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his longtime associate who was convicted of sex trafficking, called on Congress to hold hearings and take legal action to demand compliance with the law. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence.",
      "\"It is alarming that the United States Department of Justice, the very agency tasked with upholding the law, has violated the law, both by withholding massive quantities of documents, and by failing to redact survivor identities,\" they said in a statement Monday.",
      "The survivors said the government released \"a fraction of the files,\" and said the material that was disclosed was \"riddled with abnormal and extreme redactions with no explanation.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced a resolution Monday that would direct the upper chamber to \"initiate legal actions\" against the Justice Department to demand that it comply with the law. The New York Democrat is expected to force a vote on the measure when the Senate reconvenes in the new year.",
      "Schumer called the Justice Department's rollout a \"blatant cover-up,\" claiming Attorney General Pam Bondi and Blanche \"are shielding Donald Trump from accountability, and the Senate has a duty to act.\"",
      "\"The law Congress passed is crystal clear: release the Epstein files in full so Americans can see the truth,\" Schumer said in a statement.",
      "Bondi said in a post on X on Sunday\u00a0that the Justice Department \"will bring charges against anyone involved in the trafficking and exploitation of Jeffrey Epstein's victims,\" and urged any survivors with information to come forward.",
      "But in July, the Justice Department and FBI released a memo stating that a review of the government's files related to Epstein \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna expressed dissatisfaction with the release on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday. Khanna, a California Democrat, and Massie, a Kentucky Republican, authored the Epstein legislation and worked together on the discharge petition to force a vote on the measure.",
      "Massie said he and Khanna are \"talking about and drafting\" a resolution to hold Bondi in \"inherent contempt\" of Congress, which he called \"the quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims.\"",
      "Inherent contempt is a rarely used tool that Congress can use to enforce compliance with its directives. A 2017 report from the Congressional Research Service called it a \"long dormant\" power that allows lawmakers \"to detain and imprison a contemnor until the individual complies with congressional demands.\" The report noted that while there \"may be an argument for the imposition of monetary fines\" as an alternative, there's no precedent for Congress imposing a fine for contempt.",
      "Last year, a push by GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida to hold then-Attorney General Merrick Garland in inherent contempt fell short in the House. Though she had initially signaled that she was pursuing a resolution to hold Garland in custody, the final measure would have imposed a fine of $10,000 per day on Garland for defying a congressional subpoena.",
      "Khanna said he and Massie are \"building a bipartisan coalition, and it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she's not releasing these documents.\" To force a vote on the House floor upon the chamber's return next month, the resolution would likely be offered as a privileged motion, which would require leadership to schedule a vote within two legislative days.",
      "Under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the attorney general had 30 days from its enactment to make public \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" in the Justice Department's possession that related to Epstein and Maxwell.",
      "The law prohibited the government from withholding, delaying or redacting records \"on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.\" But it did allow the attorney general to redact certain portions of documents, including personally identifiable information of survivors or depictions of child sexual abuse.",
      "The law also requires the Justice Department to provide written justification for any redactions to Congress.",
      "The president, asked about the Epstein documents at an event at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida Monday, voiced frustration that there is still so much attention focused on them.",
      "\"I believe they gave over 100,000 pages of documents,\" he said. \"And there is tremendous backlash, it's an interesting question, because a lot of people are very angry that pictures are being released of other people that really had nothing to do with Epstein. But they're in a picture with him because he was at a party. And you ruin a reputation of somebody. So a lot of people are very angry that this continues.\"",
      "Epstein was under investigation in South Florida in the early 2000s, but ultimately reached a deal with federal prosecutors in Miami to escape federal charges. He agreed to instead plead guilty to state prostitution charges and serve 18 months in prison.",
      "He was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in New York in 2019 and died by suicide at a Manhattan correctional facility weeks later.",

      "The military has hit at least 29 alleged drug vessels since early September, killing 105 people.

The military said the boat was operated by a designated terrorist organization \u2014 it did not specify the organization, but the Trump administration has categorized several Latin American drug cartels as terror groups.",

      "Called \"clutter,\" this radar interference can make it difficult to identify legitimate moving targets, Interior noted.",
      "The action comes two weeks after a federal judge struck down President Trump's executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was \"arbitrary and capricious\" and violates U.S. law.",
      "Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump's Jan. 20\u00a0executive order\u00a0blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.",

      "Halted projects",
      "Vineyard Wind 1, located about 15 miles south of the Massachusetts islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, is slated to include 62 wind turbines, each spaced by one nautical mile apart, according to the project's website. About half of those turbines were operational in October, the Vineyard Times reported that month.",
      "Once fully developed, the project is projected to generate renewable energy for more than 400,000 homes and businesses in Massachusetts. Vineyard Wind didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Revolution Wind, a project located off the coast of Rhode Island, is 80% completed, according to its website. It's operated by renewable energy company Orsted, which didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Dominion Energy's CVOW, which stands for Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, is the largest offshore wind project in the U.S., with 176 turbines. The project was projected to be up and running by the end of 2026, according to its website.",

    "published": "Sun, 21 Dec 2025 18:10:22 -0500",
    "summary": "NASA is gearing up to send four Artemis astronauts on looping test flight around the moon in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "Four astronauts in training to fly around the moon early next year strapped into their Orion spacecraft this weekend for a dress rehearsal countdown in a major milestone toward launch.",
      "Based on repeated stops and starts seen on NASA's countdown clock, the complex test originally planned for late November, ran into problems at various points on Saturday. NASA provided no details, but Artemis 2 commander Reid Wiseman said that overall, the test went well.",
      "\"Extremely successful day in our spacecraft #Integrity,\" Wiseman said in a post on X. \"Did everything go perfectly? Absolutely not. But this vehicle and our team showed us they're up to the challenge. Launch is getting very close.\"",
      "Launch is tentatively targeted for early February, but the schedule is extremely tight and the flight may slip to early March. No decisions are expected until after the first of next year.",
      "In any case, Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen, wearing bright orange pressure suits, strapped into their Orion capsule using the same procedures they'll follow on launch day.",
      "Such \"countdown demonstration tests\" have traditionally taken place shortly before launch with the rocket and crew ship already on the launch pad. But for Saturday's test, the astronauts boarded their spacecraft atop NASA's huge Space Launch System (SLS) rocket inside the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center.",
      "Over the course of the exercise, the astronauts and the launch control team worked through the same countdown procedures they will follow on launch day, ending less than a minute before the clocks would normally hit zero.",
      "Five launch opportunities are available in February when the moon and Earth are in the proper relative positions. The first such opportunity comes on Feb. 6. To make that date, the SLS rocket and Orion would have to be rolled from the assembly building to pad 39B in mid January, setting the stage for a critical fueling test that must go well before NASA can proceed to launch.",
      "Given the amount of work remaining to complete preparations, sources say NASA may opt to delay the flight to early March.",
      "Whenever it takes off, the flight plan calls for the Orion and its crew to spend 25 hours in an elliptical orbit around Earth to test spacecraft life support, propulsion and navigation systems.",
      "The crew plans to fly in close proximity to the SLS rocket's upper stage to test the Orion's maneuvering systems and rendezvous procedures that will be needed for eventual moon landing missions.",
      "An uncrewed Orion carried out a similar loop around the moon during the Artemis 1 mission in November 2022. But the Lockheed Martin-built spacecraft was not equipped with a full life support system and it did not carry out thruster firings like those needed for a rendezvous.",
      "Once the testing is complete, the Artemis 2 Orion will leave Earth orbit on a \"free return\" trajectory that will carry the crew around the moon and back to a Pacific Ocean splashdown. The ship will not go into orbit around the moon.",
      "But Artemis 2 will still be the first piloted trip back to the moon since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, carrying Wiseman and his crewmates farther from Earth than any other humans have ever traveled.",
      "The flight will set the stage for Artemis 3, carrying yet-to-be-named astronauts to the surface of the moon near the lunar south pole, NASA hopes, in 2028.",
      "The Artemis 3 flight originally was planned for 2024, a target set during the first Trump administration. But the mission has been repeatedly delayed by processing problems, slowdowns during the COVID pandemic, Super Heavy-Starship testing and work to develop the lunar lander, known by NASA as the Human Landing System, or HLS.",
      "The current 2028 target was set in the past few weeks when it became apparent the space agency would not be ready in time for the most recent previous target of 2027.",
      "China also plans to land its own \"taikonauts\" on the moon by 2030, creating a new space race of sorts, one that NASA vows to win.",

      "\"Effective immediately, Instacart is ending all item price tests on our platform,\" an Instacart spokesperson told CBS News in an email statement. \"Retailers will no longer be able to use Eversight technology to run item price tests on Instacart.\"",
      "The announcement comes after a recent investigation by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, a nonprofit advocacy group, found evidence that retailers such as Albertsons, Costco, Kroger, Safeway and Sprouts Farmers Market were testing the AI pricing system.",
      "The organizations based their findings on data gathered from more than 400 volunteers during online shopping sessions in September. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins varied by as much as 23%.",
      "\"Once we pulled back the curtain on Instacart's hidden pricing experiments, the company had no choice but to close the lab,\" Groundwork Collaborative's executive director Lindsay Owens said in a statement on Monday.",
      "The investigation also found\u00a0that Instacart was conducting algorithmic pricing tests using product information from Target. The retail giant told CBS News it has no commercial relationship with Instacart and that it was not involved in the pilot.",
      "Instacart acquired Eversight, an AI-enabled pricing platform, in 2022, and began offering pricing software to retail companies in 2023.",
      "Instacart claims the AI pricing tests did not include customers' personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral characteristics. The decision to end the use of its pricing tool was made in response to feedback from Instacart customers, a company spokesperson said Monday.",
      "Retailers will continue to set their own prices on the delivery website, and they may still offer different prices at different brick-and-mortar locations, Instacart said Monday in a blog\u00a0post.",
      "Reuters reported\u00a0on Dec. 17 that the Federal Trade Commission was probing Instacart over its AI pricing tests. The FTC declined to comment on the report, but said in a statement that it was \"disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart's alleged pricing practices.\"",

    "summary": "The Veterans Affairs Department is reimposing a near total ban on abortions for veterans and their families that was modified in 2022.",
    "story": [
      "The Veterans Affairs Department is reimposing a near total ban on abortions for veterans and their families after a Justice Department memo from the Office of Legal Counsel last week\u00a0asserted that it's against federal law for the VA to provide them in most instances.",
      "VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz told CBS News, \"The Department of Justice's opinion states that VA is not legally authorized to provide abortions, and VA is complying with it immediately. DOJ's opinion is consistent with VA's proposed rule, which continues to work its way through the regulatory process.\"",
      "In 2022, the department modified its 1999 abortion rules\u00a0to allow \"access to abortions when the life or health of the pregnant Veteran would be endangered if the pregnancy were carried to term, or when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest,\"\u00a0the VA website states.",
      "Now, under the guidance given by the Office of Legal Counsel, the VA's proposed rule reinstates \"the full exclusion on abortions and abortion counseling from the medical benefits package.\"",
      "The proposed rule does have one exception, stating that the \"VA has never understood this policy to prohibit providing care to pregnant women in life-threatening circumstances, including treatment for ectopic pregnancies or miscarriages, which were covered under the VA's medical benefits package prior to the 2022. ... For the avoidance of doubt, the proposed rule would make clear that the exclusion for abortion does not apply 'when a physician certifies that the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.'\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington condemned the VA's move in a post on X, saying it \"is yet another attack on reproductive freedom and a profound betrayal of veterans who put their lives on the line for our country.\" And Democratic Rep. Judy Chu of California, said on X that denying veterans \"the freedom to make their own health care decisions\u2014especially survivors of military sexual trauma\u2014is cruel, dangerous, and an insult to all who have served.\"",
      "The VA argued in its proposed rule that it is \"without question that VA has the authority to bar provision of abortion services through the VA medical benefits package to veterans\" and says the Biden administration implemented the changes to the abortion ban in response to the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturning women's abortion rights. \"In doing so, the administration predicted a high demand for VA abortions that never materialized,\" the proposed rule states.",
      "The Center for Reproductive Rights said in a press release that the policy \"is effectively a national abortion ban for veterans, preventing them and their families from receiving abortions at VA health care facilities in all 50 states, including the 14 states that protect abortion rights.\"",
      "The VA's policy change was first reported by MS Now.",

    "summary": "A single winning ticket was sold for Powerball's Christmas Eve jackpot of $1.817 billion, in Arkansas. It was the second-largest U.S. lottery jackpot ever won.",
    "story": [
      "A single winning ticket was sold for Powerball's Christmas Eve jackpot of $1.817 billion \u2014 the second-largest U.S. lottery prize ever. The winner, who has not been publicly identified, bought the lucky ticket at a gas station outside Little Rock, Arkansas.",
      "The winning numbers for Wednesday night's drawing were 4, 25, 31, 52, 59, \u00a0with a Powerball of 19.",
      "The grand prize had a lump sum cash value of $834.9 million. A rush of ticket sales pushed the final jackpot total even higher than previously expected.",
      "The winning ticket was sold at a Murphy USA in the town of Cabot, lottery officials in Arkansas said Thursday. No one answered the phone Thursday at the location, which was closed for Christmas, The Associated Press reported.",
      "CBS Little Rock affiliate KTHV reports Arkansas state law allows winners of lottery prizes over $500,000 to remain anonymous.",
      "The last time a Powerball jackpot was hit was on Sept. 6 in Missouri and Texas, when two tickets split a\u00a0$1.787 billion top prize. The nearly four-month stretch between jackpots \u2014 47 drawings \u2014 was a record for the most in a Powerball jackpot cycle, the game says.",
      "This is only the second time in the game's history with back-to-back winning jackpots topping $1 billion, Powerball said.",
      "The $1.817 billion prize is second only to the $2.04 billion jackpot won in 2022 by a single ticket sold in Altadena, California, which was the\u00a0largest in both Powerball and lottery history.",
      "The Powerball jackpot had been won once before on Christmas Eve, in 2011, and four times on Christmas Day, the game says. Powerball started in 1992.",
      "To win the jackpot, a ticket must match all five white balls and the red Powerball pulled during a drawing. Single winners of the top prize\u00a0can choose between\u00a0a lump sum payment or a payout via an annuity of one immediate payment followed by 29 annual payments that increase by 5% each time. Both the lump sum and annuity total are before taxes.",
      "Other ticket-holders will also take home a tidy sum. Powerball says eight tickets in Tuesday night's drawing matched all five white balls for a \"Match 5\" prize of $1 million (the prize total varies in California); 114 tickets won $50,000 prizes and 31 tickets won $100,000.",
      "The\u00a0odds of winning the Powerball jackpot\u00a0are 1 in 292.2 million, according to game officials.\u00a0Lottery jackpots have exploded in size\u00a0over the last decade, while the odds of winning have gotten slimmer.",
      "Tickets cost $2 each and are sold in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Drawings take place every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday at 11 p.m. ET.",

    "summary": "As many Americans head into 2026 with mounting money worries, reviewing your finances now could help put you on firmer footing next year.",
    "story": [
      "Many Americans are heading into 2026 with serious money worries as an affordability crisis collides with\u00a0stagnant wages, making it more important to take steps to shore up their finances.",
      "On top of that, a major tax overhaul is taking effect under Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" law, or OBBBA, creating opportunities to benefit from the new rules. Other financial changes, such as potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, could also impact your bank account next year, experts say.",
      "About 84% of Americans have new financial resolutions for 2026, including building an emergency fund or opening a high-yield savings account, according to a recent Vanguard survey. That resolve may be spurred by growing unease about the year ahead. About one in three Americans thinks their finances are likely to worsen in 2026, according to Bankrate, the highest share since the personal finance firm began tracking sentiment in 2018.",
      "\"The last few weeks of the year are a great time to review your finances, especially around saving, and it's important to know how you might be impacted by the new tax law,\" Sabino Vargas, a certified financial planner and senior financial advisor for Vanguard, told CBS News.",
      "Here are some tips to get your financial house in order as you prepare for the new year.",
      "Prepare for new tax changes",
      "The OBBBA, the spending and tax bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4, establishes new tax deduction rules for many Americans, including seniors and workers who earn tips or overtime.",
      "Under a \"no tax on tips\" provision, employees may deduct up to $25,000 earned in tips before Dec. 31. To qualify for the deduction, it's important that workers track their earnings closely because of the IRS's\u00a0reporting requirements, experts say.",
      "\"Document the numbers,\" Vargas said, noting that the same applies to individuals who work overtime.",
      "Some seniors are also eligible for an enhanced senior deduction beginning in 2025. Individuals who are 65 and older may claim an additional deduction of $6,000, or $12,000 per couple, if they qualify.",
      "Because the deduction phases out for single earners with modified adjusted gross income above $75,000 or $150,000 for joint filers, seniors should check that income measure to assess whether or not they are eligible for the deduction, according to Vargas.",
      "Modified adjusted gross income is calculated by finding your AGI, which is on line 11 of your Form 1040, with some deductions and non-taxable items added back in.",
      "Make a budget that will stick",
      "Affordability is a top concern for Americans, whose paychecks aren't keeping pace with inflation. Making a budget that you can realistically follow is a good way to ensure you aren't wasting any money, financial experts say.",
      "It's essential, though, that any kind of budget you design \"matches the way you live,\" Alexa von Tobel, founder and managing director of Inspired Capital, told CBS News.",
      "\"Most budgets fail because they're too aspirational. The ones that stick are automated and grounded in your real patterns,\" she said.",
      "Von Tobel said she prefers the 50/30/20 budgeting rule, which portions half of your take-home pay to essentials; one-third to lifestyle expenses; and 20% to goals such as paying off debt or saving for a vacation.",
      "\"A new year is a perfect time to readdress how your budget aligns with this framework and see where you need to adjust,\" she said.",
      "If the 50/30/20 rule doesn't work for you, there are plenty of other budgeting approaches, including the envelope system and zero-based budgeting. The envelope system sets spending limits for categories like dining out, with that amount placed in cash and used throughout the month.",
      "Zero-based budgeting assigns every dollar of your take-home pay to a specific category \u2014 such as rent, groceries or savings \u2014 until there's nothing left unallocated.",
      "AI tools can remove the self-discipline part of the equation for people and automate savings processes, von Tobel noted.",
      "\"Money management is becoming less about discipline and more about system design. Automate what you can, use tools that give you back time and clarity, and let your financial plan run even when your schedule gets chaotic,\" she said.",
      "Pay down high-interest credit card debt",
      "It's important to prioritize paying down high-interest debt like credit card balances because it's the most expensive to carry and \"can get out of control quickly,\" Vanguard's Vargas said.",
      "When it comes to shedding debt, von Tobel recommends tackling credit card balances with the highest annual percentage rates (APRs) first.",
      "\"Line up your balances by APR, automate all minimum payments and aggressively target the highest-interest line first. Structure beats willpower every time,\" she said.",
      "Another popular strategy for paying down debt is the so-called snowball method. It involves listing your debts by balance and paying off the smallest ones first, regardless of interest rates, to build momentum and stay motivated as balances disappear.",
      "Borrowers have other options for tackling credit card debt as well. One approach is to move balances to a 0% balance transfer card, which can eliminate interest for as long as 21 months. Another is to contact your credit card issuer to ask for a lower annual percentage rate, or APR.",
      "Lock in savings rates before they fall",
      "The Federal Reserve last week cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, its third consecutive cut this year, and hinted at an additional rate cut in 2026.",
      "With at least one additional rate cut expected next year, it may make sense to open a certificate of deposit or a high-yield savings account before rates fall further, said Sam Taube, a lead writer with financial advice site NerdWallet.",
      "Online financial institutions are offering some of the highest rates, with annual percentage yields around 4%.",
      "\"If the Fed lowers rates further from here, they will offer lower fixed yields, so it might make sense to open up a CD of fixed-yield savings instrument like that sooner rather than later,\" he said.",
      "Make sure you're getting the full employer match",
      "If you have a tax-advantaged savings account through your employer, such as a 401(k), financial professionals say it's important to make the most of it. If your company matches employee contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match.",
      "Vargas said a good starting point is to find out what level of contribution your employer will match \u2014 typically it's between 3% to 6% of your salary\u2014 and to contribute at least that much to your account.",
      "\"Work toward maximizing that employer match, so you're not leaving money on the table,\" he said.",
      "Setting up an automatic payroll deduction is an easy way to ensure you're contributing to your 401(k), Von Tobel said, adding that \"small, consistent increases create enormous long-term compounding.\"",
      "Before year-end, you can also make a last-minute extra contribution to your 401(k), according to CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger.",
      "Because retirement contributions lower your taxable income, \"you may also reduce your tax bill in April,\" she noted.",

      "The plane was carrying up to 20,000 packages and 38,000 gallons of fuel.",
      "In its preliminary report, the National Transportation Safety Board said that the plane reached an altitude of just 30 feet, clearing a runway fence, before coming down.

    "story": [
      "Lottery jackpots have exploded in size over the last decade.",
      "When Powerball launched in 1992, the first jackpot was $5.9 million, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association. Now, the largest Powerball jackpot on record is the $2.04 billion prize won on Nov. 7, 2022.",
      "Mega Millions followed a similar path. Its first jackpot winner in 2002 took home $28 million. Its record prize \u2014 a $1.602 billion jackpot won on Aug. 8, 2023 \u2014 ranks as the fifth-largest jackpot won in U.S. lottery history.",
      "Thirteen of the 20 largest jackpots have occurred since 2023.",
      "The bigest one this year, Christmas Eve's $1.817 billion Powerball jackpot, is now the\u00a0second-largest U.S. jackpot ever won.",
      "Here are the biggest U.S. jackpot wins before that:",
      "Only five states don't sell lottery tickets: Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada and Utah.",
      "While the prizes are huge, the odds of winning still remain extremely low. Over the last three decades, both games have been redesigned multiple times. Changes have pushed jackpots higher while also adding more ways for players to win smaller prizes.",
      "Powerball players choose five numbers from 1 to 69 and one Powerball number from 1 to 26. In 2015, Powerball increased its number of white balls from 59 to 69 and its number of red balls decreased from 35 to 26.",
      "Before the change, the odds of winning the jackpot were 1 in 175.2 million and the overall odds of winning any prize were 1 in 31.85. After the redesign, the jackpot odds became steeper, 1 in 292.2 million, while the overall odds of winning a prize improved to 1 in 24.9, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.",
      "Mega Millions requires players to pick five different numbers from one to 70 and one Mega Ball number from one to 24. A ticket wins the jackpot by matching all six numbers in a drawing.",
      "In 2025, Mega Millions changed its games to a larger starting jackpot ($50 million vs. $20 million), which \"improved odds to win the jackpot and improved overall odds,\" according to Dan Miller, a spokesperson for Mega Millions.",
      "\"Everyone who wins is winning more because of the embedded multiplier in the new game that takes all non-jackpot prizes and multiplies them by 2X, 3X, 4X, 5X or 10X,\" Miller said in an email. Through Friday, Dec. 5, he said, \"there have been 70 drawings in the new game. In that time, players have won $531 million in non-jackpot prizes. In the old game, those same prizes would have been valued at $119.8 million. That's a 343% increase in player winnings.\"",
      "For example, under the old rules, matching just the Mega Ball was a break-even outcome: a $2 ticket earned a $2 prize. Under the new game, that same match now comes with a built-in multiplier. The minimum prize is $5, which is then multiplied \u2014 meaning a player can now win $10, $15, $20, $25 or even $50 instead of just $2.",
      "The odds to win the jackpot improved from 1 in 302.6 million to\u00a01 in 290.5 million. This is because of Mega Millions removing the one gold Mega Ball from the game, Miller said.",
      "The new game has 24 Mega Balls instead of 25, which improves the odds of picking the right combinations of numbers to win the jackpot. The overall odds to win any prize went from 1 in 24 to 1 in 23.",
      "There's more money in play as well: Powerball increased the price of a ticket from $1 to $2 in 2012. Mega Millions increased its ticket prices from $1 to $2 in 2017 and from $2 to $5 in April of this year.",

Among their arguments is that the new law violates the Constitution by taxing cruise ships for the privilege of entering Hawaii ports.",
      "Plaintiff lawyers also argued that the tax would hurt tourism by making cruises more expensive. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",
      "\"Cruise tourism generates nearly $1 billion in total economic impact for Hawaii and supports thousands of local jobs, and we remain focused on ensuring that success continues on a lawful, sustainable foundation,\" association spokesperson Jim McCarthy said in a statement.",
      "According to court records, the plaintiffs will appeal. They asked the judge to grant an injunction pending an appeal and requested a ruling by Saturday afternoon, given that the law takes effect Jan. 1.",
      "Hawaii will continue to defend the law, which requires cruise operators to pay their share of transient accommodation tax to address climate change threats to the state, state Attorney General Anne Lopez said in a statement.",
      "The U.S. government intervened in the case, calling the tax a \"scheme to extort American citizens and businesses solely to benefit Hawaii\" in conflict with federal law.",

    "summary": "His lawyers argued that Rozier's alleged involvement\u200b in the wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies is limited.",
    "story": [
      "Terry Rozier's attorneys filed a motion in federal court asking a judge to throw out the charges in a gambling case that has sidelined him from playing point guard for the Miami Heat so far this season.",
      "Rozier pleaded not guilty earlier this month to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Prosecutors allege the conspiracies happened between December 2022 and March 2024.",
      "Federal prosecutors accused Rozier of participating in a scheme which facilitated bets on NBA basketball games that allegedly took advantage of insider information related to injury reports.",
      "His lawyers argued in the filing made public on Tuesday that Rozier's alleged involvement in the wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies is limited.",
      "His attorneys argued that the government's claim that sportsbooks completed bets that otherwise might not have been honored is a theory of fraud that \"has repeatedly been rejected,\" and they argue that the federal wire fraud statute had been narrowed by a recent Supreme Court ruling.",
      "\"The only basis for any alleged misconduct is breaching the sportsbook rules themselves, rather than any cognizable theory of fraud,\" Rozier's lawyers, \u00a0A. Jeff Ifrah and James Trusty, wrote. The attorneys also argue in the motion that the indictment fails to allege an essential element of money laundering conspiracy: that Rozier agreed to commit the offense. Thus, they argue, both charges should be dropped.",
      "Federal prosecutors accused Rozier of participating in a scheme surrounding a\u00a0Charlotte Hornets\u00a0and\u00a0New Orleans Pelicans\u00a0game on March 23, 2023. Rozier, who played for the Hornets before being traded to the Miami Heat in early 2024, played only 9 minutes and 34 seconds, leaving the game with right foot discomfort.",
      "The indictment alleges that Rozier passed this information before the game to his close childhood friend and co-defendant Deniro Laster. His friend then allegedly placed wagers using that information and allegedly sold that information to others, prosecutors said.",
      "Prosecutors said in a Dec. 16 letter to the judge, right after Rozier's attorneys filed their motion to dismiss but before it was made public, that Laster has lived with Rozier and has frequently traveled with him to attend Rozier's games. Between approximately December 2022 and May 2025, Laster was paid over $165,000 in regular payments from Rozier's company, GMB Chronicles LLC, the prosecutors' letter said.",
      "Rozier's attorneys said in their motion, \"Mr. Rozier's only role in the alleged scheme was to provide nonpublic information to Deniro Laster that enabled Laster to place wagers using that information.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York did not respond to a request for comment before publication.",
      "The letter filed by the government last week detailed a growing dispute between the government and Rozier over the intertwined relationship between the co-defendants. The letter notifies the court about a potential conflict, alleging that Rozier was paying for Laster's legal fees. Prosecutors also point to their concerns about Rozier's attorney making public comments on the case, such as saying Rozier relied on a \"bad friend,\" and was \"confiding in a friend,\" and \"that's not a crime.\"",
      "Rozier was\u00a0arrested\u00a0in Orlando on Oct. 23 during a sweeping FBI crackdown in which 34 defendants were snagged across two federal indictments.",
      "Rozier appeared in court in Brooklyn on Dec. 8 alongside Laster. He was released on a $3 million bond secured by his home in Florida and another property.",
      "Laster, who lives in Cleveland, was released on a $50,000 secured bond by his mother and cousin.",
      "Both defendants surrendered their passports, agreed to travel limitations, be tested for substances and not partake in gambling, among other bond conditions. They are due back in court on March 3 for a hearing before U.S. District Judge LaShann DeArcy Hall.",

    "story": [
      "Every holiday season, families flock to Main Street in Chickasha, Oklahoma, for its parade and dazzling light show. But it's not just the brightly lit Christmas tree catching their attention \u2014 a nearly 50-foot-tall leg lamp is stealing the spotlight.",
      "The giant statue, which officially reopened as a permanent attraction in November 2022, pays homage to the 1983 Christmas classic \"A Christmas Story.\" It's inspired by one of the film's iconic scenes, where Ralphie's dad Mr. Parker gets the leg lamp as a \"major award\" for winning a newspaper crossword puzzle contest.",
      "\"When he pulled the leg lamp out of the box, I could not get that out of my mind. I mean, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen,\" Tim Elliot, CEO of Standley Systems, a family-owned business technology company based in Chickasha, told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "A few years ago, that scene made a lightbulb go off in Elliot's head \u2013 put a giant leg lamp front and center on Main Street.",
      "The Chickasha Festival of Light with its 3.5 million twinkle lights and 170-foot-tall Christmas tree has frequently been named one of the best light shows in the country, bringing more than 250,000 visitors each year. But Elliot wanted to add something special that would draw people to Chickasha year-round. So, he pitched the quirky idea at a meeting for economic development.",
      "\"I pulled the leg lamp out and set it on the conference table, and I said, 'How about a 100-foot leg lamp at the end of Main Street?'\"",
      "Attendees laughed and shrugged off the idea, suggesting it was never going to happen. But Elliot was determined. He raised more than $1 million, and in 2021, the statue went up.",
      "But like the movie, the lamp kicked off controversy.",
      "Jim Cowan, Chickasha economic development director and president of the Chickasha Chamber of Commerce, said attorneys representing Warner Brothers sent a letter to the Chickasha Community Foundation that essentially read, \"cease and desist, destroy it, tear it down.\"",
      "\"We were very determined. We weren't going to let that happen. That if we had to go and battle in the courts we would because we felt like we did things the right way,\" Cowan said.",
      "The group explained to Warner Brothers that they were not profiting off the lamp because they don't charge admission, and a neighboring gift shop sells licensed products from the film. Elliot says the group hasn't heard from the entertainment company in about a year and a half.",
      "That's good news for visitors - like John Prock from Washington, D.C., who drove from his parents' house in Oklahoma to visit the giant leg lamp.",
      "\"My parents mentioned it, so I came down to visit them, and they said, 'Well, while you're here, let's go see the leg lamp.' So we literally hopped in the car, drove almost three hours to get here, and here we are,\" Prock said.",
      "The lamp has become a beacon for tourists and businesses.",
      "\"Tourism is at an all time high and a lot of that can be traced one way or another to a leg lamp,\" Cowan said.",
      "Chet Hitt grew up just 20 miles away before moving out west and becoming a successful business developer. Now, he's back home \u2013 and has big plans, investing millions in the town.He has plans to develop a business park and renovate downtown, as more and more people come to town to see the lamp.",
      "\"You drive down this little town and you see kids playing and the community behind things and the support. It just really they buy into what's here,\" Hitt said, adding that he hopes to see continued growth in the town over the next decade.",

    "summary": "Flat-headed cats are among the world's most threatened wild felines.",
    "story": [
      "An elusive wild cat long feared extinct in Thailand has been rediscovered three decades after the last recorded sighting, conservation authorities and an NGO said Friday.",
      "Flat-headed cats are among the world's most threatened wild felines, with the International Union for Conservation of Nature estimating that just 2,500 adults exist in the wild. The rare animals are about the size of a domestic cat and have distinctive, round, close-set eyes.",
      "Flat-headed cats are found only in Southeast Asia and typically live in dense wetland ecosystems like peat swamps and freshwater mangroves. Such areas are under threat: Thailand's peat swamp forests have been heavily fragmented, largely due to land conversion and agricultural expansion, said veterinarian and researcher Kaset Sutasha of Kasetsart University. The last confirmed sighting of a flat-headed cat in Thailand was in 1995.",
      "Last year, wild cat conservation organization Panthera and Thailand's Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation began an ecological survey that used camera traps in the country's Princess Sirindhorn Wildlife Sanctuary.",
      "Flat-headed cats were detected 29 times during the survey, Panthera and Thai officials said. It was not immediately clear how many individuals the detections represent, as the species lacks distinctive markings, so counting is tricky. Pattanarangsan said the survey's findings suggest a relatively high concentration of the species.",
      "The footage included a female flat-headed cat with her cub \u2014 a rare and encouraging sign for a species that typically produces only one offspring at a time. The species has also struggled to reproduce across isolated areas, contributing to its endangerment.",
      "Kaset, who was not involved in the survey but has researched wild cats for years, said the \"rediscovery is exciting\" but is only a \"starting point\" for future conservation efforts.",
      "\"What comes after this is more important \u2014 how to enable them to live alongside us sustainably, without being threatened,\" Kaset said.",
      "In addition to Thailand, flat-headed cats can be found in Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo, according to the Felidae Conservation Fund. They have a diet dominated by fish, frogs and shrimp, and are nocturnal, elusive animals.",
      "Much about the species remains a mystery because of their rarity and the difficulty of accessing their habitats, Panthera conservation program manager Rattapan Pattanarangsan said.",

    "summary": "Strikes against ISIS targets in Nigeria come after President Trump spent weeks accusing the West African country's government of failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Thursday that the U.S. launched \"powerful and deadly\" strikes against Islamic State forces in Nigeria, after spending weeks accusing the West African country's government of failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.",
      "\"Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!\" Mr. Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \"I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not provide further details on the strikes, such as how many people were killed, who or what was specifically targeted, or how many strikes were carried out, other than to say they were \"numerous perfect strikes.\"",
      "U.S. Africa Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in Africa, said in a statement that its \"initial assessment is that multiple ISIS terrorists were killed in the ISIS camps.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted on X: \"The President was clear last month: the killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria (and elsewhere) must end. \"The @DeptofWar is always ready, so ISIS found out tonight \u2014 on Christmas. More to come\u2026 Grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation.\"",
      "The Defense Department posted to its X account\u00a0an unclassified 9-second video that appeared to show a missile being launched from a military vessel.",
      ".@POTUS \u201cTonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ct7rUW128t",
      "In its own statement, Nigeria's foreign ministry acknowledged the strikes\u00a0and indicated that it was given advanced notice, saying that \"Nigerian authorities remain engaged in structured security cooperation with international partners, including the United States of America, in addressing the persistent threat of terrorist and violent extremism. This has led to precision hits on terrorist targets in Nigeria by air strikes in the North West.\"",
      "\"Terrorist violence in any form, whether directed at Christians, Muslims or other communities, remains an affront to Nigeria's values and to international peace and security,\" the ministry added.",
      "Nigerian\u00a0 Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar went further, telling a local television network his nation provided the U.S. with intelligence on jihadists before the raids, French news agency AFP reported. It quoted him as saying he spoke by phone with Secretary of State Marco Rubio \"for 19 minutes before the strike and then we spoke again for another five minutes before it went on.\"",
      "Asked if there would be more strikes, Tuggar said: \"It is an ongoing thing, and we are working with the U.S. We are working with other countries as well.\"",
      "In early November, Mr. Trump said that he had instructed the Pentagon to \"prepare for possible action\" in Nigeria after he alleged that Nigeria's government was not doing enough to combat the persecution of Christians there.",
      "\"If we attack, it will be fast, vicious and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians! WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!\" Mr. Trump wrote on Nov. 1.",
      "In response at the time, Hegseth wrote on social media that the Department of War, the Trump administration's preferred term for the Defense Department, was \"preparing for action.\"",
      "This comes about a week after the U.S. conducted a series of strikes on ISIS targets in Syria in response to the killing of two U.S. soldiers and an interpreter.",
      "Mr. Trump in November also said he would be designating Nigeria as a \"country of particular concern.\"",
      "Designating a \"country of particular concern\" under the\u00a01998 International Religious Freedom Act\u00a0is an executive prerogative that normally follows recommendations from both the congressionally mandated U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and the State Department.",
      "The State Department usually releases\u00a0its annual\u00a0Report on International Religious Freedom in the spring, but has not yet done so this year. The report may or may not include \"particular concern\" designations, which can be done at any time. And, such designations, which authorize U.S. penalties, do not necessarily impose sanctions.",
      "The Nigerian government has rejected Mr. Trump's claims that it is not doing enough to protect Christians from violence. Analysts have said that while Christians are among those targeted, the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria's Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur. Earlier Thursday, at least five people were killed and dozens more injured in an explosion at a mosque in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri.",
      "Nigeria's President Bola Ahmed Tinubu previously said on social media that the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality.",
      "\"Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,\" Tinubu said. \"Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.\"",
      "Nigeria was first placed on the \"country of particular concern\"\u00a0list\u00a0by the U.S. in 2020 in what the State Department called \"systematic violations of religious freedom.\" But the designation did not single out attacks on Christians. The designation was lifted in 2023 in what many saw as a way to improve ties between the countries ahead of a visit by then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken.",

    "summary": "Iran seized a foreign oil tanker as it traveled the strategic Strait of Hormuz carrying some 25,000 barrels of smuggled fuel, state media said.",
    "story": [
      "Tehran, Iran \u2014 Iran seized a foreign oil tanker as it traveled the strategic Strait of Hormuz, state media said Friday.",
      "Mojtaba Ghahramani, a provincial chief of the justice department, said the oil tanker was carrying some 4 million liters (25,000 barrels) of smuggled fuel when the Revolutionary Guard naval forces seized the vessel, the official IRNA news agency reported.",
      "Ghahramani said the forces also detained 16 foreign crew members of the tanker, adding that the seizure was a remarkable \"blow \" to smugglers. He didn't disclose the nationality of the crew or the flag of the tanker.",
      "Iran occasionally seizes oil-carrying vessels over similar charges in the region. In November, Iran seized a ship as it traveled through the narrow Strait of Hormuz over what it said were violations, including carrying an illegal consignment.",
      "The West has blamed Iran for a series of limpet mine attacks on vessels that damaged tankers in 2019, as well as for a drone attack on an Israeli-linked oil tanker that killed two European crew members in 2021. Those attacks began after President Trump, in his first term in office, unilaterally withdrew from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.",
      "Iran also seized the Portuguese-flagged cargo ship MSC Aries in April 2024.",
      "Following years of tensions between Iran and the West, coupled with the situation in the Gaza Strip, Iran saw a full-scale 12-day war in June with Israel, whose strikes led to the deaths of senior military commanders and nuclear scientists. Iran's retaliatory missile barrage killed 28 in Israel.",
      "Tehran has long threatened to close off the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all traded oil passes. The U.S. Navy has long patrolled the Mideast through its Bahrain-based 5th Fleet to keep the waterways open.",

    "summary": "King Charles III led his family to church on foot ahead of his annual Christmas Day speech that is expected to focus on pilgrimage.",
    "story": [
      "King Charles III and members of the royal family \u2014 minus his disgraced brother, the former Prince Andrew \u2014 gathered for Christmas at the king's private Sandringham Estate, where they traditionally spend the holiday. In the king's annual Christmas speech, broadcast across Britain and the Commonwealth, he stressed the importance of both unity and diversity.",
      "In the morning, Charles and Queen Camilla, along with the Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Kate, their children and extended family members, walked to services at St. Mary Magdalene Church at Sandringham, in Norfolk, about 100 miles north of London.",
      "Members of the royal family also stopped to greet people in the crowd outside.",
      "Andrew was not present for the holiday gathering, BBC News reported, in the wake of the\u00a0scandal over his ties to the late sex offender\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein. He\u00a0did not attend last year either. In October, he was\u00a0stripped of his remaining titles and honors, including prince, and is now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.",
      "Later in the day, the king's annual Christmas Day speech was watched by millions of people in the U.K. and across the Commonwealth, an association of 56 nations with historic ties to Britain.",
      "\"As I meet people of different faiths, I find it enormously encouraging to hear how much we have in common, a shared longing for peace and a deep respect for all life,\" Charles said in his address, which was recorded earlier this month at Westminster Abbey.",
      "Amid \"division both at home and abroad,\" he said, there are \"values of which we must never lose sight.\"",
      "\"With the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong.\"",
      "Westminster Abbey, in the heart of London, is where monarchs have been crowned since William the Conqueror in 1066, and it has also been the site of numerous royal weddings.",
      "The speech was accompanied by a video of members of the royal family, including scenes from the king's historic trip to the Vatican, where he prayed with\u00a0Pope Leo XIV in an effort to forge closer relations between the Church of England and the Catholic Church.",
      "The speech is one of the rare occasions when Charles, 77, can voice his own views and doesn't seek guidance from the government. The remarks typically have a strong religious framework, reflect current issues and sometimes draw on the monarch's personal experiences.",
      "The king's speech was followed by a performance by a Ukrainian choir and London's Royal Opera Chorus, in a sign of support for Ukraine in its war against Russia's invasion.",
      "This was Charles' fourth Christmas speech since ascending to the throne after his mother,\u00a0Queen Elizabeth II, died in September 2022.",
      "The address comes just two weeks after Charles made a deeply personal television appearance in which he said \"good news\" from his doctors meant that he would be able to reduce his treatment for cancer in the new year.",
      "The king was diagnosed with a still undisclosed form of cancer in early 2024. Buckingham Palace says his treatment is now moving to a \"precautionary phase\" and his condition will be monitored to ensure his continued recovery.",
      "During last year's Christmas address, Charles honored care workers around the country and gave a special thanks to the doctors and nurses who supported him after his cancer diagnosis.",
      "Catherine, Princess of Wales, also underwent treatment for cancer last year. She said in January that she was in remission\u00a0after going through some \"hard times\" during her recovery. Kate, as she is widely called, has not shared details about what type of cancer it was.",
      "She and her husband Prince William, the\u00a0heir to the throne, have three children: 12-year-old Prince George of Wales, 10-year-old Princess Charlotte of Wales and 7-year-old Prince Louis of Wales.",

      "He said they discussed \"certain substantive details of the ongoing work\" on a potential peace deal with Russia, though he did not specify what issues they talked about.",
      "\"I thank them for the constructive approach, the intensive work, and the kind words and Christmas greetings to the Ukrainian people,\" Zelenskyy said in a statement posted on X. \"We are truly working 24/7 to bring closer the end of this brutal Russian war against Ukraine.\"",
      "In a short video posted later, he said\u00a0they spoke for nearly an hour.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment on the talks.",

      "U.S. envoys have been holding talks with the Russian side as well. Kirill Dmitriev, who heads Russia's sovereign wealth fund, traveled to Miami for meetings last weekend.",
      "Despite the talks, in the days leading up to the holiday, Russia kept up its missile and drone bombardment of Ukrainian cities, while a Russian general was killed in a car bomb explosion in Moscow.",
      "Earlier this week, Zelenskyy said he would be willing to withdraw troops from the country's eastern industrial heartland as part of a plan to end the war, if Moscow also pulls back and the area becomes a demilitarized zone monitored by international forces.",
      "The proposal offered a potential compromise on control of the Donbas region, which has been a major sticking point in peace negotiations.

    "summary": "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a national bravery award to honor those who confronted an antisemitic terror attack.",
    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced plans Thursday for a national bravery award to recognize civilians and first responders who confronted \"the worst of evil\" during an antisemitic\u00a0terror attack that left 15 dead and has cast a heavy shadow over the nation's holiday season.",
      "Albanese said he plans to establish a special honors system for those who placed themselves in harm's way to help during the attack on a beachside Hanukkah celebration, like Ahmed al Ahmed, a Syrian-Australian Muslim who disarmed one of the assailants before being wounded himself.",
      "The attackers, identified as Sajid Akram, who was killed by police during the Dec. 14 attack, and his 24-year-old son Naveed Akram, are accused of perpetrating Australia's worst massacre since 1996.",
      "Speaking at a press conference after a Christmas Day lunch at a charitable foundation in Sydney, Albanese described a holiday season defined by a sharp contrast between extremist violence and the \"best of humanity.\"",
      "\"This Christmas is a different one because of the anti-terror and the terrorist attack motivated by ISIS and antisemitism,\" Albanese said. \"But at the same time as we have seen the worst of humanity, we have seen the bravery and kindness and compassion ... from those who rushed to danger.\"",
      "Acts of heroism amid the tragedy",
      "The proposed honors would recognize those who are nominated and recommended for bravery or meritorious awards under the existing Australian Honors and Awards system for their actions during and after the attack. Officials have not yet said who would be honored.",
      "In the days after Ahmed's story came to light, members of the public donated more than $1.5 million\u00a0to aid the 44-year-old father and shop owner who was seen on video tackling one of the gunmen from behind and wrestling the rifle from his hands. He was shot multiple times in the left arm, apparently by the second gunman, and was expected to face months of recovery.",
      "\"Ahmed did really a heroic job,\" his cousin, Mohammad al Ahmed, told The Associated Press. \"Without any hesitation, he tackled the terrorist and disarmed him just to save innocent people.\"",
      "Other accounts of heroism also emerged, including acts of extraordinary bravery by victims who did not survive.",
      "They included a married couple in their 60s,\u00a0Boris and Sofia Gurman, who were seen on video trying to stop the attack just before it unfolded. In the footage, Boris Gurman can be seen grabbing a rifle from one of the two gunmen as they unloaded multiple weapons from their car, which had an ISIS flag draped across the windshield. Moments later, the Gurmans were shot and killed.",
      "\"This encapsulates who Boris and Sofia were \u2014 people who instinctively and selflessly tried to help others,\" their family said in a statement.",
      "Another man, 62-year-old Reuven Morrison, was shot dead as he pelted one of the attackers with bricks.",
      "\"From my sources and understanding, he had jumped up the second the shooting started. He managed to throw bricks at the terrorist,\" his daughter, Sheina Gutnick, told CBS News the day after the attack. His actions were also captured on video.",
      "Gutnick berated the government and police for being \"untrained for this massacre, untrained for what's to come, untrained for what the Jewish community has been telling the Australian government is inevitable,\" adding to a chorus of\u00a0criticism after a documented rise in hate attacks\u00a0targeting Australia's Jewish residents.",
      "An American who was at the Bondi Beach event, Rabbi Leibel Lazaroff, ran over to help a police officer who was shot, taking off his own shirt to use as a tourniquet, his father told CBS News. Moments later, Lazaroff was also shot and wounded, and his mentor was killed. \"As I was talking to Leibel, he said, 'I wish I could have done more,'\" his father said.",
      "Australia strengthening gun laws",
      "Just a day after pushing through the country's toughest firearm laws, New South Wales state leader Chris Minns issued a plea for national solidarity, urging Australians to support their Jewish neighbors during what he described as a fortnight of \"heartbreak and pain.\"",
      "\"Everybody in Australia needs to wrap their arms around them and lift them up,\" Minns said at a news conference Thursday. \"I want them to know that Australians have got their back. We're in their corner and we're going to help them get through this.\"",
      "The gun reforms, which passed through the New South Wales state legislature on Christmas Eve, include capping individual gun ownership at four and reclassifying high-risk weapons like pump-action firearms.",
      "The legislation also tightens licensing by reducing permit terms to two years, restricting ownership to Australian citizens and removing the review pathway for license denials.",
      "\"Gun reform alone will not solve hatred or extremism, but we can't fail to act on restricting access to weapons which could lead to further violence against our citizens, Minns said earlier in the week when introducing the proposed laws.",
      "Other new laws will ban the public display of terrorist symbols and grant police expanded powers to restrict public gatherings in specific areas following terrorist incidents.",
      "Albanese has also announced plans to tighten Australia's already strict gun laws.",

    "published": "Thu, 25 Dec 2025 11:43:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Jair Bolsonaro, who has been hospitalized since Wednesday, has been serving a 27-year prison sentence\u200b since November for an attempted coup.",
    "story": [
      "Former Brazilian President\u00a0Jair Bolsonaro\u00a0underwent double hernia surgery on Thursday, his family said.",
      "In an Instagram post, Bolsonaro's wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, said the surgery was a success. The procedure in Brasilia, the nation's capital, lasted about 3\u00bd hours and was completed without complications, according to the family.",
      "Bolsonaro, who has been hospitalized since Wednesday, has been serving a\u00a027-year prison sentence\u00a0since November for an attempted coup.",
      "He was granted court permission to leave prison after federal police doctors confirmed that he needed the procedure.",
      "\"It is a complex surgery,\" Dr. Claudio Birolini said on Wednesday, according to Agence France-Presse. \"But it is a standardized... scheduled surgery, so we expect the procedure to be carried out without major complications.\"",
      "Doctors say Bolsonaro's double hernia causes him pain. The former leader, who was in power between 2019 and 2022, has gone through several other surgeries since he was stabbed in the abdomen during a campaign rally in 2018.",
      "Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversaw Bolsonaro's coup trial and sentenced him to prison, authorized the procedure but denied the former president's request for house arrest after he leaves the hospital.",
      "Bolsonaro doesn't have any contact with the few other inmates at the federal police headquarters in Brasilia, where he is held and where his around 130-square-foot room has a bed, a private bathroom, air conditioning, a television and a desk, according to authorities.",
      "He has free access to his doctors and lawyers, but other visitors must receive approval from the Supreme Court. On Wednesday, de Moraes authorized Bolsonaro's sons to visit him while he's hospitalized.",
      "After Thursday's operation, doctors will assess whether Bolsonaro can undergo an additional procedure: blockage of the phrenic nerve, which controls the diaphragm, for recurrent hiccups, Birolini said.",
      "Early Thursday, his eldest son, Sen. Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, told reporters before the surgery that his father had written a letter confirming he had appointed him as his political party's presidential candidate in next year's election. Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro announced on Dec. 5 that he will challenge\u00a0President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who is seeking a fourth nonconsecutive term, as the candidate of Bolsonaro's Liberal Party.",
      "The senator read the letter to journalists, and his office released a reproduction of it to the media.",
      "\"He represents the continuation of the path of prosperity that I began well before becoming president, as I believe we must restore the responsibility of leading Brazil with justice, resolve and loyalty to the aspirations of the Brazilian people,\" Bolsonaro said in the handwritten letter, dated Dec. 25.",
      "The former president and several of his allies were convicted by a panel of Supreme Court justices for attempting to overthrow Brazil's democratic system following his 2022 election defeat.",
      "The plot included plans to kill Lula, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and de Moraes. There was also a plan to encourage an insurrection in early 2023.",
      "Bolsonaro was also convicted on charges that include leading an armed criminal organization and attempting the violent abolition of the democratic rule of law. He has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "AFP  \n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "\"Fragile is the flesh of defenseless populations, tried by so many wars, ongoing or concluded, leaving behind rubble and open wounds,\" the pope said at the mass in St Peter's Basilica.",

      "Heavy rains have battered Gaza in recent days, compounding the harsh conditions of the Palestinian territory's residents, nearly all of whom were displaced during the war. The U.N. has said an estimated 1.3 million people currently need shelter assistance in Gaza and has warned of the increasing risk of hypothermia as temperatures dip.",
      "Leo met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the Vatican last month. According to a Vatican statement, both leaders agreed on \"the urgent need to provide assistance to the civilian population in Gaza\" and to \"end the conflict by pursuing a two-state solution,\" which would see an independent Palestinian state created alongside Israel.",
      "In a Christmas blessing Thursday, Leo also urged Russia and Ukraine to find the \"courage\" for direct talks following weeks of intense international diplomacy to end their nearly four-year war.",

Historically an event filled with joy and wonder, it was the first such ceremony since the war in Gaza began in 2023. But hardly any tourists were in attendance.",
      "For more than two years, international tourists and Christian pilgrims have largely stayed away following Hamas' deadly terrorist attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. As the war in Gaza raged, church leaders canceled Bethlehem's public Christmas celebrations.",
      "But this year, for Bethlehem Mayor Maher Canawati, the\u00a0Trump administration-brokered ceasefire was reason enough to try to bring the faithful back to where the Christmas story began.",

      "Inside the 4th-century Church of the Nativity, one of the world's oldest and most sacred Christian sites, around 15,000 visitors would arrive every day in times of peace. The absence of tourists has devastated Bethlehem's tourism industry, and nearly its entire economy, driving unemployment up to 70%. Hotel vacancies have been at record highs.",

    "story": [
      "Trump-backed candidate Nasry Asfura won Honduras' presidential election, the country's electoral authorities said Wednesday afternoon, ending a weeks-long count.",
      "The election result has continued a swing to the right in parts of Latin America, just a week after Chile chose the far-right politician Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast as its next president.",
      "Asfura, of the conservative National Party, received 40.27% of the vote in the Nov. 30, edging out four-time candidate Salvador Nasralla of the conservative Liberal Party, who finished with 39.39% of the vote.",
      "Asfura won in his second bid for the presidency, after he and Nasralla were neck-and-neck during a long vote count that fueled international concern over the Central American nation's fragile electoral system.",
      "On Tuesday night, a number of electoral officials and candidates were already fighting and contesting the results of the election. Meanwhile, followers in Asfura's campaign headquarters erupted into cheers.",
      "\"Honduras: I am prepared to govern,\" wrote Asfura, the former mayor of Honduras' capital Tegucigalpa, in a post on X shortly after the results were released. \"I will not let you down.\"",
      "The results were a rebuke of the current leftist leader and her governing democratic socialist Liberty and Re-foundation Party, known as LIBRE, whose candidate finished in a distant third place with 19.19% of the vote.",
      "Asfura ran as a pragmatic politician, pointing to his popular infrastructure projects in the capital. President Trump endorsed the 67-year-old conservative just days before the vote, saying he was the only Honduran candidate the U.S. administration would work with.",
      "\"If he doesn't win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Late last month, Mr. Trump also\u00a0pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez \u2014 a National Party member \u2014 on drug trafficking and weapons charges, allowing him to leave a U.S. federal prison. The U.S. president claimed Hernandez was \"treated very harshly and unfairly,\" but his decision drew criticism from some members of both parties.",
      "Nasralla has alleged that the election was fraudulent and called for a recount of all the votes just hours before the official results were announced.",
      "On Tuesday night, he addressed Mr. Trump in a post on X, writing: \"Mr. President, your endorsed candidate in Honduras is complicit in silencing the votes of our citizens. If he is truly worthy of your backing, if his hands are clean, if he has nothing to fear, then why doesn't he allow for every vote to be counted?\"",
      "He and others opponents of Asfura have maintained that Mr. Trump's last-minute endorsement was an act of electoral interference that ultimately swung the results of the vote.",
      "The unexpectedly tumultuous election was also marred by a sluggish vote count, which fueled even more accusations.",
      "The Central American nation was stuck in limbo for more than three weeks as vote-counting by electoral authorities lagged, and at one point was paralyzed after a special count of final vote tallies was called, fueling warnings by international leaders.",
      "Ahead of the announcement, Organization of American States Secretary General Albert Rambin on Monday made an \"urgent call\" to Honduran authorities to wrap up a special count of the final votes before a deadline of Dec. 30. The Trump administration warned that any attempts to obstruct or delay the electoral count would be met with \"consequences.\"",
      "For the incumbent, progressive President Xiomara Castro, the election marked a political reckoning. She was elected in 2021 on a promise to reduce violence and root out corruption.",
      "She was among a group of progressive leaders in Latin American who were elected on a hopeful message of change around five years ago, but are now being cast out after failing to deliver on their vision. Castro said last week that she would accept the results of the elections even after she claimed that Mr. Trump's actions in the election amounted to an \"electoral coup.\"",
      "But Eric Olson, an independent international observer during the Honduran election with the Seattle International Foundation, and other observers said that the rejection of Castro and her party was so definitive that they had little room to contest the results.",
      "\"Very few people, even within LIBRE, believe they won the election. What they will say is there's been fraud, that there has been intervention by Donald Trump, that we we should tear up the elections and vote again,\" Olson said. \"But they're not saying 'we won the elections.' It's pretty clear they did not.\"",

      "The private jet carrying Gen. Muhammad Ali Ahmad al-Haddad, four other military officials and three crew members crashed on Tuesday, after taking off from Turkey's capital, Ankara, killing everyone on board.

Authorities from the Turkish forensic medicine authority were working to recover and identify the remains, he said.",

    "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says a plan to end his country's war with Russia might include the establishment of demilitarized zones between Ukrianian and Russian forces.",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine won some concessions in the latest version of a U.S.-led draft plan to end the Russian invasion\u00a0revealed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, though key questions remain over territory and whether Moscow could accept the new terms.",
      "The 20-point plan, agreed on by U.S. and Ukrainian negotiators, was being reviewed by Moscow, but the Kremlin has thus far refused to abandon its hardline territorial demands for full Ukrainian withdrawal from the east.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday Moscow was \"formulating its position\" and declined to comment on the specifics of the latest plan. He said Moscow believes it's \"highly inappropriate to conduct any kind of communication via the media.\"",
      "Zelenskyy briefed journalists on each point of the plan on Tuesday but reporters didn't have permission to reveal information about it until Wednesday morning.",
      "Zelenskyy conceded there are some points in the document he doesn't like, but said Kyiv has succeeded in removing immediate requirements for Ukraine to withdraw from the Donetsk region in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland or that land seized by Moscow's army would be recognized as Russian.",
      "Nevertheless, the Ukrainian leader indicated the proposal would pave the way for Kyiv to pull some troops back, including from the 20 percent of the Donetsk region that it controls, where demilitarized zones would be established.",
      "It also got rid of demands that Kyiv must legally renounce its bid for NATO membership.",
      "Zelenskyy presented the plan during a two-hour briefing with journalists, reading from a highlighted and annotated version.",
      "\"In the Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions, the line of troop deployment as of the date of this agreement is de facto recognized as the line of contact,\" Zelenskyy said of the latest version.",
      "\"A working group will convene to determine the redeployment of forces necessary to end the conflict, as well as to define the parameters of potential future special economic zones,\" he added.",
      "This appears to suggest the plan opens the way for, but delays, options that Ukraine was previously reluctant to consider -- a withdrawal of troops and the creation of demilitarized zones.",
      "\"We are in a situation where the Russians want us to withdraw from the Donetsk region, while the Americans are trying to find a way,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "\"They are looking for a demilitarized zone or a free economic zone, meaning a format that could satisfy both sides,\" he continued.",
      "President Trump is trying to broker an to end the four-year war triggered by Russia's 2022 invasion.",
      "Tens of thousands have been killed, eastern Ukraine decimated and millions forced to flee their homes.",
      "Russian troops have been advancing on the frontline and hammering cities and Ukraine's energy grid\u00a0with nightly missile and drone barrages. The defense ministry on Wednesday said it had captured another Ukrainian settlement, in the southern Zaporizhzhia region.",
      "Moscow claimed in 2022 to have annexed four Ukrainian regions \u2014 Donetsk, Kherson, Lugansk and Zaporizhzhia \u2014 in addition to the Crimean peninsula it seized in 2014.",
      "In Moscow, President Vladimir Putin has shown no willingness to compromise, doubling down on his hardline demands for a sweeping Ukrainian withdrawal and a string of political concessions that Kyiv and its European backers have previously cast as capitulation.",
      "Any plan that involves Ukraine pulling back its troops would need to be apparoved in a referendum in Ukraine, Zelenskyy pointed out.",
      "\"A free economic zone. If we are discussing this, then we need to go to a referendum,\" Zelenskyy said, referring to plans to designate areas Ukraine pulls out from as a demilitarized free trade zone.",
      "On NATO, Zelenskyy said it's \"the choice of NATO members whether to have Ukraine or not. Our choice has been made. We moved away from the proposed changes to the Constitution of Ukraine that would have prohibited Ukraine from joining NATO.\"",
      "Nevertheless, the prospects of Ukraine being admitted to the bloc appear to be slim-to-none, as it has been ruled out by Washington.",
      "Moscow has repeatedly said NATO membership for Ukraine is unacceptable, presenting it as one of the reasons it invaded in the first place.",
      "The plan sees joint U.S.-Ukrainian-Russian management of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, which is occupied by Russian troops. Zelenskyy said he doesn't want any Russian oversight of the facility.",
      "He also said Ukraine would hold presidential elections only after an agreement is signed \u2014 something both Mr. Trump and Putin have been pushing for.",
      "Russian officials have repeatedly criticized European and Ukrainian efforts to amend an original U.S. plan that enshrined many of Moscow's demands.",
      "Direct talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators earlier this year in Istanbul failed to break the deadlock and despite the flurry of diplomacy, the positions of the two countries appear to still be far apart.",

      "\"With reflux, the danger is not the burn in the chest or throat \u2014 the real danger is the constant backflow of acid traveling the wrong way.\"",
      "\"But when the gate gets weak, it relaxes or stays slightly open, and acid slips back up the wrong way,\" he said. This \"gate\" can weaken with magnesium deficiency, high stress, alcohol, poor sleep, dehydration and late-night snacking, all of which can disrupt healthy digestion.",

      "\"Every time acid comes back up the wrong way, it injures the lining like a slow chemical burn,\" said Gioffre, who is also the author of \"Get Off Your Acid\" and \"Get Off Your Sugar.\" Over time, that irritation erodes the lining, drives inflammation and can change the cells.",

      "The team then conducted interviews, collected food diaries, and asked the patients questionnaires to calculate how much of each dairy product people ate per day.

      "\"We were a bit surprised to see a lower dementia risk among people who ate more high-fat cheese,\" Emily Sonestedt, associate professor of nutritional epidemiology at Lund University in Sweden, told Fox News Digital.",
      "At the same time, she says it isn\u2019t entirely unexpected to see a link with vascular dementia.",

      "Typing a web address directly into your browser feels harmless. In fact, it feels normal. But new research shows that a simple habit is now one of the riskiest things you can do online. A recent study from cybersecurity firm Infoblox reveals a troubling shift.",
      "Most parked domains now redirect visitors to scams, malware or fake security warnings. In many cases, this happens instantly. You do not have to click anything. That means a single typo can expose your device.",

      "What are parked domains?",
      "Parked domains are unused or expired web addresses. Many exist because someone forgot to renew a domain. Others are deliberate misspellings of popular sites like Google, Netflix or YouTube. For years, these domains displayed harmless placeholder pages. They showed ads and links to monetize accidental traffic. While annoying, they rarely posed serious danger. That is no longer true. Infoblox found that more than 90 percent of visits to parked domains now lead to malicious content. This includes scareware, fake antivirus offers, phishing pages and malware downloads.",
      "A single mistyped web address can redirect you from a trusted site to a dangerous parked domain in seconds, Kurt Knutsson writes. (PeopleImages/Getty Images)",
      "Why direct navigation has become so risky",
      "Direct navigation means typing a website address by hand instead of using a bookmark or search result. One missing letter can change everything. For example, mistyping gmail.com as gmai.com does not trigger an error. Instead, it can deliver your email straight to criminals. Infoblox found that some of these typo domains actively run mail servers to capture messages. Even worse, many of these domains form part of massive portfolios. One group tracked by Infoblox controlled nearly 3,000 lookalike domains associated with banks, tech companies and government services.",
      "Malicious parked domains often trigger fake security warnings or hidden redirects without requiring any clicks. (CyberGuy.com)",
      "How these domains decide whom to attack",
      "Not everyone sees the same thing when visiting a parked domain. That is intentional. Researchers discovered that parked pages often profile visitors in real time. They analyze IP address, device type, location, cookies and browsing behavior. Based on that data, the domain decides what you see next. Visitors using a VPN or non-residential connection often see harmless placeholder pages. Residential users on phones or home computers get redirected to scams or malware instead. This filtering helps attackers stay hidden while maximizing successful attacks.",
      "Why parked domain scams are increasing",
      "Several trends are fueling the problem. First, traffic from parked domains is often resold multiple times through affiliate networks. By the time it reaches a malicious advertiser, there is no direct relationship with the original parking company. Second, recent ad policy changes may have increased exposure. Google now requires advertisers to opt in before running ads on parked domains. While intended to improve safety, this shift may have pushed bad actors deeper into affiliate networks with weaker oversight. The result is a murky ecosystem where responsibility is difficult to trace.",
      "Even government domains are being targeted",
      "Infoblox also found typosquatting aimed at government services. In one case, a researcher accidentally visited ic3.org instead of ic3.gov while trying to report a crime. The result was a fake warning page claiming a cloud subscription had expired. That page could just as easily have delivered malware. This highlights how easy it is to fall into these traps, even when doing something important.",

      "Save banks, email providers and government portals. Avoid typing these addresses manually.",
      "Slow down when entering web addresses. One extra second can prevent a costly mistake.",
      "Strong antivirus software protects your device if a malicious page loads, blocking malware downloads, scripts and fake security pop-ups.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Data brokers often fuel targeting by selling personal details. Removing your data can reduce exposure to personalized scam redirects.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has moved at an unusually fast pace in 2025. According to the company, it launched GPT-5 in August, followed by GPT-5.1 in November. Now, just weeks later, GPT-5.2 has launched with familiar claims of being the smartest and most capable ChatGPT yet.",
      "At first glance, the rapid rollout might seem surprising. But there's context behind it. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has reportedly called a \"code red\" inside the company, urging teams to move faster on improving ChatGPT. That push comes as competition heats up. Google recently released Gemini 3, which reportedly outperformed ChatGPT on several artificial intelligence benchmarks and delivered stronger image generation. At the same time, Anthropic's Claude continues to advance quickly.",
      "Against that backdrop, GPT-5.2 feels less like a routine upgrade and more like a strategic response. So what actually changed in GPT-5.2, and why does OpenAI say it matters?",

      "What exactly is GPT-5.2",
      "GPT-5.2 is the newest version in OpenAI's flagship 5-series of large language models. Like its predecessor, it includes two default variants. GPT-5.2 Instant is designed for everyday chatting and web searches. GPT-5.2 Thinking is meant for more complex tasks like long reasoning chains and multi-step problem solving. These two models are now the default for all ChatGPT users, including free users. They replace GPT-5.1 Instant and Thinking entirely. If you are using ChatGPT today, you are already using GPT-5.2, whether you realize it or not.",
      "What OpenAI says GPT-5 brings to ChatGPT",
      "At the same time, OpenAI continues to position GPT-5 as \"expert intelligence for everyone.\" The company says GPT-5 delivers stronger performance across math, science, finance, law and other complex subjects. In OpenAI's view, ChatGPT now acts more like a team of on-demand experts than a basic chatbot. To support that claim, OpenAI points to practical examples. These include better coding help, more expressive writing support, clearer health-related explanations and improved safety and accuracy. The company showcases use cases such as generating app code, writing speeches, explaining medications and correcting mistakes in user-submitted images. In theory, GPT-5.2 builds on that same foundation. However, while OpenAI emphasizes deeper thinking and more reliable answers, those gains remain subtle for many everyday users.",
      "What new features does GPT-5.2 add?",
      "Here's the short answer. None. GPT-5.2 does not introduce new tools, interfaces, or headline features. Instead, OpenAI describes a series of behind-the-scenes improvements that supposedly make ChatGPT faster, smarter and more capable. According to OpenAI, GPT-5.2 performs better at:",

      "NEW US MILITARY GENAI TOOL \u2018CRITICAL FIRST STEP\u2019 IN FUTURE OF WARFARE, SAYS EXPERT",
      "Why testing chatbot improvements is tricky",
      "Evaluating chatbot upgrades is harder than it sounds. Responses can vary widely even when prompts stay the same. A model might excel at one task and struggle with a nearly identical one just moments later. On top of that, OpenAI's 5-series models already perform at or near the top of the field. When performance starts that high, meaningful gains become harder to detect. With that in mind, we tested GPT-5.2, and in most tests, it behaved almost identically to GPT-5.1.",
      "Why benchmarks don't tell the full story",
      "OpenAI's benchmarks show modest gains for GPT-5.2. That matters for researchers and developers working at scale. Still, even advanced users may struggle to see practical benefits. Other companies have delivered clearer upgrades. Google's Gemini Nano Banana Pro model shows obvious gains in AI image generation and editing. Those improvements are easy for anyone to test and verify. By contrast, GPT-5.2's changes feel abstract. They exist mostly on paper rather than in daily use.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you pay for ChatGPT, there's little downside to using GPT-5.2. It replaces GPT-5.1 in the model lineup and generally performs at least as well in everyday use. Free users don't have much choice either, as model access is handled automatically. For most people, the experience feels familiar and stable.",
      "The picture shifts slightly for programmers and those who use it for business. Early pricing details suggest GPT-5.2 may cost roughly 40 percent more per million tokens than GPT-5.1, depending on usage tier and access method. That makes testing important before committing at scale.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "GPT-5.2 feels like a model released under pressure rather than inspiration. It performs well, stays reliable, and moves forward in measurable ways. Still, it doesn't deliver the kind of clear progress many people expect from a new version number. OpenAI remains a leader in AI, but competition is closing in fast. As rivals roll out more noticeable improvements, small updates may no longer be enough to stand out. For now, GPT-5.2 feels less like a breakthrough and more like OpenAI holding its ground.",

I was to rip off the label on the box, tape it up and set it on my porch steps. FedEx was going to pick it up and they'd put a label on it. And just for my trouble, he'd send me a $100 gift card! However, the guy was just too anxious. He called me again at 7 am to make sure I would follow his instructions. Right after that, I picked up my box on the steps and called Spectrum, who confirmed it was a scam. There are no such things as refurbished i17 phones because they're brand new. I called the guy back, said a few choice words and hung up on him. Since then, they have called at least twice for the same thing. Spectrum should be warning its customers!\"",

      "Scammers often strike right after a new iPhone purchase, using urgency and fake carrier calls to catch you off guard before you have time to verify. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the new iPhone replacement scam works",
      "This scam relies on timing and pressure. First, criminals focus on people who recently bought a new iPhone. That information often comes from data-broker sites, leaked purchase data or marketing lists sold online. Next, scammers spoof a carrier phone number. As a result, the call appears legitimate. They sound confident and informed because they already know the device model you ordered.",
      "Once the call begins, the story moves quickly. The scammer claims a shipping mistake occurred. Then they insist the phone must be returned right away. To reinforce urgency, they say a courier is already scheduled. If you follow the instructions, you hand over a brand-new iPhone. At that point, the device is gone. The scammer either resells it or strips it for parts. By the time you realize something is wrong, recovery is unlikely.",
      "Why this scam feels so believable",
      "This scam copies real customer service processes. Carriers do ship replacement phones. FedEx does handle returns. Gift cards are often used as apologies. Scammers blend those facts together and add urgency. They count on you acting before you verify. They also rely on one risky assumption, that a phone call that looks real must be real.",

      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier explores how the technology is changing how the world operates on Special Report.",
      "Amazon's Ring video doorbells are getting a major artificial intelligence (AI) upgrade, and it is already stirring controversy.",
      "The company has started rolling out a new feature called Familiar Faces to Ring owners across the United States. Once enabled, the feature uses AI-powered facial recognition to identify people who regularly appear at your door. Instead of a generic alert saying a person is at your door, you might see something far more personal, like \"Mom at Front Door.\" On the surface, that sounds convenient.",
      "Privacy advocates, however, say this shift comes with real risks.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",

      "Ring\u2019s new Familiar Faces feature uses AI facial recognition to identify people who regularly appear at your door and personalize alerts. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",
      "How Ring's Familiar Faces feature works",
      "Ring says Familiar Faces helps you manage alerts by recognizing people you know. Here is how it works in practice. You can create a catalog of up to 50 faces. These may include family members, friends, neighbors, delivery drivers, household staff or other frequent visitors. After labeling a face in the Ring app, the camera will recognize that person as they approach. Anyone who regularly passes in front of your Ring camera can be labeled by the device owner if they choose to do so, even if that person is unaware they are being identified.",
      "From there, Ring sends personalized notifications tied to that face. You can also fine-tune alerts on a per-face basis, which means fewer pings for your own comings and goings. Importantly, the feature is not enabled by default. You must turn it on manually in the Ring app settings. Faces can be named directly from Event History or from the Familiar Faces library. You can edit names, merge duplicates or delete faces at any time.",
      "Amazon says unnamed faces are automatically removed after 30 days. Once a face is labeled, however, that data remains stored until the user deletes it.",
      "Why privacy groups are pushing back",
      "Despite Amazon's assurances, consumer protection groups and lawmakers are raising alarms. Ring has a long history of working with law enforcement. In the past, police and fire departments were able to request footage through the Ring Neighbors app. More recently, Amazon partnered with Flock, a company that makes AI-powered surveillance cameras widely used by police and federal agencies. Ring has also struggled with internal security. In 2023, the FTC fined Ring $5.8 million after finding that employees and contractors had unrestricted access to customer videos for years. The Neighbors app previously exposed precise home locations, and Ring account credentials have repeatedly surfaced online. Because of these issues, critics argue that adding facial recognition expands the risk rather than reducing it.",
      "Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) staff attorney Mario Trujillo tells CyberGuy, \"When you step in front of one of these cameras, your faceprint is taken and stored on Amazon\u2019s servers, whether you consent or not. Today\u2019s feature to recognize your friend at your front door can easily be repurposed tomorrow for mass surveillance. It is important for state regulators to investigate.\" The Electronic Frontier Foundation is a well-known nonprofit organization that focuses on digital privacy, civil liberties and consumer rights in the tech space.",
      "WASHINGTON COURT SAYS FLOCK CAMERA IMAGES ARE PUBLIC RECORDS",
      "Once a face is labeled by the device owner, Ring can replace generic notifications with named alerts tied to that individual. (CyberGuy.com)",
      "Where the feature is blocked and why that matters",
      "Legal pressure is already limiting where Familiar Faces can launch. According to the EFF, privacy laws are preventing Amazon from offering the feature in Illinois, Texas and Portland, Oregon. These jurisdictions have stricter biometric privacy protections, which suggests regulators see facial recognition in the home as a higher-risk technology. U.S. Senator Ed Markey has also called on Amazon to abandon the feature altogether, citing concerns about surveillance creep and biometric data misuse.",
      "Amazon says biometric data is processed in the cloud and not used to train AI models. The company also claims it cannot identify all locations where a face appears, even if law enforcement asks. Still, critics point out the similarity to Ring's Search Party feature, which already scans neighborhoods to locate lost pets.",
      "We reached out to Amazon for comment but did not receive a response before our deadline.",
      "Ring's other AI feature feels very different",
      "Not all of Ring's AI updates raise the same level of concern. Ring recently introduced Video Descriptions, a generative AI feature that summarizes motion activity in plain text. Instead of guessing what triggered an alert, you might see messages like \"A person is walking up the steps with a black dog\" or \"Two people are peering into a white car in the driveway.\"",
      "HOW RESTAURANT RESERVATION PLATFORM OPENTABLE TRACKS CUSTOMER DINING HABITS",
      "Ring\u2019s Video Descriptions feature takes a different approach by summarizing activity without identifying people by name. (Amazon)",
      "How Video Descriptions decides what matters",
      "This AI focuses on actions rather than identities. It helps you quickly decide whether an alert is urgent or routine. Over time, Ring says the system can recognize activity patterns around a home and only notify you when something unusual happens. However, as with any AI system, accuracy can vary depending on lighting, camera angle, distance and environmental conditions. Video Descriptions is currently rolling out in beta to Ring Home Premium subscribers in the U.S. and Canada. Unlike facial recognition, this feature improves clarity without naming or tracking specific people. That contrast matters.",
      "Video Descriptions turns motion alerts into short summaries, helping you understand what is happening without identifying who is involved. (Amazon)",
      "Should you turn Familiar Faces on?",
      "If you own a Ring doorbell, caution is wise. While Familiar Faces may reduce notification fatigue, labeling people by name creates a detailed record of who comes to your home and when. Given Ring's past security lapses and close ties with law enforcement, many privacy experts recommend keeping the feature disabled. If you do use it, avoid full names and remove faces you no longer need. In many cases, simply checking the live video feed is safer than relying on AI labels. Not every smart home feature needs to know who someone is.",
      "How to turn Familiar Faces on or off in the Ring app",
      "If you want to review or change this setting, you can do so at any time in the Ring mobile app.",

      "Alexa is now answering your door for you",
      "Amazon is also rolling out a very different kind of AI feature for Ring doorbells, and it lives inside Alexa+. Called Greetings, this update gives Ring doorbells a conversational AI voice that can interact with people at your door when you are busy or not home. Instead of identifying who someone is, Greetings focuses on what they appear to be doing. Using Ring's video descriptions, the system looks at apparel, actions, and objects to decide how to respond.",
      "For example, if someone in a delivery uniform drops off a package, Alexa can tell them exactly where to leave it based on your instructions. You can even set preferences to guide delivery drivers toward a specific spot, or let them know water or snacks are available. If a delivery requires a signature, Alexa can ask the driver when they plan to return and pass that message along to you. The feature can also handle sales representatives or service vendors. You might set a rule such as politely declining sales pitches without ever coming to the door yourself.",
      "Greetings can also work for friends and family. If someone stops by while you are away, Alexa can greet them and ask them to leave a message for you. That interaction is saved so you can review it later. That said, the system is not perfect. Because it relies on visual context rather than identity, mistakes can happen. A friend who works in logistics could show up wearing a delivery uniform and be treated like a courier instead of being invited to leave a message. Amazon acknowledges that accuracy can vary. Importantly, Amazon says Greetings does not identify who a person is. It uses Ring's video descriptions to determine the main subject in front of the camera and generate responses, without naming or recognizing individuals. That makes it fundamentally different from the Familiar Faces feature, even though both rely on AI.",
      "Greetings is compatible with Ring Wired Doorbell Pro (3rd Gen) and Ring Wired Doorbell Plus (2nd Gen). It is available to Ring Premium Plan subscribers who have video descriptions enabled and is currently rolling out to Alexa+ Early Access users in the United States and Canada.",
      "Thinking about a Ring doorbell?",
      "If you are already in the Ring ecosystem or considering a video doorbell, Ring's lineup includes models with motion alerts, HD video, night vision, and optional AI-powered features such as Video Descriptions. While Familiar Faces remains controversial and can be turned off, many homeowners still use Ring doorbells for basic security awareness and package monitoring.",
      "If you decide Ring is right for your home, you can check out the latest Ring Video Doorbell models or compare features and pricing with other options by visiting Cyberguy.com and searching \"Top Video Doorbells.\"",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Amazon Ring's AI facial recognition feature shows how quickly convenience can collide with privacy. Familiar Faces may offer smarter alerts, but it also expands surveillance into deeply personal spaces. Meanwhile, features like Video Descriptions prove that AI can be useful without identifying people. As smart home tech evolves, the real question is not what AI can do but what it should do.",

      "Safeguarding your phone and personal data has never been more crucial.",
      "A new Android banking trojan called Sturnus is shaping up to be one of the most capable threats we have seen in a while. It is still in early development, but it already behaves like a fully mature operation.",
      "Once it infects a device, it can take over your screen, steal your banking credentials and even read encrypted chats from apps you trust. The worrying part is how quietly it works in the background. You think your messages are safe because they are end-to-end encrypted, but this malware simply waits for the phone to decrypt them before grabbing everything.",
      "It's important to note, however, that Sturnus does not break encryption; it only captures messages after your apps decrypt them on your device.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "Sturnus malware uses deceptive screens that mimic real banking apps to steal your credentials in seconds. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson\u00a0)",
      "A closer look at the malware's capabilities",
      "Sturnus combines several attack layers that give the operator nearly full visibility into the device, as reported by cybersecurity research firm ThreatFabric. It uses HTML overlays that mimic real banking apps to trick you into typing your credentials. Everything you enter goes straight to the attacker through a WebView that forwards the data instantly. It also runs an aggressive keylogging system through the Android Accessibility Service. This lets it capture text as you type, follow which app is open, and map every UI element on the screen. Even when apps block screenshots, the malware keeps tracking the UI tree in real time, which is enough to reconstruct what you are doing.",
      "NEW ANDROID MALWARE CAN EMPTY YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IN SECONDS",
      "On top of overlays and keylogging, the malware monitors WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal and other messaging apps. It waits for these apps to decrypt messages locally, then captures the text right from the screen. This means your chats may remain encrypted over the network, but once the message appears on your display, Sturnus sees the entire conversation. It also includes a full remote control feature with live screen streaming and a more efficient mode that sends only interface data. This allows precise taps, text injection, scrolling and permission approvals without showing any activity to the victim.",
      "How Sturnus stays hidden and steals money",
      "The malware protects itself by grabbing Device Administrator privileges and blocking any attempt to remove it. If you open the settings page that could disable those permissions, Sturnus detects it immediately and moves you away from the screen before you can act. It also monitors battery state, SIM changes, developer mode, network conditions and even signs of forensic investigation to decide how to behave. All this data goes back to the command-and-control server through a mix of WebSocket and HTTP channels protected with RSA and AES encryption.",
      "When it comes to financial theft, the malware has several ways to take over your accounts. It can collect credentials through overlays, keylogging, UI-tree monitoring and direct text injection. If needed, it can black out your screen with a full-screen overlay while the attacker performs fraudulent transactions in the background. Since the screen is hidden, you have no idea anything is happening until it is too late.",
      "7 ways you can stay safe from Android malware like Sturnus",
      "If you want to protect yourself from threats like this, here are a few practical things you can start doing right away.",
      "Avoid downloading APKs from forwarded links, shady websites, Telegram groups or third-party app stores. Banking malware spreads most effectively through sideloaded installers disguised as updates, coupons or new features. If you need an app that isn't in the Play Store, verify the developer's official site, check hashes if provided and read recent reviews to make sure the app hasn't been hijacked.",
      "Most dangerous malware relies on accessibility permissions because they allow full visibility into your screen and interactions. Device administrator rights are even more powerful since they can block removal. If a simple utility app suddenly asks for these, stop immediately. These permissions should only be granted to apps that genuinely need them, such as password managers or accessibility tools you trust.",
      "Install system updates as soon as they arrive, since many Android banking trojans target older devices that lack the latest security patches. If your phone is no longer receiving updates, you are at a higher risk, especially when using financial apps. Avoid sideloading custom ROMs unless you know how they handle security patches and Google Play Protect.",
      "HOW ANDROID MALWARE LETS THIEVES ACCESS YOUR ATM CASH",
      "The malware quietly captures decrypted messages from apps like WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal right as they appear on your screen. (Kurt Knutsson)",
      "Android phones come with Google Play Protect built in, which catches a large chunk of known malware families and warns you when apps behave suspiciously. But if you want greater security and control, choose a third-party antivirus app. These tools can alert you when an app starts logging your screen or trying to take over your phone.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "A lot of these campaigns rely on data brokers, leaked databases and scraped profiles to build lists of people to target. If your phone number, email, address or social handles are floating around on dozens of broker sites, it becomes much easier for attackers to reach you with malware links or tailored scams. A personal data removal service helps clean up that footprint by deleting your info from data broker listings.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

If the screen layout looks different or asks for credentials in a way you don't recognize, close the app completely. Reopen it from your app drawer and see if the prompt returns.

      "With remote control tools that stream your screen and automate taps, attackers can move money behind the scenes without you noticing. (Felix Zahn/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "Attackers frequently distribute malware through WhatsApp links, SMS messages and email attachments pretending to be invoices, refunds or delivery updates. If you receive a link you weren't expecting, open your browser manually and search for the service instead. Avoid installing anything that comes from a message, even if it appears to be from someone you know. Compromised accounts are a common delivery method.",
      "DATA BREACH EXPOSES 400,000 BANK CUSTOMERS\u2019 INFO",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Sturnus is still a young malware family, but it already stands out for how much control it gives attackers. It sidesteps encrypted messaging, steals banking credentials with multiple backup methods, and maintains a strong grip on the device through administrator privileges and constant environmental checks. Even if the current campaigns are limited, the level of sophistication here suggests a threat that is being refined for larger operations. If it reaches wide distribution, it could become one of the most damaging Android banking trojans in circulation.",

      "The six buildings are arranged around shared outdoor areas, creating a village-style layout designed for student life. (SAGA Space Architects)",
      "How 36 student apartments were printed at record speed",
      "Skovsporet includes six buildings, and each one holds six ground-level student apartments. Crews printed the structures on site using the COBOD BOD3 3D construction printer. The machine extrudes a cement-like material layer by layer, following a digital blueprint with millimeter accuracy.",
      "At first, printing a single building took several weeks. However, productivity improved quickly as the team gained experience. By the final building, printing wrapped up in just five days. That pace equals more than one student apartment printed per day.",
      "Even more notable is the small crew required to run the system. Only three people operated the printer on site. As a result, automation handled the heavy work while the team focused on oversight, quality and precision.",
      "Inside the 3D-printed student apartments",
      "Each apartment measures roughly 431 to 538 square feet. Despite their compact footprint, the layouts feel open and intentional. Every unit includes a full kitchen, a study area, a lounge, a bathroom with a shower and a bedroom with a double bed. Large roof windows and slanted ceilings pull daylight deep into the space, helping soften the concrete structure. Inside, coated plywood panels and glass elements add warmth and contrast. The result feels modern and livable rather than industrial. These homes are designed for daily student life, not just architectural headlines.",
      "AFFORDABLE 3D-PRINTED BIONIC ARM USES MUSCLE SIGNALS TO MOVE",
      "Why 3D printed construction is changing how housing gets built",
      "The real story at Skovsporet is not just speed. It is repeatability. As the team moved from one building to the next, efficiency improved without sacrificing quality. The BOD3 printer runs on a ground-based track system that allows uninterrupted printing of long wall sections. That consistency makes it easier to scale multi-unit housing projects.",
      "According to COBOD, this kind of automation reduces labor needs, shortens timelines and improves accuracy. For cities facing housing shortages, those benefits matter.",
      "How sustainability is built into this 3D printed housing project",
      "Skovsporet also shows how 3D printing supports more sustainable construction. The walls were printed using D.fab concrete with FUTURECEM, a low-carbon cement developed by Aalborg Portland. Because the printer deposits material only where it is structurally needed, waste drops significantly compared to traditional methods. The site layout also preserved 95% of the existing trees by carefully positioning print beds between them. In other words, faster construction did not come at the cost of environmental care.",
      "A COBOD BOD3 printer extrudes concrete layer-by-layer on site, forming the structural walls of Skovsporet\u2019s student apartments with millimeter precision. (SAGA Space Architects)",
      "What happens next for Denmark's 3D-printed student housing",
      "The 3D printing phase is now complete. Human crews have taken over to install roofs, windows, interiors, furniture and utilities. Landscaped gardens, walking paths and bicycle parking are also underway to create a shared village atmosphere. The project remains on schedule, with residents expected to move in by August 2026.",
      "WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST 3D-PRINTED SCHOOLS ARE UNDERWAY IN QATAR",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you care about housing affordability, this project is worth watching. Skovsporet proves that automation can deliver student housing faster while keeping quality high. It also hints at what could come next. Multiunit housing built with fewer workers, less waste and shorter timelines could ease pressure in crowded cities. While 3D-printed homes will not replace traditional construction overnight, they are clearly moving into the mainstream. For students, renters and communities, that shift could open the door to more accessible housing options.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Skovsporet is more than a construction milestone. It is a real-world example of how digital design, automation and sustainability can come together at scale. As Europe, the United States and Australia explore similar projects, this student village in Denmark may become a blueprint for future neighborhoods.",
      "Printed concrete walls rise quickly across six buildings, showing how automation helped crews complete more than one apartment per day. (SAGA Space Architects)",

You gain awareness without extra effort.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to share his tips for safe holiday shopping and finding the best deals on Cyber Monday.",
      "Christmas is around the corner, and so is the SantaStealer malware. While the name sounds jolly, this malware is more than capable of ruining your happiness this festive season. The worst part is that this new strain is available to almost anyone willing to pay a small fee. It essentially works as malware-as-a-service, letting buyers target people at scale, obviously not for any legitimate use.",
      "SantaStealer is starting to make noise across Telegram channels and underground hacker forums. It is being marketed as a stealthy, memory-only information stealer that can quietly siphon data without leaving obvious traces on disk.",
      "Memory-only does not mean undetectable. It simply reduces disk artifacts, which can delay detection rather than prevent it altogether. That promise alone is enough to attract cybercriminals, especially at a time when browser-stored passwords, session cookies and crypto wallets remain high-value targets.",
      "MALICIOUS BROWSER EXTENSIONS HIT 4.3M USERS",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\u00a0Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "SantaStealer malware is spreading ahead of Christmas, with cybercriminals marketing the data-stealing tool for hire across Telegram and underground forums. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "SantaStealer and how it actually works",
      "SantaStealer operates as a malware-as-a-service, charging $175 per month for its basic tier and $300 per month for the premium plan. Researchers at Rapid7 say the operation rebrands an earlier project called BluelineStealer, with a Russian-speaking developer pushing toward a wider launch before the end of the year.",
      "Despite bold claims about evading detection, Rapid7's analysis paints a more grounded picture. The samples they examined were not particularly difficult to analyze and lacked the advanced anti-analysis techniques being advertised, which is good news for us. If it can be detected, security tools have a better chance of removing it before it can do serious damage.",
      "Functionally, SantaStealer is still dangerous. It uses 14 separate data-collection modules that run in parallel, pulling information from browsers, messaging apps like Telegram and Discord, gaming platforms such as Steam, crypto wallet apps and extensions, and even local documents. The malware can also take screenshots of your desktop. Stolen data is written to memory, compressed into ZIP files and sent out in 10MB chunks to a hardcoded command-and-control server.",
      "One notable capability is its use of an embedded executable to get around Chrome's App-Bound Encryption, a security feature introduced in mid-2024. This workaround typically requires the malware to be executed at the user level and is not a remote bypass of Chrome's security model. Similar tricks have already been used by other info-stealers, showing how quickly attackers test and adapt to new browser protections.",
      "What this says about the current threat landscape",
      "SantaStealer is not fully operational yet and has not been distributed at scale, but it reflects a broader trend in cybercrime. Modern info-stealers are modular, configurable and sold much like regular software. The affiliate panel that Rapid7 observed allows buyers to fine-tune exactly what data the malware steals, from full system sweeps to narrowly targeted attacks focused on specific apps or crypto wallets.",
      "The malware also includes options to avoid infecting systems in certain regions and to delay execution, which can throw off both victims and security analysts. As for how SantaStealer might spread, researchers say recent campaigns increasingly rely on ClickFix-style attacks. These tricks push victims into pasting malicious commands directly into the Windows terminal, often disguised as steps to fix an issue or enable a feature.",
      "More traditional methods are still very much in play. Phishing emails, pirated software, torrent downloads, malicious ads and even deceptive YouTube comments remain effective delivery channels. Once malware like this runs on a system, it needs very little time to grab saved passwords, session cookies and wallet data that can later be abused or sold.",
      "7 steps you can take to stay safe from SantaStealer malware",
      "A few sensible habits and the right tools can significantly reduce your risk, even if malware like this continues to evolve. Here are seven practical steps you can take to stay safe:",
      "Modern antivirus tools don't just look for known malware signatures. They also monitor suspicious behavior, such as programs trying to grab browser data or run hidden processes. Keep real-time protection enabled and take alerts seriously instead of dismissing them.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Updates are not just about new features. They often patch security flaws that malware actively targets. This includes your OS, browser, browser extensions, crypto wallet apps and messaging tools. Delaying updates gives attackers a wider window to exploit known weaknesses.",
      "Info-stealers love browser-saved passwords because they are easy to grab. A password manager stores your credentials in an encrypted vault and reduces what your browser keeps locally. It also helps you use strong, unique passwords for every service without having to remember them.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Even if your password is stolen, 2FA can stop attackers from getting in. App-based authenticators are more secure than SMS codes and should be your first choice for email, crypto exchanges, cloud services and social media accounts.",
      "ClickFix-style attacks rely on trust and urgency. If a website, pop-up or video tells you to paste a command into the Windows terminal to fix something, stop. Unless you fully understand what that command does, assume it is dangerous.",
      "When your email, phone number or other personal details are widely available online, attackers can target you more convincingly. Personal data removal services help take your information down from data broker sites, reducing the chances of targeted phishing or malware lures.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "SantaStealer may not yet live up to its own hype, but that should not make you complacent. Early-stage malware often improves quickly once developers patch obvious mistakes.

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says the Ability Hand brings real touch, natural movement and unmatched durability.",
      "At 18, Jamie Grohsong was living a dream many young athletes chase for years. He was a three-time all-conference shortstop, a Division I college prospect and a player who lived for the game. Then one Fourth of July night in 2023, everything changed. A firework exploded in his hand. In seconds, Jamie lost his pitching hand, his season and what felt like his entire baseball future. The path he had worked toward since childhood disappeared. For a while, Jamie accepted that reality. Baseball, the sport that shaped his identity, was over.",

      "AI-POWERED BAT TRACKING COULD GIVE BASEBALL PLAYERS THE EDGE",
      "Jamie Grohsong throws a baseball using a bionic prosthetic hand after losing his pitching hand in a fireworks accident. His return shows how technology can help athletes reclaim what they love. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "When technology reopens a closed door",
      "Two years later, Jamie stepped back onto a baseball field wearing something he never imagined using. A bionic prosthetic known as the Ability Hand.",
      "\"The fact that I can feel and sense everything to the finest details opened my mind to the possibility of everything that could actually be done,\" he told CyberGuy.",
      "The goal was not to recreate the past. It was to find out what might still be possible.",
      "Engineers who build advanced prosthetic hands saw Jamie's story and reached out with a simple question. What if he did not have to give up the game entirely? That question started an extraordinary journey that blended grit, patience and cutting-edge engineering.",
      "\"When building the Ability Hand, we prioritized real-life usage,\" Dr. Aadeel Akhtar, founder and CEO of PSYONIC, told CyberGuy. \"While we already put the hand through its fair share of stress tests, baseball is a whole different ball game.\"",
      "Baseball is definitely a brutal test for any piece of equipment. Throwing requires precise release timing. Hitting demands force, stability and follow-through. At first, nothing came easily.",
      "Learning how to throw again",
      "Throwing a baseball with a bionic hand is not about raw strength. It is about timing and grip. The Ability Hand uses muscle sensors that detect subtle movements in the arm. During a throw, many muscles activate at once, which can cause the hand to open too early. Early throws slipped away. Some felt right. Others did not.",
      "Instead of forcing the hand to grip harder, the PSYONIC team adjusted the technique. Jamie learned to hold the ball lightly and let momentum release it naturally. Small grip changes made a real difference. Slowly, throws began to land. Then they became repeatable. For Jamie, each clean throw rebuilt confidence that had been missing for two years.",

      "A former Division I baseball prospect, Jamie Grohsong steps back onto the field with a bionic hand, redefining what is possible after life-altering injury. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The surprise moment at Oracle Park",
      "Just as Jamie started throwing again, another door opened. He received an invitation to throw the ceremonial first pitch at the San Francisco Giants' Oracle Park. It was the team he grew up watching. The timeline was tight. He had barely over a week to prepare.",
      "The pitch was not perfect. That never mattered. Standing on a Major League Baseball field with a bionic hand, Jamie proved something bigger than accuracy. He showed that the game was still part of him. Later, he said the experience taught him that life does not require perfection to be meaningful.",

      "Wearing a multi-articulating bionic hand, Jamie Grohsong proves baseball is still part of his identity two years after a devastating accident. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can you actually hit with a bionic hand?",
      "Throwing was only part of the challenge.\u00a0Hitting posed an even bigger question.",
      "\"Swinging a bat was a feeling I didn't think I'd feel again,\" Jamie said.",
      "Engineers discovered that bat placement matters more with prosthetics than with natural hands. When the bionic hand serves as the bottom hand on the bat, impact spreads across the fingers. When it sits on top, stress concentrates on the thumb. Jamie bats left-handed, which placed the prosthetic in a safer position. He told CyberGuy,\u00a0\"I can hit with this thing for sure.\"",
      "Then came the first swings. The sensation was unfamiliar. The contact felt strange. Still, the bat met the ball. One swing turned into another. Soon, balls started flying deep into the field. Then it happened. Jamie sent one over the fence.",
      "A world-first moment",
      "Those swings marked what many believe to be the first documented home runs hit using a multi-articulating bionic hand. For Jamie, it was more than a technical milestone. It was emotional closure and a new beginning at the same time. He was not trying to prove that prosthetics make athletes better. He was proving that they can help people reconnect with what they love. The bionic hand did not replace his identity. It gave him a new way to express it.",

      "Jamie's comeback highlights a larger truth about modern assistive technology. At its best, design focuses on real-life use rather than lab conditions. Even so, advanced prosthetics remain expensive and imperfect, and they can break under stress. Because of that, users need time, training and patience to adapt. Yet stories like this show how powerful thoughtful engineering can be when it works alongside human determination.

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "The FBI is warning about a disturbing scam that turns family photos into powerful weapons. Cybercriminals are stealing images from social media accounts, altering them and using them as fake proof of life in virtual kidnapping scams.",
      "These scams do not involve real abductions. Instead, criminals rely on fear, speed and believable images to pressure victims into paying ransom before they can think clearly.",

      "FACEBOOK SETTLEMENT SCAM EMAILS TO AVOID NOW",
      "Scammers steal photos from public social media accounts and manipulate them to create fake proof of life images that fuel fear and urgency. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the fake kidnapping scam works",
      "According to the FBI, scammers usually start with a text message. They claim they have kidnapped a loved one and demand immediate payment for their release. To make the threat feel real, the criminals send an altered photo pulled from social media. The FBI says these images may be sent using timed messages to limit how long victims can examine them. The agency warns that scammers often threaten extreme violence if the ransom is not paid right away. This urgency is designed to shut down rational thinking.",
      "Signs the photo may be fake",
      "When victims slow down and look closely, the altered images often fall apart. The FBI says warning signs may include missing scars or tattoos, strange body proportions or details that do not match reality. Scammers may also spoof a loved one's phone number, which makes the message feel even more convincing. Reports on sites like Reddit show this tactic is already being used in the real world.",
      "Why this fake kidnapping scam is so effective",
      "Virtual kidnapping scams work because they exploit emotion. Fear pushes people to act fast, especially when the message appears to come from someone they trust. The FBI notes that criminals use publicly available information to personalize their threats. Even posts meant to help others, such as missing person searches, can provide useful details for scammers.",
      "Ways to stay safe from virtual kidnapping scams",

      "Review the privacy settings on every social platform you use. Set profiles to private so only trusted friends and family can see your photos, posts and personal updates. Virtual kidnapping scams rely heavily on publicly visible images. Limiting access makes it harder for criminals to steal photos and create fake proof-of-life images.",

      "Avoid posting real-time travel updates, daily routines or detailed family information. Even close-up photos that show tattoos, scars or locations can give scammers useful material. The less context criminals have, the harder it is for them to make a threat feel real and urgent.",

      "Review older public photo albums and remove images that clearly show faces from multiple angles. Avoid posting large collections of high-resolution facial photos publicly. Scammers often need multiple images to convincingly alter photos. Reducing facial data weakens their ability to manipulate images.",
      "Create a simple verification plan with loved ones before an emergency happens. This may include a shared code word, a call back rule or a second trusted contact. Scammers depend on panic. Having a preset way to verify safety gives you something steady to rely on when emotions run high.",
      "Contact your mobile carrier and ask about SIM protection or a port-out PIN. This helps prevent criminals from hijacking phone numbers or spoofing calls and texts. Since many fake kidnapping scams begin with messages that appear to come from a loved one, securing phone accounts adds an important layer of protection.",
      "The FBI warns that these virtual kidnapping scams often begin with a text message that pressures victims to pay a ransom immediately. (Getty Images)",
      "If you receive a threat, save screenshots, phone numbers, images and message details. Do not continue engaging with the sender. Report the incident to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. Even if no money is lost, reports help investigators track patterns and warn others.",

      "PHOENIX \u2014 A student at Loyola University New Orleans who has twice been denied the opportunity to start a Turning Point USA chapter on campus vowed at the conservative organization's annual AmericaFest conference that she would keep fighting.",
      "Anistin Murray is a freshman at the Catholic school located in the heart of the Big Easy. She and two other would-be co-founders of the campus club have endured a monthslong battle with the school's student government association (SGA), which insists that Turning Point shouldn't have a presence on campus.",
      "On Oct. 15, the TPUSA students were first denied an official charter. Murray and her fellow founders then enlisted the help of Loyola New Orleans law students to draft an appeal, saying that the decision was \"subjective.\"",
      "\"Most of it was subjective reasoning,\" law student Ethan Estis told Fox News Digital at the time. \"They didn't really root it in any of the laws or rules and regulations that they're supposed to follow, and it was purely subjective. And that was our basis in attack in the written appeal that we did.\"",

      "GREG ABBOTT MAKES MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT TURNING POINT USA IN TEXAS",
      "After the appeal succeeded in the school's Court of Review, the case was remanded back to the SGA, the same body that denied Murray and her co-founders in the first place. Following a second review earlier in December, the SGA again blocked the right-leaning students.",
      "\"They said that, you know, it does make a lot of the students feel uncomfortable and that it will bring a lot of hate and negativity and all this disruption to the university, which I find quite sad because that's not what an organization is meant to push,\" Murray told Fox News Digital at AmericaFest in Phoenix.",
      "\"You know, they say that they stand for the majority of the students and the student body at Loyola, but I think to undermine that, there were people who voted yes to have a Turning Point at Loyola,\" she said, adding that she feels like students who agree with TPUSA's values have been silenced.",
      "Murray said that Turning Point stands for dialogue, not hatred.",
      "\"Just because people disagree with us does not mean that there needs to be uncivil discourse,\" she said. \"Like, we can talk civilly and understand that we disagree, but we're hearing each other and understanding that we both come from different places, and I think that was the biggest part for [the SGA], and that was a very important question that got reiterated a lot.\"",

      "Despite the denials, Murray remains undeterred. She wants to work with the school to find a positive solution. Part of moving forward, she said, includes having a conversation with the school on how to proceed within the university's guidelines.",
      "\"We don't want to step on our university's toes, but we are not backing down,\" said Murray.",
      "\"These people who are against us need to understand that just because they're against us, we're not against them. Turning Point is not just an outlet for conservative believers, but Turning Point does have faithfully driven values that do align with conservative values.",
      "\"Having this critical deliberation is the sense of learning and growing and what we need on this university's campus.\"",

      "The Asian Law Caucus and the Sikh Coalition, along with the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, filed the lawsuit on Tuesday in an effort to stop the California DMV from canceling the CDLs, which thecomplaint says would \"result in mass work stoppages\" starting Jan 5, 2026.",
      "\"This class-action lawsuit is brought on behalf of the Jakara Movement and five commercial drivers who have been deprived of their rights and livelihoods,\" a joint statement from the Asian Law Caucus and Sikh Coalition said. \"According to reports from the San Francisco Chronicle and KQED, California state officials communicated they would begin reissuing licenses on December 17. Despite these public assurances, the state has neither reissued any of the contested licenses nor created a process to remedy the date issue with no indication that it plans to do so before January 5.\"",
      "The lawsuit alleges that on Nov. 6, the California DMV notified 17,299 immigrant drivers and business owners that their non-domiciled CDLs would be canceled on Jan. 5, 2026, due to an error with the expiration date of the licenses. A similar letter was sent to an additional 2,700 drivers in December, informing them that their licenses would be canceled in mid-February.",

      "The DMV is required to set the expiration date for a CDL given to an immigrant on either the same day or before the expiration of the driver's work authorization or legal presence documents, according to the lawsuit. However, the lawsuit alleges that the DMV letters violated California procedure, which would require the department to either cancel the license without prejudice or change the expiration date.",
      "\"For all 19,999 immigrants, the DMV intends to cancel their commercial licenses without affording any opportunity to obtain a corrected license or to contest the cancellation,\" the lawsuit reads.",
      "The filing further states that \"despite its own regulation, the DMV did not consistently ensure that a CDL\u2019s expiration date matched the end of a person\u2019s period of work authorization or lawful presence.\"",

California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office pushed back on the DOT's assertion that his state \"admitted to illegally issuing\" the licenses. However, according to the lawsuit, notices were sent to more than the reported 17,000 drivers.",
      "The lawsuit notes that the cancellation of the CDLs has a far-reaching impact beyond the drivers themselves, saying that the drivers \"play an indispensable role in our local and national economies, providing essential services that communities rely on every day, including transporting food, driving children to school and delivering manufactured goods.\"",
      "\"The sudden loss of their ability to work threatens not only their livelihoods but also the stability of our supply chains and services on which the public depends. Neither the individuals nor our communities can sustain the harm that will occur if these drivers lose their licenses, careers, and economic stability,\" the lawsuit reads.",

In one instance, a plaintiff identified as John Doe 4 allegedly received the letter despite the fact that his CDL expires on the same day as his work authorization, the very document he supposedly used to renew the license. The lawsuit claims that there are recipients of cancellation letters whose CDLs are seemingly in compliance.",
      "In another instance, a member of Jakara Movement \u2014 which describes itself as a \"grassroots community-building organization working to empower, educate, and organize working-class Punjabi Sikhs, and other marginalized communities\" \u2014 attempted to address his concerns about the cancellation by going to a DMV office in person. The lawsuit claims that when the Jakara member arrived at the DMV office, he was \"pressured into surrendering his CDL, out of fear that his non-commercial driver\u2019s license would already be cancelled.\"",
      "Further, the lawsuit claims that the \"DMV has not explained how it identified 19,999 licenses as out of compliance with state law and how it can ensure that its determinations are accurate.\"",

      "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on shocking allegations about the flying objects on 'Special Report.'",
      "It was the year of the UFO in 2025. From new-age documentaries to decades-old mysterious reports coming to light, both experts and civilians have been baffled by a slew of new information regarding otherworldly objects appearing over the country\u2019s skies.",
      "Here is a look at the most compelling, out-of-this-world UFO headlines from 2025, as questions continue to swirl regarding the validity of such claims and whether we are truly alone in the universe.",
      "Earlier this year, scientists at California\u2019s Palomar Observatory discovered several instances of transient, star-like flashes in photographs taken over 70 years ago that may hold the key to answers regarding instances of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) \u2013 or UFOs \u2013\u00a0appearing near nuclear testing sites, according to a research paper published in Nature\u2019s Scientific Reports on Oct. 20, 2025.",
      "EXPLOSIVE NEW DOCUMENTARY PROBES '80-YEAR GLOBAL COVERUP' OF UFO SECRETS",
      "The U.S. government is compelled to investigate reports of UFOs to identify any issues regarding threats to national security. (iStock)",
      "The images originated from digitized astronomical plates \u2013 pieces of glass that capture images of the night sky \u2013 compiled by the observatory from 1949 to 1957, while also predating the launch of the first artificial satellite in October 1957.",
      "\"We speculate that some transients could potentially be UAP in Earth orbit that, if descending into the atmosphere, might provide the stimulus for some UAP sightings,\" the paper states.",
      "While many of the objects were determined by scientists to be errors or markings on the physical plates, thousands of other sightings reportedly correspond with various documented sightings of UFOs appearing near nuclear testing sites.",
      "In one instance, bright objects were spotted in the night sky within the same two weeks when witnesses reported numerous UAPs above Washington, D.C., from July 19 to July 27, 1952, according to the report.",
      "The final documented sighting within the timeframe was over a nuclear testing site on March 17, 1956, just one day after the \"Joe 21\" test conducted by the Soviet Union, according to the New York Post.",
      "Researchers also subsequently observed transients hovering on at least 124 above-ground nuclear tests at sites that were active from 1951 until the launch of Sputnik in 1957. However, further research reportedly led them to the conclusion that the phenomenon was the result of \"high energy particles\" present within the atmosphere, due to the nuclear testing materials.",
      "Similarly, the study pointed to findings that revealed transients were 45% more likely to be spotted in the air within 24 hours of nuclear testing, with \"significantly more\" UAP sightings being documented within the test windows.",
      "JD VANCE SAYS UFOS, ALIENS COULD BE \u2018SPIRITUAL FORCES\u2019 AS VP VOWS TO \u2018GET TO THE BOTTOM\u2019 OF MYSTERY IN SKIES",

      "The researchers ultimately concluded that eyewitness sightings of star-like transient objects directly correlating with conditions created by nuclear weapons testing are \"small but statistically-significant associations.\"",
      "\"Our findings provide additional empirical support for the validity of the UAP phenomenon and its potential connection to nuclear weapons activity, contributing data beyond eyewitness reports,\" the scientists wrote.",
      "Newly released police logs and video directly contradict explanations from officials regarding a near-collision between a U.K. police helicopter and UAPs over a United States air base last year, ultimately discrediting reports from officials claiming it was merely a routine fighter jet sighting.",
      "According to documents obtained by the Daily Mail, the incident unfolded around 10 p.m. on Nov. 22, 2024,\u00a0when a National Police Air Service (NPAS) EC135 helicopter was forced off-course as it took emergency evasive action after the pilot reported two fast-moving craft \"targeted\" and pursued the crew over RAF Lakenheath, a major U.S. military installation in Suffolk.",
      "The move required the pilots to maneuver a steep dive to ultimately avoid crashing into the objects, which were matching the aircraft\u2019s speed at roughly 190 mph in what was later described as an \"unprovoked pursuit.\"",
      "\"They had to perform an emergency dive and described that they were pursued in the dive by two drones who matched their speed \u2013 and then pursued them for several minutes out of the area,\" one police entry states.",
      "Separate police reports compiled between Nov. 20-22 documented roughly 20 drone sightings across RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall and RAF Feltwell, with eyewitness accounts describing \"10-15 drones [flying] potentially into base airspace,\" that ultimately grounded surrounding aircraft.",

      "However, despite the sightings by both government officials and civilians, Britain's Airprox Board concluded in its final report that the objects were actually the lights of a U.S. Air Force F-15 operating nearby, pointing to radar data indicating the two aircraft came within 1,700 feet of each other on the evening of the incursion.",
      "The popular UFO-reporting app Enigma gripped the nation after its crowdsourced data recorded thousands of mysterious objects jetting up and down the United States\u2019 coastlines.",

      "Of the documented sightings, roughly 500 reportedly occurred within five miles of the country\u2019s coastline, with 150 objects being seen either hovering above \u2013 or entering and emerging from \u2013 bodies of water.",
      "According to Enigma, several clusters of activity appeared to be centered around specific coastal points, with California and Florida accounting for the most sightings throughout the country.",

Christians made up 86% of Bethlehem\u2019s population in 1950, Zarina said. By the last Palestinian census in 2017, they accounted for roughly 10%.

    "story": [
      "With further changes to the U.S.\u2019 recommended vaccine schedule likely in the year ahead under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s leadership, his agency\u2019s recent scrutiny of one vaccine additive in particular \u2014 aluminum salts \u2014 may offer a clue about what\u2019s to come.",
      "Earlier this month, members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s vaccine advisory committee \u2014 whom Kennedy selected after firing the previous group \u2014 suggested digging into concerns about aluminum salts, though large studies have found them to be safe. Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, told NBC News that the committee is \u201creviewing the body of science related to aluminum and other possible contaminants in childhood vaccine[s].\u201d",
      "Similarly, a statement that appeared on the CDC website last month said that HHS is investigating whether aluminum in vaccines could be linked to autism.",
      "Aluminum salts are not a \u201ccontaminant\u201d in vaccines: The compound is added as an adjuvant, an ingredient that boosts the body\u2019s immune response to a vaccine, allowing for a smaller dose to be used. Nearly a century of evidence has found it to be safe for this purpose. Aluminum salts are naturally present in soil and water, and the amount children are exposed to from vaccines is minuscule compared with cumulative daily exposures from food. (Exposure from infant formula or breastmilk is higher than exposure from vaccines in the first six months of life, as well.)",
      "\u201cThis is not the thing that you wrap your food in at the barbecue. \u2026 The purpose of them is to just help the immune system respond a little more robustly to that vaccine,\u201d said Dr. Michelle Fiscus, chief medical officer at the Association of Immunization Managers, a nonprofit that supports public vaccination programs.",
      "\u201cAluminum adjuvants have made vaccines very, very effective and have helped us significantly reduce suffering and sickness and death,\u201d she added.",
      "Skeptical or negative statements about aluminum have cropped up repeatedly during federal health announcements and meetings in recent months. President Donald Trump in September said aluminum was being \u201ctaken out of the vaccines\u201d during a news conference in which he and Kennedy warned that Tylenol use in pregnancy may be linked to autism. (The bulk of scientific research has not identified such a link.)",
      "\u201cWho the hell wants that pumped into a body?\u201d Trump said of aluminum.",
      "Then, during the CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory panel meeting, Dr. Tracy Beth H\u00f8eg, acting director of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, argued for adopting the vaccine schedule that Denmark uses, which is sparser than in the U.S., in part because doing so would reduce aluminum exposure.",
      "\u201cI do not feel like we have the data to show that there is an established safe amount [of aluminum] that children can receive before the age of 2, before the age of 18,\u201d H\u00f8eg said.",
      "Some public health experts worry that the investigation into aluminum is part of a broader push to restrict access to or approval of some childhood shots.",
      "Last week, HHS postponed a planned announcement about children\u2019s health to the new year. The details are not yet known \u2014 CNN reported that the Trump administration was considering decreasing the number of recommended childhood vaccines to align more closely with Denmark\u2019s, citing an unnamed source \u201cfamiliar with the plans.\u201d Several other outlets subsequently reported the same, though NBC News has not confirmed that plan.",
      "Already, the CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory committee voted to stop recommending the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns, and as a result, the CDC now advises women who test negative for the virus to decide about the shot with their medical providers.",
      "Changing vaccine recommendations based on concerns about aluminum salts would be a flimsy justification, several public health experts said. Even in Denmark, many recommended vaccines contain aluminum salts, including those for human papillomavirus (HPV), pneumococcal disease, tetanus and whooping cough.",
      "Of the pediatric vaccines on the CDC\u2019s schedule that are missing from Denmark\u2019s universal recommendations, just three \u2014 for hepatitis A, hepatitis B and meningococcal vaccines \u2014 contain aluminum salts. The others \u2014 for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rotavirus, flu and chickenpox \u2014 do not.",
      "The shot that anti-vaccine activists most frequently and erroneously associate with autism \u2014 the combination measles, mumps and rubella vaccine \u2014 also does not contain aluminum salts.",
      "A study of more than 1.2 million children in Denmark, published in July in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, found no link between aluminum salts from vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism.",
      "But Kennedy \u2014 who has made unsubstantiated claims that aluminum in vaccines is linked to rising rates of allergies and autism in children \u2014 demanded the paper be retracted.",
      "\u201cA closer look reveals a study so deeply flawed it functions not as science but as a deceitful propaganda stunt by the pharmaceutical industry,\u201d he wrote in an editorial on the website TrialSite News.",
      "Kennedy argued that the paper excluded some children who may have been at risk and did not include a control group. However, Annals of Internal Medicine stood by the study and said there was no reason to retract it.",
      "Kennedy, a longtime critic of vaccines, had been involved in lawsuits against the pharmaceutical company Merck over allegations related to its HPV vaccine (which contains aluminum salts), but since taking office, he has said any fees earned would go to one of his sons. His focus on aluminum dates back to his time as chairman and chief litigation counsel at the anti-vaccine group Children\u2019s Health Defense. The group has claimed for years that thimerosal \u2014 a mercury-based preservative \u2014 is linked to autism, and Kennedy said in a podcast appearance in 2020 that aluminum had replaced thimerosal in some vaccines, causing them to remain toxic.",
      "In reality, the ingredients serve different purposes and aluminum salts have been used in vaccines for nearly a century. Thimerosal, meanwhile, was largely phased out of childhood vaccines in 2001, and under Kennedy\u2019s leadership, HHS in July pulled the ingredient from the roughly 5% of flu vaccines that still had it.",
      "A recent analysis from the World Health Organization found no link between autism and vaccines containing thimerosal or aluminum.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this constant movement of the goal post to try to implicate vaccines in the development of these diseases, and there\u2019s just not science to back those claims,\u201d Fiscus said.",
      "In 2021, Kennedy told food blogger Mikhaila Peterson that all aluminum-containing vaccines had \u201cnegative risk profiles\u201d and that the brains of children with autism were \u201cloaded with aluminum.\u201d He suggested, too, that kids develop food allergies because \u201cwe\u2019ve been inducing allergies by pumping them full of aluminum.\u201d",
      "A large German study in 2011, however, did not find an increased risk of allergies in vaccinated children and even identified a decrease in hay fever among the group. In 2023, a study found a positive association between vaccine-related aluminum exposure and persistent asthma, but the results couldn\u2019t be replicated and scientists said the research didn\u2019t properly control for confounding variables.",
      "In response to mounting hesitancy about aluminum salts in vaccines, Dr. Seth Ari Sim-Son Hoffman, a physician-scientist at Stanford Medicine, decided to reanalyze the existing data with some of his colleagues. The team\u2019s findings, published this month in the journal Pediatrics, found no major safety concerns with aluminum-containing vaccines. Side effects were mostly limited to redness and swelling at the injection site.",
      "\u201cWhen you see the same \u2018no\u2019 finding or \u2018no\u2019 association across multiple countries, multiple study designs and over a million children, that\u2019s really, really clear and reassuring,\u201d Hoffman said.",
      "The current childhood vaccine schedule in the U.S., he added, \u201cis backed by powerful evidence in terms of safety and effectiveness.\u201d"

      "\u201cI don\u2019t see any reason to believe that\u2019s not going to at least continue for a bit, until people figure out some sort of policy moves to address that,\u201d Frank said.",
      "Uncertainty for Obamacare and Medicaid",
      "Moves by the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers have brought uncertainty to health care costs.",
      "Enhanced ACA subsidies that helped keep premiums affordable are expiring after Republicans in Congress declined to extend them. Some people could pay up to 114% more, on average, in premiums when combined with rate increases by insurers next year, according to an analysis by KFF, a health care research group.",
      "Already, early enrollment data provided by state health officials show that more people appear to be walking away from ACA coverage or switching to cheaper plans for 2026 compared to this time last year.",
      "Changes to Medicaid funding approved under Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill,\u201d including the end of a financial incentive for states to expand Medicaid, are set to take effect in January. That means that in the 10 states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid, low income adults will remain in a \u201ccoverage gap,\u201d Levitt said, meaning they make too little to pay for ACA coverage but aren\u2019t eligible for Medicaid.",
      "More sweeping Medicaid changes, such as work requirements, are scheduled to go into effect in 2027.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to be one of the biggest changes we\u2019re going to see,\u201d said Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cMore and more people won\u2019t have any access to care, and that will theoretically lead to more uncompensated care for hospitals and doctors and more medical debt for people if they actually need to go and get care.\u201d",
      "Pharma deals",
      "Still, it\u2019s possible that people who aren\u2019t on Medicare could see drug costs go down, driven by efforts from the Trump administration.",
      "Trump has pushed to align the cost of prescription drugs in the U.S. with the lowest prices in other wealthy countries, signing an executive order in May directing federal officials to implement the \u201cmost favored nation\u201d pricing model. Since then, the administration has struck deals with 14 pharmaceutical companies, which have offered a combination of lower prices \u2014 through direct-to-consumer offers and charging the federal government less for certain drugs \u2014  in exchange for tariff relief.",
      "A new website, TrumpRx.gov, will connect people to drugmakers\u2019 direct-pay websites.",
      "In November, the president struck arguably his largest deal, this one with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly \u2014 the makers of the weight loss drugs Wegovy and Zepbound \u2014 to lower the cost of the GLP-1 medications for people who pay out of pocket without using insurance. The deal also reduced the price Medicare and Medicaid pays for the drugs, a move that saves the federal government, and subsequently taxpayers, money.",
      "Levitt said he still has some concerns about the strategy, noting that unlike the Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 which codified the pricing provision into law \u2014 Trump\u2019s approach relies on voluntary deals with drugmakers.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has been using the threat of tariffs as leverage with drug companies,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cIf that threat goes away in the future, there won\u2019t be anything holding drug companies back from raising prices again.\u201d",
      "The lower costs offered through TrumpRx may still not make certain drugs more affordable for all, Dusetzina said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re lower prices for people paying cash, but still not low prices,\u201d Dusetzina said. \u201cThat\u2019s really key. If you can\u2019t afford to keep your health insurance because you\u2019ve lost access to health insurance subsidies, then it seems unlikely that you would have the resources to pay out of pocket for drugs through TrumpRx.\u201d",
      "Levitt said there may still be hope for Americans on ACA plans if Congress reaches a deal to extend subsidies next year.",
      "Republicans held firm against Democrats\u2019 efforts to extend the subsidies by the end of the year \u2014 but not before a key group of House Republicans broke ranks with Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and teamed up with Democrats to force a vote sometime next year.",
      "\u201cThey could be retroactive to Jan. 1,\u201d Levitt said, \u201cand there could be a new enrollment period to allow people to sign up.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Katie Begley needed \u201csome good juju\u201d this summer.",
      "Begley, a New York-based content creator and fitness instructor, was waiting to hear back about several big work opportunities, including a potential Little Caesars commercial with Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley.",
      "So she turned to a figure praised online for offering low-stakes help for the price of a latte: an Etsy witch.",
      "\u201cIt can\u2019t hurt. I love witches. I love magic. I love all of that,\u201d Begley, 25, recalled thinking at the end of August when she went on the online marketplace known for personalized party swag and vintage clothing. \u201cWhat\u2019s the downside?\u201d",
      "She ultimately bought four spells from a TikTok-approved witch \u2014 a soulmate attraction spell, a powerful obsession spell, glamor magic and a wealth and prosperity casting \u2014 for $60.76. The next day, Begley got a call that she had booked the commercial starring Barkley.",
      "\u201cOf course, my head was like, \u2018Oh \u2014 it was my witch,\u2019\u201d she said, laughing.",
      "Begley shared the story in two TikTok videos, racking up millions of views as the latest success story in the cultural phenomenon around Etsy witches. In the last year alone, these spiritual workers have been hailed online for saving weddings, selling houses, securing jobs, influencing basketball games, drawing soulmates and even sparking outrage after Charlie Kirk\u2019s death.",
      "For Emily D. Crews, the executive director of the Martin Marty Center for the Public Understanding of Religion at the University of Chicago Divinity School, the rise of Etsy witches mirrors a broader shift in American religious life.",
      "Institutional religion is in steady decline, with the religiously unaffiliated now making up roughly 28% of the U.S. population. In its place, she said, many Americans \u2014 especially millennials and Gen Z \u2014 are pivoting toward belief systems that borrow from multiple traditions.",
      "\u201cThis is the context in which people are buying blessings and curses from witches on Etsy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes sense, in this kind of religious landscape, that someone might just as easily seek help from a witch than from a priest or a rabbi or a sacred text, even if they were raised Christian or Jewish or some other more conventionally recognizable religion.\u201d",
      "Amid rising economic uncertainty, burnout and increasing political division, the popularity of the Etsy witch seems like an easy escape that doesn\u2019t require a massive financial leap of faith \u2014 just a spiritual one. One that even this reporter dabbled in, in the name of journalism.",
      "Viral weddings and political controversy",
      "While witchcraft is an ancient practice and Etsy witches have existed online for years, interest in buying quick spells online surged in 2025 after several influencers praised their results.",
      "The blessings and rituals are often priced between $7 and $50, and sometimes even cheaper with a discount code or in a flash sale, and they are frequently listed as an \u201centertainment\u201d service. It\u2019s a workaround after Etsy banned the sale of metaphysical services, including spellcasting, in 2015.",
      "Etsy didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Jaz Smith, a New York City-based content creator, took the internet by storm in May when she posted a video about hiring an Etsy witch to cast a spell for good weather for her influencer-studded wedding. The event was met with blue skies, spurring her followers, like Begley, to rush to her witch\u2019s storefront to buy their own spells.",
      "Four months later, influencer Becca Bloom \u2014 who has amassed 4.9 million followers on TikTok as the queen of \u201cRichTok\u201d \u2014 posted a video saying \u201cEtsy witches worked\u201d as she announced her picture-perfect wedding.",
      "Emily Hanan, the U.K.-based witch and tarot reader known online as NaturalisticBlessingStore, whom Smith hired, told NBC News by email that although she has been offering her services for almost two decades, she didn\u2019t open her Etsy storefront until early 2020 during the pandemic.",
      "Business was slow at first, she said, but customer reviews on Instagram and TikTok helped her gain international traction for a variety of services, from obsession spells to energy cleanses. Following Smith\u2019s TikTok video, which she said took her shop \u201cto the stratosphere,\u201d her custom ritual for good weather has become her most requested offering.",
      "\u201c2025 has been by far my most in-demand year. I don\u2019t know if that makes 2025 the year of the Etsy Witch, but since going viral with Jaz in the summer, I\u2019ve seen multiple TikTok\u2019s and short-form content about Etsy witches, mainly about my store but about some others too,\u201d Hanan said.",
      "Since Smith\u2019s post, Hanan has closed down her Etsy shop and now takes requests on her Instagram page \u2014 though she said she is closed for the rest of the year to work through her massive backlog.",
      "\u201cI was made aware of a video from September of a crowd of people at a girl\u2019s wedding chanting \u2018Etsy Witch, Etsy Witch,\u2019\u201d Hanan said. \u201cIt was really quite a surreal experience seeing a huge group of people, chanting my name in an after-party following a wedding that I had done a successful spell casting for.\u201d",
      "The growing popularity of Etsy witches is what caught the attention of Rohit Thawani, 44, who works at an advertising agency in Los Angeles. Thawani said that after he learned about spellworkers from a co-worker before a meeting, he quickly paid an Etsy witch $8.48 for a New York Knicks win ahead of Game 5 in the Eastern Conference finals in May \u2014 and even got a discount \u201cwith the code BLESSINGS2025.\u201d",
      "The Knicks won the game, and Thawani\u2019s spell quickly earned the attention of basketball analyst Stephen A. Smith and Desus Nice. He bought a second spell for Game 6, but the Knicks lost.",
      "\u201cWe have no control over anything around us, and so in many ways, witchcraft feels like a lottery ticket,\u201d Thawani said. \u201cThere is a chance you might win, and if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re not missing out on anything.\u201d",
      "The trend, however, hasn\u2019t always been met with levity.",
      "Two days before Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist, was assassinated at a Utah college campus in September, Jezebel published a story about the author\u2019s hiring three Etsy witches to place a hex on Kirk \u2014 including one to \u201cmake everyone hate him.\u201d Jezebel quickly removed the satirical article and issued a statement condemning Kirk\u2019s death and any political violence. But the piece sparked a larger political and social debate.",
      "While such bought-and-sold rituals might be met with skepticism or controversy, \u201cselling religion is nothing new,\u201d said Crews, of the University of Chicago Divinity School.",
      "\u201cPeople have been paying religious specialists to cast spells or do rituals or hold funerals for pretty much as long as humans have existed,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you can find a boyfriend or an apartment or a nail salon online, why not a witch?\u201d",
      "Thawani agreed, saying his viral decision to buy two spells was a moment of fun support for his favorite team, no different from wearing a specific jersey during the game.",
      "\u201cEven the phrase \u2018Make a wish.\u2019 That\u2019s been in our lexicon forever. Is this any different?\u201d he added.",
      "Trying it for myself",
      "After weeks of reporting on Etsy witches and scrolling through dozens of TikTok success stories, I did what any good journalist would do: fact-checked the theory myself.",
      "On a Wednesday afternoon this month, I bought two spells from two different Etsy witches at my desk at 30 Rock for a total of $37.61. NBC News is choosing not to name the witches for privacy reasons.",
      "The first was a weather spell for $13.90, in which I was asked to send in my name, my birthday and my request for snow on Christmas Day in the tri-state area. The second \u2014 an abundance, wealth and success ritual candle for $23.71 \u2014 requested the same information, as well as my astrological sign.",
      "Three days later, I received messages on Etsy from both witches that my rituals had been completed. Neither seller promised results, but both emphasized an open mindset. One asked for a review after the transaction was complete.",
      "Remain positive, open, and ready to receive your blessings. Trust that what is meant for you is already on its way",
      "-one etsy witch's message to this reporter",
      "The witch who performed the weather spell reported back with technical details \u2014 the candle caught quickly, the flame held steady without sputtering, and the smoke lifted clean. According to her, that is the pattern she looks for when the energy is opening \u201cnicely for clear, cooperative skies.\u201d",
      "I was also given instructions to crack a window for a few minutes, step outside and take three slow breaths while picturing the weather I wanted. At the end, I was to thank the sky.",
      "Swallowing the immediate embarrassment, I completed the ritual in my pajamas on my busy Brooklyn street and hoped for the best. The next day, New York City was blessed with its first snowfall.",
      "On Tuesday, snow picked up again in New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. On Christmas Eve, it had snowed again. But on Christmas itself, snow was only in the forecast for Friday and into the weekend.",
      "The results of the abundance ritual, however, remain to be seen. The lengthy response from that witch was accompanied by two affirmations to recite and photos of the spell: a piece of paper with my name and birthday on it being burned in a candle. I was told to take in each image and feel the magic pulsing through them and that my spells were very positive and beautiful.",
      "\u201cRemain positive, open and ready to receive your blessings. Trust that what is meant for you is already on its way,\u201d she later told me. \u201cYou can also light a white candle as you speak the words, inviting clarity and divine guidance into your space.\u201d",
      "I\u2019ll admit I quickly bought into the experience, which felt less like purchasing magic and more like setting an intention for myself. It was a ritualized pause, a moment to dream a little bigger and have some semblance of control during a time that feels increasingly uncontrollable.",
      "Whether or not the spells \u201cwork\u201d isn\u2019t the point, because, unlike gambling or risky investing, spells don\u2019t pretend to be rational. Their power lies in their transparency, that you\u2019re buying into a belief.",
      "It\u2019s a power that Begley continues to subscribe to. Months after her initial purchase, Begley said, her career momentum has continued, even if she hasn\u2019t yet found her soulmate and the spell of obsession didn\u2019t deliver as hoped.",
      "But she didn\u2019t sound disappointed. To her, the experience is now just as normal as any other viral TikTok-approval wellness practice, like journaling or \u201cLucky Girl Syndrome.\u201d",
      "\u201cI actually got coffee with a friend this morning, who told me she was on the wait list for a SoulCycle class, so she paid $7 for an Etsy witch to get her in the class,\u201d Begley said this month. \u201cAnd she got in.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The bag Emily Karst keeps in her car is filled with everything but her phone.",
      "Instead, she usually packs her journal, some watercolor supplies, a needlepoint kit, a reading light and a murder mystery-themed puzzle book.",
      "Karst, 32, calls it her \u201canalog bag,\u201d and she\u2019s not the only one rocking one this year. Many people say carrying the accessory \u2014 typically packed with hobby supplies rather than electronic devices \u2014 has become their way to minimize their screen time.",
      "\u201cEven when I\u2019m home and my analog bag is over on the hook, when I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, what do I want to do?\u2019 that neural pathway that used to say, \u2018Well, grab your phone,\u2019 is starting to fire with the urge to maybe do needlepoint,\u201d said Karst, who is an assistant principal at an elementary school in Ohio.",
      "The popularity of the bag reflects a broader shift in 2025: People have generally become more intuitive about how much of their time they want to spend online. By turning to nondigital activities for entertainment, they\u2019re trying to unplug, reclaim their attention spans and find renewed fulfillment in real-life experiences.",
      "I think we\u2019re all craving to just get back into community and real life.",
      "\u2014 Maddie DeVico, 31, a small-business owner in Colorado",
      "Ironically, those who choose to step away from the internet have also turned to social media to document their digital detox journeys. In addition to showing off their \u201canalog bags,\u201d some social media users have started online movements around the concept of returning to nondigital activities, from junk journaling \u2014 a type of scrapbooking that often involves pasting in found or recycled ephemera \u2014 to \u201crawdogging boredom,\u201d a trend in which people challenge themselves to simply sit around and do nothing.",
      "There has also been an appetite from consumers for mobile apps and tech products aimed at combating doomscrolling, or the tendency to scroll excessively online, which often entails heavy consumption of depressing content.",
      "YouTuber Hank Green\u2019s Focus Friend app, which topped the Apple App Store charts earlier this year, gives users a little bean on their phones that knits more items the longer the user keeps away from certain blocked apps. Also generating buzz this year was a small app-blocking device called the Brick, which locks users out of distracting apps and websites until they touch their phones to the Brick to deactivate the locks.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re all craving to just get back into community and real life, like real, tangible relationships. Everyone\u2019s so online now that it\u2019s hurting my soul,\u201d said Maddie DeVico, a small-business owner in Colorado. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge movement here. I think the culture is starting to shift and people are realizing how detrimental being constantly connected can be for your mental health at the end of the day.\u201d",
      "To combat her own social media addiction, DeVico, 31, took some clay and molded a physical dock for her to \u201chang up\u201d her cellphone like a landline when she has no pressing need for it. It reminded her of her childhood, when phones were tied to a designated place, like the kitchen wall.",
      "When she shared the idea on TikTok this summer, a wave of viewers responded by creating and posting about their own copycat phone docks. Now, DeVico said, she hangs up her phone in its clay dock every night. She tries to implement phone-free mornings and phone-free dinners, as well as a few phone-free zones in her home.",
      "Aside from finding more time for hobbies such as writing, painting and cooking, DeVico said, the habit has also enabled her to get excited about the little things again \u2014 like spotting a roly-poly in her garden.",
      "Others have touted similar attempts to physically separate themselves from their phones. One writer, Tiffany Ng, chronicled her experience chaining her phone to the wall for a week. Tech founder Cat Goetze, who goes by CatGPT online, built a Bluetooth-compatible landline phone and surpassed $120,000 in sales within the first three days of its July launch.",
      "What many people misunderstand about the no-phone movement, Goetze said, is that it doesn\u2019t require an all-or-nothing approach: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who say: \u2018Just get a flip phone. Take this supercomputer, chuck it into the ocean and go back to the \u201990s and just get a dumb phone again.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat I realized is that the thing that actually works is balance, and balance doesn\u2019t mean getting rid of your smartphone,\u201d Goetze said. \u201cIt\u2019s about putting external factors in place that make your smartphone less easily accessible at all times.\u201d",
      "But people aren\u2019t just detoxing from their phones to boost productivity. For many, learning how to have analog fun is just as much the goal.",
      "As DeVico put it, \u201cgrandma hobbies are so back.\u201d Tutorials on crocheting, knitting, scrapbooking and other forms of crafting have found sustained success on platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Meanwhile, social clubs organized around everything from books to running to mahjong have exploded in popularity in recent years.",
      "Shun Hawkins, 31, loves junk journaling. In her analog bag, she packs stickers, washi tape and fashion magazine clippings to collage. She brings the bag out when she wants to immerse herself in a day of crafting, keeping a doodle book and a Nickelodeon-themed coloring book complete with a box of colored pencils and felt-tip pens inside.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s reawakened something in me that I feel like I lost a long time ago. I didn\u2019t even go to school for something that I\u2019m passionate about. And now, being 31, being at home and being able to do things like junk journaling and doodling again, that\u2019s reigniting this passion for me \u2014 even wanting to go back to school just to take on fashion,\u201d said Hawkins, who lives in Tennessee. \u201cSomething like that, I feel like it wouldn\u2019t be possible if I wasn\u2019t detaching myself from social media.\u201d",
      "Another silver lining for Hawkins: More crafting has meant less doomscrolling. One recent morning, she found herself reorganizing the trinkets in her room upon waking up instead of immediately reaching for her phone.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "The urge to go analog has also become a selling point at social events and in nightlife.",
      "Hush Harbor, a cocktail bar in Washington, D.C., began offering its patrons a rare experience by prohibiting cellphones within the establishment to encourage people to be more present and better connect with their communities.",
      "Christa Eduafo, a New York-based DJ who goes by DJ Chvmeleon, has also had success with her monthly phone-free parties, which she launched in June.",
      "The goal, she said, is to revive a culture in which people feel comfortable enough to dance and let loose without fearing that they might be photographed or recorded by a stranger.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s more of an interest in capturing a moment to post later than experiencing a moment in real time, and that\u2019s impacting the real-time experience,\u201d Eduafo said. \u201cSo it\u2019s almost like everyone\u2019s going to an event or to a bar because maybe they saw it on TikTok and they saw that there might be a moment they could capture and post themselves. But if there\u2019s a room full of people waiting for something to capture, then there\u2019s nothing to capture.\u201d",
      "Goetze, who also hosted a \u201cno-phone party\u201d in Los Angeles this fall that drew more than 700 people, said the concept forced people to interact with one another without being able to pull out their phones as a social crutch. She noted that it made the experience \u201cone of the most present events that I have attended in a really long time.\u201d",
      "She plans a small tour of no-phone parties elsewhere next year. It has become clearer than ever, she said, that people are desperate to form real-life connections again.",
      "\"They're craving the ability to be present with others. It shows up in every aspect of our lives. And we\u2019re going to get there through a variety of different factors,\u201d Goetze said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get there through physical events; we\u2019re going to get there through reconnecting with our hobbies and spending time in groups. And I do feel very strongly that the solution is not just about getting rid of something. You have to add something new.\u201d"

      "Episode 7, titled \u201cThe Bridge,\u201d includes an emotional monologue when Noah Schnapp\u2019s character, Will, comes out to his family and friends. Just as the crew plans their fight against Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower), Will decides to tell those closest to him that he doesn\u2019t like girls.",
      "Sitting down and looking at his best friend Mike (played by Finn Wolfhard), mom Joyce (Winona Ryder), brother Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) and more, Will is his most vulnerable self. After making it clear that he is gay, his friends and family proudly support him and tell him they will always be by his side.",
      "The moment, Schnapp tells TODAY.com, was \u201cnerve-wracking.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was a lot of pressure. The whole cast being there, I did not  expect the scene to happen that way. I thought it was just going to be me and Joyce, and that\u2019s already nerve-wracking,\u201d Schnapp says. \u201cSo to have everyone standing there watching was really nerve-wracking in a lot of different ways.\u201d",
      "In 2022, after Season 4 dropped, Schnapp told Variety that Will was in love with Mike.",
      "\u201cI mean, it\u2019s pretty clear this season that Will has feelings for Mike,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThey\u2019ve been intentionally pulling that out over the past few seasons. Even in Season 1, they hinted at that and slowly, slowly grew that storyline.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s 100% clear that he is gay and he does love Mike,\" he added.",
      "In Season 5, Will has been curious about sharing his feelings with his friends and family after he sees Robin (Maya Hawke) kissing her girlfriend, Vickie (Amybeth McNulty). In the latest episodes, Will seemingly goes to Robin for advice on how to navigate his true feelings.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been so much build up to this moment,\u201d Schnapp tells TODAY.com about Will\u2019s coming out. \u201cIt\u2019s been built up in my head for years, like, how are they going to write it? Who are they going to write it to? Obviously in the back of your head you know the impact it\u2019s going to have on a lot of people in the real world struggling with similar issues of their own self identity.\u201d",

      "\u201cI did definitely give some input that kind of allowed new scenes to form from that. But for the most part, it was perfect,\u201d he shares, before touching on whom he considers Will\u2019s biggest supporter.",
      "\u201cProbably Jonathan,\u201d he says, referring to his character's older brother. \u201cHe\u2019s been there since the beginning and always stood by his side. You always see him understanding him and resonating with him. He never goes against him. He always wants the best for his brother.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love their relationship,\u201d Schnapp adds, \u201cand I love seeing (Jonathan) react to that... When I saw him reacting, it got me (emotional) for sure.\u201d",
      "As for what\u2019s next for Will in the finale, Episode 8 \u201cThe Rightside Up,\u201d Schnapp says, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing holding him back anymore.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou can tell, clearly, he\u2019s been able to now harness the most strength he has because he\u2019s come to terms with his own acceptance and accepted himself outwardly,\u201d Schnapp says. \u201cI\u2019m just excited to see the part he plays in that... His own power is the power that we all have, the power of accepting yourself and believing in yourself.\u201d",
      "With Will now a major player in the battle against Vecna, the Duffer brothers tell TODAY.com that his superpowers were something they talked about exploring since earlier seasons.",
      "\u201cWe knew he had this connection since Season 1 to the Upside Down, and ultimately Vecna,\u201d Matt Duffer says, adding that the connection \u201cwas something worth exploring.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve touched on it a little bit in Season 3 and Season 4, but as we got to this final season, we started to talk about it a lot and we ended up talking about Will because everything began with Will, right?\u201d",
      "From his vanishing in Season 1 that kickstarted the series, they say, \u201cIt felt very organic and, in a way, inevitable to return to Will and to orient the season around him.\u201d",
      "So after the final episode, when the credits roll, how does Schnapp hope fans feel?",
      "\u201cI just want them to be satisfied like, \u2018OK, these stories are finished,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cAnd of course they\u2019re going to miss the characters and miss being with them, but I want them to be satisfied that those journeys have come to an end.\u201d",

      "But why has Episode 5 in particular led to such an outpouring of love? Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "What Is \u2018Heated Rivalry\u2019?",

      "Episode 5 continues the dramatic highs and lows of Shane and Ilya. Notable moments include Shane ending his relationship with Rose Landry, Shane getting hurt and taken off the ice on a stretcher with a distraught Ilya looking on, and Ilya confessing he loves Shane (that is, in Russian, a monologue that \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d fans who are native Russian speakers are especially loving.)",
      "But in its final few moments, after four episodes of angst, there's a reprieve, one that fans experienced with joy \u2014\u00a0and documented for social media.",

      "While he\u2019s older than Shane and Ilya, who are both in their mid-20s, he's struggling with the same issue. His meet-cute with an aspiring art historian named Kip (Robbie G.K.) led to a real love, but he feels unable to come out. With Kip tired of living under the shadow of a secret romance, they're at a standstill.",

      "Meanwhile, Shane and Ilya seemingly have their own revelations of what this might mean for their relationship.",
      "At the end of the episode, Ilya calls Shane and takes him up on his offer to spend two weeks alone at his home. For the first time in years, they'll have quality together.",

      "Why Is Episode 5 Such a Big Deal?",

      "Ronald Charles Chavis filmed his husband, Refeal Shtivi, weeping after watching the episode in a video shared to TikTok. Speaking to TODAY.com, the couple say the episode\u2019s \u201cgrand gesture\u201d reminded them of their own story. Shtivi was encouraged to come out to the wider world after meeting Chavis in 2023.",
      "\u201cThis coming out part in front of so many people, I did myself. I felt like the big release they were having. I felt super connected with that,\u201d Shtivi says.",
      "\u201cGay, straight \u2014 people want to know that they\u2019re loved,\u201d Chavis adds. \u201cThat was the beauty in that episode.\"",

      "Dominic points to the widespread pop culture phenomenon of  LGTBQ love stories ending in tragedy. Instead, at the end of \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d Episode 5, a gay love story is \u201cloudly celebrated\" as the crowd in the stadium cheers, too.",
      "\u201cWhat was so great about it is that we finally got a huge happily ever after,\u201d Dominic says. \u201cWhen I watched it by myself, I was sobbing, because it\u2019s like we are constantly fighting for our happily ever after.\u201d",

      "This journey and group 7 have not only changed her goals, but the scale of her audience and the reach of her music. James gained over 100,000 TikTok followers after going viral, according to The New York Times.",
      "The viral moment also helped James catch the attention of SiriusXM\u2019s Mikey Piff, who discovered her song \u201cSo Unfair\u201d through the group 7 video. James explains that Piff emailed her asking to play her on the station.",
      "\u201cI was like, that\u2019s crazy \u2014 I never, ever thought I would ever have a song on the radio,\u201d James says. \u201cI consider that the pinnacle of a music career.\u201d",
      "James says \u201cSo Unfair\u201d then transferred over to the Hits 1 station because of the positive response to the song.",
      "\u201cAnd so that\u2019s been really unbelievable and very massive,\u201d James says.",
      "Still, life after group 7 can come with pressure. James says she has felt some expectations to recreate the viral success, but she knows it was a \u201clightning in a bottle\u201d moment.",
      "\u201cI will never top the group 7 video, at least on social media,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is my magnum opus on social media.\u201d",
      "New year, new music",
      "James says if people want more excitement, they should turn to her music. Instead of chasing another viral hit, James is focused on building her future. She says her upcoming album, to be released in 2026, represents a creative shift.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely the most explorative I\u2019ve ever been in music,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s very absurd and playful in a lot of ways, and it\u2019s been really fun to explore that side of artistry.\u201d",
      "James says earlier songs were more \u201cdeeply existential and grim,\u201d where the new album is a lot more \u201cexplosive.\u201d She feels all the feelings, ranging from anger to humor.",
      "\u201cTo be an artist you don\u2019t have to be tortured,\u201d James says. \u201cYou can also be a trickster, you can be playful and excited and angry.\u201d",
      "These feelings in her music are inspired by lived experience, relationships and music she\u2019s listened to across eras. In her mind, these are songs that could be enjoyed and on the radio 15 years ago or 15 years from now.",
      "Much of her upcoming album was shaped by the two years she spent writing it, a period filled with \u201ca lot of living.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like I have the freedom to dream bigger than I have felt like I was allowed to in a long while,\u201d James says.",
      "Going forward, James hopes to spend as much time on the road as possible. \u201cI want to tour forever,\u201d she says. \u201cSo come hang.\u201d",
      "In other words \u2014 we're all in group 7 now."

So, we\u2019re in a really good place right now,\u201d Isa Bolton, 50, told the AARP in an interview that was published on Dec. 19.",

      "The cancer is aggressive and difficult to treat because it grows tentacles into the brain rather than forming a solid mass. There is no cure. Uche Ojeh, the husband of TODAY co-host Sheinelle Jones, died of glioblastoma in May 2025. He was 45.",

Caregiving can leave a person burnt out, sad and lonely, Taryn Bolton said, advising the millions of others in the same situation to take time to take care of themselves, too.",
      "Is Michael Bolton Still Performing?",
      "The singer is no longer performing, but the family has grown closer since Bolton \u2014 who is known for hits such as \u201cSoul Provider\u201d and spent decades traveling the world on concert tours \u2014 was forced to slow down due to his health issues.",

    "story": [
      "She\u2019d waited years for the news.",
      "But when the message arrived Aug. 26, 2022, Josephine Wentzel suddenly had to confront an agonizing possibility. She\u2019d spent six years tracking the man authorities believed was responsible for killing her daughter, a search that spanned thousands of miles, international borders and dozens of possible sightings that, in the end, had produced little.",
      "Wentzel declined to identify the message\u2019s sender, but she said it supposedly contained a recent picture of Raymond McLeod, who at the time was one of the U.S. Marshals Service\u2019s most wanted fugitives. Had he actually been found \u2014 or would this be another jolt of false hope?",
      "She focused in on the image, she said, and \u201cjust freaked out like, oh, my gosh, it\u2019s him. I didn\u2019t even want to think it because someone might hear my thoughts and warn him to flee.\u201d",
      "McLeod, a 42-year-old former U.S. Marine, was apprehended in El Salvador days later and is awaiting trial in San Diego on a charge of first-degree murder in the June 2016 strangulation of Krystal Mitchell. He pleaded not guilty and is scheduled for a preliminary hearing in March. His attorneys either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment. In court filings, they said McLeod accidentally killed Mitchell during \u201crough, consensual sex gone wrong.\u201d",
      "Wentzel, a 67-year-old grandmother and former police detective had been preparing for life as an RV'ing snowbird when her daughter was killed. She has used the improbable platform she developed pursuing McLeod to write two books \u2014 \u201cThe Chase\u201d and \u201cThe Capture\u201d \u2014 and to help other grieving parents navigate the mix of frustration, despair and confusion left by an unsolved homicide.",
      "Wentzel has assisted a nonprofit that helps law enforcement agencies with a series of cases in recent years, including the disappearance and alleged murder of Maya Millete, according to the Cold Case Foundation\u2019s co-executive director. Through a nonprofit Wentzel established, Angels of Justice, she launched a campaign urging the White House to treat the country\u2019s massive backlog of unsolved murders as a national emergency.",
      "In a statement, a White House spokeswoman blamed former President Joe Biden for failing to enable law enforcement agencies to \u201ctruly fight crime\u201d and said that President Donald Trump is \u201crestoring integrity to our justice system.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Marshals Service, which apprehended McLeod, declined to comment on questions about Wentzel\u2019s role in finding him, but in a statement after McLeod\u2019s capture the agency\u2019s director said Wentzel had worked \u201cdiligently with law enforcement these past years to see this day of justice arrive.\u201d",
      "The San Diego County District Attorney\u2019s Office has said she was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in the search for McLeod.",
      "\u201cShe goes for it,\u201d said Pat Kuiper, who credits Wentzel with helping push investigators in Washington state to take another look at the nearly two-decade-old unsolved murder of her son. \u201cShe goes for it in such a way that people can\u2019t really refuse her, because she\u2019s so genuine and kind, but persistent, assertive.\u201d",
      "For Rachel Glass, whose daughter was found strangled along with her pregnant roommate in Arizona 15 years ago, Wentzel provided an empathetic ear and insight into an investigative process that Glass \u2014 a longtime nurse \u2014 knew nothing about.",
      "\u201cIf there are things that go on and you think, what the hell is this, I\u2019d call her and say, you won\u2019t believe what\u2019s happened now,\u201d Glass recalled. \u201cAnd she might tell me x, y and z about why it has to play out like that.\u201d",
      "Wentzel\u2019s husband of nearly three decades, a retired post office maintenance engineer, attributes her latest chapter to the tenacity she\u2019s always shown.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s something I lack,\u201d he said. \u201cI can get easily discouraged and say, forget it. But my wife, she\u2019s not gonna forget it.\u201d",
      "A deadly date in San Diego",
      "For Wentzel, that chapter began soon after the death of her daughter. According to a statement of facts filed by the San Diego County District Attorney\u2019s Office, McLeod had gotten into a fight at a San Diego bar June 9, 2016, after he grabbed Mitchell by the throat and a man intervened, telling him to stop.",
      "Mitchell was found dead the next day at the apartment where they were staying. According to the statement, a deputy medical examiner determined she had been strangled and later compared the severity of the injury to someone who\u2019d been struck with a baseball bat or had their neck stomped on.",
      "Mitchell, 30, had been visiting the city with McLeod from Phoenix, where the divorced mother of two worked as a property manager, Wentzel said. To her mother, Mitchell was the life of the party \u2014 and someone who turned heads whenever she walked into a room.",
      "Mitchell met McLeod through work a few weeks before \u2014 he\u2019d gone to her office to rent an apartment, her mother said \u2014 and they\u2019d traveled to San Diego. Mitchell was impressed by how much McLeod seemed to care for his young son, Wentzel said, and she didn\u2019t appear to know about his previous allegations of domestic violence.",
      "One of those alleged incidents occurred not long before their trip, court records in California show. In Riverside County, he was charged that April with inflicting corporal injury on a spouse \u2014 an alleged crime that involved accusations that he strangled his wife, according to the statement of facts.",
      "McLeod pleaded not guilty, the Riverside County records show, and in a filing his lawyers in Mitchell\u2019s case have said that he has a \u201chistory of consensual sexual practices that included elements of the BDSM community such as bondage, whipping, slapping, choking and erotic asphyxiation, sometimes to unconsciousness.\u201d",
      "That earlier case was not adjudicated, however, and McLeod disappeared after Mitchell\u2019s death. According to prosecutors, on June 10, he allegedly drove Mitchell\u2019s car to San Diego International Airport, where he rented another car and headed to Mexico.",
      "An international search",
      "The San Diego Police Department identified McLeod as a person of interest in Mitchell\u2019s death almost immediately. A warrant seeking his arrest in her murder was filed June 13.",
      "But McLeod was nowhere to be found. Eventually, Wentzel recalled, the Marshals Service got involved and offered a reward. But she became frustrated with the government\u2019s inability to quickly investigate leads in foreign countries, she said. U.S. embassies seemed less than enthusiastic about helping, she said, and she recalled a deputy marshal telling her that they couldn\u2019t just \u201crun in and get the guy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s another country,\u201d she recalled him saying. \u201cWe got to get approval.\u201d",
      "The Marshals Service declined to comment. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "So Wentzel began searching herself. Although she\u2019d worked for several years as a police officer and detective in her native Guam decades ago, she said that experience didn\u2019t begin to prepare her for the years of social media sleuthing that she was about to embark on.",
      "One of her first steps was to pull together a \u201cwanted\u201d poster with pictures of McLeod, along with a brief description of the slaying and the reward amount \u2014 at the time $5,000, she said. She focused on Belize, a place she\u2019d heard he might be, and circulated information among dozens of Facebook accounts \u2014 gyms and resorts, restaurants and a university, screenshots of the messages show.",
      "After posting the information to a buy/sell group, Wentzel recalled, the responses started rolling in. Some were by phone. Others came via WhatsApp or Facebook.",
      "\u201cMadam I saw this man I am sure of it from his tattoos and his face,\u201d one message read, according to a screenshot.",
      "\u201cIf he is here he will b caught,\u201d read another.",
      "But then, he wasn\u2019t. And the messages continued. There were tips that he was in Honduras, that he was in Guatemala. Some tipsters seemed to legitimately want to help, she said. Others seemed like scammers.",
      "\u201cOne guy contacted me and said, OK, he\u2019s here,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI know where he\u2019s working at. I\u2019ve got pictures. I\u2019ve got all this. So, you know, I need you to send me $1,000.\u201d",
      "There were so many tips, said Mike Wentzel, that fielding them became a 24/7 job for his wife. At times, he considered asking her to dial things back, but never could.",
      "\u201cThis is her child,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can I tell her to stop?\u201d",
      "But there were times when the thought crossed her mind. Keeping hope alive during the pandemic, when that steady flow of tips dried up, was especially difficult, she said.",
      "The final tip",
      "As this slump in information dragged on, Wentzel said, local and federal officials announced that McLeod had been added to the Marshals\u2019 list of its 15 most wanted fugitives. In the spring 2021 announcement, they also announced that the reward for information leading to McLeod\u2019s arrest had grown to $50,000.",
      "His last known location was in Guatemala in 2017, the officials said.",
      "Wentzel said she believes it was a tip linked to that Central American country that ultimately led to McLeod\u2019s capture. Five years after he was spotted in Guatemala, she said, a couple of tipsters told her they\u2019d seen McLeod at a hotel just north of the country\u2019s border with El Salvador.",
      "Wentzel surveyed YouTube videos from the hotel to see if she could spot his face, she recalled, and she posted a \u201cwanted\u201d ad on Facebook that targeted accounts in the area. Wentzel said she set a 100-mile radius for the ad, meaning that everyone in that zone would see McLeod\u2019s face.",
      "Eventually, Wentzel said, she learned from the Marshals Service that someone saw one of her ads and shared a brochure with authorities that appeared to show McLeod. The brochure was from a Salvadoran English school not far from the Guatemalan hotel, she said.",
      "It was this image that prompted Wentzel to conclude: \u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d",
      "Four days later, on Aug. 30, 2022, authorities announced that McLeod had been taken into custody in Sonsonate, El Salvador, where he\u2019d been teaching English. He landed in San Diego the next day.",
      "Wentzel wrestled with a tangle of emotion as McLeod\u2019s arraignment approached. She thought about her daughter\u2019s final moments and ticked through a litany of revenge fantasies, she recalled. But she didn\u2019t want to stew in hatred and bitterness. So she tried to focus on her daughter\u2019s children, whom she and her husband have raised, and on the other victims she\u2019s sought to help.",
      "\u201cMurder does this to you \u2014 it makes you somebody you\u2019re not, if you allow it,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t picture living my life out like this. I wanted to be a grandma and I just wanted to travel and have fun and live the rest of my life out with my family. But it made me something else.\u201d"

      "It is a surreal spectacle: Palestinians, many displaced from their bombed-out homes, malnourished, sick and jobless in this collapsed economy, being sold the recently released iPhone 17 Pro. Even budget phones have been selling for as much as 5,000 shekels \u2014 around $1,500 \u2014 according to customers in Gaza, where prices have spiked to 10 times those in other countries.",
      "That such luxury items are in supply, but often food or medicine is still scarce, is exasperating aid workers and Palestinians. Experts interviewed for this story said Israel\u2019s border controls often make commercial goods easier to transport than humanitarian aid. Though the flow has increased during the shaky ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the United Nations and other groups say they are still facing serious restrictions on urgent items.",
      "\u201cWe cannot even afford food \u2014 how are we supposed to afford phones?\u201d asked Samir Kamal Awad Abou Dakaa, 52, who was a construction worker before the war and has a wife and five children to feed.",

      "This contrast is not new for Gaza, said Mona Jebril, a research fellow at England\u2019s University of Cambridge who lived in the territory for 22 years. \u201cBefore the war and during the siege, there were mobile phones and expensive cars. But because of the extra restrictions on the borders, the massive devastation and humanitarian catastrophe, then this paradox comes to light even more.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s been two years since Jehan Trazi last celebrated Christmas.",
      "But now that a ceasefire is in place in Gaza, children like Trazi finally got to decorate the Holy Family Church, Gaza\u2019s only Catholic church, which was still largely intact despite two years of brutal war.",
      "\u201cThis is the first holiday we\u2019ve celebrated in two years, and we are happy that the war has ended,\u201d Trazi, 11, told an NBC News camera crew.",
      "\u201cWe want to celebrate the glorious birth of Jesus.\u201d",
      "For two years, Christmas has gone without celebration for the tiny Christian community in the war-torn Gaza Strip, where more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel\u2019s war against Hamas, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The war began with Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and 251 people were taken hostage.",
      "Although the fighting and routine Israeli strikes have largely paused across the enclave since the ceasefire came into effect in October, the devastation has loomed over the Christmas celebrations this year, with much of Gaza's population living out of tents and food supplies still limited.",
      "George Anton, a coordinator for the Christian community in Gaza, said the celebrations were limited strictly to prayers inside the church building.",
      "\u201cThere will be no activities for children, no programs for the elderly, no family gatherings like we used to organize,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe are still emerging from the aftermath of war.\u201d",
      "But inside, the Christmas tree was decorated, carols were sung, and some people who had lost family members and entire homes broke down in tears. People appeared dressed up, some wearing United Nations jackets. An Arabic sign with the words \u201cThe Birth of a New Hope Adorns the Holiday\u201d was set up next to a lighted tree, where children took pictures.",
      "\u201cWe decorated the Christmas tree, set up the Nativity scene and decorated the church,\u201d Dawar Sabagh, 17, said.",
      "Sabagh said he felt this Christmas was different than the previous two, and it was at least a day that has felt somewhat normal compared to the almost nonstop war of the last two years.",
      "\u201cThis Christmas has a better atmosphere. There is peace, there is no war, and for now, we are done with the war. Thank God,\u201d he said.",
      "Even though a ceasefire is in force, many haven\u2019t been able to return to their homes because much of the enclave has been reduced to rubble. The Israeli military remains inside Gaza, though it has withdrawn to positions behind a \u201cyellow line\u201d separating areas under Israeli and Palestinian control.",
      "Trazi said he was first displaced nearly two years ago following Israeli bombardment and has lived in the church since.",
      "\u201cI hope next year will be better,\u201d he said.",
      "Edward Sabaa, 17, shared mixed feelings. \u201cI don\u2019t feel real joy,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we try, in every way, to make this day special.\u201d",
      "Before the war, Christians in Gaza would make a trip to Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank or visit Jerusalem, but Gaza\u2019s borders remain closed to civilians even as the ceasefire continues.",
      "\u201cOur situation remains unstable and uncertain, and we are still deeply affected by what we have lived through,\u201d Anton said."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 European allies reacted with outrage Wednesday after the Trump administration sanctioned online safety campaigners accused of censoring \u201cAmerican viewpoints.\u201d",
      "The five people Secretary of State Marco Rubio banned from entering the United States include a former top European Union official and four high-profile activists against hate speech and disinformation on social media.",
      "Rubio accused the five sanctioned figures of leading \u201corganized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose.\u201d",
      "These \u201cradical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states,\u201d he added, using the acronym to refer to nongovernmental organizations. \u201cThe Trump administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.\u201d",
      "It marks a dramatic escalation of Washington\u2019s war on what it sees as censorship from across the Atlantic. Europe has previously seen Vice President JD Vance berate its leaders over perceived failures on free speech.",
      "For many on the continent and elsewhere, however, the move comes as an amplification of the Trump administration\u2019s own crackdown on viewpoints that don\u2019t align with its own.",
      "The pushback from Washington also comes after European attempts to regulate American tech giants such as the Elon Musk-owned platform X, which was fined 120 million euros (around $140 million) by the European Union earlier this month for \"breaching transparency obligations.\"",
      "The European Commission, which is the E.U.'s executive arm, as well as the German Justice Ministry and French President Emmanuel Macron all condemned the move.",
      "Macron called it \"intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty.\"",
      "The European Commission warned that \"if needed, we will respond swiftly and decisively to defend our regulatory autonomy against unjustified measures,\u201d while European Council President Ant\u00f3nio Costa said that \"such measures are unacceptable between allies, partners, and friends.\"",
      "The most high-profile figure given a visa ban was Thierry Breton, the European Commission\u2019s former top technology regulator, described by the State Department as the \u201cmastermind\u201d of a landmark piece of legislation called the Digital Services Act.",
      "Musk said back in 2022 that he supported the law, but began to change with the fine against X \u2014 the first under the new legal powers \u2014 which he called \"bulls---.\" He has also referred to Breton as a \"tyrant of Europe,\" while Rubio and JD Vance both condemned the fine.",
      "\u201cIs McCarthy\u2019s witch hunt back?\u201d Breton wrote on X, referring to the 1950s anti-communist campaign led by Republican Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy. \u201cTo our American friends: \u2018Censorship isn\u2019t where you think it is.\u2019\u201d",
      "The State Department also imposed a visa ban on Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a research and advocacy nonprofit that says it holds to account social media companies that \u201cerode basic human rights and civil liberties by enabling the spread of online hate and disinformation.\u201d",
      "In a post on X, Sarah B. Rogers, the under secretary of state, called Ahmed a \u201ckey collaborator with the Biden administration\u2019s effort to weaponize the government against U.S. citizens\u201d and noted that CCDH had previously put out a report that named now-Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as part of the \"disinformation dozen.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Ahmed, a U.S. permanent resident, filed a lawsuit against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other Trump officials over the sanctions. On Thursday, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order that forbade law enforcement from arresting or detaining Ahmed before his case is heard.",
      "Next on the list was Clare Melford, head of the Global Disinformation Index, a nonprofit organization based in the United Kingdom that tries to tackle disinformation. Rogers accused the group of using American \u201ctaxpayer money to exhort censorship and blacklisting of American speech and press.\u201d",
      "The State Department also sanctioned Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon, both co-leaders of the German nonprofit HateAid, whose mission statement is to \u201cstrengthen democracy in digital space\u201d by providing legal support to victims of \u201cdigital violence.\u201d",
      "Hodenberg and Ballon told NBC News in a statement that this was \"an act of repression by a government that is increasingly disregarding the rule of law and trying to silence its critics by any means necessary.\"",
      "They added: \u201cWe will not be intimidated by a government that uses accusations of censorship to silence those who stand up for human rights and freedom of expression.\u201d",
      "The Global Disinformation Index condemned the measures as an \u201cauthoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship.\u201d",
      "It added: \u201cOnly the bullies and petty fascists of the Trump administration could miss the irony of decrying \u201cspeech suppression\u201d while using state power to silence critics engaging in protected speech.\u201d",
      "The French Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, alleged double standards between how the U.S. was treating its old European allies and its historical adversaries in Russia as it negotiates for peace in Ukraine.",
      "\"Hey @StateDept, did you know this guy you invited in Miami is an official from a country where American platforms are banned?\" the ministry wrote on X. Beside the text was a photo of Kirill Dmitriev, envoy to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has just come back from diplomatic talks in Florida.",
      "Putin's regime has banned Facebook and Instagram and severely throttled other platforms such as X, formerly Twitter.",
      "NBC News has reached out to the State Department for comment on the reactions, and contacted the Center for Countering Digital Hate for a response.",
      "The sanctions are a new high watermark for the Trump administration\u2019s war on what it calls European censorship. The White House has portrayed its actions as necessary to break the decadeslong liberal bias held by media and government elites, while for critics, it is an attempt to silence dissent and promote illiberal, often hate, speech online.",
      "Last month, many in Europe were aghast when Trump\u2019s national security strategy railed against the E.U. for undermining \u201cpolitical liberty and sovereignty,\u201d adopting \u201cmigration policies that are transforming the continent,\u201d and \u201ccreating strife, censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition, cratering birthrates, and loss of national identities and self-confidence.\u201d"

      "SYDNEY \u2014 The sense of anger is palpable among members of the Jewish community in and around Bondi Beach as it reels from the attack on a Hanukkah celebration that killed 15 people.",
      "Much of their fury is directed at the government, which has been accused of failing to heed warnings about antisemitic threats ahead of the Dec. 14 attack. But there has also been sadness and soul-searching about the place the community has in a neighborhood well known for its Jewish roots, and in Australia\u2019s wider society.",
      "Linda Royal said her parents fled Poland after the invasion by Nazi Germany in 1939, arriving first in Lithuania. They landed in Sydney two years later, aided by illegal transit visas issued by a Japanese diplomat.",
      "\u201cLike many migrants, they came to Bondi because it was working-class and inexpensive,\u201d she told NBC News last week close to the site of the shooting, on a hill where thousands of flowers had been laid in tribute to the victims.",
      "In the years since her parents\u2019 arrival, Royal said, the Jewish community has swelled in the neighborhood and its surrounding suburbs, first with Holocaust survivors and later with refugees known as refuseniks from countries in the former Soviet Union, some of whom had been denied permission to emigrate to Israel.",
      "\u201cThere was a huge sense of community,\u201d Royal said. \u201cThe Jewish community sticks together. We\u2019re constantly unfortunately on the run from persecution.\u201d",
      "Australia\u2019s worst mass shooting in decades has \u201ccompletely ripped us apart,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll never be the same again.\u201d",
      "Authorities have identified the two suspects as 24-year-old Naveed Akram and his 50-year-old father, Sajid Akram. The elder Akram was shot dead at the scene, while his son was charged last week with 59 offenses, including terrorism and 15 counts of murder, after waking up from a coma.",
      "Investigators have said the pair were inspired by the ideology of the Islamic State terrorist group. Two homemade ISIS flags were found in the younger suspect\u2019s car, police have said. ISIS has praised but not officially claimed the attack, referring to it in an official publication as \u201cSydney\u2019s pride.\u201d",
      "As well as sadness about the attack, \u201cthere\u2019s a great deal of anger, a great deal of rage,\u201d Alex Ryvchin, the co-chief executive officer of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said via phone on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that not only was the writing on the wall, but the community explicitly and repetitively told the government what was going to happen,\u201d said Ryvchin, who was born in Ukraine before he moved to Australia as a child.",
      "The shooting was \u201ca clear escalation from violent slogans and aggressive street protests and abuse of Jews on the streets, to harassment and vandalism of Jewish property and then finally the firebombings,\u201d he said, referring to several arson attacks on synagogues in recent years. This \u201cwas always going to end in murder, and that\u2019s exactly where we are,\u201d he added.",
      "Ryvchin, whose former home was daubed with antisemitic language and cars were set alight earlier this year, said both Australia\u2019s federal government and provincial leaders in the state of New South Wales had failed to act on proposals to curb antisemitic violence.",
      "These included more visible policing and a clampdown on pro-Palestinian protests that had become increasingly aggressive and turned people against the Jewish community, he added.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, whose poll numbers were found by The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper to have plunged by 15 points in the wake of the attack, said Tuesday that his government would address hate speech and gun control and work with states on new laws.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "New South Wales, where Bondi is situated, debated tougher gun laws on Tuesday. The state\u2019s leader is also trying to ban the display of terrorist symbols and curb protests. Other states have indicated they\u2019ll try to follow suit.",
      "But while they were welcomed by some, others were critical of the hasty way the government tried to bring them in. Antony Loewenstein, a journalist and author who serves on the advisory committee of the Jewish Council of Australia, a progressive group that advocates for \u201cPalestinian freedom,\u201d said: \u201cI think they\u2019re an absolute abomination.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are rushed, not thought through, and they\u2019re arguably unconstitutional,\u201d he said, adding that he thought they would be challenged in court.",
      "Three activist groups representing those in support of Palestine and Indigenous Australians have said they\u2019ll challenge the proposed laws in Australia\u2019s high court.",
      "Loewenstein also disputed Ryvchin\u2019s claim that pro-Palestinian marches in Australia, some of the largest of which have taken place in Sydney, had incited violence against the Jewish community.",
      "Australia is home to many \u201cprogressive Jews who are deeply against Israel\u2019s mass slaughtering in Gaza\u201d and oppose Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government, Lowenstein said.",
      "\u201cThe truth of the matter is that there is literally no connection that we are aware of between the murderers, these two men, father and son, and the pro-Palestine movement. Zero,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are worried and scared, of course, by the direct targeting of Jews but also deeply concerned that our fears are being weaponized in the service of deeply antidemocratic and draconian policies,\u201d he added.",
      "Others like Ryvchin are calling for a Royal Commission, or a major public inquiry into the attack. It is necessary so \u201cJewish people can walk down the street without fear and maybe next year we can get together again, as we have every year, and kindle the Hanukkah flames and hopefully not do it with police snipers on roofs,\u201d he said.",
      "Albanese has so far resisted calls to do this, saying he wants to avoid a drawn-out process and that Royal Commissions haven\u2019t been held after similar incidents.",
      "Whether it takes place or not, back in Bondi, Linda Royal said things would not be the same again.",
      "\u201cWe now associate this place with yet another place of a Jewish massacre, and that can never be taken away,\u201d she said."

      "Ellison is separately making a hostile bid to acquire the media giant Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns CNN. Warner Bros. Discovery has already accepted an offer from Netflix in a deal valued at $82.7 billion. Both transactions would require approval from federal regulators.",
      "Trump has close ties to Ellison's father, billionaire technology mogul Larry Ellison, though in recent weeks he has publicly expressed frustration with the direction of \"60 Minutes\" under Paramount's new corporate leadership.",
      "\"For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called 'takeover,' than they have ever treated me before,\" Trump said Dec. 16 on Truth Social. \"If they are friends, I\u2019d hate to see my enemies!\"",
