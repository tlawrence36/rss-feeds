      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered his 11th studio album, \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d",
      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d his eleventh studio album that leans into some well-tread country rock territory, the kind that invariably involves broken hearts, trucks and a cold beer.",
      "Look, Bentley knows what he\u2019s doing. The album is 11-tracks of catchy, country rock radio filler and there\u2019s not much mystery to its musical roadmap. But therein lies his calling card: Dependable songs with few rough edges.",
      "Thematically, many of the tracks on the superstar\u2019s latest effort hint at internal struggles, but allow Bentley and the listener to escape them unscathed. \u201cJesus Loves Me\u201d is an admirable acoustic slow burn about finding religion but losing a woman. \u201cThought maybe if I hit my knees / She\u2019d think about hitting the brakes,\u201d Bentley sings. There is slight salvation for the Phoenix-born singer: \u201cYeah, Jesus loves me / But she don't.\u201d",
      "On the title track, the jukebox stomp \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d Bentley gets a nice assist from fellow country hitmakers John Anderson and Riley Green. Ostensibly it\u2019s an energetic drinking song about family lines, but lyrics like \u201cWe shoulda gone to college / Coulda gained a little knowledge,\u201d which pull from a popular childhood rhyme, feel like they're underperforming.",
      "What Bentley does extremely well is execute what his \u2014 and the modern genre\u2019s \u2014 biggest fans might expect. Tales of a tough exterior with a warm, if fragile, heart underneath. But his familiar is derivative.",
      "Palatable country is how you get on the radio and stay on it. Songs about beer and trucks are Spotify deliverables. If you like your country artists with a longer rap sheet, you\u2019ll need to look further than \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d Even the few attempts at invention don't totally land, like the rowdy, rocking \u201cShe Hates Me,\u201d which includes a surprising interpolation of post-grunge band Puddle of Mudd\u2019s 2001 hit \u201cShe (Expletive) Hates Me.\u201d",
      "If there\u2019s a pleasant find here, it\u2019s Stephen Wilson Jr. duetting with Bentley on the opening track, \u201cCold Beer Can.\u201d It\u2019s the most memorable song on the album \u2014 with its plucky instrumentation and ascendant chorus, which showcase Wilson Jr.\u2019s rich voice and guitar talents.",
      "It also does what Bentley aims for, but misses, throughout the record: It addresses life's touching moments over brews.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Beach Boys' Mike Love was inducted into the 2025 Songwriters Hall of Fame on Thursday night, just one day after it was announced that his inimitable bandmate Brian Wilson had died.",
      "The actor \u2014 and lifelong Beach Boys fan \u2014 John Stamos introduced him. \u201cThere are songs that don't just play on the radio,\u201d Stamos said in his speech. \u201cMike Love is a songwriter's songwriter.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhat an incredible honor this is,\u201d Clinton said in his speech. He talked about his early days in the legendary Brill Building song factory, which he described like going \u201cinto Oz.\u201d Being a songwriter, to him, required \u201cconsistent effort.\u201d",

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up chasing fame,\u201d he said. \u201cI grew up chasing feeling ... Creativity has no limitations.\u201d",
      "His four children, R.J., Heavenly, Hannah Joy and Royal Jerkins, performed one of his best-known hits, Brandy and Monica's \u201cThe Boy Is Mine.\"",

      "When Gorley took the stage for his speech, he said he felt like he was in a \u201cfever dream\u201d or that he has \u201ccrashed a royal wedding.\u201d",
      "Legendary English songwriter Tony Macaulay was also honored. He is best known for such classics as The Foundations\u2019 \u201cBaby Now That I\u2019ve Found You\" and \u201cBuild Me Up Buttercup,\u201d the latter of which was performed for Macaulay by a spirited Debbie Gibson.",

      "Gracie Abrams received the eminent Hal David Starlight Award.",
      "Last year\u2019s inductees included Steely Dan, R.E.M., Timbaland, Hillary Lindsey and Dean Pitchford. At the induction ceremony last summer, R.E.M. stunned attendees by reuniting for an acoustic version of their alt-rock hit, \u201cLosing My Religion.\u201d",
      "The Songwriters Hall of Fame was established in 1969 to honor those creating popular music. A songwriter with a notable catalog of songs qualifies for induction 20 years after the first commercial release of a song. Some already in the hall include Gloria Estefan, Carole King, Paul Simon, Billy Joel, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora, Elton John and Bernie Taupin, Brian Wilson, James Taylor, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Lionel Richie, Bill Withers, Neil Diamond and Phil Collins.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Recording Academy has tweaked some of its rules for the 2026 Grammy Awards, including carving out a stand-alone category for best album cover \u2014 a day after Sabrina Carpenter sparked considerable discourse unveiling what is believed to be the cover for her next album.",
      "The academy on Thursday announced that the best recording package and the best boxed or special limited edition package categories will be combined into the best recording package category, with best album cover spun out on its own. The last Grammy for best recording package went to \u201cBrat,\u201d the Charli xcx album whose distinctive cover was immediately embraced by pop culture and meme creators.",
      "\u201cThe Academy\u2019s top priority is to represent the music people that we serve each year,\u201d Harvey Mason jr., CEO of the Recording Academy said in a statement. \u201cThat entails listening carefully to our members to make sure our rules and guidelines reflect today\u2019s music and allow us to accurately recognize as many deserving creators as possible.\u201d",

      "Willie Nelson is busy as ever at age 92",
      "Willie Nelson's 90th birthday celebration at the Hollywood Bowl could have been mistaken for a retirement party.",
      "But two years later at 92, he's working as much as ever. Not that retirement would look much different. The life he loves is making music with his friends, even after outliving so many dear ones.",
      "Nelson will be on the road again with Bob Dylan when the Outlaw Music Festival resumes for the second leg of its 10th year starting on June 20 in Clarkston, Michigan",
      "Asked if he\u2019d ever like his life to get the feature film treatment that Dylan did last year with \u201cA Complete Unknown, \u201d Nelson said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard some talk about it. But I'm not through with it yet.\u201d",
      "Nelson spoke to The Associated Press in a phone interview from Hawaii's Oahu.",
      "\u201cBob's a good friend,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cAnd I'll be glad to let him headline.\u201d",
      "The tour is one part of a loaded year. It'll lead right up to the 40th anniversary of Farm Aid in September. This spring, Nelson released his 77th studio album. And he's added a new THC tonic, Willie's Remedy, to his wide world of weed products.",
      "Nelson has always loved singing the songs of his friends as much as if not more than the ones he writes himself. In 1979, he released \u201cWillie Nelson Sings Kristofferson,\u201d a full album of the work of his friend Kris Kristofferson, who died last year.",
      "He has similar love for the songs of his friend Rodney Crowell. Nelson has long performed Crowell's \u201cTil I Gain Control Again,\u201d which he called \u201cone of the best country songs that I think I've ever heard.\u201d Now he's released a whole album of Crowell tunes, \u201cOh What a Beautiful World.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo far he hasn\u2019t written one that I don\u2019t like,\u201d Nelson said.",
      "The album comes on the 50th anniversary of \u201cRed Headed Stranger,\u201d the album that many consider Nelson's masterpiece. A breakthrough for him at age 42, it took him from respected journeyman to beloved superstar.",
      "Nelson said he's already begun work on album number 78, but declines to share its direction.",
      "As Nelson returns to the road, the only surviving member of the classic lineup of his Family band is Mickey Raphael, 73, whose harmonica has duetted for decades with the Willie warble.",
      "Bassist Bee Spears died in 2011. Guitarist and backup singer Jody Payne died in 2013. Drummer Paul English died in 2020. And Nelson's sister Bobbie Nelson, his only sibling and his piano player, died in 2022.",
      "But the band he takes on the road now is just as familial in its own way. It often includes his sons Lukas and Micah. English's brother Billy plays the drums. The son of Payne and singer Sammi Smith, Waylon Payne, plays guitar.",
      "They collectively keep up with Nelson's wants and whims on stage. One thing the live show never includes is a set list. He refuses to use them. Band members \u2014 and sound guys, and lighting guys \u2014 have to stay on their toes and be ready for anything.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather play it off the top of my head, because I can read the crowd pretty good,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThey jump in there.\u201d",
      "The list-less set lately has included classics like \u201cWhiskey River\u201d (always the opener, no guessing to be done there,) and \u201cBloody Mary Morning\u201d along with newer adoptees like Tom Waits' \u201cLast Leaf,\u201d a song that perfectly expresses Nelson's survivor status.",
      "\u201cI'm the last leaf on the tree,\u201d Nelson sings in the song that leads his 2024 album of the same name. \u201cThe autumn took the rest, but it won't take me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy son Micah found that for me,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI really love the song, and the audience likes it, it\u2019s one of the real good ones.\u201d",
      "He's also been performing songs written by Micah, who records and performs as Particle Boy.",
      "One favorite, \u201cEverything Is B- - - - - -t,\u201d seems to stand in contrast to the gospel standards like \u201cI'll Fly Away\u201d and \u201cWill The Circle Be Unbroken\u201d that he often plays a few minutes later. Willie disagrees.",
      "\u201cIt's all gospel,\u201d he says with a laugh.",
      "September will bring the 40th anniversary addition of Farm Aid, the annual festival to support family farmers, which Nelson founded with Neil Young and John Mellencamp, He performs there annually. It was inspired by one-off charity concerts like \u201cLive Aid,\u201d but became an annual institution, rotating each year to a different farm-adjacent city. It's in Minneapolis this year.",

      "Thanks to an agreement with the International Olympic Committee, the renamed marvel will now lift off into the sky each summer evening \u2014 a ghostly echo of last year\u2019s opening ceremony \u2014 from June 21 to Sept. 14, for the next three years.",
      "Gone is the official \u201cOlympic\u201d branding \u2014 forbidden under IOC reuse rules \u2014 but not the spectacle. The 30-meter-tall (98-foot-tall) floating ring, dreamed up by French designer Mathieu Lehanneur and powered by French energy company EDF, simulates flame without fire: LED lights, mist jets and high-pressure fans create a luminous halo that hovers above the city at dusk, visible from rooftops across the capital.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of those monuments in Paris that could stay,\u201d said Laurent Bro\u00e9ze, a local architect pausing in the gardens on Thursday. \u201cIt was set up temporarily, but a bit like the Eiffel Tower, it makes sense for it to return. It\u2019s a bit of a shame they want to take it down later, but maybe it could be installed somewhere else, I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Though it stole the show in 2024, the cauldron\u2019s original aluminum-and-balloon build was only meant to be temporary \u2014 not engineered for multiyear outdoor exposure.",
      "To transform it into a summer staple, engineers reinforced it: The aluminum ring and tether points were rebuilt with tougher components to handle rain, sun and temperature changes over several seasons.",
      "A\u00e9rophile, Paris\u2019s tethered balloon specialist, redesigned the winch and tether system to meet aviation rules, allowing safe operation in winds up to 20\u201325 kph (12-15 mph).",
      "Hydraulic, electrical, and misting systems were fortified \u2014 not only to ensure smooth nightly flights but to endure months of wear and tear untested on the original design. These retrofits shift the cauldron from a fragile, one-off spectacle to a resilient, summerlong landmark \u2014 prepared to withstand everything Paris summers can throw at it.",
      "The structure first dazzled during the Paris 2024 Games, ignited on July 26 by Olympic champions Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec and Teddy Riner. Over just 40 days, it drew more than 200,000 visitors, according to officials.",
      "Now perched in the center of the drained Tuileries pond, the cauldron\u2019s return is part of French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s effort to preserve the Games\u2019 spirit in the city, as Paris looks ahead to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.",
      "Visitors have already begun to gather.",
      "\u201cBeautiful,\u201d said Javier Smith, a tourist from Texas. \u201cAnd the place where it\u2019s going to be, or is sitting now, it\u2019s beautiful. All these beautiful buildings, the Louvre, all that is fantastic.\u201d",
      "Access is free and unticketed. The cauldron will be on display from morning to night, igniting with light from 10 a.m. and lifting off each evening after the garden closes \u2014 10:30 p.m. in June and July, with earlier times through September. It will float above the city for several hours before quietly descending around 1 a.m.",
      "The \u201cflame,\u201d while entirely electric, still conjures a sense of Olympic poetry.",
      "\u201cYes, we came for a little outing focused on the statues related to mythology in the Tuileries Garden,\u201d said Chlo\u00e9 Solana, a teacher visiting with her students. \u201cBut it\u2019s true we\u2019re also taking advantage of the opportunity, because last week the Olympic cauldron wasn\u2019t here yet, so it was really nice to be able to show it to the students.\u201d",
      "The cauldron\u2019s ascent may become a new rhythm of the Parisian summer, with special flights planned for Bastille Day on July 14 and the anniversary of the 2024 opening ceremony on July 26.",
      "It no longer carries the Olympic name. But this phoenix-like cauldron is still lifting Paris into the clouds \u2014 and into memory.",

      "House Republicans will look to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration seeks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are moving to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump's administration looks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk.",
      "The package to be voted on Thursday targets foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides money for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service, as well as thousands of public radio and television stations around the country.",
      "Republicans are characterizing the spending as wasteful and unnecessary, but Democrats say the rescissions are hurting the United States' standing in the world.",
      "\u201cCruelty is the point,\u201d Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said of the proposed spending cuts.",
      "The Trump administration is employing a tool rarely used in recent years that allows the president to transmit a request to Congress to cancel previously appropriated funds. That triggers a 45-day clock in which the funds are frozen pending congressional action. If Congress fails to act within that period, then the spending stands.",
      "The benefit for the administration of a formal rescissions request is that passage requires only a simple majority in the 100-member Senate instead of the 60 votes usually required to get spending bills through that chamber. So, if they stay united, Republicans will be able to pass the measure without any Democratic votes.",
      "The administration is likening the first rescissions package to a test case and says more could be on the way if Congress goes along.",
      "Republicans, sensitive to concerns that Trump's sweeping tax and immigration bill would increase future federal deficits, are anxious to demonstrate spending discipline, though the cuts in the package amount to just a sliver of the spending approved by Congress each year. They are betting the cuts prove popular with constituents who align with Trump's \u201cAmerica first\u201d ideology as well as those who view NPR and PBS as having a liberal bias.",
      "In all, the package contains 21 proposed rescissions. Approval would claw back about $900 million from $10 billion that Congress has approved for global health programs. That includes canceling $500 million for activities related to infectious diseases and child and maternal health and another $400 million to address the global HIV epidemic.",
      "The Trump administration is also looking to cancel $800 million, or a quarter of the amount Congress approved, for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation, and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country.",
      "About 45% of the savings sought by the White House would come from two programs designed to boost the economies, democratic institutions and civil societies in developing countries.",
      "The Republican president has also asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it\u2019s slated to receive during the next two budget years. About two-thirds of the money gets distributed to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Nearly half of those stations serve rural areas of the country.",
      "The association representing local public television stations warns that many of them would be forced to close if the Republican measure passes. Those stations provide emergency alerts, free educational programming and high school sports coverage and highlight hometown heroes.",
      "Advocacy groups that serve the world's poorest people are also sounding the alarm and urging lawmakers to vote no.",
      "\u201cWe are already seeing women, children and families left without food, clean water and critical services after earlier aid cuts, and aid organizations can barely keep up with rising needs,\u201d said Abby Maxman, president and CEO of Oxfam America, a poverty-fighting organization.",
      "Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the foreign aid is a tool that prevents conflict and promotes stability but the measure before the House takes that tool away.",
      "\u201cThese cuts will lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, devastating the most vulnerable in the world,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cAnd at a time when China and Russia and Iran are working overtime to challenge American influence.\u201d",
      "Republicans disparaged the foreign aid spending and sought to link it to programs they said DOGE had uncovered.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said taxpayer dollars had gone to such things as targeting climate change, promoting pottery classes and strengthening diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Other Republicans cited similar examples they said DOGE had revealed.",
      "\u201cYet, my friends on the other side of the aisle would like you to believe, seriously, that if you don't use your taxpayer dollars to fund this absurd list of projects and thousands of others I didn't even list, that somehow people will die and our global standing in the world will crumble,\u201d Roy said. \"Well, let's just reject this now.\u201d",

      "Sometimes death, as life, brings strange symmetries",
      "Sometimes there are strange symmetries in death, as in life. The twin passings of Sly Stone and Brian Wilson this week brought that into sharp relief.",
      "Both were musical geniuses who paid a high price for their gifts. They burned bright, with art they created at their peaks that became more moving and meaningful with time, only to see their creative lights extinguished suddenly through mental health and addiction issues. Both were 82 when they died \u2014 Stone on Monday and Wilson on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt's such an unsettling coincidence,\u201d said Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. \u201cThese two figures, they were very different and massively influential, and each ran into a wall of their own problems in many ways. As much as they achieved, it's hard not to think that they could have done more.\u201d",
      "With his late brothers Carl and Dennis, Beach Boys co-founder Wilson was the architect of the California sound that captured surfing and sun, beaches and girls. Yet for all the \u201cFun, Fun, Fun,\u201d there was something much deeper and darker in Brian's abilities as a composer.",
      "It was more than disposable music for teen-agers. He had an unparalleled melodic sense, hearing sounds in his mind that others couldn't. He could worm his way into your head and then break your heart with songs like \u201cIn My Room\u201d and \u201cGod Only Knows.\u201d The tour de force \u201cGood Vibrations\u201d \u2014- had anyone ever heard of the theremin before he employed its unearthly wail? \u2014 is a symphony both complex and easily accessible.",
      "\u201cHe was our American Mozart,\u201d musician Sean Ono Lennon wrote on social media.",
      "The 1966 album \u201cPet Sounds\u201d was a peak. Wilson felt a keen sense of competition with the Beatles. But they had three writers, including Sean's dad, John Lennon. Wilson was largely alone, and he heard impatience and doubt from other Beach Boys, whose music he provided.",
      "He felt the pressure in trying to follow up \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d and \u201cSmile\u201d became music's most famous unfinished album. Wilson, a damaged soul to begin with because of an abusive father, never reached the heights again. He descended into a well-chronicled period of darkness.",
      "Stone's skills came in creating a musical world that others only dreamed of at the time. The Family Stone was an integrated world \u2014 Black and white, men and women \u2014 and the music they created was a potent mixture of rock, soul and funk. It made you move, it made you think.",
      "For a period of time from 1967 to 1973, their music was inescapable \u2014 \u201cDance to the Music,\u201d \u201cEverybody is a Star,\u201d \u201cHigher,\u201d \u201cHot Fun in the Summertime,\u201d \u201cSing a s Simple Song,\u201d \u201cFamily Affair,\u201d \u201cThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin).\u201d Their performance at Woodstock was a milestone.",
      "\u201cHis songs weren't just about fighting injustice, they were about transforming the self to transform the world,\u201d musician and documentarian Questlove, who lovingly tended to Stone's legacy, wrote this week. \u201cHe dared to be simple in the most complex ways \u2014 using childlike joy, wordless cries and nursery rhyme cadences to express adult truths. His work looked straight at the brightest and darkest parts of life and demanded we do the same.\u201d",
      "From his peak, the fall was hard. Years of drug abuse took its toll. Periodic comeback attempts deepened a sense of bewilderment and pity.",
      "Music is littered with stories of sudden, untimely and early deaths. Yet until this week, both men lived on, somewhat improbably passing average life expectancies.",
      "Wilson, by many measures, achieved some level of peace late in life. He had a happy marriage. He was able to see how his music was revered and appreciated and spent several years performing it again with a younger band that clearly worshiped him. It was a postscript not many knew, said journalist Jason Fine, who befriended Wilson and made the 2021 documentary, \u201cBrian Wilson: Long Promised Road.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat sort of simple message he really wanted to give people through his music going back to the \u201860s \u2014 a sense of warmth, a sense that it\u2019s going to be OK in the same way that music lifted him up from his darkness, he'd try to do for other people,\u201d Fine told The Associated Press in an interview then. \u201cI think now, more than earlier in his career, he accepts that he does that and that's a great comfort to him.\u201d",
      "Stone emerged to write an autobiography in 2023. But less is known about his later years, whether he found peace or died without the full knowledge of what his music meant to others.",
      "\u201cYes, Sly battled addiction,\u201d Questlove wrote. \u201cYes, he disappeared from the spotlight. But he lived long enough to outlast many of his disciples, to feel the ripples of his genius return through hip-hop samples, documentaries and his memoir. Still, none of that replaces the raw beauty of his original work.\u201d",
      "Did Sly Stone and Brian Wilson live lives of tragedy or triumph? It's hard to say now. One suspects it will become easier with the passage of time, when only the work remains. That sometimes brings clarity.",
      "\u201cMillions of people had their lives changed by their music,\u201d DeCurtis said. \u201cNot just enjoyed it, but had their lives transformed. That's quite an accomplishment.\u201d",

      "A spokesperson for Fox News Channel did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "The vice president's office does not release a schedule for Vance and did not offer advance notice of the trip, so the surprise arrival of Air Force Two in Butte, Montana, set off local speculation as his motorcade was seen driving away.",
      "The Murdoch ranch near Dillon is roughly 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Butte. The ranch, which Murdoch purchased in 2021, is spread across two valleys and a mountain range and has some 12,000 cattle. It sits near Yellowstone National Park along the Montana-Idaho border.",

      "Vance was scheduled to have lunch with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, according to the president's publicly released schedule, meaning the vice president presumably returned to Washington shortly after meeting the Murdochs 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) away on Tuesday night.",

      "The Republican president's attendance at the sold-out showing of the Tony Award-winning tale of redemption in 19th century France comes as he has focused more than any recent predecessor on the arts center along the Potomac River that is a memorial to a slain Democratic president.",
      "Presidents' involvement in the Kennedy Center's affairs had been limited to naming members to the board of trustees and attending the taping of its annual honors program in the fall.",
      "But after returning to office in January, Trump stunned the arts world by firing the Kennedy Center's longtime director and board and replacing them with loyalists, who then named him as chairman, and promising to overhaul its programming, management and even appearance as part of an effort to put his stamp on the national arts scene.",
      "Trump's appearance in the Opera House on Wednesday, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, will also mark his first time at a Kennedy Center performance as president. He avoided the venue after entertainment industry pushback to his policies in his first term in office, breaking with presidential tradition by never attending the annual Kennedy Center Honors taping.",
      "His moves have upset some of the center's patrons and performers.",
      "In March, the audience booed Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, after they slipped into upper-level seats in the Concert Hall to hear the National Symphony Orchestra. Trump appointed Usha Vance to the Kennedy Center board along with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Fox News Channel hosts Maria Bartiromo and Laura Ingraham, among other supporters.",
      "Sales of subscription packages are said to have declined since Trump's takeover, and several touring productions, including \u201cHamilton,\u201d have canceled planned runs at the center. Artists such as actor Issa Rae and musician Rhiannon Giddens scrapped scheduled appearances, and Kennedy Center consultants including musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming have resigned.",
      "Understudies may perform Wednesday night due to boycotts by \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d cast members.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has adopted a more aggressive posture toward the arts. The White House has taken steps to cancel millions of dollars in previously awarded federal humanities grants to arts and culture groups, and Trump\u2019s budget blueprint proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.",
      "Trump has also targeted Smithsonian museums by signing executive orders to restrict their funding and by attempting to fire the director of the National Portrait Gallery.",
      "Trump hosted the board at the White House for dinner in May and said congressional Republicans have pushed for more than $250 million for repairs and maintenance at the Kennedy Center. He claimed that \u201ctremendous amounts of money\u201d had been spent at the center but \u201cthey certainly didn't spend it on wallpaper, carpet or painting.\u201d",
      "He characterized previous programming as \u201cout of control with rampant political propaganda\u201d and said it featured \u201csome very inappropriate shows,\u201d including a \u201cMarxist anti-police performance\u201d and \u201cLesbian-only Shakespeare.\u201d",
      "Trump cited some drag show performances as a reason to take control of the center, though next season's theater lineup includes \u201dMrs. Doubtfire,\" which tells the story of a divorced man who disguises himself as a female nanny so he can spend time with his children.",
      "Trump also visited the Kennedy Center in March to preside over a board meeting and take a tour.",
      "The Kennedy Center, which is supported by government money and private donations, opened in 1971 and for decades has been seen as an apolitical celebration of the arts.",
      "It was first conceived in the late 1950s, during the administration of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, who backed a bill from the Democratic-led Congress calling for a National Culture Center. In the early 1960s, Democratic President John F. Kennedy launched a fundraising initiative, and his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, signed into law a 1964 bill renaming the project the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Kennedy had been assassinated the year before.",

      "German artist G\u00fcnther Uecker, one of the country\u2019s most important post-war artists who was world-famous for his large-format nail reliefs, has died",
      "BERLIN -- German artist G\u00fcnther Uecker, one of the country's most important post-war artists who was world-famous for his large-format nail reliefs, has died. He was 95.",
      "German news agency dpa reported that his family confirmed he died at the university hospital in his hometown of D\u00fcsseldorf in western Germany Tuesday night. They did not give a cause of death.",
      "For decades, Uecker, who was often dubbed \u201cthe nail artist,\u201d created art by hammering carpenter\u2019s nails into chairs, pianos, sewing machines and canvases. His works can be found in museums and collections across the globe.",
      "In his art work, seemingly endless numbers of nails, which would by themselves perhaps be perceived as potentially aggressive and hurtful, turned into harmonic, almost organic creations. His reliefs with the tightly hewn nails are reminiscent of waving grasses or fields of algae in a marine landscape.",
      "Uecker himself described his nail art as diary-like landscapes of the soul, which he called an \u201cexpression of the poetic power of man,\u201d dpa reported.",
      "Hendrik W\u00fcst, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia which includes state capital D\u00fcsseldorf, called Uecker \u201cone of the most important and influential artists in German post-war history\u201d and said that with his life\u2019s work, he influenced generations of young artists and \u201ccontributed to an open and dynamic society.\"",
      "Born on March 13, 1930, in the village of Wendorf on the Baltic Sea, Uecker moved to D\u00fcsseldorf in the mid-1950s, where he studied and later also taught at the city's prestigious art academy.",
      "In one of his most spectacular appearances or art happenings, he rode on the back of a camel through the hallways of the venerable academy in 1978. Together with fellow artist Gerhard Richter, he \u201coccupied\u201d the Kunsthalle Baden-Baden museum in 1968, with both kissing in front of the cameras.",
      "The son of a farmer, he traveled the world with a humanitarian message of peace and exhibited in countless countries, including dictatorships and totalitarian states. He painted ash pictures after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1986, and exhibited human rights messages painted on fabric in Beijing.",
      "He also painted \u201cVerletzungsw\u00f6rter,\u201d or words of violence, killing and torment in many languages and foreign scripts on large canvases. In 2023, Uecker erected a stone memorial in Weimar in memory of the victims of the Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald.",
      "\u201cThe theme of my artistic work is the vulnerability of man by man,\u201d he said.",

      "The \u201cbones\u201d of Theo Jansen\u2019s \u201cstrandbeesten\u201d \u2014 beach animals in Dutch \u2014 have taken over a former cable factory in Delft, the small city in the western Netherlands that Jansen has called home for decades.",
      "\u201cDuring the years, there has been a sort of evolutionary history, you could say. And you could see these animals as sort of natural historical objects,\u201d the 77-year old artist told The Associated Press before the installation\u2019s opening.",
      "The Strandbeesten Mortuary, as the exhibition is called, follows the various versions of the mobile sculptures since 1990 when Jansen created the first one from plastic pipes and tape. As the animals evolved, Jansen incorporated plastic bottles, wooden planks, cloth and cardboard.",
      "The life and death cycle of these famous animals \u2014 formed mostly out of PVC pipes \u2014 has left behind an impressive fossil record, which is on display at the exhibition.",
      "Marloes Koster, who organized the exhibition for Delft\u2019s Prinsenhof Museum, said that Jansen\u2019s ultimate goal is to create a beast that will live forever.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not there yet, so these are the ones that didn\u2019t make it,\u201d she added.",
      "The museum is undergoing major renovations, so Koster and her colleagues have been putting together arts and culture events at alternative venues around the city while the building is shut.",
      "Born near the North Sea, Jansen grew up captivated by the wind that often hits the Dutch coastline. He harnessed it to allow his animals to \u201cwalk\u201d along the beach. Every year, he creates a new strandbeest and, at the end of the summer, declares the animal dead.",
      "\u201cAll summer I do experiments, and in the fall I\u2019m a little bit wiser (about) how these animals should survive in the future,\u201d Jansen said.",
      "Many of the visitors to the opening of the exhibition had followed Jansen\u2019s work for years and were keen to understand how the strandbeesten had changed over time.",
      "\u201cYou see a kind of development in the way he does things. So they start out very simple, and then it gets increasingly complicated. So they evolve,\u201d said Cor Nonhof, a Delft local who had come to see the exhibition with his wife.",
      "Even at the opening, Jansen was already keen to return to the beach to work on the latest evolution of his strandbeesten.",
      "\u201cI cannot do anything else,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cAnd I am very happy with that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In the heart of Spain\u2019s capital, the famous Sobrino de Bot\u00edn restaurant proudly holds the title of being the world\u2019s oldest restaurant",
      "MADRID -- In the heart of Spain's capital, Sobrino de Bot\u00edn holds a coveted Guinness World Record as the world's oldest restaurant. Exactly three hundred years after it opened its doors, Bot\u00edn welcomes droves of daily visitors hungry for Castilian fare with a side of history.",
      "But on the outskirts of Madrid, far from the souvenir shops and tourist sites, a rustic tavern named Casa Pedro makes a bold claim. Its owners assert the establishment endured not just the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s and the Napoleonic invasion in the early 1800s, but even the War of Spanish Succession at the start of the 18th century \u2014 a lineage that would make Casa Pedro older than Bot\u00edn and a strong contender for the title.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating when you say, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve been around since 1702,\u2019 but ... you can\u2019t prove it,\u201d said manager and eighth-generation proprietor Irene Gui\u00f1ales. \u201cIf you look at the restaurant\u2019s logo, it says \u2018Casa Pedro, since 1702,\u2019 so we said, \u2018Damn it, let\u2019s try to prove it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Gui\u00f1ales, 51, remembers her grandfather swearing by Casa Pedro\u2019s age, but she was aware that decades-old hearsay from a proud old-timer wouldn't be enough to prove it. Her family hired a historian and has so far turned up documents dating the restaurant's operations to at least 1750.",
      "That puts them within striking distance of Bot\u00edn\u2019s record.",
      "Both taverns are family-owned. Both offer Castilian classics like stewed tripe and roast suckling pig. They are decorated with charming Spanish tiles, feature ceilings with exposed wooden beams and underground wine cellars. And both enjoy a rich, star-studded history.",
      "Bot\u00edn's celebrated past includes a roster of literary patrons like Truman Capote, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Graham Greene. In his book \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d Ernest Hemingway described it as \u201cone of the best restaurants in the world.\" While Casa Pedro may not have boasted the same artistic pedigree, it boasts its own VIPs. Its walls are adorned with decades-old photographs of former Spanish King Juan Carlos I dining in one of its many rooms. The current Spanish monarch, King Felipe VI dines there, too, albeit more inconspicuously than his father.",
      "But the similarities between the two hotspots end there.",
      "Casa Pedro was once a stop on the only road heading north from the Spanish capital toward France. Its clientele is largely local regulars, like David Gonz\u00e1lez and Mayte Villena, who for years have spent every Friday lunching at the tavern.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn't change a thing for us,\u201d Villena said about the restaurant someday securing the Guinness title.",
      "Bot\u00edn, on the other hand, is a stone\u2019s throw from Madrid\u2019s famed Plaza Mayor, where any day of the week tour guides are herding groups around town \u2014 and often straight through the restaurant's front door.",
      "Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, a third-generation proprietor of Bot\u00edn, concedes that the Guinness accolade awarded in 1987 has helped business, but said the restaurant had enough history to draw visitors even before.",
      "\u201cIt has a certain magic,\u201d he said.",
      "The question then becomes: How can either restaurant definitively claim the title? Guinness provides its specific guidelines for the superlative only to applicants, according to spokesperson Kylie Galloway, noting that it entails \u201csubstantial evidence and documentation of the restaurant\u2019s operation over the years.\"",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said that Guinness required Bot\u00edn show that it has continuously operated in the same location with the same name.",
      "The only time the restaurant closed was during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did Casa Pedro.",
      "That criteria would mean that restaurants that are even older \u2014 Paris' Le Procope, which says it was founded in 1686, or Beijing\u2019s Bianyifang, founded in 1416, or the 1673-established White Horse Tavern in Newport, Rhode Island \u2014 aren't eligible for the designation.",
      "La Campana, in Rome\u2019s historic center, claims over 500 years of operation, citing documents on its menu and in a self-published history. Its owners say they have compiled the requisite paperwork and plan to submit it to Guinness.",
      "Gui\u00f1ales and her husband couldn't consult archives from the former town of Fuencarral, now a Madrid neighborhood. Those papers went up in flames during the Spanish Civil War. Instead, they delved into Spanish national archives, where they found land registries of the area from the First Marquess of Ensenada (1743-1754) that showed the existence of a tavern, wine cellar and inn in the small town as of 1750.",
      "In their spare time, the couple continues to hunt for records proving that Casa Pedro indeed dates back to 1702, as is proclaimed on its walls, takeout bags and sugar packets.",
      "But even if they dig up the final documents and wrest the Guinness honor from Bot\u00edn, Gui\u00f1ales concedes that her restaurant's quiet location makes it unlikely to draw Bot\u00edn\u2019s clientele in central Madrid.",
      "\u201cTo think that we could reach that public would be incredible,\u201d Gui\u00f1ales said. \u201cIt's a dream, but it's a dream.\u201d",

      "So he went to a megachurch youth group, which promised teenage shenanigans without much danger. The \u201csanitized mischief,\u201d as he describes it, was perfect for Morris, who grew up as a nerdy, nervous kid.",
      "\u201cYouth group was great for me,\u201d Morris said. \u201cWe can put on a show, we can sing little songs, we can do little skits.

      "Morris also said he\u2019d rarely seen stories set in the kind of youth group he\u2019d grown up in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve just never seen that little world written about in a way that I thought was like, accurate or, like, that got what it was about,\u201d he said.",
      "Published last year by New York-based First Second Books, \u201cYouth Group\u201d tells the story of Kay Radford, a theater kid who winds up joining the Stone Mission megachurch youth group after her parents split up. Her mom is a true believer but lonely. Kay is more skeptical but lonely as well and angry at her dad.",
      "\u201cChurch might help with all this,\u201d Kay\u2019s mom tells her early on. \u201cI think we both could use some community.\u201d",
      "At the youth group, Kay is met by youth leader Meg Parks, a kind but sometimes over-the-top youth leader in pink; a bearded, hippy pastor who turns the \u201cPina Colada song\u201d \u2014 the Rupert Holmes hit \u201cEscape\u201d \u2014 into a metaphor for spiritual seeking; and a band that churns out parodies like \u201cI Saw the Christ\u201d sung to the melody of Ace of Base\u2019s \u201cThe Sign.\u201d",
      "Though fictional, the songs fit the kind of pop culture reference \u2014 sometimes known as a \u201cJesus juke\u201d \u2014 that youth groups can be known for.",
      "\u201cI always think there\u2019s something funny about that move, where you take a secular piece of entertainment, like a song that\u2019s in the zeitgeist, or a popular movie and try and give the hidden religious message,\u201d Morris said.",
      "Kay eventually discovers the youth pastor and some of the older Stone Mission kids also fight demons. That fight becomes personal after one of the demons goes after her dad, and Kay decides to join the battle. Along the way, the Stone Mission kids team up with youth groups from other faiths \u2014 Temple Beth Israel, Immaculate Heart parish and the Polaris Coven \u2014 to fight off a demon invasion with the help of some training by an order of nuns.",
      "Morris said he and illustrator Bowen McCurdy wanted to tell a story that was more than just satire. And while he no longer embraces the faith of his youth, Morris still sees value in the lessons he learned, like the importance of loving your neighbor.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to tell a story of people from a lot of different religions coming together with a common goal,\u201d he said.",
      "Matthew Cressler, a religion scholar and creator of the webcomic series \u201cBad Catholics, Good Trouble,\u201d said comics with evangelical or denominational settings like \u201cYouth Group\u201d are uncommon. Religion in comics, he said, is often seen as \u201ca marker of difference\u201d: for example, Kamala Khan, the Muslim-American hero known as Ms. Marvel, or Matt Murdock, better known as Daredevil, who is Irish-Catholic. In the 1960s, when Daredevil was created, Catholics were still seen as outsiders to the American mainstream, and many of the most popular heroes, like Batman, were seen as Mainline Protestants.",
      "While there were comics for evangelicals, they were often evangelistic, like the controversial Jack Chick tracts or the Christianized adventures of Archie and his friends, published by Spire Comics starting in the 1970s. And evangelicals have often downplayed the kind of sacramental imagery and architecture found in mainline or Catholic settings and try to avoid the kind of visuals needed for comics, said Cressler.",
      "Matthew Brake, founder and editor of online publication Pop Culture and Theology, said non-denominational churches often have a \u201clet\u2019s go to the mall aesthetic\u201d and lack the visual clout of Catholicism.",
      "\u201cNondenominational churches are sort of a cultural underdog,\u201d he said.",
      "That may change, Brake said, as creators like Morris, who grew up in non-denominational settings, come of age. And those settings often contain surprises. Although they are most known for things like worship music and purity culture, megachurches also provide space to talk about things like social justice.",
      "Still, he wonders if many nondenominational Christians would be the kinds of fans that would enjoy a book like \u201cYouth Group\u201d or \u201cPreacher,\u201d a late-1990s comic about an evangelical pastor who ends up possessed by a supernatural being.",
      "David Canham, who reviews comics for the secular pop-culture website AIPT \u2014 short for \u201cAdventures in Poor Taste\u201d \u2014 had mixed feelings about \u201cYouth Group.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst off, there\u2019s plenty of \u201990s nostalgia \u2014 a good-natured tongue-in-cheek look back at many of the silly and absurd things about \u201990s culture, with a focus on evangelical Christian culture,\u201d he wrote when the book came out. \u201c\u2018Youth Group\u2019 delivers on this point.\u201d",
      "But the book\u2019s take on pluralism \u2014 the idea that all religion is on the same side \u2014 turned him off as an evangelical Christian. \u201cI don\u2019t want to recommend a book that promotes a worldview that so strongly disagrees with my own beliefs,\u201d he wrote.",
      "At first, Morris said he was worried the book might offend Christians and atheists alike. Some evangelicals might feel the book mocks their faith, while atheists might think the book overlooks the shortcomings of religious groups.",
      "Both those criticisms would be fair, he said. Religious groups get a lot of things wrong, and yet churches and other faith groups remain important to their members. Morris said he tried to walk a fine line of gently poking fun at faith while showing why it still has an impact on people\u2019s lives, and how the friendships made in youth groups may long endure.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want the humor to be like, church is stupid, or say, \u2018look at this dumb church stuff,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted it to be funny and familiar.\u201d",
      "Morris said he wanted to capture the mixed feelings people have about the faiths in which they grew up. While he appreciated Bible teachings like caring for the needy, some of the politics and social messages, especially about LGBTQ+ folks, were a turnoff, he said.",
      "Religion, he said, is complicated.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of wonderful memories, and there\u2019s a lot of stuff that gives me the ick,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that\u2019s in the book. I hope you can see how a religious upbringing can be upsetting and wonderful \u2014 comforting but also makes you mad.\u201d",

      "YEONCHEON, South Korea -- Hundreds of fans gathered in the early morning hours to catch a glimpse of K-pop superstars Jimin and Jung Kook, the latest and final members of BTS to be discharged from South Korea\u2019s mandatory military service.",
      "The pair wore their military uniforms Wednesday, saluted and addressed fans who had assembled to see the pair after their discharge.",
      "Jung Kook thanked the journalists and fans who traveled to see him and Jimin after their discharge and acknowledged how different it was to be back in the spotlight. \u201cActually, it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been in front of cameras, and I didn\u2019t even put on makeup, so I\u2019m a bit embarrassed,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d",
      "The pair enlisted in December 2023, one day after RM and V did the same. The latter were discharged on Tuesday.",
      "Supporters traveled from around the world to the public sports ground where the meet-and-greet took place. It was moved from the military base\u2019s gate for safety reasons. Color-wrapped buses bearing BTS members\u2019 faces lined the streets while red and yellow balloons floated above and a decorated food truck provided free coffee and water, adding to the festive atmosphere.",
      "Many supporters wore masks, conscious of potential backlash after the band\u2019s label discouraged attendance citing safety concerns. Despite the challenges, fans like Anaesi from Portugal said the 20-hour journey to Yeoncheon, a town near the tense border with North Korea, was worth it.",
      "\u201cPortugal is a small country, but inside of Portugal, BTS is a king,\u201d she said. Anaesi, who discovered BTS on YouTube, said the group \u201csaved\u201d her from depression. \u201cSo for me BTS is my angel,\u201d she said. She displayed a colorful upper arm tattoo featuring a golden shield emblazoned with \u201cARMY\u201d and an eagle above it, complemented by Korean text listing BTS members\u2019 names and those of her friends.",
      "V thanked fans Tuesday for their patience in waiting for him and RM's return and teased the band's reunion. \"If you can just wait a little bit longer, we will return with a really amazing performance.\u201d",
      "The seven singers of the popular K-pop band plan to reunite as a group sometime in 2025 after they finish their service.",
      "Six of the group\u2019s seven members served in the army, while Suga is fulfilling his duty as a social service agent, an alternative form of military service. He will be discharged later this month.",
      "Jin, the oldest BTS member, was discharged in June 2024. J-Hope was discharged in October.",
      "In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18 to 28 are required by law to perform 18-21 months of military service under a conscription system meant to deter aggression from rival North Korea.",
      "The law gives special exemptions to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers if they have obtained top prizes in certain competitions and are assessed to have enhanced national prestige. K-pop stars and other entertainers aren\u2019t subject to such privileges.",
      "However, in 2020, BTS postponed their service until age 30 after South Korea\u2019s National Assembly revised its Military Service Act, allowing K-pop stars to delay their enlistment until age 30.",
      "There was heated public debate in 2022 over whether to offer special exemptions of mandatory military service for BTS members, until the group\u2019s management agency announced in October 2022 that all seven members would fulfill their duties.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Country musician Conner Smith fatally hit a pedestrian while driving his truck in Nashville over the weekend, and he currently faces no charges as an investigation continues, police said.",
      "Metro Nashville Police said Smith, 24, hit Dorothy Dobbins, 77, Sunday evening while she was crossing the road inside a marked crosswalk. Dobbins, a retired attorney, later died at a hospital. The Tennessee Bar Association posted on its website that Dobbins had been out walking her dog when she was hit.",
      "Police say Smith showed no signs of impairment. They believe the \u201cpreliminary contributing factor\u201d appears to be that Smith did not yield the right of way to the pedestrian.",
      "Smith\u2019s attorney, Worrick Robinson, said his client is cooperating with the investigation.",
      "\u201cHis heart goes out to Ms. Dobbins\u2019 family during this incredibly difficult time,\" Robinson said in a statement.",
      "Dobbins was a leader in the city\u2019s legal aid and family law communities, where she practiced for over 40 years, according to posts by the Bar Association and the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands. She played a \u201cfoundational role in opening Nashville\u2019s first domestic violence shelter,\u201d according to a Facebook post from the Legal Aid Society, and she wrote the state\u2019s first order of protection legislation.",

      "Lame arrived in the U.S. on April 30 and \u201coverstayed the terms of his visa,\u201d the ICE spokesperson said. The Associated Press sent a message seeking comment Tuesday to the email address listed on Lame\u2019s Instagram account. He has not publicly commented on his detainment.",
      "His detainment and voluntary departure from the U.S. comes amid President Donald Trump\u2019s escalating crackdown on immigration, including raids in Los Angeles that sparked days of protests against ICE, as the president tests the bounds of his executive authority.",
      "A voluntary departure \u2014 which was granted to Lame \u2014 allows those facing removal from the U.S. to avoid a deportation order on their immigration record, which could prevent them from being allowed back into the U.S. for up to a decade.",
      "The 25-year-old rose to international fame during the pandemic without ever saying a word in his videos, which would show him reacting to absurdly complicated \u201clife hacks.\" He has over 162 million followers on TikTok alone.",
      "The Senegal-born influencer moved to Italy when he was an infant with his working class parents and has Italian citizenship.",
      "His internet fame quickly evolved. He signed a multi-year partnership with designer brand Hugo Boss in 2022. In January, he was appointed as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador.",

      "The admission from Victoria Heuermann isn\u2019t made on camera but through a statement from producers near the end of \u201cThe Gilgo Beach Killer: House of Secrets,\u201d a three-part documentary on NBC\u2019s streaming service Peacock.",
      "\u201cA week before the series release, Victoria Heuermann told the producers that based on publicly available facts that have been presented and explained to her, she now believes her father is most likely the Gilgo Beach killer,\u201d reads a statement at the close of the final episode of the documentary.",
      "Bob Macedonio, an attorney for Heuermann\u2019s now ex-wife, Asa Ellerup, said in a statement after the documentary\u2019s release that \u201ctime will only tell\u201d whether his client will ever accept that her husband may have been a serial killer.",

      "In the documentary, Victoria Heuermann struggles to reconcile her childhood memories with the portrait of the killer described by authorities.",
      "She says her father was around the family \u201c90% of the time\u201d and was never violent toward any of them.",
      "At the same time, Victoria Heuermann acknowledged there were times when he stayed home while the family went on vacation and that she was around 10 to 13 years old when the killings happened. Prosecutors say Heuerman committed some of the killings in the basement while his family was out of town.",
      "\u201cWhether or not I believe my dad did it or not, I\u2019m on the fence about that,\u201d said the now 28-year-old. \u201cPart of me thinks he didn\u2019t do it, but at the same time, I don\u2019t know, he could have just totally had a double life.\u201d",
      "Ellerup, for her part, maintained she saw no \u201cabnormal behavior\u201d in their nearly three decades of marriage.",
      "She dismissed a computer file prosecutors claim is a \u201cblueprint\u201d of his crimes as \u201cabsurd.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors say the document features a series of checklists for before, during and after a killing, such as a \u201cbody prep\u201d checklist that includes among other items a note to \u201cremove head and hands.\u201d",
      "Ellerup also shrugged off other evidence prosecutors have enumerated in court documents, including a vast collection of bondage and torture pornography found on electronic devices seized from their home, and hairs linked to Heuermann that were recovered on most of the victims\u2019 bodies.",
      "At the same time, she revealed that in July 2009, around the time one of his alleged victims went missing, Heuermann suddenly renovated a bathroom while she and their two children visited her family in Iceland. But she noted her former husband eventually joined the family for their final week of the trip.",
      "\u201cMy husband, he\u2019s a family man. He\u2019s my hero,\u201d Ellerup said. \u201cWhat I want to say to him is, \u2018I love you, no matter what.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ellerup divorced Heuermann after his arrest in 2023. But in the documentary, Victoria Heuermann says the separation was for financial reasons to protect the family\u2019s assets.",
      "Indeed, the filmmakers captured the family speaking to Heuermann by phone from jail, and the mother and daughter have been regularly attending court hearings with their attorney.",
      "The family, which also includes Ellerup\u2019s adult son from a prior marriage, is also planning to put up its notoriously ramshackle house in well-to-do Massapequa Park for sale as they look to move to a property they own in South Carolina.",
      "Ryan McCormick, an NBCUniversal spokesperson, declined to say how much family was compensated, though he said the payments could not go toward Heuermann or his defense funds.",

      "Before Celine Song was an Oscar-nominated filmmaker, she was a playwright in New York who needed day jobs to pay rent. That\u2019s how she found herself as a professional matchmaker.",
      "What may have begun as a purely transactional gig, a way for her to keep making her art in an expensive city, taught her more about people\u2019s wants and needs and the true contents of their hearts than she could have ever imagined.",
      "\u201cI always wanted to write something about it because there seemed to be a story in it that is massive and very epic in proportion,\u201d Song said. \u201cIt affects every human being on Earth.\"",
      "And while waiting for her breakout film \u201cPast Lives\u201d to debut, she did. That film is \u201cMaterialists,\u201d a modern-day New York love story starring Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans that\u2019s heading to theaters this weekend. Johnson is the matchmaker presented with two different types of men for herself \u2014 one a poor struggling actor and ex-boyfriend, the other a wealthy \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 and the internet has already been drawing battle lines. But, like \u201cPast Lives\u201d wasn\u2019t really about a love triangle, \u201cMaterialists\u201d is about something more than the question of which guy is the \u201ccorrect\u201d choice.",
      "Song and Johnson spoke with The Associated Press about the film, falling in love and the modern marketplace of dating. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "SONG: We met up thinking that we were just going to get to know each other and be friends and I walked away from that conversation \u2014 this is just from my perspective \u2014 but I think I was still sitting there when I texted my producers and the studio being like, \u201cI think I\u2019ve found my Lucy.\u201d That\u2019s how casting works for me, it\u2019s always about falling in love. It\u2019s very connected to what we talk about in the film. Like, there\u2019s no mathematical anything. It just the feeling that you get talking to someone and you\u2019re like, oh I just know.",
      "JOHNSON: I knew you had this movie that you were about to start making. I was basically told it was too late. I was like, but I really want to meet her because she\u2019s so smart, and I\u2019ve seen interviews and obviously had seen \u201cPast Lives.\u201d I just wanted talk and get to know her as an artist and a person and so I went into this being like there\u2019s no chance that I\u2019ll be in this movie, but maybe she\u2019ll make another one. We just had such a good time talking, I didn\u2019t even know that I was someone she was thinking about. A few weeks later we spoke. It was very romantic.",
      "JOHNSON: She\u2019s sort of at the top of her game in her work and is very disconnected from her heart and focused on being a perfectionist and getting people to get married. On the surface, you see her as a very transactional person and not really invested in people\u2019s souls, but she actually is and really does want the best for them. She\u2019s also on her own journey of trying to figure out what it is she wants for herself in this life, and, essentially, do you fight for the thing that you think you want, or do you fight for that thing that you know you need? Is that right, Celine?",
      "SONG: That\u2019s so good.",
      "SONG: It was never going to be a conversation about which flavor of a person. It\u2019s actually so much more about this marketplace of dating that all of us live in if you\u2019re single, and also the marketplace that Dakota\u2019s character is navigating. She knows the math better than anyone else in the film. She\u2019s an excellent matchmaker.",
      "Pedro plays somebody who is probably, in straight dating, someone of the highest possible value. Chris\u2019 character, in the spectrum in the marketplace of values of dating, is someone who is of the lowest value possible. I find them to be such adorable characters, very worthy of an adoration.",
      "Lucy knows exactly where they fall in the in the stock market of men. It\u2019s actually about the way that the math around that is going to blow up.",
      "JOHNSON: Celine speaks so eloquently about the marketplace of dating and I glitch at those words because I\u2019m like, you can\u2019t explain love that way. But that\u2019s actually how people are. Marriage used to be a business deal. It was like, my father wants your cows and my mother needs your wheat and whatever. It was a trade-off. But now there\u2019s all these books about how we expect our partner to fulfill every single aspect of our needs. And the world being dominated by social media, people don\u2019t meet in real life anymore. They don\u2019t behave normally in public.",
      "People are in a very strange place in evolution, and I think the difference between these two characters and these two men, sure they are different ends of the spectrum in terms of like technical value, materialistic value. But also each of them have the opposite in terms of psycho-spiritual value and emotional value and what they can offer the other person in terms of soul evolution and growth.",
      "Perhaps because she works in this world of trying to understand people and what they want, she\u2019s forced to go more inward and really interrogate herself and say, what do I really want and what is actually important in this life? Is it how much money I have or is it how truly loved I am?",
      "SONG: To me, it\u2019s about this contradiction, right? It\u2019s this thing of how we talk about what we want in our partner, when we\u2019re asked to use language to describe it, and how we literally, spiritually fall in love. The gap between those two things is terrifyingly big. To me, that\u2019s where the mystery of the film is.",

Just a few years ago, their inclusion might've been unthinkable amid murky regulations and a lack of public awareness surrounding harm reduction.",
      "Advocates say drugs are commonly consumed at music festivals, making them ideal locations for harm reduction activities. While more music festivals are allowing such activities, activists are pushing for expanded efforts as some festivals remain cautious.",
      "Founded by William Perry and Ingela Travers-Hayward in 2022, This Must Be The Place has since given away an estimated $4.5 million in naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal medication, at festivals and smaller community events.",
      "In the very beginning, without a \u201cproof of concept,\u201d as Perry describes it, they had trouble partnering with festivals. Eventually, a few festivals in the Midwest agreed to let them table, which \u201cgot us in the door with Bonnaroo in 2022,\u201d says Perry, referring to the major U.S. festival operated by C3 Presents, one of the largest concert promoters on the planet. Now they have a presence at 35 major U.S. festivals \u2014 including Lollapalooza, Governors Ball and Besame Mucho \u2014 where they collaborate directly with C3 and their security personnel.",
      "The organization's growth overlaps with advancing federal regulations. According to Daliah Heller, vice president of overdose prevention initiatives at the global public health nonprofit Vital Strategies, naloxone distribution used to be determined by state regulations until 2023, when the Food and Drug Administration approved the first over-the-counter nasal spray.",
      "\u201cWe no longer need the prescription laws to be amended to allow for the distribution of naloxone,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it's like buying aspirin \u2014 it's over the counter.\u201d",
      "Last year, This Must Be the Place gave away 46,146 units of Narcan \u2014 a brand name for naloxone \u2014 through their national festival outreach.",
      "Emmett Beliveau, chief operating officer of C3 Presents, says working with This Must Be the Place was C3\u2019s first time implementing public-facing harm reduction strategies, in addition to the promoter's existing medical programs.",
      "Bringing the organization into C3\u2019s festivals was \u201cnot in response to anything that has happened at one of our festivals,\u201d he says, but rather because of the \u201cnumber of fatalities happening in our communities.\u201d",
      "Some activists believe attendees are most responsive to receiving harm reduction education from peers instead of authority figures. And so, for the last three years, a nonprofit dedicated to combating accidental drug overdoses among young adults, Team Awareness Combating Overdose, has distributed fentanyl test strips and Narcan at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.",
      "Former TACO CEO Kameran Mody says that music festivals are ideal locations for distribution and education because \u201cmusic and the use of drugs are synonymous with each other.\u201d",
      "TACO distributes through what Mody describes as \u201cguerrilla-style marketing.\u201d They enlist volunteers, train them on how to use naloxone, and ship Narcan and test strips to them to bring into the festival.",
      "They do not involve the festival organizers. Representatives for Coachella did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment.",
      "In 2023, a TACO volunteer administered Narcan to an unresponsive Coachella attendee exhibiting signs of an overdose. The organization says the attendee regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cThat was one of our biggest successes,\u201d Mody says.",
      "In 2019, at Bonnaroo, a 27-year-old man was found dead at his campsite \u2014 right after harm reduction activists had picketed the Tennessee festival because it didn't allow drug testing. The toxicology report found ecstasy and fentanyl in his system.",
      "At the time, under state law, test strips were criminalized and classified as drug paraphernalia. That\u2019s changed: In 2022, Tennessee decriminalized fentanyl test strips. By the end of 2023, 44 other states and D.C. had done the same.",
      "But in some states, drug paraphernalia laws are written in a way that isn't completely transparent \u2014 there are test strips that are not fentanyl-specific, Heller points out \u2014 and criminalization and social stigmas endure.",
      "Some have found workarounds. \u201cEven in the states where the legalities were a bit unclear, instead of just coming in and hoping things worked out, we would reach out to the health department, and say \u2018We run this project, how do feel about it?\u2019\u201d says Perry. \u201cWe would end up with letters from the highest-ranking health official, either in the county or in the state, saying \u2018We approve of this.\u2019 That circumvented any roadblocks.\u201d",
      "Some festivals, though, might be hesitant to use test strips because \u201cit\u2019s tough for them to admit that drugs are being used,\u201d Mody says. Some festivals have even banned naloxone.",
      "While This Must Be The Place distributes fentanyl test strips at some Ohio events, C3 doesn't distribute test strips at its events and does not plan to. Beliveau doesn't believe fentanyl test strips are effective and expressed concern they could encourage drug use. Test strips, which can detect fentanyl in pills, powders or injectables, are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a low-cost means of helping prevent drug overdoses.",
      "At a three-day electronic music festival in Mexico City earlier this year, a booth provided free, anonymous drug testing. The initiative, known as \u201cCheca tu Sustancia\u201d (Check Your Substance), was spearheaded by the Instituto RIA, a Mexico-based drug policy research and advocacy organization.",
      "When unexpected substances are detected, users received detailed information on what they are, their risks, potential interactions with other substances and dosage adjustments, empowering them to make informed choices.",
      "Perry says they are aware of smaller festivals in the United States conducting drug checking, but \u201cthey do it in a very underground and whisper network way\u201d to avoid criminalization.",
      "What Perry says his organization would like to see at music festivals in the future would be harm reduction areas \u2014 sections where attendees who have taken drugs can be monitored, not to \u201cget them into trouble\u201d but to ensure safety.",
      "Heller says there are a number of groups working to destigmatize drugs, promote decriminalization, and promote drug checking.",
      "\u201cWe already have drug checking happening in cities,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes perfect sense to expand the settings where you would offer that to include music festivals. It's the same rationale. ... The issue is this idea of liability. You\u2019d have to create a law, essentially, that would protect the festival from liability.\u201d",

      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday she is investigating whether pharmaceutical giant CVS improperly used customers' personal information to send out text messages lobbying against a proposed state law.",
      "Murrill also said she plans to issue a cease-and-desist letter to the company to stop the messages.",
      "As lawmakers debated a now-failed bill on Wednesday they held up screenshots of text messages sent by CVS.",
      "\u201cLast minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy \u2014 your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,\u201d one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, read.",
      "The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.",
      "The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country\u2019s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.",
      "\u201cThese powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies,\u201d a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report warned.",
      "CVS says on its website that it \u201cnegotiates lower costs for our customers and expands coverage to affordable medications that people need to stay healthy.\u201d",
      "The company's text messages to Louisiana residents included a link to a draft letter urging lawmakers to oppose the legislation that someone could sign with their email address and send to legislators.",
      "\u201cThe proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients\u2019 ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,\u201d the letter read. \u201cThey would also ban the pharmacies that serve patients suffering from complex diseases requiring specialty pharmacy care to manage their life-threatening conditions like organ transplants or cancer. These vulnerable patients cannot afford any disruption to their care \u2013 the consequences would be dire.\u201d",
      "Rep. Dixon McMakin pointed to some of the messages from CVS, saying they were misleading and false. He specifically pointed to ads, that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers \u201cmay shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.\u201d",

      "Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS, said the texts were the result of a last-minute amendment to the bill Wednesday without an opportunity for a public hearing.",

      "\u201cWe believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly,\u201d Thibault said in an email. \u201cOur communication with our customers, patients and members of our community is consistent with law.\u201d",
      "Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has continued to push the bill as the state's legislature concluded Thursday afternoon.",
      "The bill, which proponents said would bolster independent pharmacies and reduce the cost of prescription medications, received overwhelming approval in the House, with a vote of 88-4.",
      "Among those who voted against the measure was Rep. Mandie Landry. The Democrat said that while she wanted to vote in favor, but she was receiving messages from people in her district urging her not to. She said CVS's lobbying had reached them and as a result they feared that they wouldn't be able to access their medications.",

      "Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias has asked for an investigation into a suburban Chicago police department for allegedly sharing data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- The Illinois secretary of state on Thursday asked for an investigation into a suburban Chicago police department after learning that it violated state law by sharing data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion.",
      "Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias asked the attorney general to review the matter. He also is creating an audit system to ensure police departments don't run afoul of a 2023 law banning the distribution of license-plate data to track women seeking abortions or to find undocumented immigrants.",
      "The incident underscores the fears that led to the law: In particular, that states which restricted abortion access after Roe v. Wade was overturned would use the technology to follow and possibly prosecute women seeking the procedure by crossing into Illinois, where it is readily available.",
      "\u201cLicense plate readers can serve as an important tool for law enforcement, but these cameras must be regulated so they aren\u2019t abused for surveillance, tracking the data of innocent people or criminalizing lawful behavior,\u201d the Democrat said in a statement.",
      "According to Giannoulias, police in Mount Prospect, 24 miles (39 kilometers) northwest of Chicago, shared license-plate data with the sheriff in Johnson County, Texas, who was looking for a woman whose family was worried because she had undergone a self-administered abortion.",
      "Giannoulias says Mount Prospect also shared data outside of Illinois on undocumented immigrants, in violation of the law. Between mid-January and April, there were 262 searches on immigration-related matters in Mount Prospect alone, he said.",
      "Telephone and email messages were left for Mount Prospect Police Chief Michael Eterno. Violations by Mount Prospect could result in loss of state funding, deputy Secretary of State Scott Burnham said.",
      "The incident was revealed by a website called 404 Media, which reported that the Texas sheriff sent a nationwide request for data from 83,000 cameras operated by the private company Flock Safety, including those in Mount Prospect.",
      "At Giannoulias\u2019 request, Flock Safety blocked access to 62 out-of-state agencies that have sought data related to abortion or immigration, Burnham said. The company also set up a program to flag the terms \u201cabortion\u201d and \u201cimmigration\u201d in requests for access and deny those requests.",
      "Police agencies will also be required to comply with audits by the secretary of state to mark trends or upticks in certain requests, Burnham said.",
      "The Flock Safety cameras take photos of passing license plates thousands of times a day. The technology, called Automatic License Plate Recognition, is helpful in tracking stolen vehicles or carjackings, missing persons and in other authorized cases.",
      "The technology allows police agencies to read thousands of license plates per minute from images captured by cameras along roadways.",
      "After Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion, was overturned in 2022, Giannoulias was behind Illinois' first-in-the-nation law that requires other states wanting access to Illinois license-plate data to agree not to use it for that purpose or to track undocumented immigrants.",

      "Every month, thousands of women thwart abortion bans in their home states by turning to telehealth clinics willing to prescribe pregnancy-ending drugs online and ship them anywhere in the country.",
      "Whether this is legal, though, is a matter of debate. Two legal cases involving a New York doctor could wind up testing the shield laws some states have passed to protect telehealth providers who ship abortion pills nationwide.",
      "Dr. Margaret Carpenter faces a felony charge in Louisiana for supplying abortion medication through the mail to a pregnant teen in that state. The patient's mother also faces criminal charges. A Texas judge fined the same physician $100,000 after the state accused her of prescribing abortion medication for a woman near Dallas.",
      "So far, the prosecution hasn't progressed thanks to New York's shield law, which has protected Carpenter from extradition to Louisiana. But other telehealth centers operating in states with similar legal protections for abortion providers are watching closely.",
      "\"We have great legal counsel who have advised us that what we are doing is legal,\u201d said Dr. Angel Foster, co-founder of The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, which is among a handful of telehealth providers that facilitate abortions from afar in states with bans.",
      "As more states consider enacting shield laws or expanding existing ones, whether one state can shield providers from liability for breaking another state's laws around abortion is still an unsettled area of law.",
      "Erik Baptist, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which opposes abortion, said shield laws violate a constitutional requirement that states respect the laws and legal judgments of other states.",
      "\"What these shield law states are doing are undermining the prerogative of these pro-life states to implement and enforce pro-life laws,\u201d said Baptist, director of the group\u2019s Center for Life. \u201dAnd so I think the Supreme Court ultimately will want to take this.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is inherently a challenge with shield laws and telehealth,\u201d said Carmel Shachar, faculty director of the Health Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School. \u201cAt a certain point, for the purposes of abortion bans, the courts will need to decide: Do we treat a telehealth abortion as happening within the state of the provider or within the state of the patient?\u201d",

      "The prescribing process at telehealth clinics varies by provider, but usually takes place entirely online, with the patient answering a series of health-related questions and consent forms.",
      "At some telehealth clinics, medical providers don't come face-to-face with patients, even via videoconferencing, and patients don't necessarily know the prescriber's name unless requested.",
      "For instance, when Foster's clinic, also known as The MAP, puts pills in the mail, only the name of the practice appears on the label, as allowed under the Massachusetts shield law. If patients have follow-up questions, they can talk or text the doctor working that day, but may not know that doctor's name either.",

      "\u201cThis has been the safety net, post-Dobbs, of allowing people who don\u2019t have the ability to travel out of state to get abortion care,\u201d said Greer Donley, a University of Pittsburgh law professor and abortion law expert.",
      "When dealing with medications not related to abortion, doctors are often able to write prescriptions for patients in other states. However, in most states, if the patient is located within its borders, the doctor must have a license issued by that state, according to Mei Wa Kwong, executive director of the The Center for Connected Health Policy.",
      "Twenty three states and Washington, D.C., currently have shield laws protecting abortion providers.",
      "Of those, eight have specific provisions protecting them from criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits even if the patient is in another state, according to the nonprofit research organization KFF. They include California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s request to extradite Carpenter hit a roadblock when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected it, citing the state\u2019s shield law. (A county clerk also cited the shield law as he refused to file the civil judgment from Texas.)",
      "\u201cThese are not doctors providing health care. They are drug dealers,\u201d Republican Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told state lawmakers as she promoted a bill that would expand who can sue and be sued in abortion medication cases. \u201cThey are violating our laws. They are sending illegal medications for purposes of procuring abortions that are illegal in our state.\u201d",
      "Julie Kay, the executive director of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, the nationwide organization co-founded by Carpenter, said providers won\u2019t be \u201cbullied and intimidated\u201d into ceasing operations.",
      "Other telehealth abortion providers said they also won't be deterred by legal threats.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday named eight new vaccine policy advisers to replace the panel that he abruptly dismissed earlier this week.",
      "They include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines, a leading critic of pandemic-era lockdowns, and a professor of operations management.",
      "Kennedy's decision to \u201cretire\u201d the previous 17-member Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was widely decried by doctors' groups and public health organizations, who feared the advisers would be replaced by a group aligned with Kennedy's desire to reassess \u2014 and possibly end \u2014 longstanding vaccination recommendations.",
      "On Tuesday, before he announced his picks, Kennedy said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring great people onto the ACIP panel \u2013 not anti-vaxxers \u2013 bringing people on who are credentialed scientists.\u201d",
      "The new appointees include Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director for the National Association of Catholic Nurses, who has been listed as a board member and volunteer director for the National Vaccine Information Center, a group that is widely considered to be a leading source of vaccine misinformation.",
      "Another is Dr. Robert Malone, the former mRNA researcher who emerged as a close adviser to Kennedy during the measles outbreak. Malone, who runs a wellness institute and a popular blog, rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as he relayed conspiracy theories around the outbreak and the vaccines that followed. He has appeared on podcasts and other conservative news outlets where he\u2019s promoted unproven and alternative treatments for measles and COVID-19.",
      "He has claimed that millions of Americans were hypnotized into taking the COVID-19 shots and has suggested that those vaccines cause a form of AIDS. He\u2019s downplayed deaths related to one of the largest measles outbreaks in the U.S. in years.",
      "Other appointees include Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm. Dr. Cody Meissner, a former ACIP member, also was named.",
      "Abram Wagner of the University of Michigan\u2019s school of public health, who investigates vaccination programs, said he\u2019s not satisfied with the composition of the committee.",
      "\u201cThe previous ACIP was made up of technical experts who have spent their lives studying vaccines,\u201d he said. Most people on the current list \u201cdon\u2019t have the technical capacity that we would expect out of people who would have to make really complicated decisions involving interpreting complicated scientific data.\u201d",
      "He said having Pebsworth on the board is \u201cincredibly problematic\u201d since she is involved in an organization that \u201cdistributes a lot of misinformation.\u201d",
      "Kennedy made the announcement in a social media post on Wednesday.",
      "The committee, created in 1964, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC directors almost always approve those recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The CDC\u2019s final recommendations are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "The other appointees are:",
      "\u2014Dr. James Hibbeln, who formerly headed a National Institutes of Health group focused on nutritional neurosciences and who studies how nutrition affects the brain, including the potential benefits of seafood consumption during pregnancy.",
      "\u2014Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies business issues related to supply chain, logistics, pricing optimization and health and health care management. In a 2023 video pinned to an X profile under his name, Levi called for the end of the COVID-19 vaccination program, claiming the vaccines were ineffective and dangerous despite evidence they saved millions of lives.",
      "\u2014Dr. James Pagano, an emergency medicine physician from Los Angeles.",
      "\u2014Dr. Michael Ross, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist.",
      "Of the eight named by Kennedy, perhaps the most experienced in vaccine policy is Meissner, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, who has previously served as a member of both ACIP and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory panel.",
      "During his five-year term as an FDA adviser, the committee was repeatedly asked to review and vote on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that were rapidly developed to fight the pandemic. In September 2021, he joined the majority of panelists who voted against a plan from the Biden administration to offer an extra vaccine dose to all American adults. The panel instead recommended that the extra shot should be limited to seniors and those at higher risk of the disease.",
      "Ultimately, the FDA disregarded the panel\u2019s recommendation and OK\u2019d an extra vaccine dose for all adults.",
      "In addition to serving on government panels, Meissner has helped author policy statements and vaccination schedules for the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "ACIP members typically serve in staggered four-year terms, although several appointments were delayed during the Biden administration before positions were filled last year. The voting members all have scientific or clinical expertise in immunization, except for one \u201cconsumer representative\u201d who can bring perspective on community and social facets of vaccine programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. government\u2019s top health official, has accused the committee of being too closely aligned with vaccine manufacturers and of rubber-stamping vaccines. ACIP policies require members to state past collaborations with vaccine companies and to recuse themselves from votes in which they had a conflict of interest, but Kennedy has dismissed those safeguards as weak.",
      "Most of the people who best understand vaccines are those who have researched them, which usually requires some degree of collaboration with the companies that develop and sell them, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher.",
      "\u201cIf you are to exclude any reputable, respected vaccine expert who has ever engaged even in a limited way with the vaccine industry, you\u2019re likely to have a very small pool of folks to draw from,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "The U.S. Senate confirmed Kennedy in February after he promised he would not change the vaccination schedule. But less than a week later, he vowed to investigate childhood vaccines that prevent measles, polio and other dangerous diseases.",
      "Kennedy has ignored some of the recommendations ACIP voted for in April, including the endorsement of a new combination shot that protects against five strains of meningococcal bacteria and the expansion of vaccinations against RSV.",
      "In late May, Kennedy disregarded the committee and announced the government would change the recommendation for children and pregnant women to get COVID-19 shots.",
      "On Monday, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the ACIP, saying he would appoint a new group before the next scheduled meeting in late June. The agenda for that meeting has not yet been posted, but a recent federal notice said votes are expected on vaccinations against flu, COVID-19, HPV, RSV and meningococcal bacteria.",
      "A HHS spokesman did not respond to a question about whether there would be only eight ACIP members, or whether more will be named later.",

    "story": [
      "Big changes are being are being proposed to a food aid program as part of President Donald Trump's tax-cut legislation",
      "TPresident Donald Trump's plan to cut taxes by trillions of dollars could also trim billions in spending from social safety net programs, including food aid for lower-income people.",
      "The proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would make states pick up more of the costs, require several million more recipients to work or lose their benefits, and potentially reduce the amount of food aid people receive in the future.",
      "The legislation, which narrowly passed the U.S. House, could undergo further changes in the Senate, where it's currently being debated. Trump wants lawmakers to send the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d to his desk by July 4, when the nation marks the 249th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Here's a look at the food aid program, by the numbers:",
      "The federal aid program formerly known as food stamps was renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, on Oct. 1, 2008. The program provides monthly payments for food purchases to low-income residents generally earning less than $1,632 monthly for individuals, or $3,380 monthly for a household of four.",
      "The nation\u2019s first experiment with food stamps began in 1939. But the modern version of the program dates to 1979, when a change in federal law took effect eliminating a requirement that participants purchase food stamps. There currently is no cost to people participating in the program.",
      "A little over 42 million people nationwide received SNAP benefits in February, the latest month for which figures are available. That's roughly one out of every eight people in the county. Participation is down from a peak average of 47.6 million people during the 2013 federal fiscal year.",
      "Often, more than one person in a household is eligible for food aid. As of February, nearly 22.5 million households were enrolled SNAP, receiving an average monthly household benefit of $353.",
      "Legislation passed by the House is projected to cut about $295 billion of federal spending from SNAP over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "A little more than half of those federal savings would come by shifting costs to states, which administer SNAP. Nearly one-third of those savings would come by expanding a work requirement for some SNAP participants, which the CBO assumes would force some people off the rolls. Additional money would be saved by eliminating SNAP benefits for between 120,000 and 250,000 immigrants legally in the U.S. who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents.",
      "Another provision in the legislation would cap the annual inflationary growth in food benefits. As a result, the CBO estimates that the average monthly food benefit would be about $15 lower than it otherwise would have been by 2034.",
      "To receive SNAP benefits, current law says adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents would need to work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don't do so are limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation that passed the House would expand work requirements to those ages 55 through 64. It also would extend work requirements to some parents without children younger than age 7. And it would limit the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas that lack sufficient jobs.",
      "The combined effect of those changes is projected by the CBO to reduce SNAP participation by a monthly average of 3.2 million people.",
      "The federal government currently splits the administrative costs of SNAP with states but covers the full cost of food benefits. Under the legislation, states would have to cover three-fourths of the administrative costs. States also would have to pay a portion of the food benefits starting with the 2028 fiscal year.",
      "All states would be required to pay at least 5% of the food aid benefits, and could pay more depending on how often they make mistakes with people\u2019s payments.",
      "States that had payment error rates between 6-8% in the most recent federal fiscal year for which data is available would have to cover 15% of the food costs. States with error rates between 8-10% would have to cover 20% of the food benefits, and those with error rates greater than 10% would have to cover 25% of the food costs.",
      "Many states could get hit with higher costs. The national error rate stood at 11.7% in the 2023 fiscal year, and just three states \u2014 Idaho, South Dakota and Vermont \u2014 had error rates below 5%. But the 2023 figures are unlikely to serve as the base year, so the exact costs to states remains unclear.",
      "As a result of the cost shift, the CBO assumes that some states would reduce or eliminate benefits for people.",
      "House Resolution 1, containing the SNAP changes and tax cuts, passed the House last month by a margin of just one vote \u2014 215-214.",
      "A vote also could be close in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of the 100 seats. Democrats did not support the bill in the House and are unlikely to do so in the Senate. Some Republican senators have expressed reservations about proposed cuts to food aid and Medicaid and the potential impact of the bill on the federal deficit. GOP Senate leaders may have to make some changes to the bill to ensure enough support to pass it.",

      "A top aide to Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Calley Means has built a following within the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement by railing against the failings of the U.S. health system, often pinning the blame on one issue: corruption.",
      "Means, a top aide to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was hired as a White House adviser in March. He has used that perch to attack the nation\u2019s leading physician groups, federal agencies and government scientists, claiming they only protect their own interests in the nation\u2019s $4.9 trillion-a-year industry.",
      "In recent interviews, speeches and podcasts he has called the American Medical Association \u201ca pharma lobbying group,\u201d labeled the Food and Drug Administration \u201ca sock puppet of industry,\" and said federal health scientists have \u201coverseen a record of utter failure.\u201d",
      "Means, however, has his own financial stake in the sprawling health system. He\u2019s the co-founder of an online platform, Truemed, that offers dietary supplements, herbal remedies and other wellness products. Some of the vendors featured on Truemed\u2019s website are supporters of Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement, which downplays the benefits of prescription drugs, vaccines and other rigorously tested medical products.",
      "Kennedy has pledged to run the Department of Health and Human Services with \u201cradical transparency,\u201d but Means has never had to publicly disclose his own financial details or where exactly they intersect with the policies he's advancing.",
      "\u201cIt reeks of hypocrisy,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, a health researcher at Yale University. \u201cIn effect, he is representing another industry that is touting nonregulated products and using his platform within the government to financially benefit himself.\u201d",
      "In a written statement, Means said his government work has not dealt with matters affecting Truemed and has focused on issues like reforming nutrition programs and pressuring companies to phase out food dyes.",
      "\u201cPursuing these large-scale MAHA goals to make America healthy has been the sole focus in my government work,\u201d Means said.",
      "Truemed helps users take tax-free money out of their health savings accounts, or HSAs, to spend on things that wouldn\u2019t normally qualify as medical expenses, such as exercise equipment, meal delivery services and homeopathic remedies \u2014 mixtures of plants and minerals based on a centuries-old theory of medicine that's not supported by modern science.",
      "The business model caught the attention of the IRS last year, which issued an alert: \u201cBeware of companies misrepresenting nutrition, wellness and general health expenses as medical care.\u201d",
      "Truemed co-founder and CEO, Justin Mares, said in a statement the company is \u201cin full alignment\u201d with IRS guidelines.",
      "\u201cTruemed enables patients to work with providers to use medical funds for root cause interventions like exercise and vitamin D to reverse disease under current law,\u201d Mares said.",
      "The full extent of Means\u2019 potential conflicts \u2014 including his personal investments\u2014 are unclear because of his status as a special government employee.",
      "Unlike presidential appointees and other senior officials, special government employees are temporary staffers who do not have to leave companies or sell investments that could be impacted by their work. Also, their financial disclosure forms are shielded from public release.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d says Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush now at the University of Minnesota. Painter and other experts have raised alarms over a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails.",
      "Still, part-time government employees are subject to the same law that bars all federal staffers from working on issues that could directly benefit their finances. When such cases arise, they must recuse themselves or risk criminal penalties.",
      "Means regularly opines on matters before HHS, including rethinking the use of drugs for depression, weight loss, diabetes and other conditions. Recently he's been promoting a new government report that calls for scaling back prescription medications in favor of exercise, dietary changes and other alternatives.",
      "\u201cIf we rely less on our medical system, less on drugs, it necessitates the spiritual, cultural conversation about what we\u2019re doing to our children\u2019s bodies,\u201d Means said in a recent podcast appearance.",
      "Experts note that government ethics rules are intended to both prevent financial conflict violations, but also the appearance of such conflicts that might undermine public trust in government.",
      "\u201cIf I were running the ethics office over at HHS, I sure as heck wouldn\u2019t want anybody going around giving interviews and speeches about government matters that could have an effect on their own financial interests,\u201d Painter said.",
      "Means\u2019 rapid rise reflects the seeming contradictions within the MAHA movement itself, which urges followers to distrust both big corporations and the government agencies which regulate them.",
      "Means rails against big pharma and food conglomerates, two industries that he says he spent years working for as a consultant in Washington.",
      "Means has no medical training. A graduate of Harvard Business School, he previously ran a bridal gown startup with his wife. On Wednesday, he's scheduled to be the keynote speaker at FDA's annual science forum, according to a copy of the program shared with The Associated Press.",
      "He traces his passion for health care reform to the death of his mother from pancreatic cancer in 2021. Shortly thereafter, Means and his sister, Dr. Casey Means, took psychedelics together and had \u201ca mind-blowing, life-changing experience,\u201d which led them to co-author a wellness book, launch separate health startups and begin appearing on podcasts.",
      "Casey Means was recently nominated to be surgeon general and has faced scrutiny over her qualifications, including an unfinished medical residency.",
      "Asked about her nomination, President Donald Trump said: \u201cBobby thought she was fantastic,\u201d adding that he did not know her.",
      "Meanwhile, her brother has stepped up his rhetoric for the MAHA agenda, recently declaring that Kennedy has \u201ca spiritual mandate to reform our broken system.\"",
      "While promoting the administration\u2019s accomplishments, Means does not shy away from plugging his own brand or those of his business partners.",
      "When asked to offer health advice to listeners of a sports podcast, Outkick The Show, in April, Means said: \u201cRead our book, \u2018Good Energy.\u2019\u201d",
      "He also recommended blood tests sold by Function Health, which provides subscription-based testing for $500 annually. The company was cofounded by Dr. Mark Hyman, a friend of Kennedy and an investor in Truemed, which also offers Hyman's supplements through its platform. Casey Means is also an investor in Hyman's company.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re sick, most likely you have some kind of nutrient deficiency, some kind of biomarker that you can actually then target with your diet and your supplements,\u201d Calley Means said.",
      "Like dietary supplements, the marketing claims on laboratory tests sold by Hyman are not approved by the FDA. The agency has warned for years about the accuracy of such tests and tried to start regulating them under President Joe Biden.",
      "Experts say MAHA entrepreneurs like Hyman are following a playbook common to the wellness industry: Identify a health concern, market a test to diagnose it and then sell supplements or other remedies to treat it.",
      "\u201cIt ends up favoring these products and services that rest on flimsy grounds, at the expense of products that have actually survived a rigorous FDA approval process,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, a former FDA official who is now president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "Many of the items sold via Truemed, including sweat tents, cold plunge tanks and light therapy lamps, wouldn\u2019t typically qualify as medical expenses under rules for HSAs, tax-free accounts created by Congress to manage medical costs.",
      "The IRS generally states that HSA purchases must help diagnose, cure, treat, mitigate or prevent disease.",
      "Truemed allows users to request a \u201cletter of medical necessity\u201d from a doctor, stating that the product in question could have medical value for them. Like other telehealth services, there\u2019s usually no real-time communication with the patient. The physician reviews a \u201csimple survey solution,\u201d filled out by the Truemed user, according to the company\u2019s website.",
      "Industry representatives say customers should be careful.",
      "\u201cYou need to be prepared to defend your spending habits under audit,\u201d said Kevin McKechnie, head of the American Bankers Association\u2019s HSA council. \u201cCompanies are popping up suggesting they can help you manage that process and maybe they can \u2014 so the debate continues.\u201d",
      "Americans have an estimated $147 billion in HSA accounts, a potential windfall for companies like Truemed that collects fees for transactions made using their platforms.",
      "Means sees an even bigger opportunity \u2014 routing federal funds out of government programs and into more HSAs.",
      "\u201cThe point of our company is to steer medical dollars into flexible spending,\u201d Means told fitness celebrity Jillian Michaels, on her podcast last year. \u201cI want to get that $4.5 trillion of Medicare, Medicaid, everything into a flexible account.\u201d",
      "Means\u2019 pitch for expanding HSAs echoes two decades of Republican talking points on the accounts, which were created in 2003 to encourage Americans in high-deductible plans to be judicious with their health dollars.",
      "But HSAs have not brought down spending, economists say. They are disproportionately used by the wealthiest Americans, who have more income to fund them and a bigger incentive to lower their tax rate.",
      "Americans who earn more than $1 million annually are the group most likely to make regular HSA contributions, according to an analysis by the nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than half Americans with HSAs have balances less than $500.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d would further expand HSA purchases, making gym memberships and other fitness expenses eligible for tax-free spending. That provision alone is expected to cost the government $10 billion in revenue.",
      "\u201cThese are really just tax breaks in the guise of health policy that overwhelmingly benefit people with high incomes,\u201d said Gideon Lukens, a former White House budget official during the Obama and Trump administrations, now with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Expanding HSA eligibility was listed as a goal for a coalition of MAHA entrepreneurs and Truemed partners, founded by Means, which lobbied Congress last year, according to the group's website.",
      "Means said in a statement that the group focused only on broad topics like \u201chealth care incentives and patient choice \u2014 but did not lobby for specific bills.\u201d",
      "In total, the HSA expansions in Trump's bill are projected to cost the federal government $180 billion over the next 10 years. As HSAs expand to include more disparate products and services, Lukens says the U.S. government will have fewer dollars to expand medical coverage through programs like Medicaid.",
      "\u201cWe have a limited amount of federal resources and the question is whether we want to spend that on health and wellness products that may or may not be helpful for wealthy people,\u201d Lukens said.",

      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- Terminally ill New Yorkers would have the legal ability to end their own lives with pharmaceutical drugs under a bill passed Monday in the state Legislature.",
      "The proposal, which now moves to the governor's office, would allow a person with an incurable illness to be prescribed life-ending drugs if he or she requests the medication and gets approval from two physicians. A spokesperson for New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said she would review the legislation.",
      "The New York Senate gave final approval to the bill Monday night after hours of debate during which supporters said it would let terminally ill people die on their own terms.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about hastening death, but ending suffering,\u201d said state Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal, a Democrat who sponsored the proposal.",
      "Opponents have argued the state should instead improve end-of-life medical care or have objected on religious grounds.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. is up to 1,197 confirmed measles cases this year",
      "The U.S. logged fewer than 30 measles cases this week as Ohio health officials confirmed three outbreaks in two counties were over.",
      "There have been 1,197 confirmed measles cases this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. Health officials in Texas, where the nation's biggest outbreak raged during the late winter and spring, confirmed two cases in the last week.",
      "There are three other major outbreaks in North America. The longest, in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in 2,083 cases from mid-October through June 10. The province logged its first death June 5 in a baby who got congenital measles but also had other preexisting conditions.",
      "Another outbreak in Alberta, Canada, has sickened 868 as of Thursday. And the Mexican state of Chihuahua had 2,179 measles cases and four deaths as of Friday, according to data from the state health ministry.",
      "Other U.S. states with active outbreaks \u2014 which the CDC defines as three or more related cases \u2014 include Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota and Oklahoma.",
      "In the U.S., two elementary school-aged children in the epicenter in West Texas and an adult in New Mexico have died of measles this year. All were unvaccinated.",
      "Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that\u2019s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines, and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.",
      "There are a total of 744 cases across 35 counties, most of them in West Texas, state health officials said Tuesday.",
      "Throughout the outbreak, 96 people have been hospitalized.",
      "State health officials estimated less than 1% of cases \u2014 fewer than 10 \u2014 are actively infectious. Fifty-five percent of Texas\u2019 cases are in Gaines County, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has had 411 cases since late January \u2014 just under 2% of the county\u2019s residents.",
      "The April 3 death in Texas was an 8-year-old child, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  Local health officials said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of \u201cwhat the child\u2019s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.\u201d A unvaccinated child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas in late February; Kennedy said the child was 6.",
      "New Mexico held steady Friday with a total of 81 cases.",
      "Seven people have been hospitalized since the outbreak started. Most of the state\u2019s cases are in Lea County. Sandoval County near Albuquerque has six cases, Eddy County has three, Don\u0303a Ana County has two. Chaves, Curry and San Juan counties have one each.",
      "An unvaccinated adult died of measles-related illness March 6. The person did not seek medical care.",
      "Oklahoma stayed steady Friday with a total of 16 confirmed and three probable cases.",
      "The state health department is not releasing which counties have cases.",
      "Arizona has four cases in Navajo County. They are linked to a single source, the county health department said Monday. All four were unvaccinated and had a history of recent international travel.",
      "Colorado has seen a total of 14 measles cases in 2025, which includes one outbreak of eight related cases.",
      "The outbreak is linked to a Turkish Airlines flight that landed at Denver International Airport in mid-May, and includes four cases in Arapahoe County, three in El Paso County and one in Denver, plus a person who doesn't live in Colorado.",
      "Other counties that have seen measles this year include Archuleta and Pueblo.",
      "Illinois health officials confirmed a four-case outbreak on May 5 in the far southern part of the state. It grew to eight cases as of June 6, but no new cases were reported in the following week, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health.",
      "The state's other two cases so far this year were in Cook County, and are unrelated to the southern Illinois outbreak.",
      "Kansas has a total of 76 cases across 11 counties in the southwestern part of the state, with three hospitalizations. All but two of the cases are connected, and most are in Gray County.",
      "Montana had 20 measles cases as of Tuesday. Twelve were in Gallatin County, which is where the first cases showed up \u2014 Montana\u2019s first in 35 years.",
      "Flathead and Yellowstone counties had two cases each, and Hill County had four cases.",
      "There are outbreaks in neighboring North Dakota and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.",
      "North Dakota, which hadn't seen measles since 2011, was up to 34 cases as of June 6, but has held steady since. Two of the people have been hospitalized, and all of the people with confirmed cases were not vaccinated.",
      "There were 16 cases in Williams County in western North Dakota on the Montana border. On the eastern side of the state, there were 10 cases in Grand Forks County and seven cases in Cass County. Burke County, in northwest North Dakota on the border of Saskatchewan, Canada, had one case.",
      "Measles cases also have been reported this year in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.",
      "Earlier outbreaks in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania were declared over by health officials after six weeks of no new cases. Tennessee\u2019s outbreak also appears to be over.",
      "Cases and outbreaks in the U.S. are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. The CDC said in May that more than twice as many measles have come from outside of the U.S. compared to May of last year, and most of those are in unvaccinated Americans returning home. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.",
      "The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don\u2019t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from \u201ckilled\u201d virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.",
      "People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don\u2019t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have \u201cpresumptive immunity.\"",
      "Measles has a harder time spreading through communities with high vaccination rates \u2014 above 95% \u2014 due to \u201cherd immunity.\u201d But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.",
      "Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.",
      "The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.",
      "Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s National Institutes of Health director says some employees\u2019 critical letter to him has \u201cfundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- In his confirmation hearings to lead the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya pledged his openness to views that might conflict with his own. \u201cDissent,\" he said, \u201dis the very essence of science.\u201d",
      "That commitment is being put to the test.",
      "On Monday, scores of scientists at the agency sent their Trump-appointed leader a letter titled the Bethesda Declaration, challenging \u201cpolicies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.\u201d",
      "It says: \"We dissent.\"",
      "In a capital where insiders often insist on anonymity to say such things publicly, 92 NIH researchers, program directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on the letter \u2014 and their careers on the line. An additional 250 of their colleagues across the agency endorsed the declaration without using their names.",
      "The four-page letter, addressed to Bhattacharya, also was sent to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and members of Congress who oversee the NIH. White House spokesman Kush Desai defended the administration's approach to federal research and said President Donald Trump is focused on restoring a \u201cGold Standard\u201d of science, not \u201cideological activism.\u201d",
      "The signers went public in the face of a \u201cculture of fear and suppression\u201d they say Trump's administration has spread through the federal civil service. \u201cWe are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Bhattacharya responded to the declaration by saying it \u201chas some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months.\"",
      "\u201cNevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive,\u201d he said in a statement. \"We all want the NIH to succeed.\u201d",
      "Named for the agency's headquarters location in Maryland, the Bethesda Declaration details upheaval in the world\u2019s premier public health research institution over the course of mere months.",
      "It addresses the termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12 billion and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants.",
      "In one case, an NIH-supported study of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti had to be stopped, ceasing antibiotic treatment mid-course for patients.",
      "In a number of cases, trials that were mostly completed were rendered useless without the money to finish and analyze the work, the letter says. \u201cEnding a $5 million research study when it is 80% complete does not save $1 million,\u201d it says, \u201cit wastes $4 million.\u201d",
      "Jenna Norton, who oversees health disparity research at the agency's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, recently appeared at a forum by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., to talk about what's happening at the NIH.",
      "At the event, she masked to conceal her identity. Now the mask is off. She was a lead organizer of the declaration.",
      "\u201cI want people to know how bad things are at NIH,\" Norton told The Associated Press.",
      "The signers said they modeled their indictment after Bhattacharya\u2019s Great Barrington Declaration in 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.",
      "His declaration drew together likeminded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive COVID-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracized by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH.",
      "\u201cHe is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,\" said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration.",
      "As chief of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch, Kobrin provides scientific oversight of researchers across the country who've been funded by the cancer institute or want to be. Cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimizing its destruction. \"So much of it is gone \u2014 my work,\u201d she said.",
      "The 21-year NIH veteran said she signed because she didn't want to be \"a collaborator\u201d in the political manipulation of biomedical science.",
      "Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, also signed the declaration. \u201cWe have a saying in basic science,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go and become a physician if you want to treat thousands of patients. You go and become a researcher if you want to save billions of patients.",
      "\u201cWe are doing the research that is going to go and create the cures of the future,\u201d he added. But that won\u2019t happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing grant cuts.",
      "The NIH employees interviewed by the AP emphasized they were speaking for themselves and not for their institutes nor the NIH.",
      "Employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants.",
      "The letter asserts \u201cNIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety\u201d and the agency is shirking commitments to trial participants who \u201cbraved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has gone at public health research on several fronts, both directly, as part of its broad effort to root out diversity, equity and inclusion values throughout the bureaucracy, and as part of its drive to starve some universities of federal money.",
      "At the White House, Desai said Americans \u201chave lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",
      "This has forced \u201cindiscriminate grant terminations, payment freezes for ongoing research, and blanket holds on awards regardless of the quality, progress, or impact of the science,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Some NIH employees have previously come forward in televised protests to air grievances, and many walked out of Bhattacharya's town hall with staff. The declaration is the first cohesive effort to register agency-wide dismay with the NIH's direction.",
      "The dissenters remind Bhattacharya in their letter of his oft-stated ethic that academic freedom must be a lynchpin in science.",
      "With that in place, he said in a statement in April, \u201cNIH scientists can be certain they are afforded the ability to engage in open, academic discourse as part of their official duties and in their personal capacities without risk of official interference, professional disadvantage or workplace retaliation.\"",
      "Now it will be seen whether that's enough to protect those NIH employees challenging the Trump administration and him.",
      "\u201cThere's a book I read to my kids, and it talks about how you can't be brave if you're not scared,\u201d said Norton, who has three young children. \"I am so scared about doing this, but I am trying to be brave for my kids because it's only going to get harder to speak up.",
      "\u201cMaybe I'm putting my kids at risk by doing this,\" she added. \"And I'm doing it anyway because I couldn't live with myself otherwise.\u201d",
      "e and noy on",
      "\u201cIn recent years, Americans have lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago,\u201d spokesman Kush Desai said. \u201cThe Trump administration is focused on restoring the Gold Standard of Science \u2014 not ideological activism \u2014 as the guiding principle of HHS, the NIH, and the CDC to finally address our chronic disease epidemic.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency is taking aim at dozens of rules aimed at protecting the environment, including one that requires big polluters to report greenhouse gas emissions",
      "LEOPOLD, Ind. -- On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman\u2019s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.",
      "Outside, the real sky isn\u2019t always blue. Sometimes it\u2019s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that\u2019s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.",
      "\u201cIndustry and government is very, very, very powerful. It\u2019s more powerful than me. I\u2019m just an English teacher,\u201d Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.",
      "In a way, Brockman\u2019s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.",
      "That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump\u2019s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.",
      "But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data \u2014 at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere \u2014 would make it tougher to fight climate change.",
      "At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.",
      "And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.",
      "The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.",
      "\"We can\u2019t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that\u2019s changing over time,\" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.",
      "Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.",
      "But the registry \u201cdoes put pressure on companies to ... document what they\u2019ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.",
      "Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.",
      "\"It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.\u201d",
      "The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these \u201cmonitoring deserts,\u201d said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.",
      "\"The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can\u2019t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.",
      "The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.",
      "CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It\u2019s human rights,\u201d said Daisha Wall, the group's community science program manager. \u201cWe all deserve a right to clean air.\u201d",
      "Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what\u2019s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.",
      "Indiana says it \u201cmaintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,\u201d but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren't satisfied. She and other members of local advocacy groups Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life and Valley Watch install and maintain their own air and water quality monitors. It\u2019s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.",
      "Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven\u2019t eaten breakfast.",
      "\u201cBut you also don\u2019t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says rising global oil prices following Israeli strikes on Iran will strengthen Russia by increasing its oil revenues, aiding its war effort in Ukraine",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- A sharp rise in global oil prices following Israeli strikes on Iran will benefit Russia and bolster its military capabilities in the war in Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday in comments that were under embargo until Saturday afternoon.",
      "Speaking to journalists in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said the surge in oil prices threatens Ukraine\u2019s position on the battlefield, especially because Western allies have not enforced effective price caps on Russian oil exports.",
      "\u201cThe strikes led to a sharp increase in the price of oil, which is negative for us,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cThe Russians are getting stronger due to greater income from oil exports.\u201d",
      "Global oil prices rose as much as 7% after Israel and Iran exchanged attacks over the past 48 hours, raising concerns that further escalation in the region could disrupt oil exports from the Middle East.",
      "Zelenskyy said he planned to raise the issue in an upcoming conversation with U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cIn the near future, I will be in contact with the American side, I think with the president, and we will raise this issue,\u201d he said.",
      "Zelenskyy also expressed concern that U.S. military aid could be diverted away from Ukraine toward Israel during renewed tensions in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cWe would like aid to Ukraine not to decrease because of this,\u201d he said. \u201cLast time, this was a factor that slowed down aid to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Ukraine\u2019s military needs have been sidelined by the United States in favor of supporting Israel, Zelenskyy said, citing a shipment of 20,000 interceptor missiles, designed to counter Iran-made Shahed drones, that had been intended for Ukraine but were redirected to Israel.",

      "An air defense system, Barak-8, promised to Ukraine by Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu was sent to the U.S. for repairs but never delivered to Ukraine, Zelenskyy said.",
      "The Ukrainian president conceded that momentum for the Coalition of the Willing, a group of 31 countries which have pledged to strengthen support for Ukraine against Russian aggression, has slowed because of U.S. ambivalence over providing a backstop.",
      "\u201cThis situation has shown that Europe has not yet decided for itself that it will be with Ukraine completely if America is not there,\u201d he said.",
      "The offer of a foreign troop \u201creassurance force\u201d pledged by the Coalition of the Willing was still on the table \u201cbut they need a backstop, as they say, from America,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cThis means that suddenly, if something happens, America will be with them and with Ukraine.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian president also said the presence of foreign contingents in Ukraine would act as a security guarantee and allow Kyiv to make territorial compromises, which is the first time he has articulated a link between the reassurance force and concessions Kyiv is willing to make in negotiations with Russia.",
      "\u201cIt is simply that their presence gives us the opportunity to compromise, when we can say that today our state does not have the strength to take our territories within the borders of 1991,\u201d he said.",
      "But Europe and Ukraine are still waiting on strong signals from Trump.",
      "Without crushing U.S. sanctions against Russia, \u201cI will tell you frankly, it will be very difficult for us,\u201d Zelenskyy said, adding that it would then fall on Europe to step up military aid to Ukraine.",
      "In other developments, Russia repatriated more bodies of fallen soldiers in line with an agreement reached during peace talks in Istanbul between Russian and Ukrainian delegations, Russian officials said Saturday, cited by Russian state media. The officials said Ukraine did not return any bodies to Russia on Saturday.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War confirmed in a statement that Russia returned 1,200 bodies.",
      "The first round of the staggered exchanges took place Monday. The agreement to exchange prisoners of war and the bodies of fallen soldiers was the only tangible outcome of the talks in Istanbul on June 2.",
      "Continuing a renewed battlefield push along eastern and northeastern parts of the more than 1,000-kilometer (over 600-mile) front line, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed Saturday that its troops captured another village in the Donetsk region, Zelenyi Kut. The Ukrainian military had no immediate comment on the Russian claim.",
      "Russia launched 58 drones and decoys at Ukraine overnight into Saturday, according to the Ukrainian air force, which said its air defenses destroyed 23 drones while another 20 were jammed.",
      "Russia\u2019s defense ministry said it shot down 66 Ukrainian drones overnight.",
      "Attacks have continued despite discussions of a potential ceasefire in the war. During the June 2 talks in Istanbul, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators traded memorandums containing sharply divergent conditions that both sides see as nonstarters, making a quick deal unlikely.",

      "\u201cGrowing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honor,\" he said.",
      "Oldman, 67, was recognized for his services to drama both on screen and on stage. He won an Oscar for his portrayal of Winston Churchill in the 2017 film \u201cDarkest Hour,\" and recently dazzled audiences in the Apple TV spy thriller series \u201c Slow Horses.\u201d",

The Kremlin previously denied involvement in damaging the infrastructure, which provides power and communication for thousands of Europeans.",

Those are aging vessels with obscure ownership, acquired to evade Western sanctions amid the war in Ukraine and operating without Western-regulated insurance.",
      "Russia\u2019s use of the vessels has raised environmental concerns about accidents given their age and uncertain insurance coverage.",
      "For the West, the incidents are a test of resolve in the face of what are believed to be widespread sabotage attacks in Europe allegedly linked to Moscow following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",
      "The Eagle S was carrying 35,000 tons of oil and investigators allege it left a drag trail with its anchor for almost 100 kilometers (62 miles) on the sea bed before it was stopped and escorted to the vicinity of a Finnish port.",
      "The senior officers, whose names were not made public, were the master, the chief mate and the second mate, Finnish police said in a statement Friday. The trio was responsible for the safe passage, navigation and operation of the tanker and are suspected of aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference with telecommunications.",
      "\u201cThe criminal investigation has examined and assessed, among other things, the extent of their responsibility for the condition of the vessel and the degree to which they should have observed the anchor falling into the sea,\u201d said Detective Chief Inspector Sami Liimatainen, who is leading the case for the National Bureau of Investigation.",

      "VENICE, Italy -- Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez have invited celebrity friends like fellow space traveler Katy Perry, Oprah Winfrey, Mick Jagger and Ivanka Trump for their Venice nuptials later this month, but the couple hopes to put a spotlight on Venice\u2019s traditions during the celebrations.",
      "They are sourcing some 80% of their wedding provisions from Venetian vendors, according to people close to the couple, as a way to share their appreciation for the romantic lagoon city. The wedding will take place over three days in late June, with events kept private.",
      "Two historic Venetian companies will add artisanal touches to the celebration: Rosa Salva, the city\u2019s oldest pastry maker that has been crafting donut-shaped fishermen\u2019s biscuits since 1876, and Laguna B, a design studio known for its distinctive handblown Murano glass prized by fashion and design clients.",
      "Antonio Rosa Salva, the 6th generation in his family to run the business, said the wedding order of a selection of surprises for goody bags was important recognition of his family\u2019s long tradition of baking Venetian specialties dating back 150 years.",
      "They include the bussola buttery biscuit that was long a fisherman\u2019s staple, and small zaletti cookies, made from the Veneto region\u2019s corn meal, flavored with raisins and lemon zest.",
      "\u201cWe try to maintain the old recipes,\u2019\u2019 said Rosa Salva, whose family business includes a catering service and four locations in Venice\u2019s historic center and one on the mainland. \u201cWe do everything with love. It\u2019s a pleasure and a privilege.\u2019\u2019",
      "Rosa Salva, whose business regularly caters large events for 1,000 or more people in Venice, is perplexed by posters that have gone up around the historic center protesting the use of the city as a venue for the Bezos-Sanchez wedding.",
      "\u201cEvents like this bring quality tourism to Venice,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see how an event with 200 people can create disruptions. It\u2019s responsible tourism. It\u2019s prestigious that a couple like this, who can go anywhere in the world, are getting married in the city.\u201d",
      "Laguna B was founded by Marie Brandolini, who became known as the glass countess, in 1994, and the company is now being guided by her son, Marcantonio, from the family\u2019s palazzo overlooking the Grand Canal.",
      "The younger Brandolini said his vision is to restore the Venetian tradition of running creative enterprises out of Venice\u2019s grand palazzi, which historically dedicated the ground floor to work spaces for the merchant nobility. His is a good example. The company employs 14 people under 30 out of offices in the back garden and a boutique in an adjacent alleyway, in a sector, he underlines, \u201cnot related to tourism.\u2019\u2019",
      "His upstairs neighbors are Diane von Furstenberg and Barry Diller \u2013 close friends of Bezos and Sanchez, but he doesn\u2019t think that is why the wedding planner singled out his company, which is well known among a small network of collectors.",
      "Laguna B won\u2019t disclose what his master glassblowers on Murano have created for the wedding, but the company is known for distinctive glassware that at times feature an undulating lip \u2013 no two alike.",
      "\u201cI hope they like what we did for them,\u2019\u2019 Brandolini said. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s a great opportunity, it gives extra support for our growth.\u2019\u2019",
      "While the business thrives on such important orders, Brandolini said he is equally gratified by young, discerning customers who seek out the shop because they admire the company\u2019s commitment to community building, reviving Venice\u2019s artisanal heritage and projects to help protect the fragile lagoon. They might buy just a single drinking glass.",
      "His is a message of inclusivity, which he also applies to the Bezos-Sanchez choice of wedding venue. \u201cThe world is for everybody. Whoever wants to do something, should be able to do it, following the law.\u201d",
      "Unsurprisingly in a city whose future is fiercely debated at every turn, the wedding has attracted the attention of protesters, who on Thursday hung a banner on St. Mark\u2019s bell tower with Bezos crossed out. They cite the risk of disruptions in a city so overrun with mass tourism that officials are for a second year requiring day-trippers to pay a tax to enter on key summer days.",
      "City officials have pledged that services will function normally during the wedding, and issued a denial in late March to reports that the wedding organizers had booked half the city\u2019s water taxis and blocked out rooms at luxury hotels.",
      "\u201cWe are very proud,\u2019\u2019 Mayor Luigi Brugnaro told The Associated Press this week in St. Mark\u2019s Square, saying he hoped he would get the chance to meet Bezos. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I will have time, or if he will, to meet and shake hands, but it\u2019s an honor that they chose Venice. Venice once again reveals itself to be a global stage.\u2019\u2019",

      "The ceremony held in the embassy gardens was intended to celebrate Pride Month, which is celebrated every June, and the consulate said the marriage marked a step toward inclusion, respect and equality for all.",
      "\"We celebrate love without borders,\" wrote the embassy in a post on the social media platform X. \u201cThis is the first civil wedding of a same-sex couple at the Embassy of Mexico in Guatemala. It's a right granted to all individuals when both are Mexican citizens.\u201d",
      "Shortly after, the ceremony sparked an outcry among conservative politicians in Guatemala, a largely Catholic country and one of a handful in Latin America that still doesn't recognize same-sex marriages. While such marriages aren't explicitly prohibited, Guatemalan law only refers to unions between a man and a woman.",
      "Allan Rodr\u00edguez, the head of the VAMOS party bloc and ally of former president Alejandro Giammattei, was among those to reject the wedding, writing in a statement that \u201calthough the act may be protected under external jurisdictions, it clearly contradicts Guatemala\u2019s current legal framework.\u201d",
      "According to the congressman, the properties where embassies are located \u201care not foreign territory; they merely enjoy diplomatic privileges\" and therefore are not a part of the Mexican state. He claimed considering them as such would \"violate constitutional principles of sovereignty, territorial unity, and the rule of law.\u201d",
      "Rodr\u00edguez, a former president of Congress, is sanctioned by the United States for obstructing anti-corruption efforts and undermining democracy in Guatemala.",
      "The office of progressive President Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo said that under international law embassies like Mexico's \"have territorial immunity and operate under the jurisdiction of the state they represent.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn this case, it is an activity carried out by the Mexican Consulate in Guatemala and aimed at Mexican citizens. Therefore, it is exclusively the responsibility of the Government of Mexico, through its diplomatic representation, to comment or speak on the matter,\" the embassy statement said.",
      "Still, debate only continued on, with Elmer Palencia, a congressman for the VALOR party, created by the daughter of a former dictator, called the marriage, \u201cnot an act of inclusion, but a provocation.\u201d",
      "\"Out of respect for the host country, Mexico should refrain from that narrative. Guatemalan sovereignty and social institutions deserve that respect,\u201d he said.",
      "Constitutional lawyer Edgar Ort\u00edz contradicted the conservative politicians, saying the marriage doesn't violate Guatemala's sovereignty and complies with the Vienna Convention, which establishes that what happens on diplomatic premises \u201care not subject to the host state\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d He noted that Guatemala's constitution establishes that the country will govern following international principles.",
      "\u201cIn no way are Guatemala\u2019s laws being altered; the effects of this marriage will occur in Mexico, which does recognize same-sex marriage,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cRather,\" he added, \u201cit is the Guatemalan lawmakers who are violating sovereignty, by interfering in Mexico\u2019s affairs and trying to tell them what they can or cannot do. That seems far more discourteous.\u201d",

      "BAMAKO, Mali -- BAMAKO, Mali (AP) \u2014 Malian security forces clashed with members of an armed separatist group over two days, resulting in the deaths of 10 separatists, the Malian army said Friday. The Azawad separatists said it killed dozens of Malian soldiers and members of a Kremlin-controlled armed force.",
      "The clashes began with a military offensive in the northern Kidal region on Thursday, the Malian army said in a statement. On Friday, the Malian military's logistics convoy was ambushed before the attack was repelled, it added.",
      "The separatists reported they killed \u201cdozens\u201d of Malian soldiers and fighters with the Kremlin-controlled African Corps in the ambush.",
      "The Azawad separatist movement has been fighting for years to create the state of Azawad in northern Mali. They once drove security forces out of the region before a 2015 peace deal that has since collapsed was signed to pave the way for some ex-rebels to be integrated into the Malian military.",
      "\u201cWe recovered 12 trucks loaded with cereals, tankers full of diesel, one military pickup, and one armored vehicles from the 30 vehicles in the convoy,\u201d Mohamed Maouloud Ramadan, spokesman for the Azawad separatists, said in a statement that acknowledged the death of three of their members.",
      "Viral videos shared by the separatists showed military trucks on fire in a large swathe of desert land amid gunfire as gun-wielding hooded young men posed in front of the trucks. The videos also showed bodies with uniforms that resemble those of the Malian army. The Associated Press could not independently verify the videos.",
      "The latest clashes show how difficult it is for security forces in Mali to operate in difficult terrains like Kidal, according to Rida Lyammouri, a Sahel expert at the Morocco-based Policy Center for the New South think tank.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to gather actionable intelligence to protect their convoys, and this gives a significant advantage to armed and jihadist groups\u201d, said Lyammouri.",
      "The latest attack occurred days after Russia\u2019s mercenary group Wagner \u2013 which for more than three years helped Malian security forces in the fight against armed groups \u2013 announced it was leaving the country. The Africa Corps, under the direct command of the Russian defense ministry, said it will remain in Mali.",
      "There are around 2,000 mercenaries in Mali, according to U.S. officials. It is unclear how many are with Wagner and how many are part of the Africa Corps.",

      "The 18-carat fully functioning toilet was on display as a piece of contemporary art at Blenheim Palace \u2014 the country mansion where British wartime leader Winston Churchill was born \u2014 when five burglars smashed a window and yanked it from its plumbing in a brazen early morning raid in September 2019. It was never recovered and was believed to have been chopped up and sold.",

      "Michael Jones, 39, who worked for Sheen and was convicted of burglary at trial, was sentenced to two years and three months.",
      "The toilet weighed just over 215 pounds (98 kilograms) and was worth more than its weight in gold. The value of the gold at the time was 2.8 million ($3.5 million), but it was insured for 4.7 million pounds (more than $6 million).",
      "The toilet was part of a satirical commentary on consumer culture, titled \u201cAmerica,\u201d by Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan, whose work of a banana duct-taped to a wall was sold in 2024 for $6.2 million at auction in New York.",

      "Ramaphosa's visit will come amid criticism of authorities' early response to the disaster, which was caused by an extreme weather front that brought heavy rain, strong winds and even snow to parts of the province. Forecasters warned about the extreme weather last week.",
      "The head of the provincial government said the rescue effort was \u201cparalyzed\u201d in the first few hours after the floods because of a lack of resources like specialized search and rescue teams, divers and K-9 dog units in one of the country's poorest regions.",

      "The new prime minister of Mongolia has pledged to address the economic demands of protesters after their daily rallies led to the fall of his predecessor",
      "ULAANBAATAR, Mongolia -- The new prime minister of Mongolia has pledged to address the economic demands of protesters after their daily rallies led to the fall of his predecessor.",
      "Lawmakers approved former parliament speaker Zandanshatar Gombojav as prime minister by an overwhelming majority in a vote late Thursday night.",
      "His election appeared to mark the end of several weeks of political uncertainty in a still-young democracy of 3.4 million people that is sandwiched between much larger China and Russia. The new leader faces multiple challenges including high inflation, a looming government budget deficit and fears of power shortages this winter.",
      "Speaking ahead of the vote in parliament, Zandanshatar said this year's government spending needs to be reduced by about $640 million to avoid a significant revenue shortfall.",
      "\u201cRevision of the budget has become inevitable,\u201d the former banker said, saying he would submit a revised budget to parliament next week.",
      "Zandanshatar, 45, studied economics at university in Russia and was vice director of one of the largest commercial banks in Mongolia.",
      "He was parliament speaker from 2020 to 2024 and was named head of the president's office after he lost his seat in an election last year. From 2014-16, he was a visiting scholar at Stanford University in California.",
      "His predecessor, Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai, resigned 10 days ago after losing a vote of confidence in parliament.",
      "The protests against Oyun-Erdene's rule were sparked by reports of lavish spending by his son. Many Mongolians feel the nation's mineral wealth has benefited politicians and their business friends rather than the general population. The poverty rate remains high in the sparsely-populated country.",
      "Zandanshatar said he would ensure that economic growth is inclusive and reached all Mongolians. He promised to launch a tax reform to reduce the burden on the middle class and increase taxes on luxury consumption and those with ultra-high incomes.",
      "He won election by a vote of 108 to 9 in the 126-member parliament. The other nine members were absent.",

      "Pope Leo XIV has made waves with some of his fashion choices, returning to much of the traditional pomp of popes past",
      "VATICAN CITY -- When Pope Leo XIV stepped out on the central loggia of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica to greet the crowd for the first time after his May 8 election, liturgical fashion aficionados around the globe took note: Gone was the simple white cassock and silver cross favored by Pope Francis. Back was the red satin mozzetta shoulder cape, the burgundy stola with gold embroidery and a gold cross held by a double-stranded silken gold cord.",
      "Over Leo\u2019s first few weeks, the excitement grew among liturgical fashion-conscious Catholics as they noticed new additions to the wardrobe, or rather a return to the old additions of the papal wardrobe: cufflinks, white pants, lace.",
      "After Francis' revolutionary papacy, Vatican watchers are now wondering if Leo's return to the past sartorial look means a return to the past on other things too, including more substantial policy issues. But for tailors at the elite handful of liturgical tailoring shops in Rome, there is hope that Leo's return to the fancier garb of popes past will mean a boon to business if Leo's traditional look has a trickle-down effect from the pope to priests and all those in between.",
      "According to the Rev. John Wauck, professor of church communication at the Pontifical Holy Cross University in Rome, Leo's clothing choices are a \u201creturn to form,\u201d and his attire similar to that worn by Pope Benedict XVI, Pope John Paul II and other popes going back to the middle ages.",
      "They show \u201ca respect for tradition,\u201d he said.",
      "Such respect for the papal office is important for many conservative Catholics. Many conservatives and traditionalists soured on Francis' informal style and disdain for tradition, which reached its pinnacle with his his crackdown on the old Latin Mass. The old liturgy was celebrated before the modernizing reforms of the 1960s Second Vatican Council; Francis greatly restricted access to the old liturgy, saying it had become a source of division in parishes.",
      "Leo has shown strong familiarity with Latin, and has taken to singing the Sunday noontime prayer in Latin. Some traditionalist Catholics are hoping Leo will take the pro-Latin path even further and reverse Francis to allow greater use of the traditional Latin Mass.",
      "Massimo Faggioli, professor of theology at Villanova University, where Leo went to college, said it's too early to tell if Leo will reverse Francis' reform.",
      "\u201cIt remains to be seen if Leo\u2019s more traditional attire and liturgical style means that he will change Francis\u2019 strong decisions limiting the so-called \u2018Latin Mass,\u2019\" he said.",
      "That said, Faggioli said U.S. conservatives seems particularly happy with Leo\u2019s traditional attire, given Francis\u2019 disdain for the fashion pomp of the papacy.",
      "\u201cIn this sense, Francis might have been a parenthesis or an interlude, more than a changer of the tradition in \u2018papal style,\u2019\u201d he said in an email.",
      "At his inaugural Mass on May 18, 2025, Pope Leo XIV reached out his arm to sprinkle holy water and revealed a shirt with cufflinks, which Francis had largely avoided. He was also wearing an amitto, and an alb held in place by a cingulum. For the non-experts, the amitto is a lacy linen cloth that goes around the neck, the alb is the white tunic worn under the ceremonial vestment, and the cingulum is a braided rope with tassels that serves as a belt.",
      "If it weren\u2019t for photographers\u2019 long lenses relentlessly trained on the pope\u2019s every gesture, Leo\u2019s switch from Francis\u2019s standard black pants to more traditional white papal trousers would have gone completely unnoticed.",
      "In addition to the clothing changes, Leo has returned to some other traditions of the Vatican that Francis eschewed.",
      "He has shown himself willing to accept the traditional \u201cbaciamano\u201d or kissing of his ring. Francis disliked having his ring kissed and often pulled his hand away if someone tried to kiss it.",
      "\u201cI think that what we see with Pope Leo is a willingness to embrace tradition, even if it risks seeming perhaps more formal than Pope Francis,\u201d Wauck said. The idea is that \u201cseeing that tradition as a treasure to be conserved and embraced as opposed to something that makes one feel perhaps a little bit standoffish.\u201d",
      "It remains to be seen whether Leo will move into the papal apartment in the Apostolic Palace, which stood empty during the 12-year Francis papacy. Francis shocked the world by choosing to live in a small room at the Santa Marta residence at the Vatican, eating his meals in the common dining room.",
      "For the Rev. Castro Prudencio, this is all much ado about nothing. \"For Pope Francis it was simplicity. Always. And Pope Leo has taken up what Pope Benedict had and many others. That is what the church is like,\u201d he said.",

      "Canada is hosting a Group of Seven meeting that will include U.S. President Donald Trump, who is waging a trade war against America\u2019s allies",
      "TORONTO -- U.S. President Donald Trump will arrive Sunday for a Group of Seven summit in a country he has suggested should be annexed and as he wages a trade war with America\u2019s longstanding allies.",
      "Trump\u2019s calls to make Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, and Prime Minister Mark Carney, who won his office by pledging to confront the U.S. president\u2019s increased aggression, now hosts the G7 summit.",
      "Carney asserted this week that Washington no longer plays a predominant role on the world stage, imposing tariffs for access to its markets and reducing its contributions to collective security.",
      "Carney has decided to abandon the annual practice of issuing a lengthy joint statement, or communiqu\u00e9, at the summit\u2019s conclusion as French President Emmanuel Macron did at the G7 summit in France in 2019.",
      "The document typically outlines the consensus reached by leaders on summit issues and provides a roadmap for how they plan to tackle them.",
      "Trump roiled the 2017 meeting in Italy over the climate change passage in that summit\u2019s final statement. He then withdrew his support from the 2018 communiqu\u00e9 after complaining he had been slighted by then Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the host that year.",
      "The leaders of the world's richest countries begin arriving Sunday in the resort town of Kananaskis, Alberta in the Canadian Rockies.",
      "The Group of Seven comprises Canada, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, Germany and Britain. The European Union also attends as well as other heads of state who are not part of the G7 but have been invited by Carney.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will attend and is expected to meet with Trump, a reunion coming just months after their contentious Oval Office encounter, which laid bare the risks of having a meeting with the U.S. president.",
      "Other world leaders will be meeting with Trump both in a group setting and for bilateral talks, which are often precarious as foreign leaders must navigate between placating and confronting him.",
      "\u201cAnything could happen. The Canadians would be crazy not to anticipate something. We can\u2019t tell. That\u2019s Trump stock and trade. He likes to keep everyone guessing,\u201d said Robert Bothwell, a University of Toronto professor of Canadian history and international relations.",
      "\u201cIt all depends what kind of theater he\u2019s going to want to have,\u201d he said.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum will attend and said she expects to have her first in-person meeting with Trump. On his way to Canada, Macron is making a notable stop in Greenland, the semi autonomous Danish territory that the U.S. president has also suggested annexing.",
      "Among the other newcomers are German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.",
      "Starmer will meet with Carney on Saturday in Ottawa before flying to Alberta.",
      "Carney also invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, despite accusations from Canada's national police force that agents of Modi's government were involved in \u201cwidespread\u201d violence in Canada.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler, was invited but will not attend.",
      "The 2018 G7 summit in Quebec was thrown into disarray after Trump called Trudeau \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cweak,\" while complaining that he had been blindsided by Trudeau\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s tariff threats at a summit-ending news conference. Trump pulled out of the G7 group statement just as it was released.",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t too happy because we thought we managed to pull off a pretty good summit,\u201d said Peter Boehm, Canada\u2019s deputy minister for the Quebec summit.\" The reaction \u2014 and I was with Mr. Trudeau at the time \u2014 was a bit of disbelief.\"",
      "Boehm expects a chair's summary from Carney this year instead of a joint statement from the leaders.",
      "During the Quebec summit, Trump also insisted on Russia's readmission to the elite group, from which it was ousted in 2014 following President Vladimir Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea.",
      "\u201cTrump raised that at the foreign policy dinner,\" Boehm recalled. \u201cIt was a bit awkward because British Prime Minister Theresa May was there and some British citizens had just been killed by Russian operatives using a toxic agent.\u201d",
      "Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were targeted in a nerve agent attack a few months before the Quebec summit in the English city of Salisbury.",
      "U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra has said that Carney has been quietly holding direct talks with Trump about a trade deal in the lead up to the summit. Separately, top Canadian cabinet ministers have also been in Washington for negotiations in recent weeks.",
      "Trade tensions may be unavoidable. The United States runs trade deficits with all G7 countries except the United Kingdom. In an effort to balance what he describes as America\u2019s lopsided trade relations, Trump has imposed 10% import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on almost every country in the world. He also announced bigger tariffs, then suspended them, on countries that sell more to the United States than they buy.",
      "\u201cThe big X Factor (is) the looming tariffs,\u201d said Max Bergmann of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe G7 is supposed to provide global economic governance. And the way the Europeans see it right now is that the country that\u2019s the source of major instability in global economic affairs is the United States.\u2019\u2019",
      "Trump\u2019s trade wars are already threatening the world economy. The World Bank on Tuesday sharply downgraded its forecast for global economic growth this year, citing \u201ca substantial rise in trade barriers.\u2019\u2019",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte will attend the G7 meeting ahead of this month's NATO summit and has said most U.S. allies in the alliance endorse Trump\u2019s demand that they invest 5% of gross domestic product on their defense needs.",
      "Carney said this week Canada would meet NATO's current 2% target but seemed to suggest he would not support 5%, saying his goal is to protect Canadians, and not to satisfy NATO accountants.",
      "Law enforcement overseeing security expect large protests but say protesters won't be able to get anywhere near Kananaskis, as access roads to the summit will be closed to the public.",
      "The Mounties say there will be designated G7 demonstration zones in Calgary and Banff, Alberta that will have live audio and video feeds, which will be broadcast to G7 leaders and delegations at the summit. Kananaskis also hosted a G8 summit in 2002.",

    "story": [
      "Israel attacked Iran nuclear and military sites on Friday as tensions reached new heights over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Israel attacked multiple Iranian nuclear and military sites on Friday as tensions reached new heights over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program.",
      "Israeli leaders said the attack was necessary to head off what they claimed was an imminent threat that Iran would build nuclear bombs. Iran long has insisted its program is peaceful and U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Tehran was not actively pursuing the bomb.",
      "The attack came one day after the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors censured Iran for the first time in 20 years for not working with its inspectors. Iran immediately announced it would establish a third enrichment site in the country and swap out some centrifuges for more-advanced ones.",
      "The U.S. and Iran had been in talks that could have resulted in the U.S. lifting some of its crushing economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran drastically limiting or ending its enrichment of uranium.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some major Iranian sites and their importance in Tehran\u2019s program.",
      "Iran\u2019s nuclear facility at Natanz, located some 220 kilometers (135 miles) southeast of Tehran, is the country\u2019s main enrichment site.",
      "Part of the facility on Iran\u2019s Central Plateau is underground to defend against potential airstrikes. It operates multiple cascades, or groups of centrifuges working together to more quickly enrich uranium.",
      "Iran also is burrowing into the K\u016bh-e Kolang Gaz L\u0101, or Pickax Mountain, which is just beyond Natanz\u2019s southern fencing. Natanz has been targeted by the Stuxnet virus, believed to be an Israeli and American creation, which destroyed Iranian centrifuges. Two separate sabotage attacks, attributed to Israel, also have struck the facility.",
      "Iran\u2019s nuclear facility at Fordo is located some 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Tehran. It also hosts centrifuge cascades, but isn\u2019t as big a facility as Natanz.",
      "Buried under a mountain and protected by anti-aircraft batteries, Fordo appears designed to withstand airstrikes.",
      "Its construction began at least in 2007, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, although Iran only informed the U.N. nuclear watchdog about the facility in 2009 after the U.S. and allied Western intelligence agencies became aware of its existence.",
      "Iran\u2019s only commercial nuclear power plant is in Bushehr on the Persian Gulf, some 750 kilometers (465 miles) south of Tehran. Construction on the plant began under Iran\u2019s Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in the mid-1970s. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the plant was repeatedly targeted in the Iran-Iraq war. Russia later completed construction of the facility.",
      "Iran is building two other reactors like it at the site. Bushehr is fueled by uranium produced in Russia, not Iran, and is monitored by the United Nations\u2019 International Atomic Energy Agency.",
      "The Arak heavy water reactor is 250 kilometers (155 miles) southwest of Tehran. Heavy water helps cool nuclear reactors, but it produces plutonium as a byproduct that can potentially be used in nuclear weapons. That would provide Iran another path to the bomb beyond enriched uranium, should it choose to pursue the weapon. Iran had agreed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to redesign the facility to relieve proliferation concerns.",
      "The facility in Isfahan, some 350 kilometers (215 miles) southeast of Tehran, employs thousands of nuclear scientists. It also is home to three Chinese research reactors and laboratories associated with the country\u2019s atomic program.",
      "The Tehran Research Reactor is at the headquarters of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, the civilian body overseeing the country\u2019s atomic program. The U.S. actually provided Iran the reactor in 1967 as part of America\u2019s \u201cAtoms for Peace\u201d program during the Cold War. It initially required highly enriched uranium but was later retrofitted to use low-enriched uranium over proliferation concerns.",

      "HONG KONG -- China's national security authorities in Hong Kong and the city's police launched their first publicly known joint operation, raiding the homes of six people on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security.",
      "The police\u2019s statement on late Thursday did not disclose the identity of the six people suspected of breaking the 2020 Beijing-imposed national security law between November 2020 and June 2024. Beyond their homes, officers searched the office of the organization involved and seized exhibits such as bank documents and devices for further investigation, according to the statement. The six people were required to surrender their travel documents.",
      "Beijing's national security arm in Hong Kong also had requested assistance from the city\u2019s national security police, including in arranging interviews with the people in the case, the police said. But the local force did not elaborate details of their accusations and which organization it was, saying the investigation was still underway.",
      "Since the 2020 security law took effect, many leading activists have been prosecuted or jailed for national security offenses . Last week, prominent young activist Joshua Wong, who was already convicted and sentenced over a subversion case last year, was charged for the second time under the law. He faces up to life in prison over the fresh charge of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces to endanger national security.",
      "The Beijing and Hong Kong governments insist the law was necessary for returning stability to the city following massive anti-government protests in 2019.",
      "In May, Hong Kong enacted subsidiary legislation for a separate, homegrown national security law, which was passed last year. The subsidiary legislation requires public servants, if requested, to provide all necessary and reasonable assistance to Beijing\u2019s national security office in Hong Kong. Local public servants must offer such help if the office needs to ascertain whether a case involves a special circumstance that could allow it to have jurisdiction over the case.",
      "Over the past week, the Hong Kong authorities have stepped up their national security work as the fifth anniversary of the enactment of the Beijing-imposed law neared, including targeting a mobile game application which they accused of advocating armed revolution and promoting secessionist agendas.",

      "President Donald Trump has signed an executive order paving the way for a Nippon Steel investment in U.S. Steel, so long as the Japanese company complies with a \u201cnational security agreement\u201d submitted by the federal government",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order paving the way for a Nippon Steel investment in U.S. Steel, so long as the Japanese company complies with a \u201cnational security agreement\u201d submitted by the federal government.",
      "Trump's order didn\u2019t detail the terms of the national security agreement.",
      "But the iconic American steelmaker and Nippon Steel said in a joint statement that the agreement stipulates that approximately $11 billion in new investments will be made by 2028 and includes giving the U.S. government a \u201c golden share \" \u2014 essentially veto power to ensure the country's national security interests are protected against cutbacks in steel production.",
      "\u201cWe thank President Trump and his Administration for their bold leadership and strong support for our historic partnership,\" the two companies said. \"This partnership will bring a massive investment that will support our communities and families for generations to come. We look forward to putting our commitments into action to make American steelmaking and manufacturing great again.\u201d",
      "The companies have completed a U.S. Department of Justice review and received all necessary regulatory approvals, the statement said.",
      "\u201cThe partnership is expected to be finalized promptly,\u201d the statement said.",
      "U.S. Steel rose $2.66, or 5%, to $54.85 in afterhours trading Friday. Nippon Steel's original bid to buy the Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel in late 2023 had been valued at $55 per share.",
      "The companies offered few details on how the golden share would work, what other provisions are in the national security agreement and how specifically the $11 billion would be spent.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said the order \u201censures U.S. Steel will remain in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and be safeguarded as a critical element of America\u2019s national and economic security.\u201d",
      "James Brower, a Morrison Foerster lawyer who represents clients in national security-related matters, said such agreements with the government typically are not disclosed to the public, particularly by the government.",
      "They can become public, but it's almost always disclosed by a party in the transaction, such as a company \u2014 like U.S. Steel \u2014 that is publicly held, Brower said.",
      "The mechanics of how a golden share would work will depend on the national security agreement, but in such agreements it isn't unusual to give the government approval rights over specific activities, Brower said.",
      "U.S. Steel made no filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.",
      "Nippon Steel originally offered nearly $15 billion to purchase U.S. Steel in an acquisition that had been delayed on national security concerns starting during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.",
      "As it sought to win over American officials, Nippon Steel gradually increased the amount of money it was pledging to invest into U.S. Steel. American officials now value the transaction at $28 billion, including the purchase bid and a new electric arc furnace \u2014 a more modern steel mill that melts down scrap \u2014 that they say Nippon Steel will build in the U.S. after 2028.",
      "Nippon Steel had pledged to maintain U.S. Steel\u2019s headquarters in Pittsburgh, put U.S. Steel under a board with a majority of American citizens and keep plants operating.",
      "It also said it would protect the interests of U.S. Steel in trade matters and it wouldn\u2019t import steel slabs that would compete with U.S. Steel\u2019s blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana.",
      "Trump opposed the purchase while campaigning for the White House, and using his authority Biden blocked the transaction on his way out of the White House. But Trump expressed openness to working out an arrangement once he returned to the White House in January.",
      "Trump said Thursday that he would as president have \u201ctotal control\u201d of what U.S. Steel did as part of the investment.",
      "Trump said then that the deal would preserve \u201c51% ownership by Americans,\u201d although Nippon Steel has never backed off its stated intention of buying and controlling U.S. Steel as a wholly owned subsidiary.",
      "\u201cWe have a golden share, which I control,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump added that he was \u201ca little concerned\u201d about what presidents other than him would do with their golden share, \u201cbut that gives you total control.\u201d",
      "The proposed merger had been under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, during the Trump and Biden administrations.",
      "The order signed Friday by Trump said the CFIUS review provided \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that Nippon Steel \u201cmight take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States,\u201d but such risks might be \u201cadequately mitigated\u201d by approving the proposed national security agreement.",
      "The order doesn't detail the perceived national security risk and only provides a timeline for the national security agreement. The White House declined to provide details on the terms of the agreement.",
      "The order said the draft agreement was submitted to U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel on Friday. The two companies must successfully execute the agreement as decided by the Treasury Department and other federal agencies that are part CFIUS by the closing date of the transaction.",
      "Trump reserves the authority to issue further actions regarding the investment as part of the order he signed on Friday.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Consumer sentiment increased in June for the first time in six months, the latest sign that Americans\u2019 views of the economy have improved as inflation has stayed tame and the Trump administration has reached a truce in its trade fight with China.",
      "The preliminary reading of the University of Michigan\u2019s closely watched consumer sentiment index, released Friday, jumped 16% from 52.2 to 60.5. The large increase followed steady drops that left the preliminary number last month at the second-lowest level in the nearly 75-year history of the survey. Consumer sentiment is still down 20% compared with December 2024.",

      "Americans have largely taken a darker view of the economy\u2019s future after President Donald Trump unleashed a wide-ranging trade war, imposing steep tariffs on China, the European Union, and dozens of other countries. Yet in April Trump postponed a set of sweeping tariffs on about 60 nations and last month reached a temporary truce with China, after both sides had sharply ratcheted up tariffs on each other.",
      "The Conference Board's consumer confidence index, released in late May, also increased after five straight declines that were linked to anxiety over tariffs.",
      "U.S. duties remain elevated compared with historical levels, but so far they have not worsened overall inflation. Prices rose just 2.4% in May compared with a year ago, up slightly from 2.3% in April. Still, most economists expect tariffs to hit harder in the coming months.",

      "BRUSSELS -- Less than two weeks before a NATO summit, Sweden and the Netherlands said Friday that they intend to increase defense spending to 5% of their gross domestic product, in line with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s demands.",
      "Trump and his NATO counterparts meet for a summit in the Netherlands on June 24-25, where they\u2019re due to agree a new defense spending target. He insists that Europe must look after its own security, while Washington focuses on China and its own borders.",

      "\u201cWe are in a specific geographical situation where we need to meet the future threats from Russia,\u201d Kristersson told reporters in Stockholm, standing alongside NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.",
      "After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, NATO's 32 allies agreed to spend at least 2% of GDP on their military budgets. But NATO\u2019s new plans for defending Europe and North America against a Russian attack require investment of at least 3%.",
      "The aim now is to raise the bar to 3.5% for core defense spending on tanks, warplanes, air defense, missiles and hiring extra troops. A further 1.5% would be spent on things like roads, bridges, ports and airfields so armies can deploy more quickly, as well as preparing societies for possible attack.",
      "According to the most recent NATO figures, Sweden was estimated to have spent 2.25% of its GDP on defense last year. The Netherlands spent 2.06%, among 22 of the 32 allies who reached NATO\u2019s old benchmark.",

      "In landlocked Arizona, where the Colorado River crisis has put water use under a microscope, a new inland desert fish farm is growing barramundi \u2014 a tropical species native to Australia",
      "DATELAND, Ariz. -- Storks scatter, white against blue water, as Dan Mohring's pickup truck rumbles down the dirt road. He's towing a trailer full of ground-up beef, chicken, fish and nutrient bits behind him, ready to be shot out of a cannon into the ponds below.",
      "It's time to feed the fish.",
      "Mohring fires up the machine and the food flies out in a rainbow arc. Then the water comes alive. Hundreds of thrashing, gobbling barramundi wiggle their way to the surface, all fighting for a piece. Until, in a few months, they will become food themselves.",
      "In the desert of landlocked Arizona, where the Colorado River crisis has put water use under a microscope, Mainstream Aquaculture has a fish farm where it's growing the tropical species barramundi, also known as Asian sea bass, for American restaurants.",
      "Mainstream sees it as a sustainable alternative to ocean-caught seafood. They say chefs and conscious consumers like that the food has a shorter distance to travel, eliminating some of the pollution that comes from massive ships that move products around the world. And they and some aquaculture experts argue it's efficient to use the water twice, since the nutrient-rich leftovers can irrigate crops like Bermuda grass sold for livestock feed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the business of water,\u201d said Matt Mangan, head of Australia-based Mainstream\u2019s American business. \u201cWe want to be here in 20 years', 30 years' time.\u201d",
      "But some experts question whether growing fish on a large scale in an arid region can work without high environmental costs.",
      "That question comes down to what people collectively decide is a good use of water. In Arizona, some places manage water more aggressively than others. But the whole state is dealing with the impacts of climate change, which is making the region drier and water only more precious.",
      "The farm uses groundwater, not Colorado River water. It's a nonrenewable resource, and like mining, different people and industries have different philosophies about whether it should be extracted.",
      "\u201cAs long as groundwater is treated as an open resource in these rural parts of Arizona, they\u2019re susceptible to new industries coming in and using the groundwater for that industry,\u201d said Sarah Porter, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University's Morrison Institute.",
      "Some scientists believe aquaculture can play a role in protecting wild ocean ecosystems from overfishing. And it might play at least a small role in smoothing any supply problems that result from the Trump administration's tariffs on imports from dozens of countries, including those that send the U.S. about 80% of its seafood, per the United States Department of Agriculture.",
      "In the greenhouses at University of Arizona professor Kevin Fitzsimmons' lab in Tucson, tilapia circle idly in tanks that filter down into tubs full of mussels and floating patches of collard greens and lettuce. Fitzsimmons mentored the student who started the tilapia farm eventually bought by Mainstream about three years ago where they now raise barramundi.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think desert agriculture is going away,\" he said. \u201cObviously, we want to do it as water-efficient as possible.\"",
      "But not everyone agrees it's possible.",
      "\u201cArtificial ponds in the desert are stupid,\u201d said Jay Famiglietti, a professor at ASU and director of science for the Arizona Water Innovation Initiative. He worried about heavy water losses to evaporation.",
      "Mangan says that evaporation hasn't been an issue so much as the loss of heat in the wintertime. That has required pumping more water since its warmth when it arrives at the surface helps keep the barramundi cozy. But Mangan says they've been improving pond design to retain heat better and have found, after the last year of research and development, that they can cut their water requirement by about half as a result.",
      "Plus, he argues, the water coming out of the fish ponds is \"essentially liquid fertilizer,\" and though it's slightly salty, they use it for crops that can tolerate it, like Bermuda grass dairy cows can eat.",
      "But that's supporting the cattle industry, which contributes more than its share of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, Famiglietti said.",
      "\u201cDoing two suboptimal things doesn't make it better,\u201d he said.",
      "Purple flowers sprout alongside paddle wheels. Fish bones crunch underfoot. The faint odor of brackish water and ammonia catches in the breeze.",
      "Without groundwater, none of it would be possible.",
      "Some farmers in Arizona rely on water from the Colorado River, but many others use well water to irrigate crops like alfalfa for the dairy industry or the lettuce, cucumbers and melons shipped nationwide year-round.",
      "Arizona has seven areas around the state where groundwater is rigorously managed. Dateland doesn't fall into one of those, so the only rule that really governs it is a law saying if you land own there, you can pump a \u201creasonable\u201d amount of groundwater, said Rhett Larson, who teaches water law at ASU.",
      "What might be considered \u201creasonable\u201d depends from crop to crop, and there's really no precedent for aquaculture, an industry that hasn't yet spread commercially statewide.",
      "Using numbers provided by Mainstream, Porter calculated that the fish farm would demand a \u201cvery large amount\u201d of water, on par with a big ranch or potentially even more than some suburbs of Phoenix. And she noted that although the water use is being maximized by using it twice, it's still depleting the aquifer.",
      "When the company scoped out Arizona to expand, Mangan said they didn\u2019t see nearly the same kinds of regulations as back in Australia.",
      "As part of its growth strategy, Mainstream is also hoping to work with other farmers in the area so more can use nutrient-rich fish pond wastewater to produce hay. They say a few have expressed interest.",
      "The seafood industry needs to reduce its reliance on catching small wild fish to feed bigger farmed ones that humans eat, said Pallab Sarker, an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who studies sustainability in the aquaculture industry. He said seabirds and mammals rely on small species like anchovies and mackerel commonly used in fish meal.",
      "\u201cWe should not rely on ocean fish to grow fish for aquaculture to meet the demand for humans,\u201d Sarker said.",
      "Mainstream gets its fish feed from two suppliers, Skretting and Star Milling, but Mangan and Mohring said they didn't know for certain where those suppliers got their base ingredients from.",
      "Fitzsimmons, of the University of Arizona, also pointed out that between pollution, overfishing and oceanfront development for recreation, the commercial fishing industry had already been facing problems. He doesn't think that Trump's moves this spring to open up marine protected areas for commercial fishing will improve that situation the way aquaculture could.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t keep hunting and gathering from the ocean,\u201d Fitzsimmons said.",

      "Shares of Brazilian meat giant JBS began trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, falling about 3%",
      "Shares of Brazilian meat giant JBS fell nearly 3% in morning trading as they made their debut Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.",
      "Trading in New York is a long-held goal for JBS, which was founded 72 years ago and is now one of the world's largest meat companies. Half of its annual revenue comes from the U.S., where it has more than 72,000 employees. JBS is America\u2019s top beef producer and its second-largest producer of poultry and pork.",
      "JBS's minority shareholders voted last month to approve the company's plan to list its shares both in Sao Paulo and New York, casting aside opposition from environmental groups, U.S. lawmakers and others who noted JBS\u2019 record of corruption, monopolistic behavior and environmental destruction.",
      "JBS said a dual listing would give it broader access to investors and more competitive interest rates, which would help it finance its growth. It has also said a U.S. listing would subject it to more oversight from regulators. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved JBS's planned listing last month.",
      "Still, the proposed listing has received significant pushback. Earlier this week, Mighty Earth, an environmental group, said it sent a letter to the NYSE board urging it to decline the listing. Mighty Earth contends that JBS is illegally profiting from deforested land in Brazil.",
      "Glass Lewis, an influential independent investor advisory firm, was also among those recommending that JBS's shareholders reject the planned listing.",
      "In its report, Glass Lewis said the recent return of brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista to the JBS board should concern investors. The brothers, who are the sons of JBS\u2019 founder, were briefly jailed in Brazil in 2017 on bribery and corruption charges.",
      "Glass Lewis also objected to the company\u2019s plan for dual share classes, which give the Batistas and other controlling shareholders more voting power.",
      "JBS said the outcome showed shareholders were confident in the benefits a dual listing would bring.",

      "AHMEDABAD, India -- The Air India plane crash this week was one of India\u2019s worst aviation disasters, killing 241 people on board and several people on the ground.",
      "Indian authorities said Friday the investigation into the crash was underway, which is expected to include experts from the plane's maker Boeing and U.S. aviation regulators.",
      "The Air India plane crashed minutes after takeoff Thursday afternoon in the northwestern city of Ahmedabad. Surreal images captured both the plane's last moments and the horror of the crash site, with rescuers picking through smoking debris as they searched for survivors.",
      "Here's what is known about the crash:",
      "The lone survivor was a passenger, Vishwashkumar Ramesh, a British national of Indian origin.",
      "Ramesh was thrown from the aircraft and walked to an ambulance, according to Dr. Dhaval Gameti, who treated Ramesh. The doctor told The Associated Press that Ramesh was disoriented, with multiple injuries, but that he seemed to be out of danger.",
      "Another medic said Ramesh told him that immediately after the plane took off, it began descending and suddenly split in two, throwing him out before a loud explosion.",
      "The airline said there were no other survivors among the 242 passengers and crew on board.",
      "Security camera footage verified by The Associated Press showed the plane taking off and then veering slightly to the side. It then drops into a downward glide, disappears briefly from sight and hits the ground.",
      "Moments later, a huge orange and black fireball appears, rising high into the air.",
      "At the crash site, the tail cone of the aircraft with damaged stabilizer fins still attached was lodged near the top of a building. The plane's jagged cavity has torn into the facade. A web of cracks spirals outward from the plane's impact.",
      "The battered building in Ahmedabad was the dining area for medical students, and they were having lunch when the plane crashed.",
      "Indrajeet Singh Solanki, an eyewitness and rescuer, said that at first it was chaotic, smoke everywhere.",
      "\"We could see some small parts (of the plane) burning. Just like this wing lying over here,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough the smoke, we kept rescuing injured people and rushed them to the trauma center in the civil hospital in auto rickshaws. We rushed nine people to the hospital.\u201d",
      "The airline had been plagued by tragedy and financial losses under prior state ownership.",
      "In 2010, an Air India flight arriving from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, overshot the runway in Mangalore, India, and plunged over a cliff, killing 158 of the 166 people on board. In 2020, a flight for the Air India Express subsidiary skidded off a runway in southern India during heavy rain and cracked in two \u2014 killing 18 people and injuring more than 120 others.",
      "An Air India Boeing 747 flight crashed into the Arabian Sea in 1978, killing all 213 aboard.",
      "The carrier was under government control from 1953 through 2022.",
      "The Boeing 787 went into service in 2009. This was the first crash of the model, according to the Aviation Safety Network database.",
      "The 787 Dreamliner was the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium ion batteries, which are lighter, recharge faster and can hold more energy than other types of batteries. In 2013 the 787 fleet was temporarily grounded because of overheating of its lithium-ion batteries, which in some cases sparked fires.",
      "There was no information yet about possible causes of the crash. Authorities were searching the crash site Friday as part of the investigation, and there was no word whether the plane's black boxes \u2014 the flight data and cockpit voice recorders \u2014 had been recovered.",

      "Canada is hosting a Group of Seven meeting that will include U.S. President Donald Trump, who is waging a trade war against America\u2019s allies",
      "TORONTO -- U.S. President Donald Trump will arrive Sunday for a Group of Seven summit in a country he has suggested should be annexed and as he wages a trade war with America\u2019s longstanding allies.",
      "Trump\u2019s calls to make Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, and Prime Minister Mark Carney, who won his office by pledging to confront the U.S. president\u2019s increased aggression, now hosts the G7 summit.",
      "Carney asserted this week that Washington no longer plays a predominant role on the world stage, imposing tariffs for access to its markets and reducing its contributions to collective security.",
      "Carney has decided to abandon the annual practice of issuing a lengthy joint statement, or communiqu\u00e9, at the summit\u2019s conclusion as French President Emmanuel Macron did at the G7 summit in France in 2019.",
      "The document typically outlines the consensus reached by leaders on summit issues and provides a roadmap for how they plan to tackle them.",
      "Trump roiled the 2017 meeting in Italy over the climate change passage in that summit\u2019s final statement. He then withdrew his support from the 2018 communiqu\u00e9 after complaining he had been slighted by then Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the host that year.",
      "The leaders of the world's richest countries begin arriving Sunday in the resort town of Kananaskis, Alberta in the Canadian Rockies.",
      "The Group of Seven comprises Canada, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, Germany and Britain. The European Union also attends as well as other heads of state who are not part of the G7 but have been invited by Carney.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will attend and is expected to meet with Trump, a reunion coming just months after their contentious Oval Office encounter, which laid bare the risks of having a meeting with the U.S. president.",
      "Other world leaders will be meeting with Trump both in a group setting and for bilateral talks, which are often precarious as foreign leaders must navigate between placating and confronting him.",
      "\u201cAnything could happen. The Canadians would be crazy not to anticipate something. We can\u2019t tell. That\u2019s Trump stock and trade. He likes to keep everyone guessing,\u201d said Robert Bothwell, a University of Toronto professor of Canadian history and international relations.",
      "\u201cIt all depends what kind of theater he\u2019s going to want to have,\u201d he said.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum will attend and said she expects to have her first in-person meeting with Trump. On his way to Canada, Macron is making a notable stop in Greenland, the semi autonomous Danish territory that the U.S. president has also suggested annexing.",
      "Among the other newcomers are German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.",
      "Starmer will meet with Carney on Saturday in Ottawa before flying to Alberta.",
      "Carney also invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, despite accusations from Canada's national police force that agents of Modi's government were involved in \u201cwidespread\u201d violence in Canada.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler, was invited but will not attend.",
      "The 2018 G7 summit in Quebec was thrown into disarray after Trump called Trudeau \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cweak,\" while complaining that he had been blindsided by Trudeau\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s tariff threats at a summit-ending news conference. Trump pulled out of the G7 group statement just as it was released.",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t too happy because we thought we managed to pull off a pretty good summit,\u201d said Peter Boehm, Canada\u2019s deputy minister for the Quebec summit.\" The reaction \u2014 and I was with Mr. Trudeau at the time \u2014 was a bit of disbelief.\"",
      "Boehm expects a chair's summary from Carney this year instead of a joint statement from the leaders.",
      "During the Quebec summit, Trump also insisted on Russia's readmission to the elite group, from which it was ousted in 2014 following President Vladimir Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea.",
      "\u201cTrump raised that at the foreign policy dinner,\" Boehm recalled. \u201cIt was a bit awkward because British Prime Minister Theresa May was there and some British citizens had just been killed by Russian operatives using a toxic agent.\u201d",
      "Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were targeted in a nerve agent attack a few months before the Quebec summit in the English city of Salisbury.",
      "U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra has said that Carney has been quietly holding direct talks with Trump about a trade deal in the lead up to the summit. Separately, top Canadian cabinet ministers have also been in Washington for negotiations in recent weeks.",
      "Trade tensions may be unavoidable. The United States runs trade deficits with all G7 countries except the United Kingdom. In an effort to balance what he describes as America\u2019s lopsided trade relations, Trump has imposed 10% import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on almost every country in the world. He also announced bigger tariffs, then suspended them, on countries that sell more to the United States than they buy.",
      "\u201cThe big X Factor (is) the looming tariffs,\u201d said Max Bergmann of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe G7 is supposed to provide global economic governance. And the way the Europeans see it right now is that the country that\u2019s the source of major instability in global economic affairs is the United States.\u2019\u2019",
      "Trump\u2019s trade wars are already threatening the world economy. The World Bank on Tuesday sharply downgraded its forecast for global economic growth this year, citing \u201ca substantial rise in trade barriers.\u2019\u2019",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte will attend the G7 meeting ahead of this month's NATO summit and has said most U.S. allies in the alliance endorse Trump\u2019s demand that they invest 5% of gross domestic product on their defense needs.",
      "Carney said this week Canada would meet NATO's current 2% target but seemed to suggest he would not support 5%, saying his goal is to protect Canadians, and not to satisfy NATO accountants.",
      "Law enforcement overseeing security expect large protests but say protesters won't be able to get anywhere near Kananaskis, as access roads to the summit will be closed to the public.",
      "The Mounties say there will be designated G7 demonstration zones in Calgary and Banff, Alberta that will have live audio and video feeds, which will be broadcast to G7 leaders and delegations at the summit. Kananaskis also hosted a G8 summit in 2002.",

      "The plane hit a building hosting a medical college hostel and burst into flames, killing several students, in the city that is the capital of Gujarat, Modi\u2019s home state.",
      "\u201cWe are all devastated by the air tragedy in Ahmedabad. The loss of so many lives in such a sudden and heartbreaking manner is beyond words,\u201d Modi said on social media after visiting the site. \u201cWe understand their pain and also know that the void left behind will be felt for years to come.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Phuket International Airport in southern Thailand said Friday it received a report that a pilot of Air India flight AI 379, which was bound for New Delhi, found a bomb threat message shortly after the morning flight took off.",
      "The plane requested an emergency landing back at Phuket and all 156 passengers were evacuated before authorities began an inspection of the plane, the airport said. The inspection results were not immediately announced.",
      "The survivor was seen in television footage meeting Modi at the government hospital where he was being treated for burns and other injuries.",
      "Viswashkumar Ramesh told India's national broadcaster he still can\u2019t believe he was alive. He said the aircraft seemed to become stuck immediately after takeoff. He said then the lights came on, and right after that it accelerated but seemed unable to gain height before it crashed.",
      "He said the side of the plane where he was seated fell onto the ground floor of a building and there was space for him to escape after the door broke open. He unfastened his seat belt and forced himself out of the plane.",
      "\u201cWhen I opened my eyes, I realized I was alive,\u201d he said.",

      "Besides the inflation data, a separate report on jobless claims also helped to weigh on Treasury yields. It said slightly more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits  last week than economists expected, and the total number remained at the highest level in eight months. That could be an indication of a rise in layoffs.",

      "More recently, the growing commercialization of AI large language models \u2014 the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Meta's Llama \u2014 brought a new market for Scale's annotation teams. The company claims to service \u201cevery leading large language model,\u201d including from Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta and Microsoft, by helping to fine tune their training data and test their performance. It's not clear what the Meta deal will mean for Scale's other customers.",
      "Wang has also sought to build close relationships with the U.S. government, winning military contracts to supply AI tools to the Pentagon and attending President Donald Trump's inauguration. The head of Trump's science and technology office, Michael Kratsios, was an executive at Scale for the four years between Trump's first and second terms. Meta has also begun providing AI services to the federal government.",
      "Meta has taken a different approach to AI than many of its rivals, releasing its flagship Llama system for free as an open-source product that enables people to use and modify some of its key components. Meta says more than a billion people use its AI products each month, but it's also widely seen as lagging behind competitors such as OpenAI and Google in encouraging consumer use of large language models, also known as LLMs.",
      "It hasn't yet released its purportedly most advanced model, Llama 4 Behemoth, despite previewing it in April as \"one of the smartest LLMs in the world and our most powerful yet.\u201d",
      "Meta's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, who in 2019 was a winner of computer science's top prize for his pioneering AI work, has expressed skepticism about the tech industry's current focus on large language models.",
      "\u201cHow do we build AI systems that understand the physical world, that have persistent memory, that can reason and can plan?\u201d LeCun asked at a French tech conference last year.",
      "These are all characteristics of intelligent behavior that large language models \u201cbasically cannot do, or they can only do them in a very superficial, approximate way,\u201d LeCun said.",
      "Instead, he emphasized Meta's interest in \u201ctracing a path towards human-level AI systems, or perhaps even superhuman.\u201d When he returned to France's annual VivaTech conference again on Wednesday, LeCun dodged a question about the pending Scale deal but said his AI research team's plan has \u201calways been to reach human intelligence and go beyond it.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just that now we have a clearer vision for how to accomplish this,\u201d he said.",
      "LeCun co-founded Meta's AI research division more than a decade ago with Rob Fergus, a fellow professor at New York University. Fergus later left for Google but returned to Meta last month after a 5-year absence to run the research lab, replacing longtime director Joelle Pineau.",
      "Fergus wrote on LinkedIn last month that Meta's commitment to long-term AI research \u201cremains unwavering\u201d and described the work as \u201cbuilding human-level experiences that transform the way we interact with technology.\u201d",

      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday she is investigating whether pharmaceutical giant CVS improperly used customers' personal information to send out text messages lobbying against a proposed state law.",
      "Murrill also said she plans to issue a cease-and-desist letter to the company to stop the messages.",
      "As lawmakers debated a now-failed bill on Wednesday they held up screenshots of text messages sent by CVS.",
      "\u201cLast minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy \u2014 your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,\u201d one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, read.",
      "The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.",
      "The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country\u2019s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.",
      "\u201cThese powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies,\u201d a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report warned.",
      "CVS says on its website that it \u201cnegotiates lower costs for our customers and expands coverage to affordable medications that people need to stay healthy.\u201d",
      "The company's text messages to Louisiana residents included a link to a draft letter urging lawmakers to oppose the legislation that someone could sign with their email address and send to legislators.",
      "\u201cThe proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients\u2019 ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,\u201d the letter read. \u201cThey would also ban the pharmacies that serve patients suffering from complex diseases requiring specialty pharmacy care to manage their life-threatening conditions like organ transplants or cancer. These vulnerable patients cannot afford any disruption to their care \u2013 the consequences would be dire.\u201d",
      "Rep. Dixon McMakin pointed to some of the messages from CVS, saying they were misleading and false. He specifically pointed to ads, that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers \u201cmay shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo we\u2019re not, you liars. Quit being liars. Quit using scare tactics,\u201d McMakin said.",
      "Republican Rep. Bryan Fontenot held up his phone, showing that he, too, had received a text message from CVS.",
      "\u201cIt's in the same text thread (used) to notify when my prescription is filled,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve now taken that to send me political texts.\u201d",
      "CVS sent messages to \u201clarge numbers\" of state employees and their families to lobby against proposed legislation involving the company's pharmaceutical benefits manager, Murrill said in an X post.",
      "Customers gave CVS their phone numbers to receive pharmaceutical information such as vaccine availability or prescription pick-ups but the company is using this personal information \u201cfor their own personal corporate interests against pending legislation,\u201d Murrill told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s not why anybody gave them their phone number.\u201d",
      "Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS, said the texts were the result of a last-minute amendment to the bill Wednesday without an opportunity for a public hearing.",
      "The amendment was crafted behind closed-doors by a conference committee \u2014 a regular practice utilized in the statehouse when the House and Senate cannot agree on final versions of a bill.",
      "\u201cWe believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly,\u201d Thibault said in an email. \u201cOur communication with our customers, patients and members of our community is consistent with law.\u201d",
      "Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has continued to push the bill as the state's legislature concluded Thursday afternoon.",
      "The bill, which proponents said would bolster independent pharmacies and reduce the cost of prescription medications, received overwhelming approval in the House, with a vote of 88-4.",
      "Among those who voted against the measure was Rep. Mandie Landry. The Democrat said that while she wanted to vote in favor, but she was receiving messages from people in her district urging her not to. She said CVS's lobbying had reached them and as a result they feared that they wouldn't be able to access their medications.",
      "\u201cCVS \u2026 you should be so ashamed of this. You are scaring people,\u201d Landry said.",
      "The bill ultimately died with the Senate opting not to take it up in the final hour of the 2025 session.",

    "summary": "China has approved &ldquo;a certain number&rdquo; of export permits for rare earth elements and related items, its commerce ministry spokesman said on Thursday",
    "story": [
      "China has approved \u201ca certain number\u201d of export permits for rare earth elements and related items, its commerce ministry spokesman said on Thursday",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The high-level negotiations over China's export controls of rare earths is giving U.S. businesses some relief, even though it may be only for now.",
      "China has approved \u201ca certain number\u201d of export permits for rare earth elements and related items, its commerce ministry said on Thursday, one day after U.S. President Donald Trump declared that Beijing would supply to the U.S. companies those key elements and the magnets made from them following a two-day trade talk in London.",
      "\u201cI will be one of the happiest people out there if, if in fact, China starts to, to release some of those heavy rare earths and allows them to get into the world economy because the world economy is going to shut down without those heavy rare earths,\u201d said Mark Smith, chief executive officer of NioCorp., which is developing a new mine in Nebraska to produce niobium, scandium, titanium and an assortment of rare earths.",
      "Export controls of the minerals apparently eclipsed tariffs in the latest round of trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington, after China imposed permitting requirements on seven rare earth elements in April, threatening to halt production of cars, robots, wind turbines and other high-tech products in the U.S. and around the world.",
      "Negotiators from the two governments said they reached a framework to move forward, with details yet to be agreed to by Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, but businesses welcomed the developments, even though uncertainties persist.",
      "Rare earth elements are some of the most sought-after critical minerals. Despite the name, they aren't actually rare, but it is hard to find them in high enough concentrations to make mining them economical. They are also difficult to extract from the ore, and China over the past several decades has built dominance in the processing capacity, supplying nearly 90% of the world's rare earths.",
      "In the heat of the tariff war with Trump, Beijing on April 4 announced permitting requirements for seven heavy rare earths: samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium, citing the need to \u201cbetter safeguard national security and interests and to fulfill global duties of non-proliferation.\u201d",
      "The elements China has restricted, such as terbium and dysprosium, are key ingredients needed to make permanent rare earth magnets withstand high temperatures. That is crucial for a variety of uses in electric vehicles, wind turbines and military uses like jet engines and nuclear submarines.",
      "Some of the other rare earths needed for those magnets are produced at the only operating U.S. rare earths mine run by MP Materials in California, but China remains the only source of nearly all of what\u2019s known as the heavy rare earths. MP Materials previously sent the heavy rare earths that it mines to China for processing but it halted that in April amid the tariffs. The company is working to expand its own processing capability as soon as possible, and it is building a new magnet plant in Texas.",
      "Neha Mukherjee, rare earths analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, had previously predicted that most companies wouldn\u2019t start to run short of rare earths until later this year, but it appears some companies already have problems.",
      "\u201cThe overall market stockpile exists, but looks like a lot of OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), especially auto manufacturers, were not prepared, especially in Europe,\u201d Mukherjee said. Some American companies have stockpiled, but they \u201cmight start experiencing constraint if this continues.\u201d",
      "\u201cLooks like most of the stockpile is still in China hence the bottleneck in supply,\u201d Mukherjee said.",
      "On June 4, the European Association of Automotive Supplies said the industry was \u201calready experiencing significant disruption\u201d due to China\u2019s export restrictions on rare earths and magnets. \u201cThese restrictions have led to the shutdown of several production lines and plants across Europe, with further impacts expected in the coming weeks as inventories deplete,\u201d the group said.",
      "Details are still scarce on any agreement on rare earths shipments from China.",
      "On Thursday, He Yadong, spokesman for the Chinese commerce ministry, said China will \u201csufficiently consider the reasonable needs and concerns by all countries in the civilian field\" in reviewing applications of export permits for rare earths and related items.",
      "He said that it is consistent with international practice to put export controls on rare earths because they can be used for both civilian and military purposes.",
      "In a note, Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, wrote that even though there is an agreement for now, \u201csupply cutoffs will remain an ever-present threat.\u201d That's because China\u2019s licensing regime for the export of the seven heavy rare earths and related magnets is permanent, despite perceptions at the time that it was an act of retaliation, he wrote.",
      "China \"will probably not approve exports in sufficient quantity to allow U.S. customers to stockpile, ensuring that Beijing\u2019s leverage remains undiminished,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBeijing may approve few if any exports to U.S. defense companies and their suppliers.\u201d",
      "Smith of NioCorp. said even if the Chinese are offering a reprieve from their restrictions on rare earths, they will likely still keep limits in place on U.S. military uses.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m in the military and flying a jet or running a nuclear class submarine or a guided missile, I don\u2019t want that to fail because of high temperatures. So we have to have these heavy rare earths,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Smith said he hopes to find a solution to the problem of America being almost entirely dependent on China for these elements.",
      "\u201cI sincerely hope from the bottom of my heart that we use this situation as our final learning,\" Smith said. \u201cLet\u2019s take care of what we know needs to be taken care of.\u201d",

      "The Republican tax bill approved by the House would cost the poorest Americans roughly $1,600 a year while increasing the income of the wealthiest households by an average of $12,000 annually",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Republican tax bill approved by the U.S. House of Representatives would cost the poorest Americans roughly $1,600 a year while increasing the income of the wealthiest households by an average of $12,000 annually, according to a new analysis released Thursday by the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Middle-income households would see a boost of roughly $500 to $1,000 per year under Republican President Donald Trump's tax bill, the CBO found.",
      "The cuts to the lowest-income households come from proposed cuts to social safety net programs including Medicaid and a food assistance program for lower-income people, known as Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program.",
      "The bill also proposes expanding work requirements to receive food aid and new \u201ccommunity engagement requirements\u201d of at least 80 hours per month of work, education or service for able-bodied adults without dependents to receive Medicaid. Some proposed tax breaks would be temporary, including a tax break on tips and overtime, car loan interest and a $4,000 increase in the standard deduction for seniors.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other Republicans have sought to discredit the CBO's analyses of the bill and say that the U.S. could head toward economic catastrophe if the measure is not passed. GOP Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo said during a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Thursday that the tax bill \"recognizes the solution to our debt crisis is not to tax Americans more, it is to spend less.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe legislation recognizes that extending proven tax reform is critical for working families,\" he said.",
      "Administration officials have said the the cost of the tax bill would be offset by tariff income. Recently, the CBO separately estimated that Trump's sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall.",
      "The CBO was established more than 50 years ago to provide objective, impartial analysis to support the budget process. It is required to produce a cost estimate for nearly every bill approved by a House or Senate committee and will weigh in earlier when asked to do so by lawmakers.",
      "The office's analysis released Thursday considers Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d in isolation, excluding the potential impact of the tariffs that Trump has imposed and paused on nations around the world.",
      "Democratic Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, who requested the CBO analysis released Thursday, said in a statement that \"this would be one of the largest transfers of wealth from working families to the ultra-rich in American history. It\u2019s shameful.\u201d",

      "A portion of state incentives awarded by the committee \u2014 more than $1 billion over 37 years \u2014 is based on a percentage of income taxes withheld from plant workers\u2019 paychecks. The incentives also include up to $784 million from Guilford County and Greensboro and $450 million from the General Assembly to help with infrastructure, officials said. The project includes a research facility for composite structures.",
      "A commerce department official said that JetZero, headquartered in Long Beach, California, looked for over a year for a plant location, examining 25 sites in 17 states.",
      "JetZero, currently with just 225 workers, enters a jet purchasing market dominated by industry behemoths U.S.-based Boeing and European Airbus.",
      "\u201cWe have already shown strong commercial interest and momentum to meet the real airline demand for this aircraft,\u201d CEO Tom O'Leary said. \u201cSo this is more than just a factory. It\u2019s a launchpad for a new chapter of American aerospace.\u201d",
      "While a variant of the Z4 would have tanker and transport uses in the military, JetZero has said that it would focus first on building a commercial jetliner with about 250 seats and a range of 5,000 nautical miles.",
      "The 5-year-old company says the plane\u2019s shape will reduce drag and the mounting of engines on the top and back of the plane will make it much quieter than traditional airliners. The Z4 would run on conventional jet fuel but could be converted to hydrogen fuel, according to JetZero.",
      "JetZero says Z4 travelers will board through larger doors and into shorter but wider cabins, and aisles will be less congested as bathrooms will be far away from galleys where meals are prepared.",
      "\u201cIt's going to deliver a better passenger experience than you\u2019ve ever had before on any other plane,\u201d O'Leary said.",
      "The state is already home to more than 400 aerospace companies. And the Piedmont Triad airport has emerged as an industry hot spot, with Honda Aircraft placing its headquarters there and Boom Supersonic building its first full-scale manufacturing plant for next-generation supersonic passenger jets.",
      "The central location and easy access to interstates also lured Toyota to build an electric battery plant in adjoining Randolph County.",
      "North Carolina's previous largest economic development project, measured by employment, was revealed in 2022, when Vietnamese automaker VinFast announced plans to build an electric vehicle manufacturing plant in Chatham County, promising 7,500 jobs.",

      "Former congressman Billy Long of Missouri has been confirmed to lead the Internal Revenue Service, an agency he once sought to abolish",
      "WASHINGTON -- Former U.S. Rep. Billy Long of Missouri was confirmed on Thursday to lead the Internal Revenue Service, giving the beleaguered agency he once sought to abolish a permanent commissioner after months of acting leaders and massive staffing cuts that have threatened to derail next year\u2019s tax filing season.",
      "The Senate confirmed Long despite Democrats\u2019 concerns about the Republican's past work for a firm that pitched a fraud-ridden coronavirus pandemic-era tax break and about campaign contributions he received after President Donald Trump nominated him to serve as IRS commissioner.",
      "While in Congress, where he served from 2011 to 2023, Long sponsored legislation to get rid of the IRS, the agency he is now tasked with leading. A former auctioneer, Long has no background in tax administration.",
      "Long will take over an IRS undergoing massive change, including layoffs and voluntary retirements of tens of thousands of workers and accusations that then-Trump adviser Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency mishandled sensitive taxpayer data. Unions and advocacy organizations have sued to block DOGE\u2019s access to the information.",
      "The IRS was one of the highest-profile agencies still without a Senate-confirmed leader. Before Long\u2019s confirmation, the IRS shuffled through four acting leaders, including one who resigned over a deal between the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security to share immigrants\u2019 tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and another whose appointment led to a fight between Musk and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "After leaving Congress to mount an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate, Long worked with a firm that distributed the pandemic-era employee retention tax credit. That tax credit program was eventually shut down after then-IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel determined that it was fraudulent.",
      "Democrats called for a criminal investigation into Long\u2019s connections to other alleged tax credit loopholes. The lawmakers allege that firms connected to Long duped investors into spending millions of dollars to purchase fake tax credits.",
      "Long appeared before the Senate Finance Committee last month and denied any wrongdoing related to his involvement in the tax credit scheme.",
      "Ahead of the confirmation vote, Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles blasting the requisite FBI background check conducted on Long as a political appointee as inadequate.",
      "\u201cThese issues were not adequately investigated,\u201d Wyden wrote. \u201cIn fact, the FBI\u2019s investigation, a process dictated by the White House, seemed designed to avoid substantively addressing any of these concerning public reports. It\u2019s almost as if the FBI is unable to read the newspaper.\u201d",
      "Democratic lawmakers have also written to Long and his associated firms detailing concerns with what they call unusually timed contributions made to Long\u2019s defunct 2022 Senate campaign committee shortly after Trump nominated him.",
      "The IRS faces an uncertain future under Long. Tax experts have voiced concerns that the 2026 filing season could be hampered by the departure of so many tax collection workers. In April, The Associated Press reported that the IRS planned to cut as many as 20,000 staffers \u2014 up to 25% of the workforce. An IRS representative on Thursday confirmed the IRS had shed about that many workers but said the cuts amounted to approximately the same number of IRS jobs added under the Biden administration.",
      "The fate of the Direct File program, the free electronic tax return filing system developed during President Joe Biden's Democratic administration, is also unclear. Republican lawmakers and commercial tax preparation companies had complained it was a waste of taxpayer money because free filing programs already exist, although they are hard to use. Long said during his confirmation hearing that it would be one of the first programs that come up for discussion if he were confirmed.",
      "Long is not the only Trump appointee to support dismantling an agency he was assigned to manage.",
      "Linda McMahon, the current education secretary, has repeatedly said she is trying to put herself out of a job by closing the federal department and transferring its work to the states. Rick Perry, Trump's energy secretary during his first term, called for abolishing the Energy Department during his bid for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination.",

      "President Donald Trump signed a resolution on Thursday that blocks California\u2019s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump signed a resolution on Thursday that blocks California\u2019s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.",
      "The state quickly announced it was challenging the move in court, with California's attorney general holding a news conference to discuss the lawsuit before Trump's signing ceremony ended at the White House.",
      "The resolution was approved by Congress last month and aims to quash the country\u2019s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. Trump also signed measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.",
      "Trump called California\u2019s regulations \u201ccrazy\u201d at a White House ceremony where he signed the resolutions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a disaster for this country,\u201d he said.",
      "It comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump's move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It's the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over issues including tariffs, the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.",
      "The state is already involved in more than two-dozen lawsuits challenging Trump administration actions, and the state's Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the latest one at a news conference in California. Ten other states, all with Democratic attorneys general, joined the lawsuit filed Thursday.",
      "\u201cThe federal government\u2019s actions are not only unlawful; they\u2019re irrational and wildly partisan,\u201d Bonta said. \u201cThey come at the direct expense of the health and the well-being of our people.\u201d",
      "The three resolutions Trump signed will block California\u2019s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and end the sale of new ones by 2035. They will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.",
      "In his remarks at the White House, Trump expressed doubts about the performance and reliability of electric vehicles, though he had some notably positive comments about the company owned by Elon Musk, despite their fractured relationship.",
      "\u201cI like Tesla,\u201d Trump said.",
      "In remarks that often meandered away from the subject at hand, Trump used the East Room ceremony to also muse on windmills, which he claimed \u201care killing our country,\u201d the prospect of getting electrocuted by an electric-powered boat if it sank and whether he'd risk a shark attack by jumping as the boat went down.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll take electrocution every single day,\" the president said.",
      "When it comes to cars, Trump said he likes combustion engines but for those that prefer otherwise, \u201cIf you want to buy electric, you can buy electric.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat this does is it gives us freedom,\u201d said Bill Kent, the owner of Kent Kwik convenience stores. Kent, speaking at the White House, said that the California rules would have forced him to install \u201cinfrastructure that frankly, is extremely expensive and doesn\u2019t give you any return.\u201d",
      "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major car makers, applauded Trump\u2019s action.",
      "\u201cEveryone agreed these EV sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic,\u201d John Bozzella, the group\u2019s president and CEO, said in a statement.",
      "Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal and said the state plans to sue.",
      "Newsom said Trump\u2019s action was a continuation of his \u201call-out assault\u201d on California.",
      "\u201cAnd this time he\u2019s destroying our clean air and America\u2019s global competitiveness in the process,\u201d Newsom said in a statement. \u201cWe are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a President who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters.\u201d",
      "The signings come as Trump has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.",
      "The move follows other steps the Trump administration has taken to roll back rules that aim to protect air and water and reduce emissions that cause climate change.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.",
      "Dan Becker with the Center for Biological Diversity, said the signing of the resolutions was \u201cTrump\u2019s latest betrayal of democracy.\u201d",
      "\u201cSigning this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people\u2019s health and their wallets,\u201d Becker said in a statement.",
      "California, which has some of the nation\u2019s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.",
      "In his first term, Trump revoked California\u2019s ability to enforce its standards, but Democratic President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.",
      "Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.",
      "That\u2019s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California\u2019s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.",
      "California, which makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, has significant power to sway trends in the auto industry. About a dozen states signed on to adopt California's rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.",

      "O.C. Tanner Institute, a software and service company, helps organizations find effective ways to show appreciation to their employees, such as managers giving handwritten notes of thanks. The company helped American Airlines develop a system for managers and colleagues to recognize good work with points that can be applied to a catalog order.",
      "It also helped Amway create gift boxes to celebrate workers' accomplishments and important personal milestones, such as buying a home or adopting a child.",
      "\u201cRecognition impacts so many facets of the employee experience. And when you do it well, it connects people back to a deep sense of purpose and meaning,\u201d said Meghan Stettler, a director at O.C. Tanner.",
      "Some companies donate their own products to thank nurses, doctors, police officers, firefighters and other workers who serve their communities. Frontline Builders, a nonprofit organization launched during the pandemic, connects donors of snacks, drinks and personal care items with recipients.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all worked in that job where we weren\u2019t shown gratitude and realized how much that stinks,\u201d said Jason Lalack, partnership director at Frontline Builders. \u201cShowing someone gratitude or showing appreciation doesn\u2019t really cost anything, and shouldn\u2019t be that difficult of a thing, and yet it\u2019s rarer than it should be.\u201d",
      "Registered nurse Denise Whittsell remembers how quiet the hospital where she works became during the pandemic. The hallways of Denver Health, typically busy with families and guests, were suddenly empty as visits from outsiders were curtailed and patients battled illnesses alone.",
      "Once in a while, someone from the community would deliver gifts of gratitude: tasty snacks or handmade cards from schoolchildren.",
      "\u201cThose spontaneous recognitions were really sweet,\u201d Whittsell said. \u201cIt just felt really kind, and it felt like there was a lot of wrapping around us, a very supportive feeling.\u201d",
      "Whittsell is part of a team of volunteers at Denver Health's RESTORE program, which connects front-line hospital workers with trained peer responders for confidential emotional support and training.",
      "The hospital started the program as a way to improve and sustain the emotional well-being of its workforce, said Tia Henry, the program's director. Volunteers take shifts so someone is available around-the-clock to answer calls from hospital personnel who are struggling with stressful events such as losing a patient or witnessing violence.",
      "Volunteers and staff regularly express gratitude for the program, Henry said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had calls on my way to work: \u2018I\u2019m having a hard time and I need to talk with somebody who gets it,\u2019\u201d Whittsell said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way to give back to the people that I work with.\"",
      "Aside from peer support, RESTORE also provides training and education to employees about stress, burnout and techniques to deescalate violence, Henry said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not doing counseling or therapy, but we\u2019re using components of psychological first aid to truly engage timely with our teammates when they\u2019re distressed, helping them calm their nervous system and get back to the place of regulation where they can show back up and do what it is they need to do or they can lay something down and go back home,\u201d Henry said. \u201cThat is gratitude from my lens.\u201d",
      "Indy Public Safety Foundation, an Indianapolis nonprofit organization that supports front-line workers, shows gratitude to police, firefighters and paramedics through awards banquets, trainings, and showing up with food, shaking hands and saying thank you after a community tragedy.",
      "Foundation staff members take gratitude a step further by providing tools and equipment such as electric bikes for police patrols.",
      "While front-line workers were applauded during the pandemic, \"their work has continued and arguably not gotten any less stressful, and some of that support has waned,\u201d said Dane Nutty, the foundation's president and CEO.",
      "While practicing gratitude may make for a more pleasant on-the-job environment, it's not a replacement for better working conditions. It's good to be grateful to have a job that pays the bills. It's also important to ask for what's fair.",
      "\u201cBeing grateful absolutely doesn\u2019t mean that we accept anything subpar or inappropriate,\u201d Jones said, adding that people should advocate for basic needs such as meal breaks. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to confuse gratitude with being passive.\"",

      "Some U.S. business owners say President Donald Trump\u2019s unpredictable trade policies are stifling the American ingenuity he hopes to foster",
      "NEW YORK -- Toy robots that teach children to code. Sneakers made in America. Mold-resistant kitchen gadgets.",
      "The three items are among new products that have gotten stuck in the pipeline due to President Donald Trump's unpredictable trade policies, according to the brand founders behind the stalled items. They say that instead of fostering U.S. innovation, Trump\u2019s tariffs are stifling it with extra costs and unexpected work.",
      "At Learning Resources in Vernon Hills, Illinois, Made Plus in Annapolis, Maryland, and Dorai Home in Salt Lake City, research and development have taken a backseat to recalculating budgets, negotiating with vendors and tracking shipments in the shifting tariff environment.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t have enough cash to cover just the restocks of the things that we know we need, do we want to take a risk on this new thing when we don\u2019t know how well it will sell yet?\u201d Dorai Home founder Kelsey O\u2019Callaghan said.",
      "O\u2019Callaghan started the eco-friendly home goods company with a stone bath mat and now offers about 50 kitchen and bathroom accessories, which are made in China with a non-toxic material that dries quickly. New launches are critical to increasing sales and attracting customers, she said.",
      "As Trump increased the tariff on Chinese goods to 20% and as high as 145% before reducing the import tax rate to 30% for 90 days, Dorai Home postponed introducing new merchandise. O'Callaghan said she had to lay off the CEO as well as the head of product development, who helped the company jump on new trends.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t really put the time or the emphasis on (innovation) because I\u2019m covering too many other people\u2019s roles,\u201d she said.",
      "The company paused shipments from China in early April but resumed some on a staggered basis after the president's rate reduction. On Wednesday, Trump touted progress  in U.S.-China trade talks.",
      "With details still sketchy and a deal not finalized, entrepreneurs interviewed by The Associated Press said they viewed the tariffs war as an ongoing threat.",
      "The potential stunting of innovation follows an economic slowdown during the coronavirus pandemic, when companies also had to put projects on hold. Some experts think the on-again-off again tariffs may have more enduring consequences because they rewire markets and upend business strategies.",
      "\u201cWhen executive attention shifts from innovation to regulatory compliance, the innovation pipeline suffers. Companies end up optimizing for the political landscape rather than technological advancement,\u201d economists J. Bradford Jensen, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and Scott J. Wallsten, president of the Technology Policy Institute think tank, wrote in an April blog post.",
      "Trump has argued that curtailing foreign imports with tariffs would help revive the nation's diminished manufacturing base. Analysts and various trade groups have warned that fractured trade ties and supply chains may depress R&D activity of U.S. tech and health care companies that rely on international partnerships or foreign suppliers.",
      "Small companies, which often drive the innovations that create jobs and economic growth, already are under strain.",
      "With fewer people on staff and tighter budgets compared to large corporations, entrepreneurs say they are spending more time on cutting costs, suspending or arranging orders, and deciding how much of their tariff-related costs to charge customers. That means they\u2019re spending less time thinking of their next big ideas.",
      "Schylling Inc., a Massachusetts company that produces modern versions of Lava lamps, Sea-Monkeys, My Little Pony and other nostalgic toys, has its products made in China. As part of its strategy to account for tariffs, the company put a group of employees on temporary unpaid leave last month to reduce expenses.",
      "Marketing director Beth Muehlenkamp said she and other furloughed workers typically would have been planning products for the final months of 2026. But Schylling isn't focusing on designing new products given the unstable trade outlook.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to focus on innovation and creativity when you\u2019re consumed with this day-to-day of how we\u2019re just going to balance the books and deal with the changing rates,\u201d Muehlenkamp said.",
      "Even some companies that do their manufacturing in the U.S. are scaling back investments in new products. Made Plus, a Maryland company that makes athletic shoes at a small factory in the state capital, put a planned golf line on hold because two key components \u2014 a foam insole and the tread for the bottom of the shoe \u2014 currently are made in China, founder Alan Guyan said.",
      "The company customizes its shoes on demand and charges $145 to $200 a pair. The footwear is made from recycled plastic bottles with advanced knitting, 3D printing and computerized stitching techniques. It's looking into getting components from Vietnam instead of China.",
      "Embracing new technology is essential to restoring manufacturing capability in the U.S. and competing with Asia, Guyan said. But given ongoing trade frictions, he said he does not want to invest time or money evaluating the latest embroidery and knitting machines, which come from Germany, Italy, China and the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just battening down the hatches a little bit and just hoping that there\u2019s enough influence in the community of footwear that it will somewhat change and get resolved and we can move forward,\u201d he said of the tariff roller coaster.",
      "In contrast, many big companies are forging on. Google parent Alphabet confirmed late last month that it still planned to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures this year, with most of the money going toward artificial intelligence technology.",
      "Sonia Lapinsky, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners, has advised her clients to limit tariff discussions to a small group of executives and to keep their product creation cycles in motion.",
      "Businesses have an even greater imperative to come up with attention-grabbing innovations when consumers may be reluctant to open their wallets, she said.",
      "Yet smaller companies may struggle to wall off tariff discussions from the rest of the business.",
      "Learning Resources CEO Rick Woldenberg said that roughly 25% to 30% of the 350 employees at the educational toy company\u2019s headquarters, including product developers, are working at least part-time on tariff-related tasks.",
      "The company usually develops 250 different products a year and expects to get half that many off the drawing board for 2026, Woldenberg said. While exploring factories in countries besides China, he said, Learning Resources is delaying the next generation of its interactive robots that help children develop computer programming skills through games and other activities.",
      "The family-run business and Woldenberg's other toy business, hand2Mind, are locked in a legal battle with the Trump administration. The jointly owned companies filed a lawsuit accusing the president of exceeding his authority by invoking an emergency powers law to impose tariffs.",
      "A federal judge ruled in favor of the two companies last month, and the administration has appealed the decision. Woldenberg said he's ready to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cIt's a win at the Supreme Court that we need,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so until then, there will be no certainty. Even then, if the government is bound and determined to keep us in an uncertain situation, they\u2019ll be able to do that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "U.S. President Donald Trump wants China to lift restrictions on exporting rare earths and other critical minerals that Beijing imposed as part of a yearslong trade war",
      "GANZHOU, China -- China\u2019s dominance over critical minerals in global supply chains was a powerful bargaining chip in trade talks between Beijing and Washington that concluded with both sides saying they have a framework to pursue a deal.",
      "China has spent decades building the world's main industrial chain for mining and processing such materials, which are used in many industries such as electronics, advanced manufacturing, defense and health care.",
      "Mines and factories in and around Ganzhou, a key production hub for rare earths, underpin China's control over the minerals. Many residents grew up collecting rocks containing the valuable minerals from the forested hills surrounding the southern city and today make a living from mining, trading or processing them.",
      "Responding to ever higher tariffs and other controls on advanced technology, China told exporters of certain key rare earths and other critical minerals to obtain licenses for every shipment abroad. Approvals can take weeks, leading to supply chain disruptions in the U.S. and other countries.",
      "President Donald Trump said Wednesday that China would make it easier for American industry to obtain much-needed needed magnets and rare earth minerals, clearing the way for talks to continue between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. In return, Trump said, the U.S. will stop efforts to revoke the visas of Chinese nationals on U.S. college campuses.",
      "But details remain scarce. Beijing has not confirmed what the negotiators agreed to, and Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump himself have yet to sign off on it.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said Saturday it had approved a \u201ccertain number\u201d of export licenses for rare earth products, apparently acknowledging Trump\u2019s personal request to Xi during a phone call last week. And on Wednesday, the Ganzhou-based rare-earth conglomerate JL MAG Rare-Earth Co. confirmed it had obtained some export licenses for shipments to destinations including the U.S., Europe and Southeast Asia.",
      "Experts say, however, Beijing is unlikely to do away with the permit system enabling it to control access to those valuable resources.",
      "The only scenario in which China might deregulate its critical minerals export is if the U.S. first fully removes tariffs imposed on Chinese goods as part of the trade war, said Wang Yiwei, a professor of international affairs at Renmin University, echoing the Chinese government\u2019s earlier stance.",
      "\u201cWithout that,\u201d he said, \u201cit will be difficult to blame China for continuing to strengthen its export controls.\u201d",
      "In 1992, Deng Xiaoping, the leader who launched China's ascent as the world's biggest manufacturing power, famously said \u201cthe Middle East has oil, China has rare earths,\u201d signaling a desire to leverage access to the key minerals.",
      "Several generations later, Beijing has made its rich reserves of rare earths, a group of 17 minerals that are abundant in the earth\u2019s crust but hard, expensive and environmentally polluting to process, a key element of China's economic security. In 2019, during a visit to a rare earth processing plant in Ganzhou, Xi described rare earths as a \u201cvital strategic resource.\u201d",
      "China today has an essential monopoly over \u201cheavy rare earths,\u201d used for making powerful, heat-resistance magnets used in industries such as defense and electric vehicles.",
      "The country also produces around 80% of the world\u2019s tungsten, gallium and antimony, and 60% of the world\u2019s germanium -\u2013 all minerals used in the making of semiconductors, among other advanced technologies.",
      "The risks of dependency on Chinese suppliers first came into focus in 2010, when Beijing suspended rare earths exports to Japan due to a territorial dispute. The ban was lifted after about two months, but as a precaution, Japan invested in rare earths processing plants in other countries and began stockpiling the materials.",
      "Beijing's across-the-board requirement for export licenses for some critical minerals has put pressure on world electronics manufacturers and automakers.",
      "Some auto parts makers in Europe have shut down production lines due to delays in supply deliveries, according to the European Association of Automotive Suppliers. In the U.S., Tesla CEO Elon Musk said a shortage of rare earths is affecting his company\u2019s work on humanoid robots.",
      "In the drab industrial hub of Ganzhou, cradled by the scenic Dayu Mountains, the U.S.-China trade war is still a distant stressor. Miners and small mineral traders interviewed by The Associated Press said they are more concerned about depleting the mountains' once-abundant resources.",
      "Zhong, a tungsten factory manager in Ganzhou who would only give his last name, worked his way up to manager from a miner, but he's unsure there is a future for him and others in the industry.",
      "\u201cI find growing difficulties to source tungsten these days,\u201d he said, adding that smaller mines and trading companies are slowly disappearing as the resources are dwindling. Tungsten is an ultra-hard metal used in armor-piercing ammunition, nuclear reactors and semiconductors.",
      "At least five tungsten mines have closed in the area in recent years, according to state media. Remaining reserves are deeper and harder to extract and process after decades of exploitation, said Li Shangkui, chairman of the Ganzhou-based Jiangxi Yuean Advanced Materials Co., Ltd.",
      "Processing factories in Ganzhou now routinely source materials from other provinces or other countries. Zhong\u2019s plant imports some raw materials from places like Africa and Cambodia.",
      "Major state-owned and private companies in Ganzhou are also ramping up investments abroad. Tungsten producer Ganzhou Haisheng, for instance, announced last year a $25 million investment in a new tungsten plant in Thailand.",
      "Whatever the challenges in procuring raw materials, China likely will seek to maintain its dominance in critical minerals, said Fabian Villalobos, an engineer and critical minerals expert at the RAND think tank.",
      "Between 2020 and 2023, the U.S. imported at least 70% of the rare earth compounds it used from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It has diversified its sources in recent years, but still mainly relies on China.",
      "Since beginning his second term in office, Trump has made improving access to critical minerals a matter of national security. But the U.S. has an incredibly long way to go to catch up with China, experts say.",
      "The sole operational U.S. rare earths mine, in Mountain Pass, California, is unable to separate heavy rare earths. It sends its ore to China for processing. The U.S. Defense Department has provided funding to the mine's owner, MP Materials, to build new separation facilities. It will take months to build and still only produce a fraction of what is needed.",
      "Friction over the issue has opened the way for government-backed financing that was unavailable before, said Mark Smith, who ran the Mountain Pass mine in the early 2010s and now leads NioCorp. It's seeking about $780 million in financing through the U.S. Export-Import Bank to build a processing facility in Nebraska for critical minerals including rare earths.",
      "The Defense Department has committed $439 million to building domestic rare earth supply chains, but building a complete mining and processing industrial chain like China's could take decades.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be some real issues here unless we can figure out how to get along with China for a period of time while we're developing our own resources and our mainstream processing,\u201d Smith said.",
      "The spotlight on critical minerals also provides opportunities for smaller miners to invest in extracting and processing some critical minerals, such as tungsten, considered \u201cniche\u201d because they are needed in relatively small amounts in key industries, said Milo McBride, an expert on sustainability and geopolitics at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\u201cFor many of these companies, the business strategy hedges on a scenario where the U.S. and China become more confrontational and where trade relations become more uncomfortable,\u201d McBride said. \u201cAnd all of a sudden, what was once an uneconomic project somewhere outside of China starts to make more sense.\u201d",

      "Fullback Josh Jacomb scored the Chiefs' third try in the 64th minute to establish a 20-point margin and McKenzie's try-saving tackle on Tom Wright two minutes later snuffed out a potential Brumbies rally.",
      "\u201cThe Brumbies came out of the blocks fast as we knew they would and I just love the way we were really composed and stuck to our game,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cWe put the ball in front of our forwards and our set piece was great tonight.\u201d",
      "The Brumbies were Australia's last hope in the playoffs as they attempted to win the Super Rugby title for the first time since 2004. Their defeat means Australian teams are now 0-21 in Super Rugby matches in New Zealand.",
      "The Brumbies suffered a major blow when Wallabies flyhalf Noah Lolesio failed a head injury assessment in the 11th minute. The kicking game was integral to the Brumbies' plan and while they used it to keep pressure on the Chiefs and to gain field position, Lolesio's early departure was a turning point.",
      "The Brumbies had the Chiefs under defensive pressure for long periods in both halves but while hooker Billy Pollard opened the scoring with a try from a lineout drive in the 15th minute the Chiefs were later able to neutralize that threat.",
      "Pollard's early try followed his double in the Brumbies' quarterfinal win over the Wellington-based Hurricanes. He finishes with 11 tries for the season as does Toole, who scored his tries on either side of halftime.",
      "Narawa scored his first try in the 20th minute, picking the ball up from the base of an attacking ruck and scything through the Brumbies' defense.",
      "Toole scored off a precise cross-kick from replacement flyhalf Jack Debreczeni, who previously played for the Chiefs. But penalties to McKenzie gave the Chiefs a 19-12 lead at halftime.",
      "Toole scored three minutes after the restart after a lone dash down the left-wing touch. The Brumbies were right in the match at that point, trailing 19-17.",
      "But Narawa scored his second four minutes later to begin a run of 18 unanswered points by the Chiefs.",
      "The Chiefs will now attempt to go one step further after losing in the final to the Crusaders and the Blues in each of the last two years. They will attempt in Christchurch next Saturday to win their third Super Rugby title and first since 2013 which the Crusaders are seeking their 13th championship.",

      "DETROIT -- Cincinnati Reds left-hander Wade Miley declined on Friday to specifically address an accusation in court documents of providing drugs to the late Tyler Skaggs, a Los Angeles Angels pitcher who died of an accidental overdose in 2019.",
      "Skaggs\u2019 former agent, Ryan Hamill, said in a deposition that Skaggs told him he was using pain pills containing oxycodone, which were provided by Miley.",
      "The deposition is part of a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Skaggs\u2019 family against the Angels in California. A former publicist for the Angels, Eric Kay, was convicted in Texas of providing the fentanyl-laced pills that an autopsy said contributed to Skaggs\u2019 death. Kay was sentenced to 22 years in federal prison.",
      "Skaggs died in the team hotel in a Dallas suburb. His body was found hours before what was supposed to be the start of a series between the Angels and Texas Rangers.",
      "\u201cI hate what happened to Tyler,\u201d Miley told reporters ahead of the Reds' game in Detroit on Friday. \u201cIt sucks. My thoughts are with his family and friends. But I\u2019m not going to sit here and talk about things that somebody might have said about me or whatnot.",
      "\u201cI was never a witness for any of this. I\u2019ve never been accused of any wrongdoing.\u201d",
      "Miley is not facing criminal charges, and it\u2019s not the first time his name has come up in relation to Skaggs\u2019 death. During the sentencing phase of Kay\u2019s case, prosecutors used a recording of a conversation between Kay and his mother in which Kay said Miley was one of Skaggs\u2019 drug suppliers.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather just focus on the Cincinnati Reds right now and baseball and what I have to do moving forward. I\u2019ve got to get ready for a game on Sunday,\" Miley said.",
      "Matt Harvey, now a retired major league pitcher, testified during Kay\u2019s trial that he provided drugs to Skaggs. Harvey was later suspended for 60 days for violating MLB\u2019s drug policy. He didn\u2019t pitch in the major leagues again. Harvey and three other players also testified they received pills from Skaggs and described the recreational drug use they witnessed while with the Angels.",
      "Harvey and Skaggs were teammates with the Angels in 2019. Skaggs and Miley were teammates with the Arizona Diamondbacks from 2012-13.",
      "Hamill said the conversation in which Skaggs implicated Miley took place in 2013. Hamill had expressed concern to Skaggs\u2019 parents about what he said was erratic behavior from the pitcher in a phone conversation. Hamill said he and Skaggs\u2019 parents confronted Skaggs at home, leading to Skaggs\u2019 admission that he was using drugs and the accusation that Miley was supplying them.",
      "The 38-year-old Miley signed a one-year contract with the Reds on June 4 and has made two starts this season. He had Tommy John surgery on his left elbow in May 2024 and signed a minor league deal with Cincinnati in February.",
      "Miley had an opt-out clause if he didn\u2019t reach the big leagues by June 1. The 14-year veteran executed that clause but remained with Cincinnati while he pursued potential deals with other clubs before re-signing with the Reds.",

      "A new poll finds Elon Musk has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his public falling-out with President Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- Tech billionaire Elon Musk has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his messy public falling-out with President Donald Trump last week, a new survey finds.",
      "Fewer Republicans view Trump's onetime government efficiency bulldog \u201cvery favorably\u201d compared with April, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Though most Republicans continue to hold a positive view of Musk, their diminished fervor suggests his vocal opposition to Trump's signature spending and tax cut legislation \u2014 and Musk's subsequent online political and personal taunts \u2014 may have cost him some enthusiasm within the party.",
      "\u201cSome things have happened lately that have changed how I feel about him a little,\u201d said Alabama Republican Katye Long, whose feelings for Musk have cooled to \u201csomewhat favorable.\u201d",
      "\u201cI liked what he was doing when he was helping. But now I feel like he\u2019s kind of hurting,\u201d said the 34-year-old automotive component factory employee and mother of three from Woodstock, Alabama. \u201cI also don\u2019t feel like he matters that much. He\u2019s not actually part of the government. He\u2019s just a rich guy who pushes his opinions.\u201d",
      "Musk's overall popularity hasn't shifted, the poll found, and most of the shift among Democrats and Republicans was between \u201cvery\u201d and \u201csomewhat\u201d strong opinions. Americans are less likely to view him favorably than his electric vehicle company, Tesla. That said, about half of Americans have a negative opinion of Tesla, highlighting another challenge for Musk when the company has dropped in value and been the target of protests in the U.S. and Europe. About one-third have a favorable view of Tesla, while about 2 in 10 don't know enough to say.",
      "Even a subtle shift in the intensity of Republicans\u2019 feelings about Musk could be important as the electric car and aerospace mogul weighs a second political act after spending about $200 million in service of Trump\u2019s 2024 election effort.",
      "After decrying the GOP\u2019s massive tax and budget policy bill as \u201ca disgusting abomination,\u201d Musk wrote on X, his social media platform, \u201cIn November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.\u201d",
      "The poll suggests the messy feud with Trump may have rubbed some Republicans the wrong way, as the share of Republicans viewing Musk as \u201cvery favorable\u201d has dropped from 38% in April to 26% now. At the same time, antipathy toward Musk among Democrats has waned a little. About two-thirds, 65%, of Democrats have a very negative view of Musk, down slightly from about three-quarters, 74%, in April.",
      "Musk's bitter back-and-forth with Trump has business implications, too. Tesla was already struggling with a backlash against Musk's association with Trump. Sales across Europe plunged by half in May, even as growth in the electric car market accelerated. Then the company's shares plunged in value when Musk began sparring publicly with the president.",
      "Victoria Brown, of Kansas City, Kansas, rated Tesla \u201csomewhat unfavorable\u201d because she objects to how Trump is conducting his administration and links the company\u2019s owner with the president\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t favor Trump. So, pretty much the fact that they have been working together means I don\u2019t care too much for Tesla,\u201d said Brown, 63, a political independent and an insurance agent.",
      "While the intensity of people's feelings about Musk may have changed, their overall opinions have not. About one-third of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of Musk, compared with about 6 in 10 who hold an unfavorable view, while about 1 in 10 don't know enough to say. That's unchanged from the April poll.",
      "The new poll was conducted June 5-9, after Musk left his government role and began attacking Trump's marquee legislative priority.",
      "Musk's public clash with Trump began four days after Trump honored Musk effusively during an Oval Office event discharging him from duties as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "After first tearing down the budget bill, Musk two days later complained he had never seen the language, and he aimed his fire at Trump, suggesting the president didn't sufficiently appreciate the role Musk assumed as the chief benefactor to Trump's reelection effort.",
      "\u201cWithout me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201cSuch ingratitude.\u201d",
      "Musk went on to claim without evidence that the federal government was concealing information about Trump's association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Musk deleted the post, and early Wednesday he stepped back from his attacks on Trump, writing on X that he regretted some of his posts and they \u201cwent too far.\u201d",
      "Tesla endured a difficult first quarter in 2025, with its sales falling while the world\u2019s leading electric car manufacturer faced protests in showrooms. The new poll also shows that Tesla is viewed far more negatively than some of its peers \u2014 notably, Ford, Toyota and General Motors.",
      "Only about one-third of U.S. adults have a \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favorable view of Tesla. About half of U.S. adults have an unfavorable opinion of Tesla, including 30% of Republicans. Democrats, at 66%, are more than twice as likely as Republicans to have a negative view of Tesla. But even among Republicans, Tesla is viewed less favorably than the other brands.",
      "Marisa Mills is no Musk fan. The 41-year-old teacher from Oakland, California, objects to his association with Trump and what the Democrat sees as their misguided notion that government is always well served by operating like a business.",
      "And yet she was once proud to have Tesla building cars in her own county. She soured on the company in 2020, when Musk sued Alameda County over its workplace restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, before he moved the company to Texas in 2021.",
      "\u201cMy government is supposed to serve the people, not his company. We were all glad to see him go,\u201d Mills said. \u201cI do regret that we now have feelings of regret for the Tesla car product. We were once so proud.\u201d",

      "Wang, though leaving for Meta with a small group of other Scale employees, will remain on Scale\u2019s board of directors. Replacing him is a new interim Scale CEO Jason Droege, who was previously the company\u2019s chief strategy officer and had past executive roles at Uber Eats and Axon.",
      "Zuckerberg's increasing focus on the abstract idea of \u201csuperintelligence\u201d \u2014 which rival companies call artificial general intelligence, or AGI \u2014 is the latest pivot for a tech leader who in 2021 went all-in on the idea of the metaverse, changing the company's name and investing billions into advancing virtual reality and related technology.",
      "It won't be the first time since ChatGPT's 2022 debut sparked an AI arms race that a big tech company has gobbled up talent and products at innovative AI startups without formally acquiring them. Microsoft hired key staff from startup Inflection AI, including co-founder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman, who now runs Microsoft's AI division.",
      "Google pulled in the leaders of AI chatbot company Character.AI, while Amazon made a deal with San Francisco-based Adept that sent its CEO and key employees to the e-commerce giant. Amazon also got a license to Adept\u2019s AI systems and datasets.",
      "Wang was a 19-year-old student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he and co-founder Lucy Guo started Scale in 2016.",
      "They won influential backing that summer from the startup incubator Y Combinator, which was led at the time by Sam Altman, now the CEO of OpenAI. Wang dropped out of MIT, following a trajectory similar to that of Zuckerberg, who quit Harvard University to start Facebook more than a decade earlier.",
      "Scale's pitch was to supply the human labor needed to improve AI systems, hiring workers to draw boxes around a pedestrian or a dog in a street photo so that self-driving cars could better predict what's in front of them. General Motors and Toyota have been among Scale's customers.",
      "What Scale offered to AI developers was a more tailored version of Amazon's Mechanical Turk, which had long been a go-to service for matching freelance workers with temporary online jobs.",
      "More recently, the growing commercialization of AI large language models \u2014 the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Meta's Llama \u2014 brought a new market for Scale's annotation teams. The company claims to service \u201cevery leading large language model,\u201d including from Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta and Microsoft, by helping to fine tune their training data and test their performance. It's not clear what the Meta deal will mean for Scale's other customers.",
      "Wang has also sought to build close relationships with the U.S. government, winning military contracts to supply AI tools to the Pentagon and attending President Donald Trump's inauguration. The head of Trump's science and technology office, Michael Kratsios, was an executive at Scale for the four years between Trump's first and second terms. Meta has also begun providing AI services to the federal government.",
      "Meta has taken a different approach to AI than many of its rivals, releasing its flagship Llama system for free as an open-source product that enables people to use and modify some of its key components. Meta says more than a billion people use its AI products each month, but it's also widely seen as lagging behind competitors such as OpenAI and Google in encouraging consumer use of large language models, also known as LLMs.",
      "It hasn't yet released its purportedly most advanced model, Llama 4 Behemoth, despite previewing it in April as \"one of the smartest LLMs in the world and our most powerful yet.\u201d",
      "Meta's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, who in 2019 was a winner of computer science's top prize for his pioneering AI work, has expressed skepticism about the tech industry's current focus on large language models.",
      "\u201cHow do we build AI systems that understand the physical world, that have persistent memory, that can reason and can plan?\u201d LeCun asked at a French tech conference last year.",
      "These are all characteristics of intelligent behavior that large language models \u201cbasically cannot do, or they can only do them in a very superficial, approximate way,\u201d LeCun said.",
      "Instead, he emphasized Meta's interest in \u201ctracing a path towards human-level AI systems, or perhaps even superhuman.\u201d When he returned to France's annual VivaTech conference again on Wednesday, LeCun dodged a question about the pending Scale deal but said his AI research team's plan has \u201calways been to reach human intelligence and go beyond it.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just that now we have a clearer vision for how to accomplish this,\u201d he said.",
      "LeCun co-founded Meta's AI research division more than a decade ago with Rob Fergus, a fellow professor at New York University. Fergus later left for Google but returned to Meta last month after a 5-year absence to run the research lab, replacing longtime director Joelle Pineau.",
      "Fergus wrote on LinkedIn last month that Meta's commitment to long-term AI research \u201cremains unwavering\u201d and described the work as \u201cbuilding human-level experiences that transform the way we interact with technology.\u201d",

      "In his interview with police after he surrendered, the suspect said he also has a YouTube channel and had been livestreaming from the Strip on the night of the shooting. Ruiz told police began shooting because it looked like one of the victims was reaching for a weapon, according to the report.",
      "Police said no firearms were found on the victims.",
      "The shooting happened on one of the busiest stretches of the Strip. The dancing Bellagio fountains, which soar up to 460 feet (140 meters) into the air, play every 15 minutes on the weekends between 8 p.m. and midnight.",

      "New research says long-billed curlews listen to alarm barks from prairie dog colonies to protect themselves from predators",
      "WASHINGTON -- Prairie dogs are the Paul Reveres of the Great Plains: They bark to alert neighbors to the presence of predators, with separate calls for dangers coming by land or by air.",
      "\u201cPrairie dogs are on the menu for just about every predator you can think of\u201d\u2014 golden eagles, red-tailed hawks, foxes, badgers, even large snakes \u2014 said Andy Boyce, a research ecologist in Montana at the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.",
      "Those predators will also snack on grassland nesting birds like the long-billed curlew.",
      "To protect themselves, the curlews eavesdrop on the alarms coming from prairie dog colonies, according to research published Thursday in the journal Animal Behavior.",
      "Previous research has shown birds frequently eavesdrop on other bird species to glean information about potential food sources or approaching danger, said Georgetown University ornithologist Emily Williams, who was not involved in the study. But, so far, scientists have documented only a few instances of birds eavesdropping on mammals.",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s rare in the wild,\u201d she said, \u201cit just means we haven\u2019t studied it yet.\u201d",
      "Prairie dogs live in large colonies with a series of burrows that may stretch for miles underground. When they hear one each other\u2019s barks, they either stand alert watching or dive into their burrows to avoid approaching talons and claws.",
      "\u201cThose little barks are very loud \u2014 they can carry quite a long way,\u201d said co-author Andrew Dreelin, who also works for the Smithsonian.",
      "The long-billed curlew nests in short-grass prairie and incubates eggs on a ground nest. When one hears the prairie dog alarm, she responds by pressing her head, beak and belly close to the ground.",
      "In this crouched position, the birds \u201crely on the incredible camouflage of their feathers to become essentially invisible on the Plains,\u201d Dreelin said.",
      "To test just how alert the birds were to prairie dog chatter, researchers created a fake predator by strapping a taxidermied badger onto a small remote-controlled vehicle. They sent this badger rolling over the prairie of north-central Montana toward curlew nests \u2014 sometimes in silence and sometimes while playing recorded prairie dog barks.",
      "When the barks were played, curlews ducked into the grass quickly, hiding when the badger was around 160 feet (49 meters) away. Without the barks, the remote-controlled badger got within about 52 feet (16 meters) of the nests before the curlews appeared to sense danger.",
      "\u201cYou have a much higher chance of avoiding predation if you go into that cryptic posture sooner \u2014 and the birds do when they hear prairie dogs barking,\u201d said co-author Holly Jones, a conservation biologist at Northern Illinois University.",
      "Prairie dogs are often thought of as \u201cenvironmental engineers,\u201d she said, because they construct extensive burrows and nibble down prairie grass, keeping short-grass ecosystems intact.",
      "\u201cBut now we are realizing they are also shaping the ecosystems by producing and spreading information,\u201d she said.",

      "Supported by \u201cunrestricted gifts\u201d from Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI, the Harvard-based Institutional Data Initiative is working with libraries around the world on how to make their historic collections AI-ready in a way that also benefits libraries and the communities they serve.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to move some of the power from this current AI moment back to these institutions,\u201d said Aristana Scourtas, who manages research at Harvard Law School\u2019s Library Innovation Lab. \u201cLibrarians have always been the stewards of data and the stewards of information.\u201d",
      "Harvard's newly released dataset, Institutional Books 1.0, contains more than 394 million scanned pages of paper. One of the earlier works is from the 1400s \u2014 a Korean painter\u2019s handwritten thoughts about cultivating flowers and trees. The largest concentration of works is from the 19th century, on subjects such as literature, philosophy, law and agriculture, all of it meticulously preserved and organized by generations of librarians.",
      "It promises to be a boon for AI developers trying to improve the accuracy and reliability of their systems.",
      "\u201cA lot of the data that\u2019s been used in AI training has not come from original sources,\u201d said the data initiative's executive director, Greg Leppert, who is also chief technologist at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. This book collection goes \"all the way back to the physical copy that was scanned by the institutions that actually collected those items,\u201d he said.",
      "Before ChatGPT sparked a commercial AI frenzy, most AI researchers didn\u2019t think much about the provenance of the passages of text they pulled from Wikipedia, from social media forums like Reddit and sometimes from deep repositories of pirated books. They just needed lots of what computer scientists call tokens \u2014 units of data, each of which can represent a piece of a word.",
      "Harvard\u2019s new AI training collection has an estimated 242 billion tokens, an amount that's hard for humans to fathom but it's still just a drop of what's being fed into the most advanced AI systems. Facebook parent company Meta, for instance, has said the latest version of its AI large language model was trained on more than 30 trillion tokens pulled from text, images and videos.",
      "Meta is also battling a lawsuit from comedian Sarah Silverman and other published authors who accuse the company of stealing their books from \u201cshadow libraries\u201d of pirated works.",
      "Now, with some reservations, the real libraries are standing up.",
      "OpenAI, which is also fighting a string of copyright lawsuits, donated $50 million this year to a group of research institutions including Oxford University's 400-year-old Bodleian Library, which is digitizing rare texts and using AI to help transcribe them.",
      "When the company first reached out to the Boston Public Library, one of the biggest in the U.S., the library made clear that any information it digitized would be for everyone, said Jessica Chapel, its chief of digital and online services.",
      "\u201cOpenAI had this interest in massive amounts of training data. We have an interest in massive amounts of digital objects. So this is kind of just a case that things are aligning,\u201d Chapel said.",
      "Digitization is expensive. It\u2019s been painstaking work, for instance, for Boston's library to scan and curate dozens of New England\u2019s French-language newspapers that were widely read in the late 19th and early 20th century by Canadian immigrant communities from Quebec. Now that such text is of use as training data, it helps bankroll projects that librarians want to do anyway.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear that, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re a public library,\u2019\" Chapel said. \u201cOur collections are held for public use, and anything we digitized as part of this project will be made public.\u201d",
      "Harvard's collection was already digitized starting in 2006 for another tech giant, Google, in its controversial project to create a searchable online library of more than 20 million books.",
      "Google spent years beating back legal challenges from authors to its online book library, which included many newer and copyrighted works. It was finally settled in 2016 when the U.S. Supreme Court let stand lower court rulings that rejected copyright infringement claims.",
      "Now, for the first time, Google has worked with Harvard to retrieve public domain volumes from Google Books and clear the way for their release to AI developers. Copyright protections in the U.S. typically last for 95 years, and longer for sound recordings.",
      "How useful all of this will be for the next generation of AI tools remains to be seen as the data gets shared Thursday on the Hugging Face platform, which hosts datasets and open-source AI models that anyone can download.",
      "The book collection is more linguistically diverse than typical AI data sources. Fewer than half the volumes are in English, though European languages still dominate, particularly German, French, Italian, Spanish and Latin.",

      "A salvage company plans to lift the luxury yacht Bayesian in late June from the Sicilian seabed where it sank last summer, killing seven people",
      "MILAN -- A salvage company expects to lift the wreck of the luxury Bayesian yacht in late June from the seafloor off Sicily where it sank last summer, killing seven people, according to a recovery plan agreed with Italian maritime and investigating authorities, the TMC salvage company said Wednesday.",
      "Salvage teams in the past week have recovered 17 pieces of suspected Bayesian debris from the sea floor identified using a remote-controlled submersible. They have been transferred to shore in Termini Imerese as part of the investigation.",
      "The British-flagged superyacht sank in August, killing U.K. tech magnate Mike Lynch, his daughter and five others.",
      "Several days before the 56-meter (183-foot) long 473-ton yacht is lifted to the surface, crews will use precision tools to remove the 72-meter mast. After that, the Bayesian will be set upright and then gradually lifted to the surface with eight main steel lifting strops that will be installed under the hull. The whole process is expected to take several days.",
      "Marine salvage experts began the operation in early May to recover the superyacht, which is on the seafloor at a depth of about 49 meters (160 feet.) The operation was temporarily halted after a diver\u2019s death a few days later, and the new recovery plan was approved on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe salvage teams will now hopefully be able to make more systematic progress in preparations for the ultimate safe recovery of Bayesian, whilst ensuring the safety of those working on this very complex lifting and recovery operation,\u2019\u2019 said Marcus Cave, a TMC Marine director.",
      "British investigators in an interim report issued last month said that the yacht was knocked over by \u201cextreme wind\u201d and couldn\u2019t recover. The report stated that the Bayesian had chosen the site where it sank as shelter from forecast thunderstorms. Wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph.) at the time of the sinking at 4:06 a.m. on Aug. 19 and \u201cviolently\u201d knocked the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds.",
      "Italian authorities are conducting a full criminal investigation.",
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Lynch, 59, and his daughter Hannah, 18, were among the dead when the Bayesian sank. The boat trip was a celebration of Lynch\u2019s acquittal in a fraud case in the U.S. in June. Fifteen people survived the accident.",

      "Satellite photos show emperor penguins in one region of Antarctica declined 22% in the past 15 years",
      "WASHINGTON -- The population of emperor penguins in one part of Antarctica appears to be declining faster than previously thought, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery released Tuesday.",
      "The estimated population of 16 penguin colonies \u2014 visible in satellite photos taken between 2009 and 2024 \u2013 had declined 22% during that period mainly because of climate change that's shrinking the amount of available sea ice. It's unclear whether this drop is seen across the continent, scientists said.",
      "\u201cSea ice is very important for the penguins because they breed on sea ice and forage on sea ice,\u201d said Peter Fretwell with British Antarctic Survey, who helped analyze the data.",
      "Scientists previously estimated that the total emperor penguin population declined about 10% across all of Antarctica over the past decade and a half. The latest survey included a region covering the Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea and Bellingshausen Sea.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely alarming that the numbers are so much worse than predicted,\u201d said Daniel Zitterbart, a penguin researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "There are uncertainties in the latest estimate. The analysis relies on a calculation of how densely the penguins are clustered in each area where they're detected in a single satellite photo taken each year.",
      "The colonies studied represent about 30% of the total emperor penguin population, which lives only in Antarctica. The loss of stable sea ice may be affecting the penguins in ways beyond shrinking their breeding grounds.",
      "\u201cMore predators like leopard seals and orcas may be able to come in closer to the colonies if sea ice breaks up earlier in the year,\u201d said Fretwell.",
      "Warming ocean temperatures and changing rainfall patterns may also impact the survival of penguin chicks, he added.",

They poop where they like, tear into garbage and the vixens in heat let out terrifying shrieks in the dead of winter when attracting a mate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like Marmite with foxes,\u201d Townsend said, referring to the food spread that is an acquired and divisive taste. \u201cYou either love them or hate them.\u201d",
      "The divide between the two camps led Trevor Williams to found what became The Fox Project nearly 35 years ago.",
      "Once a bass player in the rock group Audience that opened for Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, Williams had been active in the campaign to stop fox hunting when he redirected his protection efforts to the city, where foxes were once routinely killed.",
      "\u201cBecause of the myths that have occurred over the years, there\u2019s still a lot of suspicion about what foxes might be,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou know, they\u2019re going to bite the baby, they\u2019re going to eat the cat, they\u2019re going to run away with your husband.\u201d",
      "The project has since grown from providing information on deterring foxes to rescuing 1,400 a year, including 400 cubs, though only about half survive to be released.",
      "There are estimated to be 15,000 foxes in London. The project covers a swath of south London and its leafy suburbs while other organizations not devoted solely to foxes handle other parts of the city.",
      "While the omnivores survive on small animals, bugs and berries in the wild, they favor easily scavenged leftovers in the city and handouts that make them more dependent on humans.",
      "Their main urban menaces are cars, getting snagged in soccer nets or getting stuck in tight spaces. In their effort to get free, they often get nasty abrasions that can become infected. Many also suffer from mange, a parasitic infestation that leads to all kinds of problems.",
      "Townsend pilots her VW Caddy on city streets, highways and narrow lanes that roll through lush hills, responding to calls about injured or ill foxes or cubs that have lost their mothers.",
      "She's seen a bit of everything since her first humbling call 2 1/2 years ago when the supposedly injured fox bolted.",
      "\u201cIn my inexperience, I chased after him, which is comical because you\u2019re never going to outrun a fox,\u201d she said. \u201cI just remember he ran very fast and I looked silly running after him.\u201d",
      "Despite many challenging situations \u2014 she once managed to rescue a fox that lost its footing atop a fence and ended upside down at eye level with its paw lodged between boards \u2014 she's only been bitten once.",
      "Her van carries the distinctly musky scent of foxes. The odor becomes unpleasant when an anxious passenger in a litter of cubs relieves itself enroute to being delivered to a foster care pen where they will stay until being released in the wild.",
      "\u201cFeel free to open the window,\u201d said Townsend, who is accustomed to the stench. \u201cThis is a stinky job.\"",
      "On a recent day, she was dispatched to meet a heartbroken couple who found a cub with a puncture wound collapsed on their back lawn.",
      "\u201cWe thought he was asleep at first, so we went to go and have a close look because we love them,\" Charlotte English said. \u201cThen he just didn\u2019t move, so we knew something was wrong.\u201d",
      "That cub had to be put to sleep, as did the adult Townsend transferred at the start of her shift.",
      "Cubs that recover are socialized in packs of five until they mature and are then released in a rural location while the adults are freed in the neighborhoods where they were found.",
      "Given a second chance, it's not clear how well the foxes fare, because they are rarely tracked. A 2016 study in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science found that rehabilitated foxes were more likely to behave as if they had been displaced when returned to their original territory. They were tracked wandering farther away, potentially exposing them to more traffic and greater stress.",
      "\u201cIt is a gap in the knowledge and there\u2019s an assumption that when you release them, they thrive and I think that that assumption needs to be challenged more,\u201d said Bryony Tolhurst, a University of Brighton honorary research fellow and lead author of the study.",
      "For Townsend, fox deaths are offset by the joy of seeing little ones venture into the unknown or an adult darting into a neighborhood it instantly recognizes.",
      "\u201cSometimes they look back and people like to romanticize that they\u2019re saying \u2018thank you,'\" she said. \"They\u2019re just making sure we\u2019re not chasing after them.\u201d",

      "Financial aid fraud is exploding, thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence",
      "It was an unusual question coming from a police officer. Heather Brady was napping at home in San Francisco on a Sunday afternoon when the officer knocked on her door to ask: Had she applied to Arizona Western College?",
      "She had not, and as the officer suspected, somebody else had applied to Arizona community colleges in her name to scam the government into paying out financial aid money.",
      "When she checked her student loan servicer account, Brady saw the scammers hadn't stopped there. A loan for over $9,000 had been paid out in her name \u2014 but to another person \u2014 for coursework at a California college.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine how many people this is happening to that have no idea,\u201d Brady said.",
      "The rise of artificial intelligence and the popularity of online classes have led to an explosion of financial aid fraud. Fake college enrollments have been surging as crime rings deploy \u201cghost students\u201d \u2014 chatbots that join online classrooms and stay just long enough to collect a financial aid check.",
      "In some cases, professors discover almost no one in their class is real. Students get locked out of the classes they need to graduate as bots push courses over their enrollment limits. And victims of identity theft who discover loans fraudulently taken out in their names must go through months of calling colleges, the Federal Student Aid office and loan servicers to try to get the debt erased.",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Education Department introduced a temporary rule requiring students to show colleges a government-issued ID to prove their identity. It will apply only to first-time applicants for federal student aid for the summer term, affecting some 125,000 borrowers. The agency said it is developing more advanced screening for the fall.",
      "\u201cThe rate of fraud through stolen identities has reached a level that imperils the federal student aid program,\u201d the department said in its guidance to colleges.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of fraud reports obtained through a public records request shows California colleges in 2024 reported 1.2 million fraudulent applications, which resulted in 223,000 suspected fake enrollments. Other states are affected by the same problem, but with 116 community colleges, California is a particularly large target.",
      "Criminals stole at least $11.1 million in federal, state and local financial aid from California community colleges last year that could not be recovered, according to the reports.",
      "Colleges typically receive a portion of the loans intended for tuition, with the balance going directly to students for other expenses. Community colleges are targeted in part because their lower tuition means larger percentages of grants and loans go to borrowers.",
      "Scammers frequently use AI chatbots to carry out the fraud, targeting courses that are online and allow students to watch lectures and complete coursework on their own time.",
      "In January, Wayne Chaw started getting emails about a class he never signed up for at De Anza Community College, where he had taken coding classes a decade earlier. Identity thieves had obtained his Social Security number and collected $1,395 in financial aid in his name.",
      "The energy management class required students to submit a homework assignment to prove they were real. But someone wrote submissions impersonating Chaw, likely using a chatbot.",
      "\u201cThis person is typing as me, saying my first and last name. ... It\u2019s very freaky when I saw that,\u201d said Chaw.",
      "The fraud involved a grant, not loans, so Chaw himself did not lose money. He called the Social Security Administration to report the identity theft, but after five hours on hold, he never got through to a person.",
      "As the Trump administration moves to dismantle the Education Department, federal cuts may make it harder to catch criminals and help victims of identity theft. In March, the Trump administration fired more than 300 people from the Federal Student Aid office, and the department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, which investigates fraud, has lost more than 20% of its staff through attrition and retirements since October.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just nervous that I\u2019m going to be stuck with this,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThe agency is going to be so broken down and disintegrated that I won\u2019t be able to do anything, and I\u2019m just going to be stuck with those $9,000\u201d in loans.",
      "Criminal cases around the country offer a glimpse of the schemes' pervasiveness.",
      "In the past year, investigators indicted a man accused of leading a Texas fraud ring that used stolen identities to pursue $1.5 million in student aid. Another person in Texas pleaded guilty to using the names of prison inmates to apply for over $650,000 in student aid at colleges across the South and Southwest. And a person in New York recently pleaded guilty to a $450,000 student aid scam that lasted a decade.",
      "Brittnee Nelson of Shreveport, Louisiana, was bringing her daughter to day care two years ago when she received a notification that her credit score had dropped 27 points.",
      "Loans had been taken out in her name for colleges in California and Louisiana, she discovered. She canceled one before it was paid out, but it was too late to stop a loan of over $5,000 for Delgado Community College in New Orleans.",
      "Nelson runs her own housecleaning business and didn\u2019t go to college. She already was signed up for identity theft protection and carefully monitored her credit. Still, her debt almost went into collections before the loan was put in forbearance. She recently got the loans taken off her record after two years of effort.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like if someone came into your house and robbed you,\u201d she said.",
      "The federal government's efforts to verify borrowers' identity could help, she said.",
      "\u201cIf they can make these hurdles a little bit harder and have these verifications more provable, I think that\u2019s really, really, really going to protect people in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Delgado spokesperson Barbara Waiters said responsibility for approving loans ultimately lies with federal agencies.",
      "\u201cThis is an unfortunate and serious matter, but it is not the direct or indirect result of Delgado\u2019s internal processes,\u201d Waiters said.",
      "In San Francisco, the loans taken out in Brady's name are in a grace period, but still on the books. That has not been her only challenge. A few months ago, she was laid off from her job and decided to sign up for a class at City College San Francisco to help her career. But all the classes were full.",
      "After a few weeks, Brady finally was able to sign up for a class. The professor apologized for the delay in spots opening up: The college has been struggling with fraudulent applications.",

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia on Monday filed a lawsuit in bankruptcy court seeking to block the sale of personal genetic data by 23andMe without customer consent. The lawsuit comes as a biotechnology company seeks the court's approval to buy the struggling firm.",
      "Biological samples, DNA data, health-related traits and medical records are too sensitive to be sold without each person\u2019s express, informed consent, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a news release about the lawsuit. Customers should have the right to control such deeply personal information and it cannot be sold like ordinary property, it said.",
      "23andMe customers use saliva-based DNA testing kits to learn about their ancestry and find long-lost relatives. Founded in 2006, the company also conducted health research and drug development. But it struggled to find a profitable business model since going public in 2021. In March it laid off 40% of its staff and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the Eastern District of Missouri, raising concerns about the safety of customer data.",
      "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals said last month it aimed to buy the company for $256 million. Regeneron said it would comply with 23andMe\u2019s privacy policies and applicable law. It said it would process all customer personal data in accordance with the consents, privacy policies and statements, terms of service, and notices currently in effect and have security controls in place designed to protect such data.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s media company just announced a plan to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, joining a growing number of so-called \u201cbitcoin treasury companies\u201d as the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency hits all-time highs.",
      "The companies buy bitcoin for different reasons: Some hold it as a hedge against inflation or to signal support for the cryptocurrency industry, while some firms have made using debt and stock sales to buy bitcoin their primary business strategy.",
      "\u201cThe world at large has no idea what\u2019s happening and they\u2019re in for a big shock,\u201d Dylan LeClair, an executive at the Japan-based Metaplanet, which recently went from being a budget hotel firm to a bitcoin treasury company, said at a recent crypto conference. \u201cThis is a one-way train, nothing is going to stop this.\u201d",
      "The massive increases in some firms\u2019 stock price may seem to validate LeClair\u2019s bravado, but there are plenty of warnings that a downturn in bitcoin\u2019s prices could lead to large selloffs.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at bitcoin treasury companies by the numbers:",
      "That\u2019s how many bitcoins owned by MicroStrategy \u2013 the undisputed goliath of bitcoin treasury companies.",
      "With nearly 3% of the total bitcoin supply, MicroStrategy owns more bitcoins than every other bitcoin treasury company combined. It also owns more bitcoin than every nation state combined, according to the tracking site bitcointreasuries.net.",
      "Now called Strategy, the software company first started buying bitcoin in 2020 with reserve cash. Now, its software business is a small part of a perpetual bitcoin-buying machine that uses a variety of strategies \u2013 like selling shares or issuing debt \u2013 to keep growing its bitcoin holdings.",
      "That\u2019s how much MicroStrategy\u2019s stock price has increased in the last five years, compared to around 1,000% gain in bitcoin and the 1,500% jump for chipmaker and stock market darling Nvidia during that same period.",
      "The company\u2019s success has boosted the profile of MicroStrategy\u2019s founder and chairman, Michael Saylor, who has visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago and the White House while becoming bitcoin\u2019s enigmatic high priest.",
      "\u201cBitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy,\u201d Saylor said in a social media post.",
      "Saylor\u2019s success has also spawned many imitators.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of shocking \u2026 that it took someone four years after Michael Saylor started doing it to finally do it and pull the trigger and now it feels like everyone\u2019s pulling the trigger,\u201d said Eric Semler, the chairman of Semler Scientific, a healthcare company that started acquiring bitcoin last year.",
      "That\u2019s the average purchase price of bitcoin for half of the 61 publicly traded bitcoin strategy companies, excluding bitcoin mining companies and bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to a recent analysis by Standard Chartered.",
      "Geoff Kendrick, the bank\u2019s head of digital assets research, said in the report that restrictions on investors buying bitcoin directly help explain the popularity of bitcoin treasury companies, as their stocks can serve as bitcoin proxies. But as crypto becomes more mainstream, the case for investing in bitcoin treasury companies becomes weaker, Kendrick said.",
      "He added that bitcoin\u2019s volatility could force some newer bitcoin treasury companies to sell their holdings to satisfy their debts if it falls under the purchase price.",
      "\u201cThe question then becomes, how much pain can companies withstand before being forced to sell their BTC?\u201d Kendrick said, referring to the symbol for bitcoin.",

      "The scientist is accused of shipping biological material months ago to staff at a laboratory at the University of Michigan. The FBI, in a court filing, described it as material related to certain worms and requires a government permit.",
      "\u201cThe guidelines for importing biological materials into the U.S. for research purposes are stringent, but clear, and actions like this undermine the legitimate work of other visiting scholars,\u201d said John Nowak, who leads field operations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",

      "Nintendo's Switch 2 video-game console is out, and it makes some substantial improvements over its predecessor",
      "WASHINGTON -- I'm cruising around Bowser's Castle with my old pal Toad. It's not exactly relaxing, what with all the lava pits and banana peels and turtle shells littering the road. Add 23 other characters \u2014 is that a cow driving? \u2014 who are trying to get to the finish line first, and it's chaos.",
      "The hectic, high-speed insanity of any race in the new Mario Kart World would have caused the eight-year-old Switch console to wheeze a bit. And that's why we've got the Switch 2 ($449.99), the souped-up sequel to Nintendo's popular home-and-portable hybrid.",
      "It looks prettier, too. The 7.9-inch portable display (up from 6.2 inches) boosts the resolution to 1020p (from 720p), and while the LCD screen isn't quite as sharp as an OLED screen might have been, it's much cleaner than the original recipe Switch. It looks even better when connected to an HDTV since it now supports 4K and HDR.",
      "Nintendo has always stood apart from the technological arms race that fans of Sony\u2019s PlayStation and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox obsess over, insisting that first-rate games don\u2019t necessarily depend on high-powered computer chips. But you could feel the strain in 2023\u2019s The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, with its at-times blurry graphics and sluggish framerate. The Switch 2, with a faster framerate of 120 fps, corrects much of the fuzziness.",
      "That's not to say it comes close to matching the high-definition performance of the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox X/S. If you're expecting the jaw-dropping graphics of, say, Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows ... well, no.",
      "There is good news for those of us who have gotten weary of the old Switch's dinky 32 gigabytes of internal storage. The Switch 2 multiplies that by eight, for 256 GB. Of course, flashier games take up more space, so if you want more room you'll have to invest in a microSD Express card \u2014 which is a bit pricier than the standard memory card used in most portable devices.",
      "The Switch 2's Joy-Con controllers have undergone some tinkering. As before, you can attach them to the sides of the screen if you're playing on the go. If you're at home, you can attach them to a doohickey that feels more like a traditional joystick. Either way, they're now more firmly connected with magnets, which provide a satisfying snap.",
      "Both the left and right Joy-Cons now include an optical mouse, which you can use by placing the controller on its edge and rolling it around on a table. (Nintendo says you can also use it on your pants, but I prefer using a clipboard on my lap.) It remains to be seen how many Switch 2 games will call for a mouse, but 2K's port of Sid Meier's Civilization VII seems like a good candidate.",
      "And then there's a new button labeled \u201cC\u201d on the right-hand Joy-Con. That calls up GameChat, which lets you start up a conversation with other players \u2014 provided you've all taken the time to register yourselves as friends. (Eventually, you'll also need to subscribe to the Nintendo Switch Online service, but that requirement doesn't kick in until March 31, 2026.) The microphone is built into the Switch 2, though if you want to upgrade to video chat, you'll need to buy a separate Nintendo camera.",
      "Finally, there\u2019s GameShare, which lets you play selected titles with other Switch users even if they don\u2019t own the software.",
      "Nintendo has been emphasizing the new social features in its marketing, though it feels like it's catching up to the competition. The kids I know who play Fortnite or Minecraft on competing consoles seem to have figured out long ago how to chat with their pals. Welcome to the 2010s?",
      "As with any console launch, the driving question is: Does it have the games?",
      "There are just a couple of Switch 2 exclusives out now: Mario Kart World and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a $10 demo package that really should have been free. There are some new-to-Nintendo ports of excellent titles like Split Fiction and Cyberpunk 2077. You can get upgrades of classics like the last two Legend of Zelda adventures. And the Switch 2 is fully backward-compatible, so you can play everything that came out for the Switch as well as a substantial library of older titles.",
      "There\u2019s no other machine that will let you play future installments of beloved franchises like Zelda, Super Mario Bros., Super Smash Bros. and Animal Crossing. None of those have been announced yet, but some marquee names \u2014 Donkey Kong and Kirby \u2014 will star in Switch 2 exclusives later this year.",
      "There\u2019s plenty of competition out there, though, and not just in the TV-connected console market Switch shares with the PlayStation and the Xbox. Nintendo no longer has the portable market to itself, thanks to Valve\u2019s SteamDeck. Some models of that device cost less than the Switch 2, and it already has a huge library of PC games. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced over the weekend that it's teaming up with Asus on the ROG Xbox Ally, a handheld that will be out before Christmas.",
      "Honestly, we\u2019ll probably have a better idea of the Switch\u2019s quality a few years down the line, after developers get a handle on what the new hardware can do.

      "Amazon says it will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, including one it is building alongside a nuclear power plant that has drawn federal scrutiny over its arrangement to essentially plug right into the power plant",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Amazon said Monday that it will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, including one it is building alongside a nuclear power plant that has drawn federal scrutiny over an arrangement to essentially plug right into the power plant.",
      "Kevin Miller, vice president of global data centers at Amazon\u2019s cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, told The Associated Press that the company will build another data center complex just north of Philadelphia.",
      "One data center is being built next to northeastern Pennsylvania's Susquehanna nuclear power plant. The other will be in Fairless Hills at a logistics campus, the Keystone Trade Center, on what was once a U.S. Steel mill.",
      "In a statement, Gov. Josh Shapiro called it the largest capital investment in Pennsylvania's history.",
      "The announcements add to the billions of dollars in Big Tech's data center cash already flowing into the state.",
      "Since 2024 started, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina as it ramps up its investment in infrastructure to compete with other tech giants to meet growing demand for artificial intelligence products.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "The majority owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant, Talen Energy, announced last year that it had sold its data center to Amazon for $650 million in a deal to eventually provide 960 megawatts. That's 40% of the output of one of the nation's largest nuclear power plants, or enough to power more than a half-million homes.",
      "However, the arrangement between Talen and Amazon \u2014 called a \u201cbehind the meter\u201d connection \u2014 has been held up by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the first such case to come before the agency.",
      "It has raised questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it\u2019s fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid.",
      "For Big Tech, plugging energy-hungry data centers directly into a power plant can take years off their development timelines and is a much faster route to procuring power than having to connect to the congested electricity grid.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on a procedural grounds, will decide the matter, leaving in limbo regulatory treatment of the deal and others that likely would follow.",
      "Already in Pennsylvania, Microsoft announced a deal with the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to restart the reactor under a 20-year agreement to supply its data centers in four states with energy.",
      "Meanwhile, the owners of what was once Pennsylvania\u2019s biggest coal-fired power plant say they will turn it into a $10 billion natural gas-powered data center campus.",

      "A manhunt is now underway for the gunman who was impersonating a police officer.",
      "A Minnesota state representative and her husband were shot and killed, and a state senator and his wife were shot and wounded in an \"act of targeted political violence\" at their homes early Saturday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said.",
      "A manhunt is now underway for the gunman who was impersonating a police officer, authorities said.",
      "State Rep. Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, and her husband were shot and killed in what appears to be a \"politically-motivated assassination,\" Walz said at a news conference.",
      "Hortman, formerly the Speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives, \"was a formidable public servant,\" the governor said of his friend. \"She is irreplaceable.\"",
      "State Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife were both shot multiple times and underwent surgery, the governor said.",
      "\"We're cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt,\" Walz said.",
      "The two shooting locations are a few miles away from each other in Champlin and Brooklyn Park, just north of Minneapolis.",
      "Hoffman and his wife were shot around 2 a.m. in Champlin, Superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Drew Evans said.",
      "After Hoffman was shot, officers were heading to pro-actively check on Hortman when they encountered the suspect at Hortman's home around 3:35 a.m., Evans said.",
      "The officers found a person who was dressed as a police officer -- wearing a vest and a badge, and with a Taser and other equipment -- at the door, coming out of Hortman's house, police said.",
      "The suspect fired at the officers; gunfire was exchanged and the suspect was able to escape and flee on foot, authorities said.",
      "The suspect's vehicle -- which looked like a police vehicle, including police lights -- was in Hortman's driveway, authorities said.",
      "A list of other possible targets was retrieved from the suspect\u2019s vehicle, authorities said. Police said the list had \"many lawmakers,\" including the victims.",
      "Security resources have been dispatched to protect those people named on the list, authorities said.",
      "The gunman did say something to the victims, police said, but authorities did not reveal what that was.",
      "President Donald Trump has been briefed on the shooting and said \"such horrific violence will not be tolerated,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on social media.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said she's closely monitoring the situation.",
      "\"This horrific violence will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\" she said in a statement.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson also condemned the violence and said \"every leader must unequivocally condemn it.\"",
      "Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, formerly the Minnesota Democratic party chair, said he\u2019s friends with both Hoffman and Hortman.",
      "\"Speaker Hortman was a leader in every sense of the word -- from ushering in free lunch for our kids, to protecting women\u2019s rights and reproductive care, to standing up for Minnesota families,\" Martin said in a statement. \"Melissa was also a close friend whom I've known since the very start of her political career. She was someone I personally relied on for advice, counsel, and friendship and I am beyond words. As I said many times when I introduced her at events, she is the very best Speaker of the House that Minnesota has ever had.\"",
      "\"This senseless violence must end. These heinous murders are a reflection of the extremism and political violence that have been fomented in our country,\" Martin said. \"Today, we recommit ourselves to fight harder for the values that Melissa and Mark embodied -- building a kinder, more just, and loving world. If this murderer thinks we will be silenced, he\u2019s wrong.\"",
      "With the manhunt ongoing, police are urging community members to be cautious. Brooklyn Park is under a shelter in place order, officials said.",
      "Police warned, if an officer comes to your door, call 911 to confirm that the officer is supposed to be there.",
      "\"Police are asking that no one open their door to a lone police officer,\" the Hennepin County Sheriff\u2019s Office said. \"Licensed officers are working in pairs.\"",

      "Thousands of \"No Kings Day\" protests are set to be held throughout the country on Saturday to protest President Donald Trump's administration and to counterprogram the military parade in Washington, D.C., marking the U.S. Army's 250th birthday.",
      "Here's what to know about the protests.",
      "What is the idea behind \"No Kings Day\"?",
      "\"'No Kings Day' is the largest single-day, peaceful protest in recent American history, made up of millions of normal, everyday Americans who are showing up in more than 2,000 communities around the country to say, 'we don't do kings in America,'\" Ezra Levin, the co-executive director of progressive organizing group Indivisible, told ABC News on Thursday.",
      "Indivisible and other organizations involved with the coalition coordinating the protests have said that the protests are meant to protest what they say is overreach by the Trump administration on immigration enforcement and deportations, civil rights and cuts to the federal government.",
      "They've also pointed to how the military parade is being held on Trump's birthday. Trump has denied any connection between the parade's timing and his birthday, pointing to how June 14 is Flag Day.",
      "The groups coordinating the protests originally announced the initiatives in early May, after reports of the upcoming military parade, but organizers have said that the protests against immigration enforcement in Los Angeles and the response from the federal government have driven much more interest to the events.",
      "Where and when will the protests be?",
      "The protests will be held across the country and even beyond the United States, with a flagship event held in Philadelphia. Levin told ABC News there are now more than 2,000 events planned \"just about everywhere, everywhere but downtown D.C. -- intentionally so.\"",
      "According to Levin, the organizers did not want to give Trump a rationale to retaliate against peaceful protests in D.C. or to say that the protesters were protesting the military.",
      "\"We are ceding downtown D.C. Trump can have it for that day, and instead, we're organizing literally everywhere else,\" Levin said.",
      "Most of the protests around the country will be held in the morning, ahead of the parade. Some in the western part of the country may occur concurrently with the parade, which is set to kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET.",
      "What has Trump said about the protests?",
      "Asked on Thursday about his thoughts on the \"No Kings\" protests planned across the country for Saturday, Trump said he did not feel like a king.",
      "\"I don't feel like a king. I have to go through hell to get stuff approved,\" he said.",
      "\"A king would say, 'I'm not gonna get this'... he wouldn't have to call up Mike Johnson and Thune and say, 'Fellas, you got to pull this off' and after years we get it done. No, no, we're not a king, we're not a king at all,\" he added, referencing the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate Majority leader, respectively.",
      "Trump, on Tuesday, had threatened to use \"heavy force\" against \"any\" protesters at the military parade in the nation's capital; White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later said that \"of course\" the president supports peaceful protestors. Organizers of the No Kings protests have continuously emphasized they are not planning protests in Washington.",
      "Are there safety concerns surrounding the protests?",
      "Organizers have emphasized that the protests should remain peaceful and nonviolent, pointing to various trainings they've held this week about safety and deescalation.",
      "Levin said there were some concerns about outside agitators trying to disrupt protests, but he said people shouldn't feel \"as if we're going into battle. That's not what this is about. This is peaceful protest. People are going to have funny signs, people are going to be dancing, people are going to be chanting, people are going to be expressing their First Amendment rights.\"",
      "At least two states, Texas and Missouri, have said they are calling up the National Guard in their states as a precaution against the potential for any violence at protests on Saturday. The governors of both states affirmed that peaceful protests are legal.",
      "What comes next?",
      "The events on Saturday are not meant to be the be-all end-all of the groups' efforts to protest the Trump administration, Levin said.",
      "\"I think sometimes folks think a protest has to be everything. It's got to solve all your problems ... We need persistent, peaceful, people-powered organizing them on the ground in blue states, red states and purple states that allow people to push back against the escalating overreach from this administration,\" Levin said.",

      "A new analysis from the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office released Thursday shows the House-passed Trump megabill would reduce \u201cresources\u201d of the poorest U.S. households by about $1,600 per year while households in the top 10% would see gains of about $12,000 per year.",
      "Overall, the megabill would benefit high-earners most but reduce financial resources to lowest-income households.",
      "In addition, the lowest-earning 10% would see a 3.9% income cut while the highest-earning 10% would get a 2.3% income boost.",

    "summary": "The program will allow for compensation for exposure to toxic waste.",
    "story": [
      "The program will allow for compensation for exposure to toxic waste.",
      "For years, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley has been the face of a fight in Congress to reauthorize and expand access to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), which provides compensation to individuals exposed to nuclear waste. Now, Hawley has announced a breakthrough: reauthorization and expansion of the program in the Senate's version of the \"One Big Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "If the Senate's version of the bill is finally adopted, it will include in it the largest expansion of the program since its inception in 1990, allowing individuals in regions of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky and Alaska, as well as the already-qualified \"downwinders\" exposed to nuclear radiation from the testing of the atomic bomb, to be compensated for exposure to toxic waste.",
      "In an exclusive phone interview with ABC News Thursday night, Hawley called the inclusion of the RECA provisions in the Senate's version of the megabill advancing President Donald Trump's legislative agenda a \"huge step forward\" in the fight to secure compensation for individuals affected by nuclear exposure.",
      "\"This will be, if we can get the Big Beautiful Bill passed, this will be a huge huge victory,\" the Missouri Republican said during the phone call.",
      "The Senate is still working through the larger contours of the package which is expected to include an extension of the Trump 2017 Tax cuts and more funding for defense and border security. The bill is also expected to make changes to a number of programs, including SNAP and Medicaid, in order to cut costs.",
      "Hawley has been outspoken about concerns that the bill could limit Medicaid access for certain individuals and affect funding for rural hospitals. He's conditioned his support on changes to the Medicaid provisions in the House-passed bill.",
      "The Senate's Medicaid provisions have not yet been made available.",
      "The proposed reauthorization of RECA will be included in the Senate Judiciary Committee's portion of the reconciliation package. In addition to expansion and reauthorization, the proposal also allows for claims to be used for increased levels of atmospheric testing and adds uranium mine workers who worked in the mines from 1971-1990 to be eligible for benefits under the bill.",
      "\"There will be more to do,\" Hawley said. \"But this is a very very significant expansion.\"",
      "Hawley has been engaged in attempting to reauthorize RECA for several years. Some of his constituents in St. Louis are affected by nuclear waste from the Manhattan Project that is currently stored in the West Lake Landfill in Bridgeton, Missouri.",
      "One of those constituents is Dawn Chapman, who lives within miles of the West Lake Landfill and whose son and husband both suffer from autoimmune diseases as a result of exposure to the toxic waste near their home. Chapman has been to Capitol Hill several times over the last few years to advocate for families like hers.",
      "\"Tonight, we know we are not alone,\" Chapman told ABC News Thursday. \"With the help of Sen. Hawley and our community members as well as our other bipartisan REA family, we have been able to turn the lights back on, and make RECA bigger to cover more communities.\"",
      "For those affected by nuclear exposure, Hawley said he hopes this moment shows that the country is standing beside them.",
      "\"I think it really is an incredible sign that the country is with them,\" Hawley said. \"I think now this is a measure of vindication. It is a measure of appreciation.\"",
      "The Senate has twice passed an expansion and reauthorization of RECA with bipartisan support, but the bill has failed to gain traction in the House, in part due to concerns about the very high price tag originally estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. That price tag has been refuted by proponents of the bill, and they've taken steps to modify it to lower the cost.",
      "With further review and with programs set to sunset in 2028, the price tag should, Hawley said, fit well within the funds allocated to the Judiciary Committee to craft their portion of the reconciliation package. The CBO has not yet scored this portion of the package.",
      "The Senate will still need to maneuver these provisions through the Senate's procedural rules test as well as the finnicky Senate GOP conference, but Hawley said Majority Leader John Thune has been an ally in including the RECA language in the package. Thune's support could be critical to keeping the language in the bill.",
      "\"It would not be in this mark were it not for him and his commitment to putting it into reconciliation. He has been a terrific partner,\" Hawley said.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson has also conveyed that he \"wants to pass the RECA bill,\" Hawley said. Inclusion in the bill would make it difficult for House Republicans to reject RECA provisions, given that the package is massive and includes many other GOP priorities.",
      "Hawley said he has spoken with Trump about the move to include this legislation in the tax and immigration bill.",
      "\"He's been very involved in everything, and he and I have talked about the RECA program before on many occasions, we are glad for his involvement in all of this,\" Hawley said of his conversations with Trump.",

      "\"Since April 23, we've been working diligently, around the clock, to get this plan ready,\" Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service's Washington Field Office, told ABC News, noting that officials typically have six months to a year to prepare for large-scale special security events.",
      "\"This is a comprehensive plan,\" he said.",
      "The Secret Service has had five National Special Security Events, or NSSEs, in the past six months.",

      "Both McCool and U.S. Park Police Chief Jessica Taylor told ABC News touted the partnerships around the Washington metropolitan area that will help secure the parade and festival on the National Mall.",
      "\"Something I say often is, in Washington, D.C., nothing gets done without partnership,\" Taylor said. \"In D.C. specifically, with law enforcement, we rely heavily on one another. Nothing gets done without partnerships.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Jun 2025 16:32:13 -0400",
    "summary": "Ahead of President Trump's military parade, a transgender service member who was barred from the military, reflects on \"patriotism\" and her fight against the ban.",
    "story": [
      "As the U.S. military prepares to celebrate the legacy of the Army with a massive parade in Washington, D.C. on Saturday, some transgender service members are grappling with an involuntary end to their careers after the Trump administration banned them from the military.",
      "\"I'm heartbroken,\" said Cmdr. Emily Shilling, a decorated Navy pilot who is also the lead plaintiff in Shilling vs. Trump -- one of three federal lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's executive order barring transgender service members.",
      "Shilling, who is based in the D.C. area, is also the president of Sparta Pride -- an organization advocating for 2,400 transgender people in the military and those who hope to join.",
      "Reflecting on the upcoming parade commemorating the 250th anniversary of the Army's founding, Shilling, who has served since 2005, told ABC News that \"military might does not equal patriotism.\"",
      "\"The members who take an oath and dedicate their lives to service -- that's patriotism, whether or not we have tanks or rocket launchers, that has nothing to do with it,\" Shilling said.",
      "And according to Shilling, for active duty members of Sparta, who were faced with the \"heartbreaking\" decision to voluntarily separate from the military or get kicked out, abandoning their commitment to serving their country is what's \"keeping them up at night.\"",
      "\"When I sit in these town halls that we do with Sparta, people are really struggling with the idea of giving up or quitting, or, you know, not fulfilling their oath,\" she said. \"And that's actually what's keeping these men, women and folks you know, up at night. They feel like they have a duty to keep serving and keep fighting.\"",
      "The Pentagon's new ban went into effect in early May shortly after the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration could enforce the ban on transgender people in the military while legal challenges proceed in lower courts.",
      "After the Supreme Court ruling, the Pentagon issued a memo giving active duty service members until June 6 -- last Friday -- to self-identify and begin the voluntary separation process. Transgender service members in the reserve forces have until July 7 to voluntarily separate.",
      "The memo also stated that after June 6, military commanders will be told to identify people in their units who have a diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria or exhibit symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria. The move would initiate a referral to an annual health check-up that would begin what could be a lengthy process for each individual that could lead to their removal from the military.",
      "Shilling, who will be eligible for retirement at 20 years in September, told ABC News that faced with these options, she chose to self-identify and begin the process of voluntarily separating from the military, but noted that she made the decision \"under duress.\"",
      "\"I hit my retirement date in September. So if I didn't volunteer at that time, I could theoretically be kicked out between June and September and lose everything,\" she said. \"So it was very much a decision made under duress. You know, I was coerced into it because we knew that the voluntary separation would give me an honorable discharge with some portion of my retirement, and I'd be able to keep all of my benefits.\"",
      "The Pentagon incentivized service members with gender dysphoria to voluntarily separate ahead of the June 6 deadline by offering benefit payment packages that would be more than double what would be received if they were to separate involuntarily. Those who voluntarily separated would not have to risk paying back the recruitment or retention bonuses they may have earned during their military service.",
      "Its policy came after the Trump administration announced a ban on transgender service members in a Jan. 27 executive order, where President Donald Trump directed the Defense Department to revise the policy allowing transgender troops to openly serve.",
      "\"Expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service,\" the order said.",
      "The order further argued that receiving gender-affirming medical care is one of the conditions that is physically and mentally \"incompatible with active duty.\"",
      "Defense officials estimate that as of last December, about 4,240 current active-duty, National Guard and Reserve service members had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria.",
      "There are more than 2.1 million military service members serving on active-duty, National Guard and the Reserves. Advocacy groups have put the actual number of transgender service members as being much higher, at around 15,000.",
      "\"There's a lot of fear,\" Shilling said, reflecting on service members like herself who are losing their jobs.",
      "She also said that being banned from the military has taken an emotional toll on the community -- some of whom have left \"rough homes\" and found a family in the military.",
      "\"For a lot of people, this was, you know, the dream they've always wanted, and now their family is saying, you're not good enough. They're being rejected again by another family,\" she said. \"And that's pretty brutal.\"",
      "When asked how she feels about her decision to voluntarily separate from the military, Shilling said that she is at \"peace\" because she knows that the fight is not over.",
      "\"I'm at peace,\" she said. \"I'm going to thrive, and I'm going to be able to fight this \u2026 and continue to fight for that America that I believe in -- that good, righteous America, and a lot of these service members feel very much the same.\"",

Alex Padilla has continued to defend himself and refute claims by the Trump administration that he \"crashed\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's news conference before federal officers shoved him outside the room, pushed him to the floor and handcuffed him.",
      "Padilla, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety, provided more details about the incident Thursday night during an interview on MSNBC -- in which he said he was not a threat and had merely raised his voice to ask a question.",
      "The senator claimed he did not barge into the news conference, as alleged by Noem, but rather he was in the federal building for an approved scheduled briefing with representatives of the Northern Command. He said that meeting was delayed by Noem's news conference in a nearby room, where she was discussing the administration's use of the National Guard to respond to protests over President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.",
      "Padilla said he decided to go to listen to Noem's news conference and asked the National Guard member and FBI agent escorting with him if he could go.",
      "\"We're, the whole time, being escorted in this federal building by somebody from the National Guard, somebody from the FBI. I've gone through screening. This is a federal building. And so, I tell them, 'Let's go listen to the press conference.' They escort me over to that room,\" Padilla told MSNBC.",

And I spent a few minutes in the back of the room just listening in until the rhetoric, the political rhetoric got to be too much to take. So, I spoke up,\" he later added.",
      "During her news conference, Noem claimed she was going to \"liberate\" Los Angeles \"from the socialists and the burdensome leadership this governor and mayor have placed on this country and this city.\"",
      "Padilla told MSNBC that he felt he needed to speak out, said he introduced himself and started asking a question before the officers pushed him out of the room as news cameras, reporters and onlookers recorded the incident.",
      "Noem said law enforcement reacted as they did because Padilla came toward her without identifying himself. She told Fox News Thursday that no one knew who he was and that he was \"lunging forward.\"",
      "Video of the incident captures Padilla identifying himself and saying he wanted to ask a question as he is pushed out of the room; it's not clear from the video if he identified himself before that point, including as he came forward toward the podium. Padilla was wearing a navy blue polo shirt with a small U.S. Senate logo, but it was covered under a navy blue jacket. He said he was not wearing a U.S. Senate security pin at the time of the incident.",
      "After he was quickly released, he and Noem had a private conversation for \"10-15 minutes\" after the incident, according to both the senator and the secretary.",
      "Noem said that Padilla will likely not be charged.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday said Padilla should be \"ashamed of his childish behavior.\"",
      "\"He crashed the middle of an official press conference being held by a cabinet secretary, recklessly lunged toward the podium where @Sec_Noem was speaking, and then refused to leave the room and follow the directions of law enforcement officers,\" Leavitt posted to X.",
      "Outraged Democratic senators quickly came to Padilla's defense Thursday, claiming Noem and the officers mistreated the senator.",
      "\"This is an administration that has no respect for our democracy, for our institutions, for the separation of powers, for a co-equal branch of government,\" California Sen. Adam Schiff said.",
      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told reporters, \"I've seen that one clip. It is horrible. It is shocking at every level. It's not the America I know.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans chastised Padilla, with Johnson going so far as saying censure might be needed. A vote to censure does not hold any power beyond a public condemnation of the member's behavior and it does not deny the member privileges.",

      "Congressional Democrats and at least one high-profile Republican are slamming the multimillion-dollar cost of the Army's 250th anniversary parade on Saturday that President Donald Trump has long sought to celebrate the military.",
      "Trump has said the cost -- projected to be as much as $45 million for the Army alone, not counting security and other expenses -- will be \"peanuts compared to the value of doing it.\"",
      "However, his critics argue the money could be better spent elsewhere.",
      "\"If it was really about celebrating military families, we could put $30 million toward helping them offset the cost of their child care, food assistance and tuition,\" Sen. Tammy Duckworth said on X. \"But it isn't. Trump is throwing himself a $30 million birthday parade just to stroke his own ego.\"",
      "The Army said it has accounted for spending between $25 million and $45 million on the parade, which will include 6,700 troops and dozens of tanks, military fighting vehicles and aircraft staged on or near the National Mall.",
      "\"Money should be put in medical defense research instead of wasted on some pomp and circumstance for the president,\" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday. \"This is not consistent with what the men and women in uniform deserve.\"",
      "Saturday's parade also falls on Trump's 79th birthday, and when it ends near the White House, the Army's Golden Knights parachute team will present him with an American flag, after which he'll administer the constitutional oath to Army enlistees.",
      "\"We all like to enjoy a nice birthday party,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., posted on X. \"But most of us don't celebrate with a $45 million taxpayer-funded military parade.",
      "\"Save taxpayer money. Have a birthday cake and blow out a few candles,\" he said. \"Don't shut down the capital and roll out 60-ton tanks through the streets.\"",

      "Some Democrats echoed that criticism.",
      "\"It's outrageous,\" Rep. Yassamin Ansari, D-Ariz., said. \"This is something that would happen in North Korea, not the United States of America. Donald Trump thinks he's a king. He's not. He was elected as president of the United States, and he should act as such.\"",
      "Army spokesman Steve Warren defended the parade, saying, \"It is a lot of money, but I think that amount of money is dwarfed by 250 years of service and sacrifice that American soldiers have given this country.",
      "\"We're looking at this as an opportunity to really strengthen the connection between America and her Army,\" he added. \"So, yeah, it's a lot of money, but it pales in comparison to what we're selling.\"",
      "The White House this week also requested a flyover by the Air Force Thunderbirds.",
      "When asked Thursday what he hopes the public will remember about the parade, Trump said, \"How great our country is, very simple, and how strong our military is.\"",
      "\"We have the strongest military in the world,\" he added.",
      "The White House has not responded to requests for a total cost estimate that would include money spent on security and other arrangements.",
      "Several Republicans say they're skipping the parade due to prior commitments, including House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said she would attend and defended the display.",
      "\"Washington D.C. is the safest it's ever been!!\" she wrote. \"I wish our great military men and women could just stay here. I am so excited for the parade celebrating the 250th anniversary of our United States Army!!\"",
      "Protests of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown are planned across the country to counterprogram the parade, with the flagship \"No Kings\" protest occurring in Philadelphia. Nine small protests are also expected in Washington, according to the Secret Service and local officials. Trump has warned protesters will be met with \"heavy force.\"",
      "On Thursday, he disputed the characterization of him as a king. \"I don't feel like a king. I have to go through hell to get stuff approved,\" he said, adding, \"No, no, we're not a king. We're not a king at all.\"",

      "The swell of optimism ended six straight months of worsening attitudes.",
      "Consumer sentiment improved more than expected in June, indicating a swell of optimism as President Donald Trump rolled back some tariffs in recent weeks.",
      "The resurgence of shopper attitudes ended six consecutive months of worsening sentiment, University of Michigan survey data on Friday showed. Before the uptick, consumer sentiment had fallen near its lowest level since a bout of inflation three years ago.",
      "Year-ahead inflation expectations, meanwhile, dropped sharply from 6.6% last month to 5.1% in June, the data showed. The anticipated inflation level would still mark a major increase from the current year-over-year inflation of 2.4%.",
      "The improvement of sentiment was reflected across all demographics, including age, income, wealth, political party and geographic region, Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu said in a statement.",
      "In recent weeks, Trump has dialed back some of his steepest tariffs, easing the costs imposed upon importers. Such companies typically pass along a share of the higher tax burden in the form of price hikes.",
      "A trade agreement between the U.S. and China slashed tit-for-tat tariffs between the world's two largest economies and triggered a surge in the stock market. Within days, Wall Street firms softened their forecasts of a downturn.",
      "The U.S.-China accord came weeks after the White House paused a large swath of Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs targeting dozens of countries. Trump also eased sector-specific tariffs targeting autos and rolled back duties on some goods from Mexico and Canada.",
      "Still, an across-the-board 10% tariff applies to nearly all imports, except for semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and some other items. Those tariffs stand in legal limbo, however, after a pair of federal court rulings late last month.",
      "Tariffs remain in place for steel, aluminum and autos, as well as some goods from Canada and Mexico.",
      "Fresh inflation data this week showed a slight acceleration of price increases, but inflation remains near its lowest level since 2021. So far, the economy has defied fears of price hikes, instead giving way to a cooldown of inflation over the months since Trump took office.",
      "Warning signs point to the possibility of elevated prices over the coming months, however.",
      "Nationwide retailers like Walmart and Best Buy have voiced alarm about the possibility they may raise prices as a result of the levies.",
      "The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, said this month it expects U.S. inflation to reach 4% by the end of 2025, which would mark a sharp increase from current levels.",
      "Federal Chair Jerome Powell, in recent months, has warned about the possibility that tariffs may cause what economists call \"stagflation,\" which is when inflation rises and the economy slows.",
      "Stagflation could put the central bank in a difficult position. If the Fed were to raise interest rates, it could help ease inflation, but it may risk an economic downturn. If the Fed were to cut rates in an effort to spur economic growth, the move could unleash faster price increases.",
      "For now, the Fed appears willing to take a wait-and-see approach. At its last meeting, in May, the Fed opted to hold interest rates steady for the second consecutive time.",
      "The Fed will announce its next rate decision on June 18. Investors peg the chances of a decision to leave rates unchanged at 99.9%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, a measure of market sentiment.",

      "President Donald Trump has long bet that he can scare allies into submission",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "President Donald Trump has long bet that he can scare allies into submission \u2014 a gamble that is increasingly being tested ahead of the Group of Seven summit beginning Monday in Canada.",
      "He's threatened stiff tariffs in the belief that other nations would crumple. He's mused about taking over Canada and Greenland. He's suggested he will not honor NATO's obligations to defend partners under attack. And he's used Oval Office meetings to try to intimidate the leaders of Ukraine and South Africa.",
      "But many world leaders see fewer reasons to be cowed by Trump, even as they recognize the risks if he followed through on his threats. They believe he will ultimately back down \u2014 since many of his plans could inflict harm on the U.S. \u2014 or that he can simply be charmed and flattered into cooperating.",
      "\u201cMany leaders still seem intimidated by Trump, but increasingly they are catching on to his pattern of bullying,\u201d said Jeremy Shapiro, research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIn places as diverse as Canada, Iran, China and the EU, we are seeing increasing signs that leaders now recognize that Trump is afraid of anything resembling a fair fight. And so they are increasingly willing to stand up to him.\u201d",
      "In the 22 instances in which Trump has publicly threatened military action since his first term, the U.S. only used force twice, according to a May analysis by Shapiro.",
      "Ahead of the G7 summit, there are already signs of subtle pushback against Trump from fellow leaders in the group. French President Emanuel Macron planned to visit Greenland over the weekend in a show of European solidarity. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said the U.S. is no longer the \u201cpredominant\u201d force in the world after Trump's tariffs created fissures in a decades-long partnership between the U.S. and its northern neighbor.",
      "\u201cWe stood shoulder to shoulder with the Americans throughout the Cold War and in the decades that followed, as the United States played a predominant role on the world stage,\" Carney said this past week in French. \"Today, that predominance is a thing of the past.\u201d",
      "The new prime minister added that with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the U.S. became the global hegemon, a position of authority undermined by Trump's transactional nature that puts little emphasis on defending democratic values or the rule of law.",
      "\u201cNow the United States is beginning to monetize its hegemony: charging for access to its markets and reducing its relative contributions to our collective security,\u201d Carney said.",
      "Israel\u2019s attack on Iran has added a new wrinkle to the global picture as the summit leaders gather to tackle some of the world\u2019s thorniest problems",
      "A senior Canadian official said it was decided early on that the G7 won\u2019t be issuing a joint communiqu\u00e9 as it has at past summits \u2014 an indication of how hard it can be to get Trump on the same page with other world leaders. The White House said individual leader statements will be issued on the issues being discussed.",
      "Speaking last month at a conference in Singapore, Macron called France a \u201cfriend and an ally of the United States\u201d but pushed back against Trump's desire to dominate what other countries do. Macron said efforts to force other nations to choose between the U.S. and China would lead to the breakdown of the global order put in place after World War II.",
      "\u201cWe want to cooperate, but we do not want to be instructed on a daily basis what is allowed, what is not allowed, and how our life will change because of the decision of a single person,\u201d Macron said.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba pushed back against Trump's agenda of levying higher tariffs on imported goods, arguing it would hurt economic growth. The Japanese leader specifically called Trump ahead of the summit to confirm their plans to talk on the sidelines, which is a greater focus for Japan than the summit itself.",
      "\u201cI called him as I also wanted to congratulate his birthday, though one day earlier,\u201d Ishiba said.",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the summit was an opportunity for Trump to \u201cmend\u201d relationships with other countries so China would be unable to exploit differences among the G7.",
      "She said other foreign leaders are \u201cnot intimidated\u201d by Trump's actions, which could be driving them away from tighter commitments with the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe conversations that I\u2019ve had with those leaders suggest that they think that the partnership with the United States has been really important, but they also understand that there are other opportunities,\u201d Shaheen said.",
      "The White House did not respond to emailed questions for this story.",
      "Having originally made his reputation in real estate and hospitality, Trump has taken kindly to certain foreign visitors, such as U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.",
      "Starmer has sought to keep Trump in line with Europe in supporting Ukraine and NATO instead of brokering any truces that would favor Russia. He has echoed the president\u2019s language about NATO members spending more on defense. But in his Oval Office visit, Starmer also pleased Trump by delivering an invite for a state visit from King Charles III.",
      "The German government said it, too, wanted to send a public signal of unity, saying that while Trump's recent meeting with Merz at the White House went harmoniously, the next test is how the relationship plays out in a team setting.",
      "There will also be other world leaders outside of the G7 nations attending the summit in mountainous Kananaskis, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom Trump dressed down in the Oval Office.",
      "Italy's Meloni has positioned herself as a \u201cbridge\u201d between the Trump administration and the rest of Europe. But Italy\u2019s strong support of Ukraine and Trump\u2019s threatened tariffs on European goods have put Meloni, the only European leader to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration, in a difficult position.",
      "Mark Sobel, U.S. chair of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, an independent think tank, said Trump's \u201ctrade policies, backing for right wing European movements, seeming preference for dealing with authoritarians and many of his other actions are alienating our G7 allies,\u201d even if the U.S. president is correct that Europe needs to do more on defense.",
      "But even as other G7 leaders defuse any public disputes with Trump, the U.S. president's vision for the world remains largely incompatible with they want.",
      "\u201cIn short, behind the curtains, and notwithstanding whatever theater, the Kananaskis summit will highlight a more fragmented G7 and an adrift global economy,\" Sobel said.",

    "story": [
      "Democrats in Virginia are holding primary elections Tuesday, and one name is getting talked about a lot: President Donald Trump",
      "RICHMOND, Va. -- RICHMOND, Va. (AP) \u2014",
      "Two Virginia Democrats are battling Tuesday to be their party's nominee for attorney general. Yet, the name mentioned most in their campaigns is not that of their opponent, but rather a man who lives just over the Arlington Memorial Bridge: President Donald Trump.",
      "The barrage of changes Trump has wrought to American culture in the first few months of his second White House residency has ignited the campaigns of Virginia Democrats Jay Jones and Shannon Taylor as they appeal unrelentingly to the most devout swaths of their base ahead of down-ballot primary elections. The primary will also determine the party\u2019s nominations this year for lieutenant governor and some contested seats in the House of Delegates.",
      "In one of only two states electing governors in November \u2014 the other is New Jersey \u2014 the caustic anti-Trump rhetoric could be a hint of what voters nationwide will hear from Democrats in next year's midterm elections, when the stakes will be higher.",
      "Virginia's nominees for governor have been settled by default. Democrat Abigail Spanberger became her party's nominee after running unopposed, and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears was the only contender who gathered enough signatures to be on the ballot. The other statewide races are for attorney general and lieutenant governor, and Democrats in both contests seem to be vying to top each other with anti-Trump rhetoric and caustic ads.",
      "Republicans are not hosting statewide primaries this year, so only Democrats will pick a nominee for lieutenant governor. It's a part-time position that pays about $36,000 a year but is often a stepping stone to higher office. Six Democrats want the job, and most of them have pushed ad after ad on the airwaves and online about their commitment to taking on Trump if elected to the mostly ceremonial role.",
      "In the contest for attorney general, Jones and Taylor are competing in much the same way. Turnout is likely to be sluggish, which means firing up base voters is widely seen as the way to go. The last time a left-wing candidate for governor ran unopposed, roughly 142,000 Democrats voted for an attorney general nominee compared with more than 485,000 this past election cycle.",
      "Still, the AG's race has been spicy, more so when the candidates' criticism isn't directed at each other. Jones and Taylor have lambasted the White House and argued that the administration\u2019s actions should be litigated in court. When they are not lamenting Trump, their attacks are directed toward incumbent Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is seeking reelection.",
      "In their respective campaigns, the Democrats argue that Miyares submits to the president by not suing him. They say that sets him apart from more progressive attorneys general across the United States, who are going to court over such things as birthright citizenship and elections. Their main message: A Democrat will take the White House to trial when Miyares won\u2019t \u2014 and saving democracy starts there.",
      "\u201cThe job is to protect Virginians, to fight for them, to work for them, to keep us safe,\u201d Jones said while campaigning in June in Falls Church, Virginia, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he is not going after them.\u201d",
      "Last month, Taylor told a room full of Democratic voters that Miyares would enable Trump\u2019s overreaches in Virginia, and potentially double down on institutions that don\u2019t comply with the president.",
      "Either way, \u201cthe result is the same for Virginians: getting hurt,\u201d she said.",
      "In a wide-ranging interview in May, Miyares said he identifies as a balls-and-strikes Republican. The former Virginia Beach state delegate, elected top prosecutor in 2021, worked to reduce violent crime. He sought settlements from Big Pharma. When he felt President Joe Biden\u2019s administration overstepped, he went to court.",
      "But as Trump was ushered into office for a second term, Miyares entered new political terrain. Unlike most other states, Virginians will elect their attorney general this November, nearly a year after the country voted for the president and his consequential agenda.",
      "Miyares has waded into the political arena. He often spars on social media with progressive prosecutors throughout Virginia for being too lenient in prosecuting criminal cases.",
      "Still, Miyares rebuffed the notion that suing Trump is his top concern. He said the Democrats looking to replace him fail to understand the nature of his position.",
      "The attorney general touted meaningful work his office has shouldered: holding listening sessions for crime victims, designating resources to support law enforcement and beefing up his office\u2019s prosecutions of child support cases.",
      "He flashed his law enforcement badge, tucked within a leather wallet, and described the emblem as a guidepost for being an effective people\u2019s prosecutor.",
      "\u201cThey seem very obsessed with Donald Trump, whereas I\u2019m obsessed with how am I going to keep Virginians safe?\u201d Miyares said.",

      "As events both planned and chaotically spontaneous play out, many Americans are frantically and sometimes furiously pondering assorted iterations of two questions: What is this country right now? And what should it be?",
      "Consider two quotes from recent days from two very different Americans.",
      "The first came last weekend, during World Pride in Washington, when a 58-year-old gay man from Philadelphia named David Begler summed up what many were messaging in the days leading up to it after months of Donald Trump's increasing attempts to target the LGBTQ community: \"I want us to send a message to the White House to focus on uplifting each other instead of dividing.\u201c",
      "The second came days ahead of the military parade planned Saturday for the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, from the mouth of the president on whose 79th birthday it will be held: \u201cIf there\u2019s any protester that wants to come out, they will be met with very big force,\u201d Donald Trump said. \u201cI haven\u2019t even heard about a protest, but you know, this is people that hate our country, but they will be met with very heavy force.\u201d",
      "Among the competing visions of America in 2025: the desire to protest and seek a redress of grievances against the government vs. the desire for control, order \u2014 and a respect for the government and for authority.",
      "The volatile combination of demonstrations and the U.S. military is a potent one, with its most recent roots in the protest movement of the 1960s against the Vietnam War. A young generation that would later be known as baby boomers regularly squared off against police and sometimes the military over U.S. involvement in what was framed as a war against communism in Southeast Asia. Historians give those protesters a fair bit of the credit for that war ultimately ending in 1975. President Jimmy Carter ultimately pardoned more than 200,000 people who had dodged the draft for that conflict.",
      "Then, as now, many in the establishment criticized protesters bitterly, saying they were undermining a nation to which they should be grateful. Questions of loyalty and betrayal were thrown around. The role of the military in quelling civilian protests was bitterly contested, particularly after Ohio National Guardsmen opened fire and killed four students during antiwar protests in May 1970 at Kent State University.",
      "There are echoes of that this week, not only in Los Angeles but now in Texas, where Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the deployment of 5,000 state National Guard troops ahead of the \u201cNo Kings Day of Defiance\u201d against the Trump administration's ongoing immigration raids. And as protesters in Los Angeles taunt the military and say guardsmen should be \u201cashamed\u201d to face off against what they call a just cause, it's easy to wonder: How can patriotism and protest coexist?",
      "Democracy has always been messy and resistant to consensus. That's part of why the national slogan of the United States is \u201ce pluribus unum\u201d \u2014 \u201cout of many, one.\u201d And Washington, D.C., as the nation's capital, has long been the place where the many have come to make themselves known as part of the one \u2014 and to be noticed.",
      "It was where the \u201cBonus Army\" of World War I veterans marched in 1932 to demand their promised postwar payments and be heard in a demonstration that ended violently. It was where the first National Boy Scout Jamboree was held on the National Mall in 1937. It was where the \u201cMarch on Washington,\u201d a centerpiece of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, ended with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s renowned \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. It was where, in 1995, the \u201cMillion Man March\u201d was held to address concerns of the American Black community, and where hundreds of thousands of women came to Washington largely in protest of Trump, just a day after his first inauguration.",
      "It is also the place where Americans remember, where the memorials to World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War sit. It is where the country erected stone shrines in various shapes and sizes to the presidents it most admired \u2014 Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt. It is the site of museums containing some of the most distilled expressions of culture \u2014 from the Holocaust Museum to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum to the National Museum of African American History.",
      "Is it so hard to believe, then, that two events as opposite as World Pride and a military parade unfold here, within blocks of each other, within a week's time? At a politically fractious moment when some families can hardly break bread without political arguments erupting over Trump, Gaza and Israel, immigration and LGBTQ rights, isn't it possible that the weird and downright uncomfortable juxtaposition of these two starkly different events might be the most American thing of all?",
      "Walt Whitman, one of the most famous poets in American history, had this to say about the the diversity of America when he wrote \u201cI Hear America Singing\u201d to underscore that its citizens all contribute to the nation's song: \u201cI am large. I contain multitudes.\u201d",
      "And in one week in June, at a time when the fate of the United States is being discussed in every direction we turn, the capital of Whitman's nation has become a showcase in displaying those messy democratic multitudes to the world. For better or for worse.",

      "The No Kings Day of Defiance is expected to be the largest single-day mobilization since Trump returned to office, organizers said. Organizers said they are preparing for millions of people to take to the streets across all 50 states and commonwealths.",

      "The fifth week of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs\u2019 sex trafficking trial featured a courthouse appearance by one of his famous friends: Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West",
      "NEW YORK -- The fifth week of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u2019 sex trafficking trial featured four days of testimony from a former Combs' girlfriend who testified under the pseudonym Jane and a surprise appearance at the courthouse on the fifth day by Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West.",
      "Ye said he came to show his support for his good friend but couldn't get into the courtroom and watched for a few minutes on an overflow courtroom monitor.",
      "Combs, the founder of Bad Boy Records, has pleaded not guilty in the trial, which resumes Monday.",
      "Here are key moments from the past week:",
      "Jane testified for six days about her over three-year relationship with Combs, saying her plans to meet him at a New York hotel last September were interrupted by his arrest.",
      "Her testimony consumed four of the week's five trial days as she told about her conflicted feelings toward Combs.",
      "She told a prosecutor: \u201cI just pray for his continued healing, and I pray for peace for him.\u201d And when a defense lawyer asked if she still loved him, she responded: \u201cI do.\u201d",
      "When she completed her testimony and with the jury still in the room, she went to the prosecutor and gave her a warm embrace before proceeding to the defense attorney and hugging her too.",
      "She said she resents she felt forced to have sex with strangers in multiday sex marathons as the man she longed most to cuddle with filmed and fed her drugs to give her energy to satisfy his sexual fantasies.",
      "Her testimony echoed what the jury heard in the trial's first week when Casandra \u201cCassie\u201d Ventura testified for four days that she engaged in hundreds of multiday \u201cfreak-offs\u201d while they dated from 2007 to 2018, having sex with male sex workers in front of Combs, who masturbated, filmed the encounters, and verbalized what he wanted to see sexually.",
      "Jane said she and Combs split up from Halloween 2023 until February 2024. During the break, she said, she flew on another famous rapper's private jet to Las Vegas, joining the celebrity to celebrate his romantic partner's birthday for a night that included dinner, a stripper's club visit and a hotel room party.",
      "In the hotel room, Jane testified, the rapper who was close friends with Combs made a pass at her amid flirtatious banter, saying he had always wanted to have sex with her. She said she danced in the hotel room, where a male sex worker was having sex with a woman, and at some point Jane flashed her breasts.",
      "Jane agreed with a lawyer's assessment that the famous rapper was \u201can individual at the top of the music industry as well ... an icon in the music industry.\u201d",
      "Jane also revealed that the unidentified famous rapper and his partner were looking for someone they could add to their sexual experiences who was \u201cin the lifestyle.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe they were asking me because maybe they just picked up the energy from me or I just maybe assumed that maybe they had already got an inclination that me and Sean had been doing kind of similar things,\u201d she said, noting that she referred a male sex worker she knew.",
      "A day after Jane finished testifying, Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, made a surprise appearance at the courthouse and quickly learned what a tough ticket it is to get into the courtroom where his good friend Combs is on trial.",
      "Ye, wearing all white, was ushered by courthouse security to an overflow courtroom to watch the trial on a video monitor along with others who were unable to get into the courtroom. He lasted only a few minutes there before he made his courthouse exit, saying nothing during his trip except that he was there to support Combs.",
      "It turns out that Combs, the subject of several true-crime TV documentaries, is a bit of a true-crime fan himself.",
      "Jane revealed this week that his favorite show is \u201cDateline,\u201d the magazine-style NBC stalwart that is heavy on murders and mysteries.",
      "She told jurors that, in their alone time together, she and Combs would watch \u201cDateline\u201d for hours \u201ctill we fell asleep.\u201d",
      "Other activities when it was just the two of them included hugging, cuddling and bathing Combs, and giving him foot rubs, Jane testified.",
      "Jane testified that she last saw Combs in August, when they were in their \u201csame routine having sex and everything\u201d when Combs suggested that she invite over the very first male sex worker she had sex with in front of Combs.",
      "She said that afterward, she and Combs continued texting each other and were planning to meet in New York at a hotel in September.",
      "\u201cDid you end up going to New York to see him?\u201d she was asked. \u201cNo,\u201d she answered.",
      "\u201cWhy not?\u201d she was asked before she responded: \u201cBecause he got arrested.\u201d",
      "The courtroom rules surrounding Jane's testimony were the strictest yet in a bid to protect her identity from becoming common knowledge.",
      "But the rules imposed by the judge became too much for defense attorney Marc Agnifilo, who protested that Jane was blocked from telling more about the hotel party in January 2024 with the famous, though unidentified, rapper.",
      "Agnifilo said the defense had consented to the \u201cpseudonymity\u201d of Jane.",
      "\u201cWhat we didn\u2019t consent to, and we don\u2019t, most respectfully, is that these events which play important parts in the background of some of the most critical events in the trial, should be in any way not fully public,\u201d he said.",
      "He said names should have been released.",
      "\u201cPart of the reason that trials are fully public is so if other people realize they know something about an event that\u2019s discussed in a public courtroom, they could come forward and they could share whatever their recollection is about it,\u201d he said.",
      "The fate of one anonymous juror was in limbo after the judge said Friday he will reconsider his decision to oust the juror even though he suspects he might have an \"agenda.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian said he had decided that conflicting answers from the juror about where he primarily lived \u2014 in New Jersey or New York \u2014 raised questions about his credibility and whether he was answering questions in a bid to stay on the jury. If the juror does primarily live with a girlfriend in New Jersey, he would be outside the court district and disqualified.",
      "Prosecutors said the juror's dismissal is required because of his conflicting answers. Defense lawyers argued that prosecutors were only trying to disqualify a Black juror and that his dismissal could spoil an otherwise diverse panel of jurors.",
      "The judge bristled at the suggestion that race was a factor, saying there was no support for claims that prosecutors did not use race-neutral arguments to exclude jurors during jury selection and now.",

      "A federal program that provides benefits to families of police officers and firefighters who die and become disabled on duty is rapidly growing while facing criticism for increasing delays in deciding claims.",
      "Congress created the Public Safety Officers\u2019 Benefits program in 1976 to guarantee that the spouses and children of officers who put their lives on the line would receive financial support.",
      "But repeated expansions in eligibility approved by Congress, including three passed in the last five years, have made the program more popular and complex to administer. Critics say the program fails some families by taking too long to grant or deny benefits and making inconsistent rulings.",
      "An Associated Press analysis found that hundreds of families are waiting years to learn whether they qualify for payments, and more are ultimately being denied.",
      "New Jersey widow Sharline Volcy learned this month that she'd been awarded the benefits, more than 3 1/2 years after her husband, Ronald Donat, died while training at the Gwinnett County Police Academy in Georgia.",
      "Volcy said she was grateful for the aid, which will provide some financial security and help pay for her two daughters to go to college. But she said the long wait was stressful, when she was told time and again the claim remained under review and ultimately saw her inquiries ignored.",
      "\u201cThey told me they didn't know how long it would take because they don't have a deadline. That's the hardest thing to hear,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt defeated.\u201d",
      "She said lawyers didn't want to take the case, and a plea for help to her congressperson went nowhere. She said she'd given up hope and was lucky she had a job as an airport gate agent in the meantime.",
      "Volcy's experience isn't unique, and some cases take longer.",
      "As of late April, more than 120 claims by surviving relatives or disabled first responders have been awaiting initial determinations or rulings on their appeals for more than five years, according AP's findings. About a dozen have waited over a decade for an answer.",
      "The program has a goal of making determinations within one year but has not taken steps to track its progress, according to a recent Government Accountability Office report.",
      "But roughly three in 10 cases have not met that timeframe in recent years. As of late late April, 900 claims had been pending longer than one year. That includes claims from nearly every state.",
      "Republican lawmakers have introduced a bill to require the program to make determinations within 270 days.",
      "Over the last year, the denial rate has increased, with roughly one in three death and disability claims getting rejected.",
      "Applicants can appeal to a hearing officer and then the director if they choose, but that isn't common. Many say they can't afford attorneys or want to get on with their lives.",
      "Justice Department officials, who oversee the program, say they\u2019re making complicated decisions about whether cases meet legal criteria.",
      "\u201cDeath and disability claims involving complex medical and causation issues, voluminous evidence and conflicting medical opinions, take longer to determine, as do claims in various stages of appeal,\u201d they said in a statement.",
      "The program started as a simple $50,000 payout for the families of officers who were fatally shot on duty or died as a result of other violence or dangers.",
      "But Congress expanded the program in 1990 to cover some first responders who were disabled on duty, which made some determinations harder to reach. A 1998 law added educational benefits for the spouses and children of those deceased and disabled officers.",
      "Since 2020, Congress has passed three laws making many other types of deaths and disabilities eligible, including deaths related to COVID-19, deaths and injuries of those working rescue and cleanup operations after the September 2001 attacks, and responders who committed suicide under certain circumstances.",
      "Annual claims have more than doubled in the last five years, from 500 in 2019 to roughly 1,200 today.",
      "While many applicants have criticized the increasing delays, the leading group that represents the relatives of officers who die on duty has been silent.",
      "Critics say that\u2019s because the group, Concerns of Police Survivors, has a financial incentive not to criticize the program, which has awarded it tens of millions of dollars in grant funding in recent decades.",
      "The Missouri-based nonprofit recently received a new $6 million grant from the program to for its work with deceased officers\u2019 relatives, including counseling, hosting memorial events, educating agencies about the program and assisting with claims.",
      "The group\u2019s founder and retired executive director, Suzie Sawyer, said she was warned many years ago that fighting too hard for claimants could jeopardize its grant funding.",
      "But current spokesperson Sara Slone said advocacy isn't the group's mission and that it works \u201chand in hand\u201d with PSOB to assist applicants and provide education about benefits.",
      "Lisa Afolayan\u2019s husband died after a training exercise at the Border Patrol academy more than 16 years ago, but she\u2019s still fighting the program for benefits.",
      "An autopsy found that Nate Afolayan died from heat illness after completing a 1.5-mile test run in 88 degree heat, at a high altitude in the New Mexico desert.",
      "The program had awarded benefits to families after similar training deaths, dating back to an officer who died at an academy in 1988.",
      "But its independent investigation blamed Nate\u2019s death on sickle cell trait, a genetic condition that's usually benign but has been linked to rare exertion-related deaths in police, military and sports training.",
      "The program denied Lisa\u2019s claim and her subsequent appeals, arguing the death wasn't the result of heat along and didn't qualify.",
      "The program stood by its denial in 2024, even after a federal appeals court said it may have failed to adequately consider the weather\u2019s role and violated a law barring discrimination on the basis of genetic information.",
      "The appeals court is currently considering Lisa\u2019s second appeal, even as the couple\u2019s two children reach college age.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The massive military parade that President Donald Trump has long wanted is set to step off from the Lincoln Memorial on Saturday evening, with tanks, bands and thousands of troops.",
      "And the biggest question marks are whether it will be overshadowed or delayed by either the weather in Washington or planned protests elsewhere around the country.",
      "Falling on Trump\u2019s 79th birthday, the parade was added just a few weeks ago to the Army\u2019s long-planned 250th anniversary celebration. It has triggered criticism for its price tag of up to $45 million and the possibility that the lumbering tanks could tear up city streets. The Army has taken a variety of steps to protect the streets, including laying metal plates down along the route.",
      "The daylong display of America\u2019s Army comes as Trump has shown his willingness to use his fighting forces in ways other U.S. presidents have typically avoided, inviting an array of lawsuits and accusations that he is politicizing the military.",
      "He has deployed the California National Guard and U.S. Marines to provide security during Los Angeles protests tied to immigration raids. It marks the first time in 60 years that a president activated the National Guard on federal orders inside a state without a governor\u2019s permission, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom has filed a lawsuit to stop the deployments.",
      "Earlier in the week, Trump raised eyebrows during a speech at Fort Bragg when members of the 82nd Airborne Division were directed to stand behind Trump and they booed and cheered during his incendiary remarks, including condemnation of his predecessor, Joe Biden. There also was a pop-up \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d merchandise stand nearby selling souvenirs to troops in uniform.",
      "The Defense Department has a doctrine that prohibits troops from participating in political activity while in uniform. Members of Congress and military leaders have expressed concerns about the political displays during the speech at Fort Bragg.",
      "Trump so far has shrugged off concerns about the parade cost, the rainy forecast and the potential for protests.",
      "\u201cWhat a day it will be!!!\u201d Trump wrote on his social media site, adding later that he hoped the weather would cooperate but that if it doesn't, \u201cthat brings you good luck. That\u2019s OK too. Doesn\u2019t matter. Doesn\u2019t affect the tanks at all. Doesn\u2019t affect the soldiers. They\u2019re used to it. They\u2019re tough. Smart.\u201d",
      "As for the protests, he warned that \u201cthey will be met with very big force.\u201d",
      "The \u201cNo Kings\u201d rallies planned in hundreds of cities nationwide are meant to counter what organizers say are Trump\u2019s plans to feed his ego on his 79th birthday and Flag Day. No protests are scheduled to take place in Washington, D.C., however, and officials have said they so far have no indication of any security threat.",
      "About 6 in 10 Americans say Saturday\u2019s parade is \u201cnot a good use\u201d of government money, including the vast majority of people, 78%, who neither approve nor disapprove of the parade overall, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "The parade will wind down Constitution Avenue, which is already lined with security fencing and barriers. Army helicopters and aircraft will fly above, and the march will be capped off by a parachute jump, a concert featuring \u201cGod Bless the U.S.A.\u201d singer Lee Greenwood and fireworks.",
      "With rain expected, there is a chance the parade could be interrupted by thunderstorms.",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly has said the march will go on rain or shine. But it could be delayed if there is lightning, with authorities quick to empty the expansive National Mall if it happens during major events.",
      "The parade fulfills Trump's expressed desire for a big parade that he tried to get done in his first presidential term after seeing one in France on Bastille Day in 2017. Trump said that after watching the two-hour procession along the famed Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, he wanted an even grander one on Pennsylvania Avenue.",
      "The Army expects as many as 200,000 people could attend the festival and parade. The festival will begin around 9:30 a.m. EDT and feature fitness competitions, demonstrations, equipment displays, music and a cake-cutting ceremony.",
      "The parade is set to begin at 6:30 p.m. EDT, but parts of it \u2014 including the horse-drawn caissons and other units \u2014 start at the Pentagon, head over a bridge and meet up with some of the heavier tanks and equipment. Officials did not want the more-than-60-ton M1A1 Abrams tanks and Stryker vehicles crossing the bridge.",
      "Timed down to the minute, the march will be divided into sections by history \u2014 with equipment and troops in full dress from each period.",
      "It will include a total of 6,169 soldiers and 128 Army tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery, while 62 aircraft fly overhead.",
      "At the end of the parade, Trump will swear in 250 new or reenlisting troops, and the Army's Golden Knights parachute team will jump onto the Mall. That will be followed by the concert and fireworks.",

To them, it\u2019s just a business. They\u2019re just pushing paper.\u201d",
      "Afolayan's case is part of a backlog of claims plaguing the fast-growing Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program. Hundreds of families of deceased and disabled officers are waiting years to learn whether they qualify for the life-changing payments, and more are ultimately being denied, an Associated Press analysis of program data found.",
      "The program is falling far short of its goal of deciding claims within one year. Nearly 900 have been pending for longer than that, triple the number from five years earlier, in a backlog that includes cases from nearly every state, according to AP\u2019s review, which was based on program data through late April.",

      "Today, the program sees 1,200 claims annually, up from 500 in 2019.",
      "The wait time for decisions and rate of denials have risen alongside the caseload. Roughly one of every three death and disability claims were rejected over the last year.",
      "U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and other Republicans recently introduced legislation to require the program to make determinations within 270 days, expressing outrage over the case of an officer disabled in a mass shooting who's waited years for a ruling. Similar legislation died last year.",

      "Nate loved his 10 weeks at the academy, Lisa said, despite needing medical treatment several times \u2014 he was shot with pepper spray in the face and became dizzy during a water-based drill.",
      "His classmates found him to be a natural leader in elite shape and chose him to speak at graduation, they recalled in interviews with investigators.",
      "He prepared a speech with the line, \u201cWe are all warriors that stand up and fight for what's right, just and lawful.\"",
      "But on April 30, 2009 \u2014 days before the ceremony \u2014 a Border Patrol official called Lisa. Nate, 29, had fainted after his final training run and was hospitalized.",
      "It was dusty and 88 degrees in the high desert that afternoon. Agents had to complete the 1.5-mile run in 13 minutes, at an altitude of 3,400 feet. Nate had warned classmates it was too hot to wear their black academy shirts, but they voted to do so anyway, records show.",
      "Nate, 29, finished in just over 11 minutes but then struggled to breathe and collapsed.",
      "Now Nate was being airlifted to a Lubbock, Texas, hospital for advanced treatment. Lisa booked a last-minute flight, arriving the next day.",
      "A doctor told her Nate\u2019s organs had shut down and they couldn't save his life. The hospital needed permission to end life-saving efforts. One nurse delivered chest compressions; another held Lisa tightly as she yelled: \u201cThat\u2019s it! I can\u2019t take it anymore!\u201d",
      "Lisa became a single mother. The girls were 3 and 1.",
      "Her only comfort, she said, was knowing Nate died living his dream \u2014 serving his adopted country.",
      "When she first applied for benefits, Lisa included the death certificate that listed heat illness as the cause of Nate\u2019s death.",
      "The aid could help her family. She'd been studying to become a nurse but had to abandon that plan. She relied on Social Security survivors\u2019 benefits and workers\u2019 compensation while working at gyms as a trainer or receptionist and dabbling in real estate.",
      "The program had paid benefits for a handful of similar training deaths, dating to a Massachusetts officer who suffered heat stroke and dehydration in 1988. But program staff wanted another opinion on Nate\u2019s death. They turned to outside forensic pathologist Dr. Stephen Cina.",
      "Cina concluded the autopsy overlooked the \u201cmost significant factor\u201d: Nate carried sickle cell trait, a condition that's usually benign but has been linked to rare exertion-related deaths in military, sports and law enforcement training.",
      "Cina opined that exercising in a hot climate at high altitude triggered a crisis in which Nate\u2019s red blood cells became misshapen, depriving his body of oxygen. Cina, who stopped consulting for the benefits program in 2020 after hundreds of case reviews, declined to comment.",
      "Nate learned he had the condition, carried by up to 3 million U.S. Black citizens, after a blood test following his second daughter\u2019s birth. The former high school basketball player had never experienced any problems.",
      "A Border Patrol spokesperson declined to say whether academy leaders knew of the condition, which experts say can be managed with precautions such as staying hydrated, avoiding workouts in extreme temperatures and altitudes, and taking rest breaks.",
      "Under the benefit program\u2019s rules, Afolayan\u2019s death would need to be \u201cthe direct and proximate result\u201d of an injury he suffered on duty to qualify. It couldn't be the result of ordinary physical strain.",
      "The program in 2012 rejected the claim, saying the hot, dry, high climate was one factor, but not the most important.",
      "It had been more than two years since Lisa Afolayan applied and three since Nate's death.",
      "Most rejected applicants don\u2019t exercise their option to appeal to an independent hearing officer, saying they can't afford attorneys or want to get on with their lives.",
      "But Lisa Afolayan appealed with help from a border patrol union. A one-day hearing was held in late 2012. The hearing officer denied her claim more than a year later, saying the \u201cperfect storm\u201d of factors causing the death didn't include a qualifying injury.",
      "Lisa and her daughters moved from California to Texas. They visited the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, where they saw Nate's name.",
      "Four years passed without an update on the claim. Lisa learned the union had failed to exercise its final appeal, to the program director, due to an oversight. The union didn't respond to AP emails seeking comment.",
      "Then she met Suzie Sawyer, founder and retired executive director of Concerns of Police Survivors. Sawyer had recently helped win a long battle to obtain benefits in the death of another federal agent who\u2019d collapsed during training.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018Lisa, this could be the fight of your life, and it could take forever,'\" Sawyer recalled. \"'Are you willing to do it?\u2019 She goes, \u2018hell yes.\u2019\u201d",
      "The two persuaded the program to hear the appeal even though the deadline had passed. They introduced a list of similar claims that had been granted and new evidence: A Tennessee medical examiner concluded the hot, dry environment and altitude were key factors causing Nate\u2019s organ-system failure.",
      "But the program was unmoved. The acting Bureau of Justice Assistance director upheld the denial in 2020.",
      "Such rulings usually aren\u2019t public, but Lisa fumed as she learned through contacts about some whose deaths qualified, including a trooper who had an allergic reaction to a bee sting, an intoxicated FBI agent who crashed his car, and another officer with sickle cell trait who died after a training run on a hot day.",
      "In 2022, Lisa thought she might have finally prevailed when a federal appeals court ordered the program to take another look at her application.",
      "A three-judge panel said the program erred by failing to consider whether the heat, humidity and altitude during the run were \u201cthe type of unusual or out-of-the-ordinary climatic conditions that would qualify.\u201d",
      "The judges also said it may have been illegal to rely on sickle cell trait for the denial under a federal law prohibiting employers from discrimination on the basis of genetic information.",
      "It was great timing: The girls were in high school and could use the monthly benefit of $1,530 to help pay for college. The family\u2019s Social Security and workers\u2019 compensation benefits would end soon.",
      "But the program was in no hurry. Nearly two years passed without a ruling despite inquiries from Afolayan and her lawyer.",
      "The Bureau of Justice Assistance director upheld the denial in February 2024, ruling that the climate on that day 15 years earlier wasn\u2019t \u201cunusually adverse.\u201d The decision concluded the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act didn't apply since the program wasn\u2019t Afolayan\u2019s employer.",
      "Arnold & Porter, a Washington law firm now representing Afolayan pro bono, has appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.",
      "Her attorney John Elwood said the program has gotten bogged down in minutiae while losing sight of the bigger picture: that an officer died during mandatory training. He said government lawyers are fighting him just as hard, \u201cif not harder,\u201d than on any other case he\u2019s handled.",
      "Months after filing their briefs, oral arguments haven't been set.",
      "\u201cThis has been my life for 16 years,\u201d Lisa Afolayan said. \u201cSometimes I just chuckle and keep moving because what else am I going to do?\u201d",

      "The military parade to mark the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary and its convergence with President Donald Trump\u2019s 79th birthday are combining to create a peacetime outlier in U.S. history",
      "The military parade to mark the Army's 250th anniversary and its convergence with President Donald Trump's 79th birthday are combining to create a peacetime outlier in U.S. history. Yet it still reflects global traditions that serve a range of political and cultural purposes.",
      "Variations on the theme have surfaced among longtime NATO allies in Europe, one-party and authoritarian states and history's darkest regimes.",
      "The oldest democratic ally of the U.S. holds a military parade each July 14 to commemorate one of the seminal moments of the French Revolution. It inspired \u2014 or at least stoked \u2014 Trump's idea for a Washington version.",
      "On July 14, 1789, French insurgents stormed the Bastille, which housed prisoners of Louis XVI\u2019s government. Revolutionaries commenced a F\u00eate de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration as a day of national unity and pride the following year, even with the First French Republic still more than two years from being established.",
      "The Bastille Day parade has rolled annually since 1880. Now, it proceeds down an iconic Parisian route, the Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. It passes the Arc de Triomphe \u2014 a memorial with tributes to the French Revolution, Napoleonic Wars and World War I \u2014 and eventually in front of the French president, government ministers and invited foreign guests.",
      "Trump attended in 2017, early in his first presidency, as U.S. troops marched as guests. The spectacle left him openly envious.",
      "\u201cIt was one of the greatest parades I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Trump told French President Emanuel Macron. \u201cIt was military might, and I think a tremendous thing for France and for the spirit of France. We\u2019re going to have to try and top it.\u201d",
      "In the United Kingdom, King Charles III serves as ceremonial (though not practical) head of U.K. armed forces. Unlike in France and the U.S., where elected presidents wear civilian dress even at military events, Charles dons elaborate dress uniforms \u2014 medals, sash, sword, sometimes even a bearskin hat and chin strap.",
      "He does it most famously at Trooping the Colour, a parade and troop inspection to mark the British monarch\u2019s official birthday, regardless of their actual birthdate. (The U.S. Army has said it has no specific plans to recognize Trump\u2019s birthday on Saturday.)",
      "In 2023, Charles\u2019 first full year as king, he rode on horseback to inspect 1,400 representatives of the most prestigious U.K. regiments. His mother, Queen Elizabeth II, used a carriage over the last three decades of her 70-year reign.",
      "The British trace Trooping the Colour back to King Charles II, who reigned from 1660-1685. It became an annual event under King George III, described in the American colonists\u2019 Declaration of Independence as a figure of \u201cabsolute Despotism (and) Tyranny.\u201d",
      "Grandiose military pomp is common under modern authoritarians, especially those who have seized power via coups. It sometimes serves as a show of force meant to ward off would-be challengers \u2014 and to seek legitimacy and respect from other countries.",
      "Cuba\u2019s Fidel Castro, who wore military garb routinely, held parades to commemorate the revolution he led on Dec. 2, 1959. In 2017, then-President Ra\u00fal Castro refashioned the event into a Fidel tribute shortly after his brother\u2019s death. Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, known as \u201cComandante Ch\u00e1vez,\u201d presided over frequent parades until his 2013 death. His successor, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has worn military dress at similar events.",
      "North Korean dictator Kim Jung Un, who famously bonded with Trump in a 2018 summit, used a 2023 military parade to show off his daughter and potential successor, along with pieces of his isolated country's nuclear arsenal. The event in Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square \u2014 named for Kim's grandfather \u2014 marked the North Korean Army's 75th birthday. Kim watched from a viewing stand as missiles other weaponry moved by and goose-stepping soldiers marched past him chanting, \u201cDefend with your life, Paektu Bloodline\u201d \u2014 referring to the Kim family's biological ancestry.",
      "In China, Beijing's one-party government stages its National Day Parade every 10 years to project civic unity and military might. The most recent events, held in 2009 and 2019, involved trucks carrying nuclear missiles designed to evade U.S. defenses, as well as other weaponry.",
      "Legions of troops, along with those hard assets, streamed past President Xi Jinping and other leaders gathered in Tiananmen Square in 2019 as spectators waved Chinese flags and fighter jets flew above.",
      "Earlier this spring, Xi joined Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 another strongman leader Trump has occasionally praised \u2014 in Moscow's Red Square for the annual \u201cVictory Day\u201d parade. The May 9 event commemorates the Soviet Union's role in defeating Nazi Germany in World War II \u2014 a global conflict in which China and the Soviet Union, despite not being democracies, joined the Allied Powers in fighting the Axis Powers led by Germany and Japan.",
      "Large civic-military displays were, of course, a feature in Nazi Germany and fascist Italy before and during World War II. Chilling footage of such events lives on as a reminder of the dangers of authoritarian extremism.",
      "Among those frequent occasions: a parade capping Germany\u2019s multiday observance of Adolf Hitler\u2019s 50th birthday in 1939. (Some far-right extremists in Europe still mark the anniversary of Hitler's birth.) The four-hour march through Berlin on April 20, 1939, included more than 40,000 personnel across the Army, Navy, Luftwaffe (Air Force) and Schutzstaffel (commonly known as the \u201cSS.\u201d) Hundreds of thousands of spectators lined the streets. The F\u00fchrer\u2019s invited guests numbered 20,000.",

      "The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture is one of the largest repositories of Black history in the country",
      "NEW YORK -- It\u2019s one of the largest repositories of Black history in the country \u2014 and its most devoted supporters say not enough people know about it. The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture hopes to change that Saturday, as it celebrates its centennial with a festival combining two of its marquee annual events.",
      "The Black Comic Book Festival and the Schomburg Literary Festival will run across a full day and will feature readings, panel discussions, workshops, children\u2019s story times, and cosplay, as well as a vendor marketplace. Saturday\u2019s celebration takes over 135th Street in Manhattan between Malcom X and Adam Clayton Powell boulevards.",
      "Founded in New York City during the height of the Harlem Renaissance, the Schomburg Center will spend the next year exhibiting signature objects curated from its massive catalog of Black literature, art, recordings and films.",
      "Artists, writers and community leaders have gone the center to be inspired, root their work in a deep understanding of the vastness of the African diaspora, and spread word of the global accomplishments of Black people.",
      "It\u2019s also the kind of place that, in an era of backlash against race-conscious education and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, exists as a free and accessible branch of the New York Public Library system. It\u2019s open to the public during regular business hours, but its acclaimed research division requires an appointment.",
      "\u201cThe longevity the Schomburg has invested in preserving the traditions of the Black literary arts is worth celebrating, especially in how it sits in the canon of all the great writers that came beforehand,\u201d said Mahogany Brown, an author and poet-in-residence at the Lincoln Center, who will participate in Saturday's literary festival.",
      "For the centennial, the Schomburg\u2019s leaders have curated more than 100 items for an exhibition that tells the center\u2019s story through the objects, people, and the place \u2014 the historically Black neighborhood of Harlem \u2014 that shaped it. Those objects include a visitor register log from 1925-1940 featuring the signatures of Black literary icons and thought leaders, such as Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes; materials from the Fab 5 Freddy collection, documenting the earliest days of hip hop; and actor and director Ossie Davis\u2019s copy of the \u201cPurlie Victorious\u201d stage play script.",
      "An audio guide to the exhibition has been narrated by actor and literacy advocate LeVar Burton, the former host of the long-running TV show \u201cReading Rainbow.\u201d",
      "Whether they are new to the center or devoted supporters, visitors to the centennial exhibition will get a broader understanding of the Schomburg\u2019s history, the communities it has served, and the people who made it possible, said Joy Bivins, the Director of the Schomburg Center, who curated the centennial collection.",
      "\u201cVisitors will understand how the purposeful preservation of the cultural heritage of people of African descent has generated and fueled creativity across time and disciplines,\u201d Bivins said.",
      "Novella Ford, associate director of public programs and exhibitions, said the Schomburg Center approaches its work through a Black lens, focusing on Black being and Black aliveness as it addresses current events, theories, or issues.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re constantly connecting the present to the past, always looking back to move forward, and vice versa,\u201d Ford said.",
      "Still, many people outside the Schomburg community remain unaware of the center\u2019s existence \u2014 a concerning reality at a time when the Harlem neighborhood continues to gentrify around it and when the Trump administration is actively working to restrict the kind of race-conscious education and initiatives embedded in the center\u2019s mission.",
      "\u201cWe amplify scholars of color,\u201d Ford said. \u201cIt\u2019s about reawakening. It gives us the tools and the voice to push back by affirming the beauty, complexity, and presence of Black identity.\u201d",
      "The Schomburg Center has 11 million items in one of the oldest and largest collections of materials documenting the history and culture of people of African descent. That\u2019s a credit to founder Arturo Schomburg, an Afro-Latino historian born to a German father and African mother in Santurce, Puerto Rico. He was inspired to collect materials on Afro-Latin Americans and African American culture after a teacher told him that Black people lacked major figures and a noteworthy history.",
      "Schomburg moved to New York in 1891 and, during the height of the Harlem Renaissance in 1926, sold his collection of approximately 4,000 books and pamphlets to the New York Public Library. Selections from Schomburg\u2019s personal holdings, known as the seed library, are part of the centennial exhibition.",
      "Ernestine Rose, who was the head librarian at the 135th Street branch, and Catherine Latimer, the New York Public Library\u2019s first Black librarian, built on Schomburg\u2019s donation by documenting Black culture to reflect the neighborhoods around the library.",
      "Today, the library serves as a research archive of art, artifacts, manuscripts, rare books, photos, moving images, and recorded sound. Over the years, it has grown in size, from a reading room on the third floor to three buildings that include a small theater and an auditorium for public programs, performances and movie screenings.",
      "Tammi Lawson, who has been visiting the Schomburg Center for over 40 years, recently noticed the absence of Black women artists in the center\u2019s permanent collection. Now, as the curator of the arts and artifacts division, she is focused on acquiring works by Black women artists from around the world, adding to an already impressive catalog at the center.",
      "\u201cPreserving Black art and artifacts affirms our creativity and our cultural contributions to the world,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cWhat makes the Schomburg Center\u2019s arts and artifacts division so unique and rare is that we started collecting 50 years before anyone else thought to do it. Therefore, we have the most comprehensive collection of Black art in a public institution.\u201d",
      "For years, the Schomburg aimed to uplift New York\u2019s Black community through its Junior Scholars Program, a tuition-free program that awards dozens of youth from 6th through 12th grade. The scholars gain access to the center\u2019s repository and use it to create a multimedia showcase reflecting the richness, achievements, and struggles of today\u2019s Black experience.",
      "It\u2019s a lesser-known aspect of the Schomburg Center\u2019s legacy. That\u2019s in part because some in the Harlem community felt a divide between the institution and the neighborhood it purports to serve, said Damond Haynes, a former coordinator of interpretive programs at the center, who also worked with the Junior Scholars Program. But Harlem has changed since Haynes started working for the program about two decades ago.",
      "\u201cThe Schomburg was like a castle,\u201d Haynes said. \"It was like a church, you know what I mean? Only the members go in. You admire the building.\u201d",
      "For those who are exposed to the center's collections, the impact on their sense of self is undeniable, Haynes said. Kids are learning about themselves like Black history scholars, and it's like many families are passing the torch in a right of passage, he said.",
      "\u201cA lot of the teens, the avenues that they pick during the program, media, dance, poetry, visual art, they end up going into those programs,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cA lot the teens actually find their identity within the program.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Shortly after they began guarding a Los Angeles federal building Friday, U.S. Marines detained a man who had walked onto the property and did not immediately hear their commands to stop.",
      "The brief detention marked the first time federal troops have detained a civilian since they were deployed to the nation's second-largest city by President Donald Trump in response to protests over the administration's immigration arrests. The Marines were activated earlier this week but began their duties Friday.",
      "The man, Marcos Leao, was later released without charges and said the Marines were just doing their jobs.",
      "A U.S. Army North spokesperson said the troops have the authority to temporarily detain people under specific circumstances. He said those detentions end when the person can be transferred to \u201cappropriate civilian law enforcement personnel.\u201d",
      "Leao\u2019s detention shows how the troops' deployment is putting them closer to carrying out law enforcement actions. Already, National Guard soldiers have been providing security on raids as Trump has promised as part of his immigration crackdown.",

      "A judge has blocked New York City\u2019s mayor from letting federal immigration authorities reopen an office at the city\u2019s main jail",
      "NEW YORK -- A judge blocked New York City\u2019s mayor from letting federal immigration authorities reopen an office at the city\u2019s main jail, in part because of concerns the mayor invited them back in as part of a deal with the Trump administration to end his corruption case.",
      "New York Judge Mary Rosado\u2019s decision Friday is a setback for Democratic Mayor Eric Adams, who issued an executive order permitting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies to maintain office space at the Rikers Island jail complex. City lawmakers filed a lawsuit in April accusing Adams of entering into a \u201ccorrupt quid pro quo bargain\u201d with the Trump administration in exchange for the U.S. Justice Department dropping criminal charges against him.",
      "Rosado temporarily blocked the executive order in April. In granting a preliminary injunction, she said city council members have \u201cshown a likelihood of success in demonstrating, at minimum, the appearance of a quid pro quo whereby Mayor Adams publicly agreed to bring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201dICE\u201d) back to Rikers Island in exchange for dismissal of his criminal charges.\u201d",
      "Rosado cited a number of factors, including U.S. border czar Tom Homan's televised comments in February that if Adams did not come through, \"I\u2019ll be in his office, up his butt saying, \u2018Where the hell is the agreement we came to?\u2019 \u201d",
      "Adams has repeatedly denied making a deal with the administration over the criminal case. He has said he deputized his first deputy mayor, Randy Mastro, to handle decision-making on the return of ICE to Rikers Island to make sure there was no appearance of any conflict of interest.",
      "Rosado said that Mastro reports to Adams and \u201ccannot be considered impartial and free from Mayor Adams' conflicts.\u201d",
      "Mastro said in a prepared statement Friday the administration was confident they will prevail in the case.",
      "\"Let\u2019s be crystal clear: This executive order is about the criminal prosecution of violent transnational gangs committing crimes in our city. Our administration has never, and will never, do anything to jeopardize the safety of law-abiding immigrants, and this executive order ensures their safety as well,\" Mastro said.",
      "City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who is running in the Democratic primary for mayor, called the decision a victory for public safety.",
      "\u201cNew Yorkers are counting on our city to protect their civil rights, and yet, Mayor Adams has attempted to betray this obligation by handing power over our city to Trump\u2019s ICE because he is compromised,\" she said in a prepared statement.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order paving the way for a Nippon Steel investment in U.S. Steel, so long as the Japanese company complies with a \u201cnational security agreement\u201d submitted by the federal government.",
      "Trump's order didn\u2019t detail the terms of the national security agreement.",
      "But the iconic American steelmaker and Nippon Steel said in a joint statement that the agreement stipulates that approximately $11 billion in new investments will be made by 2028 and includes giving the U.S. government a \u201c golden share \" \u2014 essentially veto power to ensure the country's national security interests are protected against cutbacks in steel production.",
      "\u201cWe thank President Trump and his Administration for their bold leadership and strong support for our historic partnership,\" the two companies said. \"This partnership will bring a massive investment that will support our communities and families for generations to come. We look forward to putting our commitments into action to make American steelmaking and manufacturing great again.\u201d",
      "The companies have completed a U.S. Department of Justice review and received all necessary regulatory approvals, the statement said.",
      "\u201cThe partnership is expected to be finalized promptly,\u201d the statement said.",
      "U.S. Steel rose $2.66, or 5%, to $54.85 in afterhours trading Friday. Nippon Steel's original bid to buy the Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel in late 2023 had been valued at $55 per share.",
      "The companies offered few details on how the golden share would work, what other provisions are in the national security agreement and how specifically the $11 billion would be spent.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said the order \u201censures U.S. Steel will remain in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and be safeguarded as a critical element of America\u2019s national and economic security.\u201d",
      "James Brower, a Morrison Foerster lawyer who represents clients in national security-related matters, said such agreements with the government typically are not disclosed to the public, particularly by the government.",
      "They can become public, but it's almost always disclosed by a party in the transaction, such as a company \u2014 like U.S. Steel \u2014 that is publicly held, Brower said.",
      "The mechanics of how a golden share would work will depend on the national security agreement, but in such agreements it isn't unusual to give the government approval rights over specific activities, Brower said.",
      "U.S. Steel made no filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.",
      "Nippon Steel originally offered nearly $15 billion to purchase U.S. Steel in an acquisition that had been delayed on national security concerns starting during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.",
      "As it sought to win over American officials, Nippon Steel gradually increased the amount of money it was pledging to invest into U.S. Steel. American officials now value the transaction at $28 billion, including the purchase bid and a new electric arc furnace \u2014 a more modern steel mill that melts down scrap \u2014 that they say Nippon Steel will build in the U.S. after 2028.",
      "Nippon Steel had pledged to maintain U.S. Steel\u2019s headquarters in Pittsburgh, put U.S. Steel under a board with a majority of American citizens and keep plants operating.",
      "It also said it would protect the interests of U.S. Steel in trade matters and it wouldn\u2019t import steel slabs that would compete with U.S. Steel\u2019s blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana.",
      "Trump opposed the purchase while campaigning for the White House, and using his authority Biden blocked the transaction on his way out of the White House. But Trump expressed openness to working out an arrangement once he returned to the White House in January.",
      "Trump said Thursday that he would as president have \u201ctotal control\u201d of what U.S. Steel did as part of the investment.",
      "Trump said then that the deal would preserve \u201c51% ownership by Americans,\u201d although Nippon Steel has never backed off its stated intention of buying and controlling U.S. Steel as a wholly owned subsidiary.",
      "\u201cWe have a golden share, which I control,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump added that he was \u201ca little concerned\u201d about what presidents other than him would do with their golden share, \u201cbut that gives you total control.\u201d",
      "The proposed merger had been under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, during the Trump and Biden administrations.",
      "The order signed Friday by Trump said the CFIUS review provided \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that Nippon Steel \u201cmight take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States,\u201d but such risks might be \u201cadequately mitigated\u201d by approving the proposed national security agreement.",
      "The order doesn't detail the perceived national security risk and only provides a timeline for the national security agreement. The White House declined to provide details on the terms of the agreement.",
      "The order said the draft agreement was submitted to U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel on Friday. The two companies must successfully execute the agreement as decided by the Treasury Department and other federal agencies that are part CFIUS by the closing date of the transaction.",

      "PHOENIX -- The top elections official in one of the nation\u2019s most pivotal swing counties is suing the Maricopa County governing board over allegations that it's attempting to gain more control over how elections are administered.",
      "County Recorder Justin Heap filed a lawsuit Thursday in state court with the backing of America First Legal, a conservative public interest group founded by Stephen Miller, who is now the White House deputy chief of staff.",
      "Heap, a former GOP state lawmaker who has questioned election administration in Arizona's most populous county, has been at odds with the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors for months over an agreement that would divide election operations between the two offices.",
      "After taking office in January, Heap terminated a previous agreement that was reached between his predecessor and the board. He claimed in his lawsuit it would have restrained his power to run elections by reducing funding and IT resources for the recorder's office.",
      "Last year's agreement also gave the board authority over early ballot processing, which drew criticism from Heap in his lawsuit.",
      "Heap is asking the court to undo what the lawsuit calls \u201cunlawful\u201d actions by the board and to issue an order requiring the board to fund expenses he deems necessary.",
      "\u201cDespite their repeated misinformation and gaslighting of the public on these issues, defending the civil right to free, fair and honest elections for every Maricopa County voter isn\u2019t simply my job as county recorder, it\u2019s the right thing to do and a mission I\u2019m fully committed to achieving,\u201d Heap said in a statement Thursday.",
      "The board's chair and vice chair have called the legal challenge frivolous, saying Heap is wasting taxpayer money by going to court.",
      "Negotiations between the offices have been ongoing since the beginning of the year, and the board said in a statement that it appeared things were going well after a meeting in April. It was only weeks later, the board said, that Heap came back with what he called a final offer that included dozens of changes.",
      "Heap claims in the lawsuit that the board rejected his proposed agreement in late May. In a statement, America First Legal says the board separately voted on a tentative budget that shifts Heap's key duties and underfunds the recorder's office.",
      "\u201cFrom day one, Recorder Heap has been making promises that the law doesn\u2019t allow him to keep,\" Board Chairman Thomas Galvin said. \"Arizona election statutes delineate election administration between county boards of supervisors and recorders to ensure there are checks and balances, and Recorder Heap clearly doesn\u2019t understand the responsibilities of his position.\u201d",
      "Following President Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 loss, Maricopa County became an epicenter for election conspiracy theories. Heap has stopped short of saying the 2020 and 2022 elections were stolen, but he has said the state\u2019s practices for handling early ballots are insecure and has questioned how ballots are transported, handled and stored after they are submitted. Last year, Heap proposed an unsuccessful bill to remove Arizona from a multistate effort to maintain voter lists.",
      "Heap's predecessor, Stephen Richer, was rebuked in some GOP circles for defending the legitimacy of the 2020 and 2022 elections, in which Democrats including former President Joe Biden and Gov. Katie Hobbs won by razor-thin margins. Trump won Arizona in 2024, along with the other battleground states.",

      "It's not the first instance of unusually high temperatures in what many consider the nation's coldest state, but the National Weather Service only recently allowed for heat advisories to be issued there. Information on similarly warm weather conditions previously came in the form of \u201cspecial weather statements.\"",
      "Using the heat advisory label could help people better understand the weather's severity and potential danger, something a nondescript \u201cspecial weather statement\u201d didn't convey.",

      "Here\u2019s what to know about Alaska's inaugural heat advisory:",
      "The National Weather Service's switch from special weather statements to advisories was meant to change how the public views the information.",
      "\u201cThis is an important statement, and the public needs to know that there will be increasing temperatures, and they could be dangerous because Alaska is not used to high temperatures like these,\u201d said Alekya Srinivasan, a Fairbanks-based meteorologist.",

      "The change doesn't reflect unprecedented temperatures, with Fairbanks having reached 90 degrees twice in 2024, Srinivasan said. It's purely an administrative change by the weather service.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that the heat in the interior that prompted Fairbanks to issue this is record heat or anything like that. It\u2019s just now there\u2019s a product to issue,\u201d said Rich Thoman, a climate specialist at the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy.",
      "Thoman also clarified that the term swap doesn't have anything to do with climate change.",
      "\u201cI think some of it is related to the recognition that hot weather does have an impact on Alaska, and in the interior especially,\" Thoman said.",
      "While the temperatures in the forecast wouldn't be considered extreme in other U.S. states, Thoman noted that most Alaska buildings don't have air conditioning.",
      "\u201cAnd just the opposite, most buildings in Alaska are designed to retain heat for most of the year,\" he said.",
      "People can open their windows to allow cooler air in during early morning hours \u2014 if wildfires aren\u2019t burning in blaze-prone state. But if it\u2019s smoky and the windows have to remain shut, buildings can heat up very rapidly.",
      "\u201cLast year was the third year in a row in Fairbanks with more than a hundred hours of visibility-reducing smoke, the first time we\u2019ve ever had three consecutive years over a hundred hours,\u201d he said.",
      "There\u2019s only been two summers in Fairbanks in the 21st century with no hours of smoke that reduced visibility, a situation he said was commonplace from the 1950s to the 1970s.",
      "The Juneau and Fairbanks weather service offices have been allowed to issue heat advisories beginning this summer, but not the office in the state\u2019s largest city of Anchorage \u2014 at least not yet. And, regardless, temperatures in the area haven't reached the threshold this year at which a heat advisory would be issued.",
      "Brian Brettschneider, a climate scientist with the weather service, said by email that the Anchorage office is working on a plan to issue such advisories in the future.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Two people have been charged with conspiracy to commit voter registration fraud in a case that shows Minnesota's election safeguards work and prevented anyone from voting illegally, Secretary of State Steve Simon said Friday.",
      "The charges announced by the U.S. Attorney's Office allege that Ronnie Williams and Lorraine Lee Combs generated fictitious names and other data they used to fill out Minnesota voter registration forms in 2021 and 2022.",
      "The charging documents, filed in federal court on Tuesday, say Williams provided the completed forms to an entity that sought to register voters in Minnesota that is identified only as \u201cFoundation 1,\u201d which paid him, and that he then split the proceeds with Combs.",
      "The documents also indicate that others were involved in the alleged conspiracy, serving as intermediaries between Williams and \u201cFoundation 1,\u201d which would submit the false registration forms to election offices across the state \u201cthrough its agents,\u201d but charges against them have not been announced.",
      "Williams and Combs were longtime romantic partners, according to the documents, which don't say how much they were paid.",
      "The charges are the result of a two-year investigation by the FBI and the Secretary of State's Office and are punishable by up to five years in prison.",
      "\u201cThe extensive checks in Minnesota\u2019s voter registration process ensured that the fraudulent applications were immediately flagged, and no ineligible votes were cast,\u201d Simon said in a statement.",
      "While voter fraud does happen occasionally, the country's processes provide many safeguards that generally keep it detectable and rare. When it happens, it tends to get caught and prosecuted.",
      "\u201cElection fraud strikes at the heart of our democracy,\u201d Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson said in a separate statement. \u201cThankfully, the FBI stopped this fraud in its tracks, before anyone successfully cast a fraudulent ballot. But we will stay vigilant.\u201d",
      "Court documents suggest that the two defendants plan to plead guilty. They were charged by complaints instead of grand jury indictments, which are normally needed to take a case to trial in federal court. And the case dockets show that Williams has a plea agreement hearing set for July 8, while Combs has a change of plea hearing on June 24.",
      "Attorneys for Williams and Combs declined to comment on the charges. The announcement from prosecutors said the two are Nevada residents who formerly lived in Minnesota. Neither has a listed phone number in either state.",
      "But Combs told the Minnesota Star Tribune that she filled out roughly 500 forms as part of the operation and turned them over to Williams. She told the newspaper that she didn\u2019t know the name of the foundation, and she didn\u2019t know how many applications Williams completed illegally.",
      "Simon's office said local officials used verification tools that are built into the state's voter registration system to identify inconsistencies on the forms, then immediately reported them to law enforcement and his office. The office then worked with every county election office to confirm that all fraudulent registration attempts would be detected and confirm that no ballots were wrongly requested or cast.",
      "\u201cOur message to would-be fraudsters is clear: If you try to trick or scheme your way into registering voters in Minnesota, you will be caught and prosecuted,\u201d Simon said.",

      "A South Carolina man sent to death row twice for separate murders has been put to death by lethal injection in the state\u2019s sixth execution in nine months",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A South Carolina man sent to death row twice for separate murders was put to death Friday by lethal injection in the state\u2019s sixth execution in nine months.",
      "Stephen Stanko, 57, was pronounced dead at 6:34 p.m.",
      "He was executed for shooting a friend and then cleaning out his bank account in Horry County in 2005.",
      "Stanko also was serving a death sentence for killing his live-in girlfriend in her Georgetown County home hours earlier, strangling her as he raped her teenage daughter. Stanko slit the teen\u2019s throat, but she survived.",
      "The execution began after a 3 1/2 minute final statement where Stanko apologized to his victims and asked not to be judged by the worst day of his life. Witnesses could hear prison officials asking for the first dose of the powerful sedative pentobarbital which was different from previous executions.",
      "Stanko appeared to be saying words, turned toward the families of the victims and then let out several quick breaths as his lips quivered.",
      "Stanko appeared to stop breathing after a minute. His ruddy complexion quickly disappeared and the color drained from his face and hands. A prison employee asked for a second dose of pentobarbital about 13 minutes later. He was announced dead about 28 minutes after the execution started.",
      "Three family members of his victims stared at Stanko and didn't look away until well after he stopped breathing. Stanko's brother and his lawyer also watched. Attorney Lindsey Vann, who watched her second inmate client die in seven months rubbed rosary beads in her hands.",
      "Stanko was leaning toward dying by South Carolina\u2019s new firing squad, like the past two inmates before him. But after autopsy results from the last inmate killed by that method showed the bullets from the three volunteers nearly missed his heart, Stanko went with lethal injection.",
      "Stanko was the last of four executions scheduled around the country this week. Florida and Alabama each put an inmate to death on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Oklahoma executed a man transferred from federal to state custody to allow his death.",
      "The federal courts rejected Stanko\u2019s last-ditch effort to spare his life as his lawyers argued the state isn\u2019t carrying out lethal injection properly after autopsy results found fluid in the lungs of other inmates killed that way.",
      "Also South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster refused clemency in a phone call to prison officials minutes before the execution began.",
      "A governor has not spared a death row inmate\u2019s life in the previous 48 executions since South Carolina reinstated the death penalty about 50 years ago.",
      "Stanko is the sixth inmate executed in South Carolina in nine months after the state went 13 years without putting an inmate to death because it could not obtain lethal injection drugs. The South Carolina General Assembly approved a firing squad and passed a shield law bill which allowed the suppliers of the drugs to stay secret.",
      "In his final statement, Stanko talked about how he was an honor student and athlete and a volunteers and asked several times not to be judged by the night he killed two people.",
      "\u201cI have live for approximately 20,973 days, but I am judged solely for one,\u201d Stanko said in his final statement read by his lawyer.",
      "Stanko apologized several times to his victims and their families.",
      "\u201cOnce I am gone, I hope that Christina, Laura's family and Henry's family can all forgive me. The execution may help them. Forgiveness will heal them.\u201d",
      "Stanko ate his last meal on Wednesday as prison officials give inmates a chance to enjoy their special food before their execution day. He ate fried fish, fried shrimp, crab cakes, a baked potato, carrots, fried okra, cherry pie, banana pudding and sweet tea.",

      "Rescuers fetched two men struck by lightning from a Colorado peak in what they believe were the highest helicopter rescues on record in this mountainous state.",
      "One man remained hospitalized in fair condition Friday while the other was treated at a hospital and released.",
      "The rescues happened late Thursday near the summit of Torreys Peak, a 14,300-foot (4,360-meter) mountain about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Denver. Torreys Peak is ranked variously as the 11th or 12th highest summit in Colorado and is less than 200 feet (60 meters) shorter than the state's highest mountain, Mount Elbert.",
      "The men from New York state, whose identities weren\u2019t released, had decided to summit the mountain during a road trip, Alpine Rescue Team public information officer Jake Smith said.",
      "They first called for help around 5 p.m. after getting off course on their way up a technical route. A different route doesn't require climbing gear or expertise.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like they had a ton of prior experience. I think it was probably just a lack of awareness,\u201d said Smith, who was among the rescuers on the ground.",
      "Rescue officials guided the men back on course, and they made it to the summit. Minutes later, one of them called back to report they had been struck by lightning.",
      "About 30 rescuers went up the mountain while another team used a Colorado National Guard Blackhawk helicopter to get the more seriously injured man, who was nonresponsive and in critical condition, off the peak using a hoist at 14,200 feet (4,330 meters).",
      "He was flown down to an ambulance and taken to a local hospital, then to a Denver hospital with a burn unit, Smith said.",
      "The helicopter made another trip around midnight to fetch the less seriously hurt man by partially touching down on the mountain.",
      "The rescuers believe Colorado's previous record for a helicopter rescue was 13,700 feet (4,175 meters). Such rescues are challenging because thin air causes helicopters to lose lifting ability the higher they fly; the Blackhawk has an altitude limit of about 19,000 feet (5,800 meters).",
      "Hikers and climbers often prefer to ascend during the morning and avoid the Rocky Mountain high country on summer afternoons. Thunderstorms are common and can develop suddenly with dangerous lightning, hail and plummeting temperatures.",

      "Kent Mawhinney had originally been charged with the more serious crime of conspiracy to commit murder.",

    "story": [
      "For half a century, Beach Boys songs like \"Fun, Fun, Fun\"  have promised unending summers of fun in the sun -- not at all like the life founding Beach Boy Brian Wilson actually led for many years, as Anthony Mason tells us now in our Sunday Profile:",
      "On a warm summer night at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles last month, Brian Wilson -- backed by a band that included fellow former Beach Boy Al Jardine -- was running through his repertoire of classics when a cake was wheeled out from backstage by the extended Wilson family.",
      "On this night, the man many regard as one of America's greatest living songwriters turned 73.",
      "Well, East coast girls are hip, \tI really dig those styles they wear. \tAnd the Southern girls, with the way they talk, \tThey knock me out when I'm down there. \tThe Midwest farmer's daughters really make you feel alright. \tAnd the Northern girls with the way they kiss \tThey keep their boyfriends warm at night.",
      "I wish they all could be California \tI wish they all could be California \tI wish they all could be California girls.",
      "-- \"California Girls,\" by Brian Wilson and Mike Love (1965)",
      "Wilson, who created the sun & surf sound that's still the soundtrack for the American summer, has had a summer of milestones. On tour again, he has just released his 11th solo album, \"No Pier Pressure,\" and is the subject of a new film about his life, \"Love & Mercy.\"",
      "Mason asked, \"How did you feel when you saw the film?\"",
      "\"I was very happy to see the good parts,\" Wilson said. \"But the dark periods were, like, very rough to watch.\"",
      "John Cusack plays an older Brian Wilson, the artist struggling to recover from depression, mental illness and drug abuse. Paul Dano pays the younger Brian Wilson, the musical genius who dreams up the Beach Boys' intricate harmonies and orchestrations.",
      "Wilson was just 20 when the Beach Boys signed with Capitol Records and made their first album in an L.A. studio.",
      "Mason asked, \"Do you remember recording in this room?\"",
      "\"I remember recording 'If everybody had an ocean across the USA ...'\" Wilson said.",
      "He would create the most successful band in America, blending the voices of his brothers Dennis and Carl, cousin Mike Love, and close friend Al Jardine. \"Mike on bass, Al and Dennis and Carl in the mid-range, and me on falsetto. We all sang together. And the harmony just happened.\"",
      "\"Love & Mercy\" focuses on two pivotal points in Wilson's life: First, the recording of The Beach Boys' highly-influential \"Pet Sounds\" album in 1965, that featured \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" and \"God Only Knows.\"",
      "\"I was so proud of that album, I could have cried,\" said Wilson. \"Very proud of it.\"",
      "\"Your father fought you about it, and the band fought you about it,\" said Mason.",
      "\"Well, they didn't like it. Mike and the guys didn't like it. They, you know, thought it was too advanced music. They wanted to keep making car songs and surf songs. I said, 'Guys, we gotta grow. We've gotta grow musically.'\"",
      "The film's other focus is the 1980s, and Wilson's troubled relationship with Dr. Eugene Landy, the psychologist accused of making him a virtual prisoner.",
      "It took nearly two decades for the film to be made. And when Brian's wife, Melinda, first saw it, she said, \"I got up and I bolted. I drove around the city for two hours, And it was tough. It was tough to watch.\"",
      "\"What were you doing while you were driving around the city?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Just thinking. 'Oh my God, did we do the right thing? It's been 19 years and this is how it's ending.'\"",
      "\"And how did you make peace with it?\"",
      "\"It was the truth,\" she said. \"So that's how I made peace with it. When you tell the truth, everything works out.\"",
      "The film tells the story of how Melinda (played by Elizabeth Banks) first met the troubled musician in 1986.",
      "\"I went to a Cadillac dealership to buy a car,\" recalled Wilson. \"And she was working there, and when I saw her I liked her the first time I saw her. And she sold me a car!\"",
      "Wilson gave Melinda a card that read, \"Frightened, scared, lonely.\"",
      "\"Did you look at that card right away?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Oh yeah, I was just like, What is he trying to tell me?  I knew I liked him. I knew I liked him a lot. And then when he left the card I was just like, what's going on here?\"",
      "Brian was then under the 24-hour care of Dr. Landy (Paul Giamatti in the film), who was controlling every aspect of his life, even co-writing songs, co-producing his records, and screening who could see him.",
      "Mason asked Wilson, \"When you think of that period of your life, what do you think of?\"",
      "\"Unhappiness,\" he said. \"Being tortured.  All that stuff.\"",
      "\"Is it something you try not to think of?\"",
      "\"Yeah.  Yeah.\"",
      "About six months into their relationship, Melinda decided she had to act: \"I called the Attorney General and he said there was nothing that could be done unless his family got involved. So a lot of times with Landy I had to be play-acting because I knew he was a bad guy.\"",
      "\"That's got to be an extremely difficult position to be in,\" said Mason.",
      "\"It was like I said to my mother:  'You know, I feel like a child is being abused.' And I couldn't find anybody that wanted to help. As much as I hate to say it, I think the family just -- they were at their rope's end with Brian and they didn't really know what to do.\"",
      "Landy eventually cut Melinda off from Brian.",
      "\"I saw her for three years. And then Dr. Landy severed the relationship,\" said Wilson.",
      "And how did he respond to that? \"Negatively,\" he said. \"I said, 'Tat's not fair, Gene. That's not fair.'\"",
      "Melinda recalled Brian telling her, \"I want outta this hellhole.\" And that, she told Mason, gave her all the impetus she needed.",
      "Landy's grip on Wilson was finally broken in 1991, when the family discovered that Brian's will had been revised -- with Landy named as his main beneficiary.",
      "They eventually won a court order barring the therapist from any further contact with his patient. Brian Wilson's nine-year ordeal was over.",
      "Brian and Melinda were married in 1995. They have five adopted children together.",
      "The song \"One Kind of Love,\" on Brian Wilson's new album, \"No Pier Pressure,\" is dedicated to Melinda.  (To hear Wilson perform the song click on the video player below.)",
      "Just driftwood floating on the sea, \tSearching for the me and all that I have known to be. \tThank God that you noticed me, \tAnd brought back harmony to this lonely soul.",
      "Mason asked, \"How important was Melinda in you getting through that?\"",
      "\"Well, she got me bailed out of it,\" Wilson said. \"She got me out of the program. She was my hero.\"",
      "\"He is really strong -- people don't get that about him,\" Melinda said. \"They think he's passive and just sits around. But he's strong.\"",
      "\"Was there a moment when you knew you'd actually won?\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "As a founding member of the '60s rock group the Beach Boys, singer-songwriter Brian Wilson (June 20, 1942-June 11, 2025) created the sun & surf sound that has been the soundtrack of summer ever since.",
      "It began in 1961, on Labor Day weekend, when Wilson's parents went out of town. Using the money they'd left for food, Wilson and his brothers decided to rent some musical instruments. \"And then we starved, but we had a good, you know, time,\" Wilson told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2002.",
      "\"We\" was Wilson; his brothers, Dennis and Carl; cousin Mike Love; and their buddy, Al Jardine.",
      "\"Surfing,\" the song they recorded that day under the name the Pendletons, went to #1 on the local charts. [It was helped by their own multiple calls to the radio station, changing their voices to impersonate masses of listeners.] It landed them a record contract, and their promotion manager suggested a new name \u2014 the Beach Boys \u2014 which the group didn't learn of until the record was released.",
      "\"Surfin' Safari\" was the first of their 29 studio albums. And never mind that Brian Wilson himself never surfed; his songs like \"Surfin',\" \"Dance, Dance, Dance,\" \"California Girls,\" \"I Get Around,\" \"Fun, Fun, Fun,\" \"Surfer Girl,\" \"Help Me, Rhonda,\" \"Good Vibrations,\" \"Barbara Ann,\" and \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" (for which Wilson rewrote the lyrics from Chuck Berry's \"Sweet Little Sixteen\") were instrumental in conjuring the \"California Sound\" \u2014 music evocative of carefree days at the beach \u2014 which earned them 35 Top 40 hits.",
      "Their manager, the Wilsons' father, Murray, drove them hard. \"He was a huge problem,\" Love told \"Sunday Morning in 2012. \"Emotionally, he was abusive, emotionally and physically to his kids, and he was unbearable at times. Brian and I'd actually fired him.\" But Brian admitted he also pushed himself hard. \"Yeah, I drove myself. I wanted to be a perfectionist,\" he said. In 1964, Wilson suffered a nervous breakdown, quit touring, and retreated to the studio, while the rest of the group stayed on the road.",
      "Wilson's songs were more harmonically and texturally complex than most pop music. Like the Beatles, who were the Beach Boys' most obvious artistic competitors, Wilson used rich vocal harmonics, orchestral and electronic instruments, and studio overdubbing to create dense textures on albums such as 1966's \"Pet Sounds\" (his response to the Beatles' \"Rubber Soul\"). With songs connected by themes of love and loss (such as \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" and \"God Only Knows\"), \"Pet Sounds\" was named by Rolling Stone magazine the second greatest album of all time. But it was a source of contention within the band itself. \"Mike and the guys didn't like it,\" Wilson told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2015. \"They, you know, thought it was too advanced music. They wanted to keep making car songs and surf songs. I said, 'Guys, we gotta grow. We've gotta grow musically.'\"",
      "But by the late 1960s, Wilson was struggling to write \u2014 his follow-up album to \"Pet Sounds,\" called \"Smile,\" was shelved \u2014 and he plunged into a severe depression. The band splintered. He was plagued by substance abuse and obesity. Along the way, Wilson's marriage fell apart, and he was estranged from his daughters, Carnie and Wendy (who, with another daughter of rock legends, Chynna Phillips, formed the trio Wilson Phillips).",
      "In desperation, Wilson went under the round-the-clock care of an unorthodox psychologist, Eugene Landy, whose years-long grip on the songwriter was finally broken in 1991, when the family discovered that Wilson's will had been revised, with Landy named as his main beneficiary. They won a court order barring the therapist from any further contact with his patient.",
      "Eventually, Wilson got well enough to record again. He released 13 solo albums beginning in 1988, and performed with Carnie and Wendy. He also had to come to terms with the deaths of his brothers, Dennis (in a 1983 drowning) and Carl (in 1998, from cancer). He married Melinda Ledbetter in 1995, and they had five adopted children together.",
      "And in 2012, to mark the band's 50th anniversary, Brian Wilson reunited with Beach Boys members Mike Love, Al Jardine, David Marks and Bruce Johnston for a Grammys appearance. And when they returned to the studio together for the first time in nearly two decades to make a new album, \"That's Why God Made the Radio,\" the bitterness had fallen away \u2014\u00a0and the good vibrations were back."

      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now urging summer camp operators to check for documentation of immunity from\u00a0measles\u00a0through vaccination or prior infection for all children, staff and volunteers, amid a deadly year of outbreaks that is now near record levels.",
      "\"Measles can spread quickly in summer camps because campers and staff spend a lot of time together in close contact with each other. Measles is more than just a rash \u2014 it can cause serious complications or even death,\" the CDC warned in a \"checklist\" for operators of summer camps published this week.",
      "The agency's new guidance says that tracking measles immunity status is important to help health departments quickly identify people who need to be vaccinated or offered antibody injections in the case of an outbreak within a camp.",
      "\"Decide if you will allow unvaccinated campers and staff at your camp. Understand the risk if you do accept a camper or staff member who has not been immunized for measles,\" the American Camp Association says in its guidance for camps, which shared the CDC's checklist.",
      "Other steps that the CDC recommends summer camps take to prepare for measles spread this year include stocking up on face masks and preparing a potential isolation space to separate campers who are sickened.",
      "The CDC's new recommendations come as confirmed measles cases have climbed to 1,197 infections so far in 2025, less than 100 cases away from topping the record 1,274 cases that were confirmed for all of 2019.

    "summary": "The Dow dropped more than 750 points Friday as investors fret over the risk of a widening war in the Middle East.",
    "story": [
      "Stocks closed lower on Friday and oil prices climbed after a military strike by Israel on Iran stirred investor fears about the risk of war breaking out in the Middle East.",
      "The S&P 500 slid 68 points, or 1.1%, to end the day at 5,977, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 770 points, or 1.8%, to 42,198 points. The Nasdaq Composite shed 1.3%.",
      "The market slide comes after\u00a0Israel launched strikes\u00a0on Iran's nuclear sites and other targets early Friday, the start of what Israel said could be a days-long attack. Iran responded by launching over 100 drones, which Israel claimed it was able to mostly intercept.",
      "The strikes come as President Trump seeks to rein in Iran's nuclear capabilities. The U.S. and Iran are scheduled to meet Sunday in Oman, as part of a series on ongoing talks.",
      "\"The initial market response has been largely contained, but the risk of a broader military conflict certainly cannot be dismissed,\" said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. \"Iran has begun to retaliate and will continue to do so. This phase of the conflict will likely last several weeks at least.\"",
      "The oil market had an even stronger reaction on Friday, with U.S. benchmark crude oil increasing 7.3% to $72.98. Bent crude, the international standard, climbed 7% to $74.23 for a barrel. A deepening conflict could impact the flow of oil from Iran, a major producer of crude, according to analysts.",
      "One concern is that Iran closes the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic channel through which millions of barrels of oil flow each day. For now, that option may be off the table for now, according to Kristian Kerr, head of macro strategy at LPL Financial.",
      "\"We think this is unlikely for now given Iran's need to maintain oil sales to China,\" Kerr said in an email.",
      "Iranian crude exports are restricted by Western sanctions and import bans, with China the only recipient of the country's oil. Israel exports only small amounts of oil and and other energy products.",
      "The Middle East tensions also affect markets beyond oil, said Joy Yang, head of index product management at MarketVector Indexes, noting a decline in bitcoin prices and a rally in defense stocks, as airline stocks fall.",
      "Airlines, whose fuel costs depend on global oil prices and whose revenues depend on travel sentiment, experienced sharp losses. United Airlines lost 4.4%, Delta Air Lines gave up 3.8% and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings dropped 5%.",

      "The president signed an executive order that says Nippon can buy the iconic Pittsburgh-based steelmaker as long as both parties sign a \"national security agreement.\"",
      "The two companies announced in a joint statement\u00a0Friday that they agreed to the terms of the government's national security agreement, which they said mandates $11 billion in new investments by 2028 and provides for \"a Golden Share to be issued to the U.S. Government.\"",
      "Nippon and U.S. Steel said they expect the deal \u2014 referred to as a partnership \u2014 to be \"finalized promptly.\" They thanked Mr. Trump, saying they \"look forward to putting our commitments into action to make American steelmaking and manufacturing great again.\"",
      "Some details about the Nippon-U.S. Steel partnership are not clear. Mr. Trump said earlier this week\u00a0that the government's golden share would give the United States \"51% ownership\" and \"total control\" over U.S. Steel, but Japanese news outlet Nikkei Asia quoted an unnamed Nippon executive who said the company needs \"management freedom\" over the combined company.",
      "Mr. Trump announced he would allow a \"partnership\" between Nippon and U.S. Steel last month.",
      "The deal between Nippon and U.S. Steel has faced tumult and uncertainty since a nearly $15 billion merger was first proposed in late 2023. Former President Joe Biden rejected the deal on national security grounds in the waning weeks of his time in office, but Mr. Trump ordered a new review of the deal and suggested Nippon could agree to \"invest heavily\" in U.S. Steel's facilities rather than fully acquiring the company.",
      "U.S. Steel has said the Nippon deal will allow for new investments in the company's aging facilities, including its Mon Valley Works in the Pittsburgh area. If the deal isn't approved, U.S. Steel has warned it may need to move its headquarters away from Pittsburgh and focus on cheaper ways of making steel than Mon Valley's blast furnaces, putting scores of jobs into jeopardy.",
      "But the United Steelworkers union is staunchly opposed to the deal, calling Nippon's promises to invest in steel mills \"public relations\" and accusing the company of job-costing unfair trade practices.",
      "Rival steelmaker Cleveland Cliffs \u2014 whose offer to buy U.S. Steel was rejected \u2014 has also blasted the deal, accusing Nippon of dumping cheap steel in American markets and saying U.S. Steel \"rejected an all-American solution and insisted on pursuing a doomed-to-fail cash out sale.\" In a lawsuit against the government in the waning days of the Biden administration, Nippon and U.S. Steel accused Cleveland Cliffs and the steel union of undermining their planned merger.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump doubled tariffs on foreign steel imports last month.",

      "China has leveraged its grip on rare earths and their widespread utility amid a trade war with the U.S. In April, Beijing announced greater export controls on the materials \u2014 a sticking point in tariff negotiations \u2014 along with other retaliatory trade measures. The controls require businesses to apply for a license to export rare earths, which U.S. automakers say they have been struggling to secure.",
      "Earlier this week, on June 11, following two days of discussions in London, U.S. and Chinese negotiators struck an agreement under which Beijing would resume regular exports of rare earths to the U.S.",
      "\"The centrality of rare earth export restrictions to the trade deal underscores the criticality of minerals to the U.S. economy as well as the severity of the chokehold Beijing holds on global supply chains,\" policy experts from the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote in a research note.",

      "Claude Wyle, an injury attorney and partner at Choulos, Choulos & Wyle who is representing Novotny, told CBS MoneyWatch that Novotny went to the emergency room after the incident and was diagnosed with a mild concussion. She continues to suffer from difficulty finding words, vision problems and headaches, he said.",
      "Novotny is suing Costco for general negligence, premises liability and products liability. Wyle said his client is seeking millions in damages.",
      "Wyle said Costco has a video of the alleged incident that has not been released to him, and which he likely won't see until the formal discovery period of the lawsuit.",
      "Costco did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "In her complaint, Novotny claims Costco acted negligently by failing to fix the dangerous conditions that led to the alleged incident. The lawsuit also alleges that the discount retailer failed to adequately train its employees to properly maintain merchandise and that each one bears some blame for Novotny's injuries.",
      "\"The negligent conduct of defendants and each of them was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff's injuries,\" the lawsuit reads.",

      "\"Any remaining hopes for sub-$60 [barrel per] oil prices this year must now be buried. Israel's attacks early Friday against Iran, directed against nuclear facilities, missile sites and senior personnel, are a marked departure from earlier exchanges between the two Middle Eastern powers,\" Tom Holland, global research director with investment advisory firm Gavekal, told clients in a note.",

    "story": [
      "Walmart heiress Christy Walton promoted a planned nationwide protest against President Trump by placing a full-page advertisement that ran in the New York Times on Sunday.",
      "The ad, which the billionaire heiress paid for, calls on people to participate in the\u00a0\"No Kings\" protest\u00a0slated to take place across the U.S. on June 14 \u2014 the same day\u00a0a military parade celebrating the Army's 250th Anniversary\u00a0is set to take place in Washington, D.C. The date of the parade and protests also coincides with Mr. Trump's birthday.",
      "The ad lists eight declarations, including \"WE honor our commitments and stand by our allies, WE defend against aggression by dictators, WE care for veterans and children, WE respect our neighbors and trading partners, WE support a health national and international economy, WE uphold the stability of rule of law,\" and more.",
      "More text is printed at the bottom of the full-page advertisement. \"We are the people of the United States of America. The honor, dignity, and integrity of our country are not for sale,\" it reads.",
      "\"Our government is of the people, by the people, for the people,\" the last line of the ad states.",
      "A spokesperson for Ms. Walton told CBS MoneyWatch that Sunday's ad \"focuses on encouraging people to engage peacefully and civically in next weekend's events on June 14th.\"",
      "Walmart sought to distance the retail chain from Ms. Walton's ad. \"The advertisements from Christy Walton are in no way connected to or endorsed by Walmart. She does not serve on the board or play any role in decision-making at Walmart,\" the company said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Eat the tariffs\"",
      "Walmart is among the major U.S. retailers that have said Mr. Trump's tariff policies would force them to pass on added costs to customers.",
      "\"We can control what we can control,\" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said during the company's first-quarter earnings call last month. \"Even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices,\" he added.",
      "Mr. Trump later warned Walmart against raising its prices, writing on social media that it should \"eat the tariffs\"\u00a0instead of raising prices on some goods.",
      "When asked about the planned protests Thursday, Mr. Trump said he did not feel like a king because \"I have to go through hell to get stuff approved.\"",

    "summary": "An estimated 4 million Americans will lose health insurance over the next decade if Congress doesn't extend enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act marketplace coverage.",
    "story": [
      "Miami\u00a0\u2014 Josefina Muralles works a part-time overnight shift as a receptionist at a Miami Beach condominium so that during the day she can care for her three kids, her aging mother, and her brother, who is paralyzed.",
      "She helps her mother feed, bathe, and give medicine to her adult brother, Rodrigo Muralles, who has epilepsy and became disabled after contracting COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "\"He lives because we feed him and take care of his personal needs,\" said Josefina Muralles, 41. \"He doesn't say, 'I need this or that.' He has forgotten everything.\"",
      "Though her husband works full time, the arrangement means their household income is just above the federal poverty line \u2014 too high to qualify for Florida's Medicaid program but low enough to make Muralles and her husband eligible for subsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, also known as Obamacare.",
      "Next year, Muralles said, she and her husband may not be able to afford that health insurance coverage, which has paid for her prescription blood thinners, cholesterol medication, and two surgeries, including one to treat a genetic disorder.",
      "Extra subsidies put in place during the pandemic \u2014 which reduced the premiums Muralles and her husband paid by more than half, to $30 a month \u2014 are in place only through Dec. 31. Without enhanced subsidies, Affordable Care Act insurance premiums would rise by more than 75% on average, with bills for people in some states more than doubling, according to estimates from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Florida and Texas would be hit especially hard, as they have more people enrolled in the marketplace than other states. Some of their congressional districts alone, especially in South Florida, have more people signed up for Obamacare than entire states.",
      "Like many of the more than 24 million Americans enrolled in the insurance marketplace this year, Muralles was unaware that the enhanced subsidies are slated to expire. She said she cannot afford a premium hike because inflation has already eaten into her household's budget.",
      "\"The rent is going up,\" she said. \"The water bill is going up.\"",
      "Low-income enrollees like the Muralles couple would see the biggest percentage increases in premiums if enhanced subsidies expire.",
      "Middle-income enrollees who earn more than four times the federal poverty line would no longer be eligible for subsidies at all. Those middle-income enrollees (who earn at least $62,600 for a single person in 2025) are disproportionately older, self-employed, and living in rural areas.",
      "Julio Fuentes, president of the Florida State Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said many of his organization's members are small business owners who rely on Obamacare for health coverage.",
      "\"It's either this or nothing,\" he said.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that letting the enhanced subsidies expire would, by 2034, increase the number of people without health insurance by 4.2 million. In tandem with changes to Medicaid in the House of Representatives' reconciliation bill and the Trump administration's proposed rules for the marketplace, including toughening income verification and shortening enrollment periods, it would increase the number of uninsured people by 16 million over that time period.",
      "A study by the Urban Institute, a nonprofit think tank, found that Hispanic and Black people would see greater coverage losses than other groups if the extra subsidies lapse.",
      "Fuentes noted that about 5 million Hispanics are enrolled in the ACA marketplace, and that President Trump won the Hispanic vote in Florida in 2024. He hopes the president and congressional Republicans see extending the enhanced subsidies as a way to hold on to those voters.",
      "\"This is probably a good way, or a good start, to possibly grow that base even more,\" he said.",
      "Enrollment in the marketplace has grown faster since 2020 in the states won by Mr. Trump in 2024. A recent KFF survey found that 45% of Americans who buy their own health insurance identify as or lean Republican, including 3 in 10 who identify as Make America Great Again supporters. Smaller shares identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents (35%) or do not lean toward either party (20%).",
      "Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said the rules proposed by the Trump administration, combined with the provisions in the House-passed budget bill, would \"strengthen the ACA marketplace.\" He noted that the CBO projects the legislation would reduce premiums for some plans about 12% on average by 2034 \u2014 but out-of-pocket costs would rise or remain the same for most subsidized ACA consumers.",
      "\"Democrats know Americans broadly support ending waste, fraud, and abuse, as The One, Big, Beautiful Bill does, which is why they are desperately trying to change the conversation,\" Desai said.",
      "But Lauren Aronson, executive director of Keep Americans Covered, a group in Washington, D.C., representing health insurers, hospitals, physicians, and patient advocates, said it is critical to raise awareness about the likely impact of losing the enhanced subsidies, which are also known as advanced premium tax credits. She is encouraged that Democrats have proposed legislation to extend the enhanced tax credits, and that some Republican senators have voiced support.",
      "What worries Aronson most is that the Republican-controlled Congress is more focused on extending tax cuts than enhanced subsidies, she said. The current bill extending the 2017 tax cuts would increase the federal deficit by about $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to the CBO, while making the enhanced subsidies permanent would increase the deficit by $358 billion over roughly the same period.",
      "\"Congress is moving forward on a tax reconciliation package that purports to benefit working families,\" Aronson said. \"But if you don't take care of the tax credits, working families will be left holding the bag.\"",
      "Brian Blase, president of Paragon Health Institute, a conservative health policy think tank, said the enhanced subsidies were supposed to be a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people at risk of losing coverage.",
      "Instead, he said, the enhanced subsidies facilitated fraud because enrollees did not need to verify their income eligibility to receive zero-premium plans if they reported incomes at or near the federal poverty level.",
      "The enhanced subsidies also worsen health inflation, discourage employers from offering health insurance benefits, and crowd out alternative models, such as short-term insurance and Farm Bureau plans, Blase said.",
      "\"Permitting these subsidies to expire would just be going back to Obamacare as it was written,\" Blase said. \"That is a more efficient program than the program that we have now.\"",
      "New rules for the marketplace proposed by the Trump administration in March are already designed to address fraud, said Anna Howard, a policy expert with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, which advocates for increased health insurance coverage. Howard said extending the enhanced tax credits would help ensure that people who are legitimately eligible for coverage can get it.",
      "\"We don't want to see over 5 million people be kicked off their health insurance coverage out of fears of fraud when the policies being proposed don't necessarily address fraud,\" she said.",
      "Without affordable premiums, many consumers will turn to short-term health plans, health care cost-sharing ministries, and other forms of coverage that do not have the benefits or protections of the health law, she said.",
      "\"These are plans that don't provide coverage for prescription drugs, or they have lifetime and annual limits,\" she said. \"For a cancer patient, those plans don't work.\"",
      "Though the enhanced subsidies do not expire until the end of the year, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association would prefer Congress to act by fall to avoid confusion during open enrollment, said David Merritt, a senior vice president. Insurers are preparing rates to meet state deadlines. By October, consumers will receive 60-day plan renewal notices with their 2026 premiums.",
      "Without enhanced subsidies, Merritt said, competition in the marketplace will wither, leading to fewer coverage options and higher prices, especially in states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility and where Obamacare enrollment spiked during the past four years, like Florida and Texas. \"Voters and patients are really going to see the impact,\" he said.",
      "Republican and Democratic representatives for some of the Florida congressional districts with the highest numbers of people in the marketplace did not respond to repeated interview requests.",
      "Muralles, of North Miami, Florida, said she wants her representatives to work in the interest of constituents like herself, who need health insurance coverage to care for their families.",
      "\"Now is the time to prove to us that they are with us,\" Muralles said. \"When everybody's healthy, everybody goes to work, everybody can pay taxes, everybody can have a better life.\"",

      "State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, John, were fatally shot at their home in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, Walz said. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded at their home in Champlin, a suburb of Minneapolis. Investigators said the shooter was dressed as a police officer.",
      "Here's what officials have said about the targeted attacks.",
      "What happened at the homes of Minnesota lawmakers?",
      "Police first responded to a call of a shooting at Hoffman's home in Champlin at around 2 a.m. local time Saturday, Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said in the briefing. Life-saving measures were provided to Hoffman and his wife and they were taken to an area hospital, where they underwent surgery to treat gunshot wounds, Evans said.",
      "Brooklyn Park police went proactively to Hortman's home after learning about the shooting at the Hoffman property, Brooklyn Park police chief Mark Bruley said. Hortman's home is about five miles from Hoffman's.",
      "Two Brooklyn Park police officers went to Hortman's home, and saw what appeared to be a police vehicle parked in front of the house with its emergency lights on, and a police officer leaving the house, Bruley said. The vehicle \"looked exactly like an SUV squad car,\" equipped with emergency lights, Bruley said. The individual was wearing a vest with a Taser, badge and other equipment, Bruley said. Bruley said the individual appeared to have knocked on the door of the home.",
      "The Brooklyn Park officers confronted the individual, who Burley said \"immediately\" fired and exchanged gunshots with officers, Bruley said. The individual then retreated into the home, Bruley said. The police officers then entered the home and saw that Hortman's husband had been shot. They attempted to render first aid, but he was pronounced dead. A drone was then used to search the rest of the home and found Hortman dead inside.",
      "Bruley said the individual was \"clearly\" impersonating a police officer and had used \"the trust of this badge and this uniform to manipulate their way into the home.\" A search of the individual's vehicle found a document that named other lawmakers and officials, Bruley said. Evans said both Hoffman and Hortman were included on the list but he did not elaborate on any other names.",
      "Extensive manhunt for suspect in shootings",
      "Authorities described the suspect as a White man with brown hair who is wearing a blue shirt, blue pants and a black tactical vest, according to CBS Minnesota. The suspect is believed to be on foot, Bruley said.",

Minnesota police agencies and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are leading the investigation, with assistance from federal agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
      "Several people have been detained and questioned, Bruley said, and police have identified \"people of interest,\" but a suspect is not in custody.",
      "A shelter-in-place order has been issued for Brooklyn Park, Bruley said, in a three-mile radius around the suburb's Edinburgh Golf Course. Increased security has been ordered for elected officials and others who may be at risk, he said.",
      "Who was Rep. Melissa Hortman?",
      "Hortman, 55, represented Minnesota House District 34B. She was the top House Democratic leader in the state Legislature and a former House speaker. A lawyer, Hortman was first elected to office in 2004. She and her husband, John, have two children, according to the Associated Press.",

    "published": "Sat, 14 Jun 2025 12:03:42 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. has held events like President Trump's military parade throughout history, but they're uncommon.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is hosting a parade celebrating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army today, bringing tanks and soldiers to the streets of Washington, D.C., for the capital's first major military parade in more than three decades.",
      "The event \u2014 which is expected to cost between $25 million and $45 million \u2014 follows a years-long push by Mr. Trump to host a parade, dating back to his first term. The festivities coincide with Mr. Trump's 79th birthday, which the president says is unrelated.",
      "The U.S. has held military parades throughout history, but they're not especially common, and they're typically held to celebrate the victorious end of a war or the return of military personnel from fighting.",
      "\"There are historical comparisons to be made, but size and scale is tremendously different,\" Arizona State University history professor Brooks Simpson told CBS News.",
      "Here's a look back at past military parades:",
      "When was the last U.S. military parade?",
      "The U.S. marked the end of the Gulf War with parades in New York City and Washington in the first major military display on the streets of D.C. since the early decades of the Cold War.",
      "The festivities in the capital\u00a0featured around 8,000 military personnel, tanks, missile launchers, fireworks shows and an address by then-President George H.W. Bush. Some 800,000 people attended the event, which cost around $12 million, The Washington Post\u00a0reported in 1991, or just under $29 million in today's dollars.",
      "Hunter Ledbetter, a Marine reservist who was deployed to Iraq during the war, told the Post at the time that it was \"the most exciting moment of my life.\"",
      "The parade \u2014 which recognized the U.S.'s campaign to drive Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait \u2014 was largely uncontroversial, Simpson said: \"No one objected to that parade.\"",
      "Still, the parades drew some pushback. Some critics questioned the D.C. Gulf War parade's price tag, and D.C. officials said the procession of heavy tanks had left tread marks on the city's streets. New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis criticized the New York parade since it followed an uprising by Iraq's Kurds that Hussein's regime brutally suppressed.",
      "\"Honor is due the soldiers who were in the gulf,\" Lewis wrote at the time. \"But for other reasons \u2014 reasons all too painfully evident \u2014 it is clear now that a celebratory parade would be inappropriate. Fireworks while Kurdish babies die?\"",
      "Cold War inaugurations",
      "Presidential inaugural parades often include some military personnel, dating back to the first inauguration of President George Washington in 1789. In the early decades of the Cold War, the festivities also sometimes featured tanks and missiles on the streets of the capital.",
      "Some military equipment appears in photos from the 1949 parade after President Harry Truman's swearing-in, President Dwight Eisenhower's 1953 and 1957 inaugurations and President John F. Kennedy's 1961 festivities.",
      "Kennedy's inauguration featured a replica of the PT boat that the new president served on during World War II. The entire event cost around $1 million in 1961 dollars \u2014 or more than $10 million today \u2014 paid for by private donors, The New York Times wrote at the time.",
      "Simpson says inauguration parades sometimes included a few tanks as an exhibition, but they were typically \"much more limited\" than the parade planned for this weekend.",
      "\"It wasn't like Pennsylvania Avenue was lined with tanks,\" he said.",
      "Parades with military equipment became less common after the 1960s. That could be due to the Vietnam War, which was\u00a0deeply unpopular\u00a0in its later years, and the eventual easing of Cold War tensions.",
      "\"After Vietnam, parades get complicated because [parades are always] linked to the outcomes of the wars and the conduct of them,\" said Aaron O'Connell, a history professor at the University of Texas, Austin. \"And that makes it more difficult to cheer and throw a ticker tape parade, when people are coming home in ones and twos, and they're not coming home in large units, and the war hasn't gone as well as we would've liked.\"",
      "World Wars I and II",
      "New York City marked victory in World War II with a massive military parade on Fifth Avenue in early 1946. The event included thousands of members of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division and dozens of tanks and howitzers, requiring planners to close off the Manhattan Bridge and carefully bring heavy equipment over the East River from Brooklyn. The New York Times reported millions of spectators attended the parade.",
      "In mid-1942, months after the U.S. formally entered World War II, the city hosted a morale-boosting \"New York at War\" parade that the Times said was meant to \"give a realistic picture of what the American armed forces and their machines of destruction look like.\"",
      "The end of World War I was also celebrated by victory parades in New York and D.C. in 1919. It could've gone smoother: Dozens of artillery tractors that participated in the New York parade took a wrong turn after the event and got lost in Brooklyn for hours, the Times wrote at the time.",
      "Civil War and 19th century celebrations",
      "Washington hosted a massive two-day parade in May 1865 to celebrate the Union's victory in the Civil War, featuring over 100,000 troops, according to the National Park Service.",
      "The event \u2014 called the Grand Review of the Armies \u2014 was made up of military volunteers who passed through the capital on their way home from the former Confederate states, Simpson says. The event featured Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and President Andrew Johnson, taking place months after President Abraham Lincoln's assassination.",
      "\"The place was packed,\" said Simpson.",
      "Other countries",
      "Mr. Trump may have drawn inspiration for Saturday's parade from abroad.",
      "The president first hinted at hosting a military parade after attending France's annual Bastille Day parade in 2017. He called it \"a tremendous thing,\" and added, \"We're going to have to try and top it\" on the Fourth of July. His administration began planning a Veterans' Day parade a year later, but it was called off, with Mr. Trump blaming city officials for driving up the cost.",
      "France has hosted its Bastille Day military parade every July for over a century, recognizing the anniversary of the start of the 1789 French Revolution. Several other countries host regular military parades, including India, Pakistan,\u00a0Russia\u00a0and North Korea.",
      "But similar events have been fairly rare in the United States. O'Connell says that's probably due to a \"long, long strain in American culture, on both left and right, of being healthily suspicious of state power and of military power in particular.\"",
      "\"It's certainly deep in the American military character to be nervous about a garrison state, a militarized society,\" O'Connell said.",
      "Mr. Trump's plans to host a military parade this weekend have drawn criticism, with some Democrats calling the idea wasteful and self-aggrandizing.",
      "But the White House has defended Saturday's event, calling it \"a fitting tribute to the service, sacrifice, and selflessness of all who have worn the uniform.\"",

      "The Trump administration has directed Immigration and Customs Enforcement to halt arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels amid concerns that the president's crackdown on illegal immigration is hurting key industries, two sources familiar with the abrupt policy change told CBS News.",
      "The pause on worksite immigration enforcement operations applies to the agricultural, hospitality and restaurant industries, which rely in large part on labor from immigrants, many of whom are in the U.S. unlawfully, the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal actions.",
      "The scaling back of some ICE operations reflects increased concern among industry leaders that the Trump administration's aggressive and government-wide immigration crackdown was hindering their businesses and the broader U.S. economy by spooking their workforce.",
      "It also marks a significant pivot for the Trump administration, which has vowed to deport millions of immigrants living in the country without legal status, regardless of whether they have criminal histories. And it comes amid a vast expansion in immigration arrests across the U.S. that has triggered protests against ICE activity in major American cities, including Los Angeles, where Mr. Trump has deployed the National Guardsmen and U.S. Marines in response to instances of violence.",
      "Asked about the catalyst for the sudden decision to limit ICE enforcement, one of the sources said the president was not aware of the scale of the agency's operations.",
      "\"When it hit him, he pulled it back,\" the source said.",
      "Asked about the move, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, \"We will follow the President's direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America's streets.\"",
      "The New York Times first reported the move.",
      "Mr. Trump came into office in January promising to launch the largest deportation effort in U.S. history. His administration quickly reversed limits on ICE operations put in place by previous administrations and moved to revoke the legal status of hundreds of thousands of migrants, greatly expanding the pool of those at risk of being arrested and deported.",
      "In recent weeks, ICE arrests have increased sharply, with the agency adopting more aggressive tactics, including efforts to arrest migrants and asylum-seekers attending their court hearings and check-in appointments.",
      "So far in June, ICE has averaged more than 1,300 arrests each day, a more than 100% increase from President Trump's first 100 days in office, when the agency recorded a 660 daily arrest rate, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News. On Saturday, ICE was holding more than 56,000 individuals in detention facilities throughout the country, a record high, the figures show.",
      "While ICE operations have expanded recently, the arrests recorded by the agency remain well below the 3,000 daily arrest rate pushed by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.",

      "A flagship \"No Kings\" march and rally are planned in Philadelphia, but no events are scheduled to take place in Washington, D.C., where the military parade will take place on Trump's 79th birthday. Organizers of the protests say they want to take attention away from the parade.",

      "Police in Los Angeles responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades while officials enforced curfews the city and Democratic governors called Trump's Guard deployment \"an alarming abuse of power\" that \"shows the Trump administration does not trust local law enforcement.\"",

At least three people have died in Israel, and dozens wounded, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) officials said Saturday morning.

      "Israel's initial assault used warplanes \u2014 as well as drones smuggled into the country in advance, according to officials \u2014 to hit key facilities and kill top generals and scientists. Israel's army said Saturday it killed nine senior scientists and experts involved in Iran's nuclear project.",

      "Iran retaliated by launching waves of drones and ballistic missiles at Israel, where explosions lit the night skies over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and shook the buildings below. The Israeli military urged civilians, already rattled by 20 months of war in Gaza sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, to head to shelter for hours. U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News that U.S. forces helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles on Friday.",
      "Both Israel and Iran said their attacks would continue, raising the prospect of another protracted Mideast conflict.

It also appeared to strike a second, smaller nuclear enrichment facility in Fordo, about 60 miles southeast of Tehran, according to an Iranian news outlet close to the government that reported hearing explosions nearby.",
      "Israel said it also struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan, and said it destroyed dozens of radar installations and surface-to-air missile launchers in western Iran. Iran confirmed the strike at Isfahan.",
      "U.N. nuclear chief Rafael Grossi told the Security Council that the above-ground section of the Natanz facility was destroyed. The main centrifuge facility underground did not appear to have been hit, but the loss of power could have damaged the infrastructure there, he said.",
      "Netanyahu said the attack had been months in the making and was planned for April before being postponed.",
      "Israel's Mossad spy agency positioned explosive drones and precision weapons inside Iran ahead of time, and used them to target Iranian air defenses and missile launchers near Tehran, according to two security officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "It was not possible to independently corroborate those claims.",
      "Over the past year, Israel has been targeting Iran's air defenses, hitting a radar system for a Russian-made air defense battery in April 2024, and surface-to-air missile sites and missile manufacturing facilities in October.",
      "The first wave of strikes gave Israel \"significant freedom of movement\" in Iran's skies, clearing the way for further attacks, according to an Israeli military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss details of the attack with the media.",
      "The official said Israel is prepared for an operation that could last up to two weeks, but that there was no firm timeline.",
      "Among those killed were three of Iran's top military leaders: one who oversaw the entire armed forces, Gen. Mohammad Bagheri; one who led the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, Gen. Hossein Salami; and the head of the Guard's ballistic missile program, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh.",
      "Two of Bagheri's deputies were also killed, Iran confirmed Saturday: Gen. Gholamreza Mehrabi, the deputy of intelligence for the armed forces' general staff, and Gen. Mehdi Rabbani, the deputy of operations.",
      "On Saturday, Khamenei named a new leader for the Revolutionary Guard's aerospace division. Gen. Majid Mousavi will replace Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, who was killed in Friday's airstrike. The Guard's aerospace division oversees Iran's arsenal of ballistic missiles.",

    "story": [
      "The Army is commemorating its 250th anniversary with a festival and parade in Washington, D.C., today which is also President Trump's 79th birthday. The event, according to Army officials, is expected to include about 6,600 soldiers, as well as about 150 vehicles and over 50 aircraft in the celebration.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to attend the festivities, D.C. officials said.",
      "Here's what else to know:",
      "Why is the festival and parade being held on June 14?",
      "The Second Continental Congress, on June 14, 1775, voted to establish official companies following the fighting at Lexington and Concord against British troops. Congress voted to create the Continental Army and then, on June 15, appointed George Washington as commander in chief.",
      "Planning has been in the works for almost two years to commemorate the anniversary with a festival, according to Army officials, but a parade was only added earlier this year. Army officials said the Army is not expected to officially recognize Mr. Trump's birthday.",
      "How much will the event cost?",
      "Army officials estimate the entire festival and parade could cost between $25 million and $45 million but did not disclose the cost before the parade was added to the schedule.",
      "When asked by members of Congress about the justification for the cost, as the Trump administration has sought cuts across the federal government, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said the United States has an \"an amazing opportunity\" to tell a story about the Army.",
      "\"I believe very specifically that telling that story will directly lead to a recruiting boom that will fill up our pipeline for the coming years,\" Driscoll told the House Armed Services Committee.",
      "What is the parade route?",
      "The parade will start at 6:30 p.m., running from 23rd Street NW along Constitution Avenue to 15th Street NW and wrap up around 7:30 p.m.",
      "Before the parade, the festival will take place on the National Mall in D.C. from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. A fireworks show will follow the parade at 9:45 p.m.",
      "When was the last time D.C. hosted a military parade?",
      "The most recent time D.C. hosted a military parade was in 1991, to mark the end of the Gulf War. The National Victory parade featured around 8,000 service members, and about 200,000 people watched the parade. According to The Washington Post, the event cost $8 million.",
      "How has the military prepared for the event?",
      "The Army has been laying down metal plates to prevent damage to D.C. roads by some of the heavier equipment, like M1A1 Abrams tanks, which can weigh over 60 tons. If there is any damage to the roads, the Army has committed to paying for the repair.",
      "An Army spokesperson said the military will strategically place 1-inch steel plates \u2014 in sizes ranging from 4 feet by 8 feet to 8 feet by 20 feet \u2014 at points where the equipment will turn.",
      "U.S. Army Col. Jesse Curry, director of the Office of the Chief of Engineers, said during a security briefing on Monday that in addition to the plates, \"the tanks all have brand new rubber track pads placed on them, which increase the padding that they have underneath each track to minimize that potential damage, and it's a parade, so they're going to be moving slowly.\"",
      "What soldiers and equipment will participate?",
      "About 6,600 soldiers representing every era of the Army's 250 years of history are expected to participate in the parade, according to Army officials. In addition, the Army anticipates that about 150 vehicles and more than 50 aircraft will participate in the celebration.",
      "The parade will feature different eras of the Army's history, from the Revolutionary War to the modern era and into the future with corresponding uniforms and equipment.",
      "Army officials say among the equipment included will be 26 M1A1 Abrams tanks, 27 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, two World War II Sherman tanks, a World War I-era Renault tank, eight CH-47 helicopters, 16 UH-60 Black Hawks and four WWII-era P-51 aircraft.",

      "Preparations have been taking place all week in Washington, with tanks arriving and fencing going up in the northwest part of the city around the White House and National Mall.",
      "What's the purpose of the military parade?",
      "Saturday's events are intended to mark the 250th birthday of the Army. The U.S. Army was established on June 14, 1775, by the Second Continental Congress a little over a year before the Declaration of Independence was signed. It was first called the Continental Army, and George Washington was appointed its first commander.",
      "More broadly, the president has declared Saturday a celebration of the country, intended to recognize America's accomplishments both on the battlefield and off it. Mr. Trump has particularly touted America's victories in World War I and World War II.",
      "\"I think it's time for us to celebrate a little bit, you know,\" the president said Wednesday. \"We've had a lot of victories. We've won two world wars \u2026 I think it's a time to celebrate our military.\"",

      "Political backlash to the president's military parade",
      "The president's parade plans have been criticized for both the cost and the optics. As the administration and the Department of Government Efficiency have been touting their efforts to eliminate waste, the parade and festivities to celebrate an armed services branch anniversary are estimated by the Army to cost\u00a0between $25 million and $45 million.",
      "\"Trump is throwing himself a $30 million birthday parade just to stroke his own ego,\" Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a veteran who lost both of her legs in Iraq, said on X last week.",
      "Some think military parades are evocative of authoritarian regimes. \"Never been a big fan of goose-stepping soldiers and big tanks and missiles rolling down the street,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told reporters this week. \"So, if you ask me, I wouldn't have done it.\"",
      "\"We were always different than the images you saw of the Soviet Union and North Korea,\" Paul added. \"We were proud not to be that. And I don't \u2014 I'm not proposing that that's the image people want to project, but I'm worried about the image that it isn't necessarily the best image to show.\"",
      "Democrats have also criticized the president for warning people against participating in protests against the parade.",
      "\"If there's any protesters that want to come out, they're going to be met with very big force,\" the president told reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware called the president's message an \"authoritarian tactic.\"",
      "\"He wasn't talking about people who were engaged in violence,\" Murphy said of Mr. Trump's remarks in an interview with podcaster Joe Gallina. \"He wasn't talking about people who were doing property damage in D.C. He just said anybody who comes out to protest my military parade is going to be treated roughly. That's an authoritarian tactic.\"",

      "The main message conveyed by the Trump administration in its outreach to allies was that the strikes were not a U.S. operation and did not involve American assets, and that the U.S. preferred diplomacy to military force.",
      "The impression left with multiple regional allied governments was that the Trump administration was trying to distance itself from the military action and the fallout that might occur as a result, including unintended consequences for allies in the region \u2014 particularly those that host U.S. forces.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the State Department and White House for comment.",
      "The State Department did not follow the standard practice of providing details of calls to foreign ministers.",

      "The Trump administration has said publicly it was not militarily involved in Israel's strikes, though it had advance notice of Israel's plan to strike Iran. The U.S. did help Israel intercept Iranian missiles fired in retaliation, a U.S. official and a White House official confirmed to CBS News. Israeli officials have told CBS News their government gave advance warning to the U.S. but have remained vague about the degree of coordination.",
      "Iran's military retaliated against the Israeli strikes with a wave of missile and drone attacks on Israel that injured more than 20 people, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Prior to the strikes, Iran threatened to target U.S. bases in the region if it is attacked.",
      "Rubio has warned Iran against targeting U.S. forces.",
      "President Trump is also seeking to strike a deal with Iran to limit the size of its nuclear program. In a Friday morning Truth Social post, Mr. Trump told Iran to \"make a deal, before there is nothing left.\"",
      "The U.S. and Iran were set to hold talks Sunday, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News. Some reports in Iranian media outlets indicated Iran would likely no longer participate in the negotiations.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News allied countries fear a wider war in the region, and unintended consequences that may come from this attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "The U.S. has air bases in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, housing U.S. military equipment along with American service members. The U.S. also has troops in Syria and Iraq.",
      "Several of the United States' regional allies also have relations with Israel via the Abraham Accords, a set of normalization deals between Israel and Arab states struck during Mr. Trump's first term. Those deals link them both to Israel and its largest weapons provider, the U.S.",
      "A number of these same U.S.-allied governments have their own concerns about the Iranian nuclear program and Iran's practice of backing militias throughout the Middle East, but strongly object to any attempts at external regime change efforts or actions that could ignite nationalist sentiment and inflame proxy forces that could put them at risk.",
      "The proximity of Arab states like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to Iran also makes radiation fallout and contamination from strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities a concern for their governments. For example, the Bushehr nuclear facility in Iran is across the Persian Gulf from Kuwait, which has an extensive U.S. military presence on its shores.",

      "But Abrego Garcia's lawyers have accused the Trump administration of abusing its power and engaging in \"delay and secrecy\" in the process of returning him to the U.S. A judge in Maryland ordered him to be returned to the U.S. in April, but the Justice Department declined to do so for months, only to bring him back days ago so he can be prosecuted.",
      "The federal judge overseeing Abrego Garcia's case did not rule on his detention Friday after an hours-long hearing, but said she will issue a written decision \"soon.\"",
      "Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of his attorneys, said last week that he doesn't believe Abrego Garcia will be convicted.",
      "\"There's no way a jury is going to see the evidence and agree that this sheet metal worker is the leader of an international MS-13 smuggling conspiracy,\" he said.",
      "The indictment unsealed last week alleges that between 2016 and 2025, Abrego Garcia conspired with others to bring migrants from Latin American countries into the U.S., passing through Mexico before crossing the border into Texas.",
      "Prosecutors said that he and an unnamed co-conspirator would pick up the migrants in Houston and transport them to other places in the U.S. They claimed that Abrego Garcia and the co-conspirator devised \"cover stories\" to provide law enforcement if stopped, like that they were transporting people for construction work.",
      "Abrego Garcia and his co-conspirators \"knowingly and unlawfully transported thousands\" of migrants who are not legally in the U.S., the indictment alleges.",
      "Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March after he was arrested by federal immigration authorities in Maryland, where he has lived since arriving in the U.S. in 2011. After the man and his wife sued over his removal, an immigration official with the Trump administration acknowledged that his deportation to El Salvador was an administrative error.",
      "In 2019, an immigration judge granted Abrego Garcia a legal status known as withholding of removal. That protection forbade the Department of Homeland Security from removing him to his country of origin \u2014 El Salvador \u2014 because he was likely to face persecution from gangs.",
      "The Maryland judge ordered the Trump administration in April to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., and that order was largely affirmed by the Supreme Court. But the administration resisted bringing him back to the U.S., arguing that the judge lacked the authority to require it to do so.",
      "Abrego Garcia had initially been held at El Salvador's supermax prison, the Terrorism Confinement Center, also known as CECOT. But he was transferred to a lower-security facility in April, the State Department said.",
      "Bondi said the Salvadoran government agreed to release Abrego Garcia to face the criminal charges in the U.S. after it was presented with a warrant for his release.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys have also moved to keep the civil case seeking his return active, rebuking a Justice Department filing after his return to the U.S. last week that claimed the Maryland judge's order mandating his return had been fulfilled and the case is now moot. The Salvadoran man's lawyers called the Trump administration's handling of his case \"pure farce\" in a court filing Monday.",
      "\"Instead of facilitating Abrego Garcia's return, for the past two months defendants have engaged in an elaborate, all-of-government effort to defy court orders, deny due process, and disparage Abrego Garcia,\" the attorneys wrote, asking the Maryland judge overseeing the case to start contempt proceedings and impose sanctions on the government.",
      "In response, the Justice Department said that it has \"done exactly what plaintiffs asked for and what this court ordered them to do,\" in facilitating his return to the US, and said it would file a motion to dismiss the case next week.",
      "\"The proof is in the pudding \u2014 defendants have returned Abrego Garcia to the United States just as they were ordered to do. None of plaintiffs' hyperbolic arguments change that or justify further proceedings in this matter,\" Justice Department attorneys wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Columbia University student activist Mahmoud Khalil can remain in federal detention on allegations he lied on his green card application, a federal judge ruled Friday.",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz said days earlier the Trump administration cannot detain or deport Khalil based on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that he could harm foreign policy. The New Jersey judge wrote that Khalil had shown his detention was causing irreparable harm to his career, family and free speech rights.",
      "But the judge acknowledged Friday his earlier ruling did not address the Trump administration's other stated basis for holding Khalil, that he allegedly left out information about his career and prior associations on his green card form.",
      "Farbiarz said it is now up to Khalil to ask for bail from the immigration judge overseeing his case.",
      "In a filing Friday, the government argued that Farbiarz never said it would be \"unlawful\" to detain Khalil over concerns about his green card application, even as the judge noted in his Wednesday ruling that evidence suggested that legal permanent residents are virtually never detained for such reasons.",
      "Khalil, for his part, disputes that he wasn't forthcoming in his application. He maintains, among other things, that he was never employed by or served as an \"officer\" of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, as the administration claims, but completed an internship approved by the university as part of his graduate studies.",
      "In a letter to Farbiarz, Khalil's lawyers said he had satisfied all of the court's requirements to go free and that the government's lawyers missed a Friday morning deadline to challenge the judge's Wednesday ruling.",
      "After Farbiarz's ruling Friday, Khalil's legal team criticized his continued detention.",
      "\"Mahmoud Khalil was detained in retaliation for his advocacy for Palestinian rights. The government is now using cruel, transparent delay tactics to keep him away from his wife and newborn son ahead of their first Father's Day as a family,\" said lawyer Amy Greer, an associate at Dratel & Lewis.",
      "Khalil was detained on March 8 at his apartment building in Manhattan over his links to pro-Palestinian demonstrations. His was the first arrest under President Trump's crackdown on students who were connected to campus protests, typically citing a law that allows people to be removed from the U.S. if the secretary of state finds their presence could pose \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\"",
      "Khalil's lawyers say the Trump administration is simply trying to crack down on free speech.",
      "Khalil isn't accused of breaking any laws during the protests at Columbia. The international affairs graduate student served as a negotiator and spokesperson for student activists. He wasn't among the demonstrators arrested, but his prominence in news coverage and willingness to speak publicly made him a target of critics.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Friday urged Iran to \"make a deal, before there is nothing left\" after Israel launched roughly 200 strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, senior military leaders and research scientists, the opening attacks in what Israeli officials said is part of a major operation against Iran.",
      "Iran launched barrages of missiles against targets in Israel in retaliation on Friday, and the U.S. helped Israel intercept the missiles, U.S. officials confirmed.",
      "Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump urged Iran to\u00a0agree to new restrictions on its nuclear program while it still can. The president has previously said Iran cannot be allowed to enrich uranium, a term Iran has not been willing to accept. Mr. Trump spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, a White House official said.",
      "\"There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,\" Mr. Trump said in one post to his social media site, Truth Social, \"Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.\"",
      "The president said he had warned Iran about what would follow if it failed to reach a deal on its nuclear program.",
      "\"I told them it would be much worse than anything they know, anticipated, or were told, that the United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come - And they know how to use it,\" he continued. \"Certain Iranian hardliner's spoke bravely, but they didn't know what was about to happen. They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse!\"",
      "When the Wall Street Journal asked Mr. Trump Friday morning if the U.S. was notified ahead of the attack,\u00a0the president responded, \"Heads-up? It wasn't a heads-up. It was, we know what's going on.\" In a second Truth Social post, Mr. Trump suggested that he would give Iran a \"second chance\" to agree to limits on its nuclear program after initially setting a 60-day deadline.",
      "U.S. official says Iran \"would be wise to negotiate\"",
      "State Department official McCoy Pitt said at a U.N. Security Council meeting Friday the U.S. was told about Israel's strikes in advance but wasn't militarily involved in them, calling Israel's operation \"unilateral.\" Pitt said Iran has \"repeatedly called for the State of Israel's eradication\" and added, \"Every sovereign nation has the right to defend itself and Israel is no exception.\" He also noted the Trump administration still wants to pursue a \"diplomatic resolution.\"",
      "\"Iran's leadership would be wise to negotiate at this time,\" Pitt said.",

      "In a video statement, Netanyahi dubbed the attack \"Operation Rising Lion\" and said it is a targeted military operation \"to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival.\" Iranian state television said the head of its Revolution Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, and Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, chief of the staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, were killed in the strikes.",
      "Netanyahu said the assault \"will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.\"",
      "Iran took its own retaliatory action Friday,\u00a0launching more than 100 drones\u00a0at Israel, the Israeli military said. But Brigadier General Effie Defrin, spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, said the country's air defenses were \"working to intercept the threats.\" Iran's supreme leader on Friday said Israel will will not remain unscathed.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson voiced his support for Israel on Friday morning, saying the U.S. ally was \"clearly within their right\" to do what they did. He is set to address Israel's parliament, known as the Knesset, in Jerusalem on June 22.",
      "\"Israel and the United States have been united, including in our shared insistence that Iran must never obtain a nuclear weapon,\" Johnson wrote\u00a0on X. \"President Trump and his administration have worked tirelessly to ensure that outcome. Unfortunately, Iran has refused to agree and even declared yesterday its intent to build a new enrichment facility.   Israel decided it needed to take action to defend itself. They were clearly within their right to do so.   Iran will face grave consequences if it responds by unjustifiably targeting U.S. interests.\"",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called Israel's strikes \"an escalation that is deeply concerning and will inevitably invite counterattacks\" and said the Trump administration \"must quickly move to deescalate the situation.\"",
      "\"This risks not only U.S. negotiations with Iran, but the safety of American service members, diplomats, their families and ex-pats around the region,\" she said in a statement. \"I agree with President Trump's instinct to distance the U.S. from Israel's actions, but Iran and its proxies are unlikely to differentiate the U.S. from Israel.\"",

      "The preliminary injunction \u2014 issued by U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz of New Jersey \u2014 does not go into effect until Friday morning, giving the government a chance to appeal. But it marks a blow to the Trump administration's push to remove Khalil, a green card holder who was detained by immigration agents in March and is currently being held in Louisiana.",
      "The ruling focuses on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that Khalil's \"presence or activities would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\" Farbiarz had previously said that seeking to deport Khalil for that reason is probably unconstitutional, but had stopped short of issuing an injunction until Wednesday.",
      "Farbiarz said, \"the Court finds as a matter of fact that [Khalil's] career and reputation are being damaged and his speech is being chilled \u2014 and this adds up to irreparable harm.\"",
      "Crucially, Farbiarz said his findings \"have no impact on efforts to remove [Khalil] for reasons other than the Secretary of State's determination.\" That means the administration could still try to deport Khalil for allegedly leaving out details on his green card application \u2014 another reason that government lawyers have given for his detention.",
      "But Farbiarz found that the government is almost certainly detaining Khalil right now because of the Rubio determination, and not due to issues with his green card application. He noted it's very rare for green card holders to be held in detention for omitting information on their paperwork.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the State Department and Justice Department for comment.",
      "The Trump administration is pushing to deport Khalil and several other international students with links to pro-Palestinian campus activism. The government has typically cited a law allowing the government to deport people if the secretary of state believes their presence in the U.S. poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\"",
      "Another Columbia student and green card holder involved in pro-Palestinian protests \u2014 Mohsen Mahdawi \u2014 was detained weeks after Khalil while attending what he was told was a citizenship interview, though a judge ordered Mahdawi's release. Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, whose lawyers say she was targeted for co-writing a campus newspaper op-ed, was also detained for several weeks until a judge ordered her release. Both students could still face deportation proceedings.",
      "The moves have drawn stiff pushback from critics, who argue the Trump administration is punishing students for First Amendment-protected speech. The judge in Mahdawi's case compared the government's conduct to the 1950s-era Red Scare and McCarthyism.",
      "But the administration argues it has the right to revoke visas and has accused some of the students of antisemitic or threatening behavior, which the students have denied.",
      "\"We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa,\" Rubio said in March.",

The Israel Defense Forces said its air defenses were \"working to intercept the threats.\"",
      "The Iranian drones could take as long as nine hours to reach Israel's airspace, but Israel has previously intercepted Iranian weapons before they get that close. The timing of the Iranian drone launch was not clear, but Israeli media said some were expected to start arriving in the country's airspace by about midday local time, which would be about 4 a.m. Eastern.",

      "IDF Spokesperson Brigadier General Effie Defrin said in a video statement Friday morning that \"200 fighter jets went on the attack and dropped over 330 different munitions\" on more than 100 targets in Iran, beginning Operation Rising Lion. He said the IDF had confirmed that \"senior members of the Iranian regime's security leadership\" had been killed, including the Iranian military's chief of staff and the Revolutionary Guard's Salami.",
      "Deffrin said Israel had launched its operation \"at the most appropriate time in light of an existing and real threat and with the highest military readiness,\" claiming intelligence showed \"the Iranian regime has made significant progress in achieving nuclear capability and its ability to act against us,\" calling it an emerging and existential threat to Israel.",

      "Defrin, the IDF spokesman who gave the remarks on Israeli television Friday morning, said the goal of Israel's attack was to eliminate the threat of an Iranian \"plan to destroy Israel that has taken shape in recent years,\" consisting, he said, of three components.",
      "The first of which is the Iranian regime \"racing towards a nuclear bomb,\" Defrin said, claiming new Israeli intelligence indicated the Iranian regime \"has established a secret program, within the framework of which senior nuclear scientists in Iran secretly conducted the experiments required to build nuclear weapons.\"",
      "\"This is unequivocal proof that the Iranian regime is working to obtain nuclear weapons in the near future,\" said Defrin. He did not share any details of the new intelligence.",
      "Second, Defrin said Iran had thousands of ballistic missiles, \"and it plans to double and triple them in light of the understanding that this is an effective threat to Israel. This is a quantity of missiles that constitutes an existential threat.\"",

      "\"All of this is connected to the plan to destroy Israel that has taken shape in recent years,\" he said.",
      "Strikes come amid U.S.-Iran nuclear talks",
      "The strikes came as the Trump administration has been seeking to negotiate an agreement with Iran's government to limit the country's nuclear program. Mr. Trump has said Iran cannot be allowed to enrich uranium, but Iran is unwilling to accept those terms.",
      "The U.S. and Iran are still expected to hold talks on Sunday, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News. Steve Witkoff, the president's Mideast envoy, was planning to hold a sixth round of talks in Oman over the weekend.",

      "Israel has long been skeptical of striking a deal with Iran, its top global foe, and has acknowledged carrying out various covert and overt actions over the years to set back Iran's nuclear ambitions.",
      "Iran's nuclear program has existed for decades, though the country denies that it has any interest in building a nuclear weapon. International watchdogs say Iran has increased its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium in recent years, after Mr. Trump withdrew from a 2015 Obama-era nuclear agreement that he viewed as weak.",
      "In a statement announcing the strikes, the IDF said Iran \"is closer than ever to obtaining a nuclear weapon\" and \"has proclaimed that its objective is to destroy the State of Israel.\" Israel also cited Iran's support for militant groups in the region, including the terrorist group Hamas, and Iran's ballistic missile attacks on Israel last year.",
      "CBS News reported Wednesday that Israel was ready to launch an operation on Iran. The U.S. anticipated Iranian retaliation on American sites in Iraq \u2014 leading the Trump administration to advise non-emergency U.S. government officials and military families to leave the entire region.",

    "title": "This T. rex ancestor is \"missing link\" to apex predators, scientists say",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/t-rex-ancestor-dinosaur-missing-link-apex-predators/",
    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 11:00:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Apex predators, like the Tyrannosaurus rex, eventually arose from smaller-bodied tyrannosauroid dinosaurs called Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, the study's researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "More than 85 million years ago, a smaller-bodied ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the plains of Mongolia. The dinosaur's identity was unknown \u2014 until now.",
      "In a study\u00a0published Wednesday in Nature, scientists describe the identification of a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",
      "\"This species, Khankhuuluu, is the missing link between smaller and earlier forms and the larger apex predatory tyrannosaurs,\" paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky, a professor at the University of Calgary and study co-author, told CBS News.",
      "The Khankhuuluu's skeleton was discovered in Mongolia in the Gobi Desert in 1972 or 1973, but wasn't studied scientifically until a few years later, Zelenitsky said. The remains were identified by Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle as Alectrosaurus olsoni, another obscure species. After it was misidentified, the bones became part of a museum collection and were relatively untouched for almost 50 years.",
      "Referred to as mid-grade tyrannosauroids, these smaller-bodied predators were evolutionary intermediates, the study found. During the period when Khankhuuluu lived in Mongolia, the tyrannosaurs began growing larger and taking on the features of apex predators. Not much else is known about these elusive tyrannosauroids due to fragmentary fossil remains, but researchers said the dinosaurs weighed around 1,700 pounds. They were one of the larger predators in the ecosystem at the time.",
      "\"It's essentially the immediate ancestor of the tyrannosaur family,\" Zelenitsky said.",
      "A surprise discovery",
      "University of Calgary postdoctoral scholar and study co-author Jared Voris traveled to Mongolia a few years earlier to research the bones of various tyrannosaurs and, in the process, gained access to see the bones of what they would later determine are the Khankhuuluu.",
      "Voris thought the remains could be something important, as he often saw references to the specimens pop up, but after he started examining the bones, he knew it could be something special. While studying the individual characteristics of the bones, one of the things he noticed was that the Khankhuuluu's teeth couldn't crush bone, Voris said, a defining characteristic of the larger apex predatory Tyrannosaurus.",
      "\"This animal had features we had never seen before in more of our iconic tyrannosaurs,\" Voris said.",
      "He texted Zelenitsky from Mongolia that he \"thought it could be a new species.\" Zelenitsky said she responded, \"I said, great going, keep looking at this so we can be sure this is a new species.\"",
      "The two paleontologists aren't new to groundbreaking scientific discoveries \u2014 they've had several.\u00a0In 2023, Zelenitsky was part of a team that identified a Tyrannosaurus fossil with a meal in its stomach, and Voris discovered a new species of tyrannosaurid dinosaur, Thanatotheristes degrootorum \u2014 whose genus name translates to \"Reaper of Death.\"",
      "\"Rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs\"",
      "These Asian tyrannosauroids eventually crossed over into North America using a northern land bridge between Alaska and Siberia, Zelenitsky said. Dinosaurs used these land bridges, which appeared periodically over the past 100 million years, to travel between Asia and North America.",
      "And from it, these tyrannosauroids evolved and morphed into apex predators. T. rex is the\u00a0deadliest land predator\u00a0ever to live, and there has long been a fascination with the dinosaur that has been extinct for about 66 million years.",
      "The study co-authors said the new identification shows there are still big discoveries to be made in science. \"What really started just as a discovery of a new species ended up with us kind of rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs,\" Zelenitsky said.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Jun 2025 09:28:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
    "story": [
      "The Joro spider, Asian long-horned beetle and spotted lanternfly have company this summer.",
      "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting continues to spread across the U.S. and can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
      "Asian needle ants were first detected in the U.S. almost a century ago, but the species has continued to expand its reach, primarily throughout the Southeast, and this pest could potentially be deadly to humans, according to Dan Suiter, a professor of urban entomology at the University of Georgia.",
      "\"It injects venom that can harm you. Its sting can be life threatening,\" Suiter recently told the university.",
      "Suiter added that people who have adverse reactions to bee and ant stings are especially vulnerable and could go into anaphylactic shock from the needle ant's sting. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within seconds of being exposed to something you're allergic to, such as a sting, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"If you suffer from anaphylaxis, you should really know what this ant looks like,\" Suiter says. \"And it might be smart to carry an EpiPen.\"",
      "Suiter urged people to be vigilant for these invasive species, especially with ant populations peaking later this summer.",
      "What are Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are technically known as Brachyponera chinensis\u00a0\u2014 roughly translated as \"short, wicked ant from China\" \u2014 but their native range also includes Japan and the Koreas, according to the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "The insect was first discovered in the U.S. in 1932 in Georgia, but has only recently started to \"cause problems in North America after being relatively unnoticed for many years,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "The pest has now been detected all the way from Washington state to Florida, according to the site\u00a0antmaps.org as well as Mississippi State University, and the ant is recently getting more attention in Texas.",
      "Suiter says Asian needle ants are \"sneaky\" because they are less than a quarter of an inch long and are adept at hiding.",
      "\"Unlike many invasive species that tend to colonize areas in the wake of natural or human disturbance, Asian needle ants are capable of invading undisturbed forest areas where they nest under and within logs and other debris, under stones, and in leaf litter,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "Environmental impacts",
      "According to Suiter, Asian needle ants wreak havoc in native environments.",
      "\"They outcompete other ant species that are important to the ecology of that area,\" he says.",
      "Asian needle ants prey on other insects and are capable of displacing ant species that are critical for seed dispersal, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Researchers have documented large decreases in seed dispersal in forests where Asian needle ants are present.",
      "\"Thus, this invasive species could have dramatic, long-term negative effects on forest understory,\" the service says.",
      "What should people do if they see Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are about 0.2 inches in length, and dark brown or black with the end of the antennae and the legs being a lighter orange-brown, the U.S. Forest Service says. Other ant species can look similar, \"so it takes an experienced eye to positively identify them,\" the service says.",
      "Suiter says that you can send a photograph or a specimen to a local University of Georgia Extension office, which can help with identification. The public can also contact a professional to come out and bait for the ants, he says.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service advises people to avoid the pest and to be especially vigilant in areas with logs, rotting wood or rocks where the ants can nest.",
      "\"Unfortunately, as with many invasive species, it appears Asian needle ants are here to stay,\" the service says.",

      "The agency did not provide any additional launch details, but based on the space station's orbit and rendezvous requirements, a Thursday takeoff would be targeted for 4:53 a.m. EDT.",
      "If that schedule holds up, commander Peggy Whitson, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, Polish researcher S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu would aim for a docking at the space-facing port of the station's Harmony module around 10:30 a.m. on Friday.",
      "The flight originally was planned for last Tuesday but it was repeatedly delayed, first by high winds in the off-shore emergency splashdown zone and then by troubleshooting to find an oxygen leak in the first stage of the crew's Falcon 9 rocket.",
      "While SpaceX worked to resolve the oxygen propellant leak, NASA managers decided they needed more time to assess recent efforts to stop or minimize air leaks in a Russian vestibule, known as the PrK, that serves as a passageway between the station's Zvezda module and spacecraft docked at its aft port.",
      "The leakage was first noticed in 2019 and up to now, efforts to seal them off have been unsuccessful. But on Friday, Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, reported cosmonauts aboard the station had successfully eliminated the leaks in the PrK.",
      "\"Following the most recent repair, pressure in the transfer tunnel has been stable,\" NASA confirmed in a blog post Saturday. \"This could indicate the small leaks have been sealed.\"",
      "The leak rates seen earlier could be related to \"a small amount of air flowing into the transfer tunnel across the hatch seal from the main part of the station,\" NASA said.",
      "\"By changing pressure in the transfer tunnel and monitoring over time, teams are evaluating the condition of the transfer tunnel configuration, resulting in an updated launch opportunity for the private astronaut mission.\"",
      "The flight is the fourth Crew Dragon launch chartered by Houston-based Axiom Space. Throughout the two-week mission, Whitson and her crewmates will carry out a full slate of science research and technology demonstrations, along with interactive educational events in the crew's home countries.",

    "story": [
      "Concern about a small but persistent air leak in a Russian compartment of the International Space Station has prompted NASA and Axiom Space to indefinitely delay this week's launch of a commercial flight to the orbiting outpost, officials said Thursday.",
      "The privately-financed Axiom-4 crew \u2014 commander Peggy Whitson, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, Polish researcher S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu \u2014 originally planned to take off Tuesday.",
      "But the flight was delayed to the end of the week, first by high winds in the off-shore emergency splashdown zone and then by an oxygen leak in their Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. SpaceX tentatively targeted Thursday and then Friday for launch, with Saturday and Sunday available if needed.",
      "But during SpaceX troubleshooting to find and fix the rocket's propellant leak, NASA engineers decided they needed more time to assess recent efforts to plug an air leak aboard the International Space Station in a Russian vestibule known as the PrK. The PrK serves as a passageway between the station's Zvezda module and spacecraft docked at its aft port.",
      "\"Teams met today and we will not be launching Axiom-4 tomorrow,\" flight controllers in Houston radioed the ISS. \"We are assessing a new launch date. This is due to the ongoing PrK investigation. So I don't have a new launch date right now, but we will not be launching tomorrow and docking Saturday.\"",
      "In a blog post, NASA said cosmonauts aboard the station \"recently performed inspections of the pressurized module's interior surfaces, sealed some additional areas of interest, and measured the current leak rate. Following this effort, the segment now is holding pressure.\"",
      "The post went on to say  the Axiom-4 delay will provide \"additional time for NASA and (the Russian space agency) Roscosmos to evaluate the situation and determine whether any additional troubleshooting is necessary.\"",
      "Launched in July 2000 atop a Russian Proton rocket, Zvezda was the third module to join the growing space station, providing a command center for Russian cosmonauts, crew quarters, the aft docking port and two additional ports now occupied by airlock and research modules.",
      "The leakage was first noticed in 2019, and has been openly discussed ever since by NASA during periodic reviews and space station news briefings. The leak rate has varied, but has stayed in the neighborhood of around 1-to-2 pounds per day.",
      "\"The station is not young,\" astronaut Mike Barratt said last November during a post flight news conference. \"It's been up there for quite a while, and you expect some wear and tear, and we're seeing that in the form of some cracks that have formed.\"",
      "The Russians have made a variety of attempts to patch a suspect crack and other possible sources of leakage, but air has continued to escape into space.",
      "In November, Bob Cabana, a former astronaut and NASA manager who chaired the agency's ISS Advisory Committee, said U.S. and Russian engineers \"don't have a common understanding of what the likely root cause is, or the severity of the consequences of these leaks.\"",
      "\"The Russian position is that the most probable cause of the PrK cracks is high cyclic fatigue caused by micro vibrations,\" Cabana said. \"NASA believes the PrK cracks are likely multi-causal including pressure and mechanical stress, residual stress, material properties and environmental exposures.",
      "\"The Russians believe that continued operations are safe, but they can't prove to our satisfaction that they are, and the US believes that it's not safe, but we can't prove that to the Russian satisfaction that that's the case.\"",
      "As an interim step, the hatch leading to the PrK and the station's aft docking compartment is closed during daily operations and only opened when the Russians need to unload a visiting Progress cargo ship.",
      "And as an added precaution on NASA's part, whenever the hatch to the PrK and docking compartment is open, a hatch between the Russian and U.S. segments of the station is closed.",
      "\"We've taken a very conservative approach to close a hatch between the US side and the Russian side during those time periods,\" Barratt said. \"It's not a comfortable thing, but it is the best agreement between all the smart people on both sides. And it's something that we crew live with and enact.\"",
      "Cabana said last year that the Russians do not believe \"catastrophic disintegration of the PrK is realistic (but) NASA has expressed concerns about the structural integrity of the PrK and the possibility of a catastrophic failure.\"",

      "Brooklyn Park police went proactively to Hortman's home after learning about the shooting at the Hoffman property, Brooklyn Park police chief Mark Bruley said. Hortman's home is about five miles from Hoffman's.",
      "Two Brooklyn Park police officers went to Hortman's home, and saw what appeared to be a police vehicle parked in front of the house with its emergency lights on, and a police officer leaving the house, Bruley said. The vehicle \"looked exactly like an SUV squad car,\" equipped with emergency lights, Bruley said. The individual was wearing a vest with a Taser, badge and other equipment, Bruley said. Bruley said the individual appeared to have knocked on the door of the home.",
      "The Brooklyn Park officers confronted the individual, who Burley said \"immediately\" fired and exchanged gunshots with officers, Bruley said. The individual then retreated into the home, Bruley said. The police officers then entered the home and saw that Hortman's husband had been shot. They attempted to render first aid, but he was pronounced dead. A drone was then used to search the rest of the home and found Hortman dead inside.",
      "Bruley said the individual was \"clearly\" impersonating a police officer and had used \"the trust of this badge and this uniform to manipulate their way into the home.\" A search of the individual's vehicle found a document that named other lawmakers and officials, Bruley said. Evans said both Hoffman and Hortman were included on the list but he did not elaborate on any other names.",
      "Extensive manhunt for suspect in shootings",
      "Authorities described the suspect as a White man with brown hair who is wearing a blue shirt, blue pants and a black tactical vest, according to CBS Minnesota. The suspect is believed to be on foot, Bruley said.",
      "An extensive manhunt is underway, Bruley said. Minnesota police agencies and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are leading the investigation, with assistance from federal agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
      "Several people have been detained and questioned, Bruley said, and police have identified \"people of interest,\" but a suspect is not in custody.",
      "A shelter-in-place order has been issued for Brooklyn Park, Bruley said, in a three-mile radius around the suburb's Edinburgh Golf Course. Increased security has been ordered for elected officials and others who may be at risk, he said.",
      "Who was Rep. Melissa Hortman?",
      "Hortman, 55, represented Minnesota House District 34B. She was the top House Democratic leader in the state Legislature and a former House speaker. A lawyer, Hortman was first elected to office in 2004. She and her husband, John, have two children, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Walz called the deaths of Hortman and her husband \"a political assassination.\"",
      "\"Hortman was someone who served the people of Minnesota with grace, compassion, humor, and a sense of service,\" Walz said. \"She was a formidable public servant. A fixture and a giant in Minnesota.\"",
      "DNC Chair Ken Martin, who was the chair of the state Democratic Party in Minnesota for 14 years, said Hortman was a \"close friend\" whom he had known since the start of his political career.",
      "\"As I said many times when I introduced her at events, she is the very best Speaker of the House that Minnesota has ever had,\" Martin said.",
      "Who is State Sen. John Hoffman?",
      "Hoffman, 60, represents Minnesota Senate District 34, which covers a swath of northwest Twin Cities suburbs. He was first elected in 2012 and has been reelected three times.",
      "He served as chair of the Human Services Committee, and also served on committees for energy, environment and health and human services, CBS Minnesota reported.",
      "He and his wife Yvette were each shot multiple times, Walz said. They are out of surgery and are receiving care, Walz said.",
      "The Hoffmans have one daughter, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Officials denounce political violence",
      "Gov. Walz said Americans \"don't settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,\" and emphasized that the shootings followed a special session where both sides compromised for the good of Minnesota.",
      "\"In the state of Minnesota, and as recently as last week, in the most closely divided state legislature in the country, we sat down, shook hands and compromised, and we served the state of Minnesota together,\" Walz said. \"It's possible in politically charged times to find compromise, democracy and civil discourse. I, Minnesota and across the country, stand against all forms of political violence.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said, \"Such horrific political violence has no place in our society, and every leader must unequivocally condemn it.\"",
      "President Trump said in a statement that he had been briefed on the \"terrible shooting\" and said Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI are investigating the situation and would prosecute anyone involved \"to the fullest extent of the law.\"",
      "\"Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!\"",

    "published": "Sat, 14 Jun 2025 12:03:42 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. has held events like President Trump's military parade throughout history, but they're uncommon.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is hosting a parade celebrating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army today, bringing tanks and soldiers to the streets of Washington, D.C., for the capital's first major military parade in more than three decades.",
      "The event \u2014 which is expected to cost between $25 million and $45 million \u2014 follows a years-long push by Mr. Trump to host a parade, dating back to his first term. The festivities coincide with Mr. Trump's 79th birthday, which the president says is unrelated.",
      "The U.S. has held military parades throughout history, but they're not especially common, and they're typically held to celebrate the victorious end of a war or the return of military personnel from fighting.",
      "\"There are historical comparisons to be made, but size and scale is tremendously different,\" Arizona State University history professor Brooks Simpson told CBS News.",
      "Here's a look back at past military parades:",
      "When was the last U.S. military parade?",
      "The U.S. marked the end of the Gulf War with parades in New York City and Washington in the first major military display on the streets of D.C. since the early decades of the Cold War.",
      "The festivities in the capital\u00a0featured around 8,000 military personnel, tanks, missile launchers, fireworks shows and an address by then-President George H.W. Bush. Some 800,000 people attended the event, which cost around $12 million, The Washington Post\u00a0reported in 1991, or just under $29 million in today's dollars.",
      "Hunter Ledbetter, a Marine reservist who was deployed to Iraq during the war, told the Post at the time that it was \"the most exciting moment of my life.\"",
      "The parade \u2014 which recognized the U.S.'s campaign to drive Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait \u2014 was largely uncontroversial, Simpson said: \"No one objected to that parade.\"",
      "Still, the parades drew some pushback. Some critics questioned the D.C. Gulf War parade's price tag, and D.C. officials said the procession of heavy tanks had left tread marks on the city's streets. New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis criticized the New York parade since it followed an uprising by Iraq's Kurds that Hussein's regime brutally suppressed.",
      "\"Honor is due the soldiers who were in the gulf,\" Lewis wrote at the time. \"But for other reasons \u2014 reasons all too painfully evident \u2014 it is clear now that a celebratory parade would be inappropriate. Fireworks while Kurdish babies die?\"",
      "Cold War inaugurations",
      "Presidential inaugural parades often include some military personnel, dating back to the first inauguration of President George Washington in 1789. In the early decades of the Cold War, the festivities also sometimes featured tanks and missiles on the streets of the capital.",
      "Some military equipment appears in photos from the 1949 parade after President Harry Truman's swearing-in, President Dwight Eisenhower's 1953 and 1957 inaugurations and President John F. Kennedy's 1961 festivities.",
      "Kennedy's inauguration featured a replica of the PT boat that the new president served on during World War II. The entire event cost around $1 million in 1961 dollars \u2014 or more than $10 million today \u2014 paid for by private donors, The New York Times wrote at the time.",
      "Simpson says inauguration parades sometimes included a few tanks as an exhibition, but they were typically \"much more limited\" than the parade planned for this weekend.",
      "\"It wasn't like Pennsylvania Avenue was lined with tanks,\" he said.",
      "Parades with military equipment became less common after the 1960s. That could be due to the Vietnam War, which was\u00a0deeply unpopular\u00a0in its later years, and the eventual easing of Cold War tensions.",
      "\"After Vietnam, parades get complicated because [parades are always] linked to the outcomes of the wars and the conduct of them,\" said Aaron O'Connell, a history professor at the University of Texas, Austin. \"And that makes it more difficult to cheer and throw a ticker tape parade, when people are coming home in ones and twos, and they're not coming home in large units, and the war hasn't gone as well as we would've liked.\"",
      "World Wars I and II",
      "New York City marked victory in World War II with a massive military parade on Fifth Avenue in early 1946. The event included thousands of members of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division and dozens of tanks and howitzers, requiring planners to close off the Manhattan Bridge and carefully bring heavy equipment over the East River from Brooklyn. The New York Times reported millions of spectators attended the parade.",
      "In mid-1942, months after the U.S. formally entered World War II, the city hosted a morale-boosting \"New York at War\" parade that the Times said was meant to \"give a realistic picture of what the American armed forces and their machines of destruction look like.\"",
      "The end of World War I was also celebrated by victory parades in New York and D.C. in 1919. It could've gone smoother: Dozens of artillery tractors that participated in the New York parade took a wrong turn after the event and got lost in Brooklyn for hours, the Times wrote at the time.",
      "Civil War and 19th century celebrations",
      "Washington hosted a massive two-day parade in May 1865 to celebrate the Union's victory in the Civil War, featuring over 100,000 troops, according to the National Park Service.",
      "The event \u2014 called the Grand Review of the Armies \u2014 was made up of military volunteers who passed through the capital on their way home from the former Confederate states, Simpson says. The event featured Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and President Andrew Johnson, taking place months after President Abraham Lincoln's assassination.",
      "\"The place was packed,\" said Simpson.",
      "Other countries",
      "Mr. Trump may have drawn inspiration for Saturday's parade from abroad.",
      "The president first hinted at hosting a military parade after attending France's annual Bastille Day parade in 2017. He called it \"a tremendous thing,\" and added, \"We're going to have to try and top it\" on the Fourth of July. His administration began planning a Veterans' Day parade a year later, but it was called off, with Mr. Trump blaming city officials for driving up the cost.",
      "France has hosted its Bastille Day military parade every July for over a century, recognizing the anniversary of the start of the 1789 French Revolution. Several other countries host regular military parades, including India, Pakistan,\u00a0Russia\u00a0and North Korea.",
      "But similar events have been fairly rare in the United States. O'Connell says that's probably due to a \"long, long strain in American culture, on both left and right, of being healthily suspicious of state power and of military power in particular.\"",
      "\"It's certainly deep in the American military character to be nervous about a garrison state, a militarized society,\" O'Connell said.",
      "Mr. Trump's plans to host a military parade this weekend have drawn criticism, with some Democrats calling the idea wasteful and self-aggrandizing.",
      "But the White House has defended Saturday's event, calling it \"a fitting tribute to the service, sacrifice, and selflessness of all who have worn the uniform.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has directed Immigration and Customs Enforcement to halt arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels amid concerns that the president's crackdown on illegal immigration is hurting key industries, two sources familiar with the abrupt policy change told CBS News.",
      "The pause on worksite immigration enforcement operations applies to the agricultural, hospitality and restaurant industries, which rely in large part on labor from immigrants, many of whom are in the U.S. unlawfully, the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal actions.",
      "The scaling back of some ICE operations reflects increased concern among industry leaders that the Trump administration's aggressive and government-wide immigration crackdown was hindering their businesses and the broader U.S. economy by spooking their workforce.",
      "It also marks a significant pivot for the Trump administration, which has vowed to deport millions of immigrants living in the country without legal status, regardless of whether they have criminal histories. And it comes amid a vast expansion in immigration arrests across the U.S. that has triggered protests against ICE activity in major American cities, including Los Angeles, where Mr. Trump has deployed the National Guardsmen and U.S. Marines in response to instances of violence.",
      "Asked about the catalyst for the sudden decision to limit ICE enforcement, one of the sources said the president was not aware of the scale of the agency's operations.",
      "\"When it hit him, he pulled it back,\" the source said.",
      "Asked about the move, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, \"We will follow the President's direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America's streets.\"",
      "The New York Times first reported the move.",
      "Mr. Trump came into office in January promising to launch the largest deportation effort in U.S. history. His administration quickly reversed limits on ICE operations put in place by previous administrations and moved to revoke the legal status of hundreds of thousands of migrants, greatly expanding the pool of those at risk of being arrested and deported.",
      "In recent weeks, ICE arrests have increased sharply, with the agency adopting more aggressive tactics, including efforts to arrest migrants and asylum-seekers attending their court hearings and check-in appointments.",
      "So far in June, ICE has averaged more than 1,300 arrests each day, a more than 100% increase from President Trump's first 100 days in office, when the agency recorded a 660 daily arrest rate, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News. On Saturday, ICE was holding more than 56,000 individuals in detention facilities throughout the country, a record high, the figures show.",
      "While ICE operations have expanded recently, the arrests recorded by the agency remain well below the 3,000 daily arrest rate pushed by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.",

      "A flagship \"No Kings\" march and rally are planned in Philadelphia, but no events are scheduled to take place in Washington, D.C., where the military parade will take place on Trump's 79th birthday. Organizers of the protests say they want to take attention away from the parade.",
      "The demonstrations come on the heels of protests flaring up around the country over federal immigration enforcement raids that began last week and Trump ordering National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles where protesters blocked a freeway and set cars on fire.",
      "Police in Los Angeles responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades while officials enforced curfews the city and Democratic governors called Trump's Guard deployment \"an alarming abuse of power\" that \"shows the Trump administration does not trust local law enforcement.\"",

No Kings Day merchandise has cropped up for sale on Amazon, Temu and other online retailers.",

    "summary": "The Dow dropped more than 750 points Friday as investors fret over the risk of a widening war in the Middle East.",
    "story": [
      "Stocks closed lower on Friday and oil prices climbed after a military strike by Israel on Iran stirred investor fears about the risk of war breaking out in the Middle East.",
      "The S&P 500 slid 68 points, or 1.1%, to end the day at 5,977, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 770 points, or 1.8%, to 42,198 points. The Nasdaq Composite shed 1.3%.",
      "The market slide comes after\u00a0Israel launched strikes\u00a0on Iran's nuclear sites and other targets early Friday, the start of what Israel said could be a days-long attack. Iran responded by launching over 100 drones, which Israel claimed it was able to mostly intercept.",
      "The strikes come as President Trump seeks to rein in Iran's nuclear capabilities. The U.S. and Iran are scheduled to meet Sunday in Oman, as part of a series on ongoing talks.",
      "\"The initial market response has been largely contained, but the risk of a broader military conflict certainly cannot be dismissed,\" said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. \"Iran has begun to retaliate and will continue to do so. This phase of the conflict will likely last several weeks at least.\"",
      "The oil market had an even stronger reaction on Friday, with U.S. benchmark crude oil increasing 7.3% to $72.98. Bent crude, the international standard, climbed 7% to $74.23 for a barrel. A deepening conflict could impact the flow of oil from Iran, a major producer of crude, according to analysts.",
      "One concern is that Iran closes the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic channel through which millions of barrels of oil flow each day. For now, that option may be off the table for now, according to Kristian Kerr, head of macro strategy at LPL Financial.",
      "\"We think this is unlikely for now given Iran's need to maintain oil sales to China,\" Kerr said in an email.",
      "Iranian crude exports are restricted by Western sanctions and import bans, with China the only recipient of the country's oil. Israel exports only small amounts of oil and and other energy products.",
      "The Middle East tensions also affect markets beyond oil, said Joy Yang, head of index product management at MarketVector Indexes, noting a decline in bitcoin prices and a rally in defense stocks, as airline stocks fall.",
      "Airlines, whose fuel costs depend on global oil prices and whose revenues depend on travel sentiment, experienced sharp losses. United Airlines lost 4.4%, Delta Air Lines gave up 3.8% and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings dropped 5%.",

      "Norris had overseen the case since federal indictments were issued in September 2023. He accepted guilty pleas from two of the officers and presided over the trial for the other three officers in October. Four of the five officers had been scheduled to be sentenced next week and the fifth on June 23.",
      "U.S. District Judge Sheryl H. Lipman was added to the case late Friday, court records showed. It was not immediately clear how the change in judges would affect the timing of the sentencings.",
      "Several motions had been filed under seal in recent days. It was not clear if any of those asked for Norris to step away from the case. It is unusual for a judge to recuse themself from a case between the trial and sentencing.",
      "The officers yanked Nichols from his car, then pepper-sprayed and hit the 29-year-old Black man with a Taser. Nichols fled, and when the five officers, who are also Black, caught up with him, they punched, kicked and hit him with a police baton. Nichols called out for his mother during the beating, which took place just steps from his home.",
      "Nichols died Jan. 10, 2023, three days later.",
      "Footage of the beating captured by a police pole camera also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled with his injuries \u2014 video that prompted intense scrutiny of police in Memphis.",
      "The beating also sparked nationwide protests and prompted renewed calls for police reform. The five officers \u2014 Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin, Desmond Mills Jr., and Justin Smith \u2014 were fired from the police force and indicted in state and federal court.",
      "Bean, Haley and Smith were found guilty in federal court in October of obstruction of justice through witness tampering related to an attempt to cover up the beating.",
      "The officers failed to say that they or their colleagues punched and kicked Nichols and broke Memphis Police Department rules when they did not include complete and accurate statements about what type of force they used.",
      "Bean and Smith were acquitted of more serious civil rights charges by the federal jury. Haley was found guilty of violating Nichols' civil rights by causing bodily injury and showing deliberate indifference to medical needs. He was also convicted of conspiracy to witness tamper.",
      "Bean and Smith were scheduled to be sentenced on Monday. Haley's sentencing was scheduled for Tuesday, and Martin was scheduled to be sentenced on Wednesday. Mills' sentencing was set for June 23.",
      "Martin Zummach, Smith's lawyer, referred questions on Norris' recusal to the district court and the U.S. Attorney's Office on Friday.",
      "Bean, Haley and Smith were acquitted in May of all state charges, including second-degree murder. The jury for the state trial was chosen in majority-white Hamilton County, which includes Chattanooga, after Judge James Jones Jr. ordered the case be heard from people outside of Shelby County, which includes the majority-Black Memphis. The officers' lawyers had argued that intense publicity made seating a fair jury difficult.",
      "Martin and Mills pleaded guilty in federal court last year to violating Nichols' civil rights by causing death and conspiracy to witness tamper. They did not stand trial in federal court with their former colleagues. Martin and Mills also avoided the trial in state court after reaching agreements to plead guilty there. Both Martin and Mills testified in the federal trial, and Mills also took the stand in the state trial.",
      "The officers were part of a crime suppression team called the Scorpion Unit that was disbanded weeks after Nichols died. The team targeted illegal drugs and guns, and violent offenders, and sometimes used force against unarmed people.",
      "In December, the U.S. Justice Department said a 17-month investigation showed the Memphis Police Department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people. The investigation also found that the Memphis Police Department conducts unlawful stops, searches, and arrests.",
      "In May, the Trump administration announced\u00a0it was retracting the findings of Justice Department civil rights investigations of police departments, including Memphis, that were issued under the Biden administration.",

    "story": [
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was wrongly deported and then returned to the United States to face federal prosecution, pleaded not guilty to charges that he\u00a0allegedly participated\u00a0in a yearslong conspiracy to traffic undocumented migrants into the country, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Abrego Garcia faces one count of conspiracy to transport aliens and one count of unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens after a grand jury in Tennessee returned a sealed indictment against him in May. He was arraigned Friday at the federal courthouse in Nashville.",
      "Those charges were made public last week when Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Abrego Garcia had been returned to the U.S. to be prosecuted. If he is convicted, Bondi said he would serve his sentence at a federal prison and be removed to El Salvador after his sentence is completed.",
      "Protesters gathered outside the federal courthouse in Nashville, carrying signs that called on the Trump administration to end immigration raids and provide due process. Abrego Garcia's wife and other family members attended the hearing.",
      "Federal prosecutors have asked a federal judge to detain Abrego Garcia as his court proceedings play out, arguing that he \"poses a danger to the community\" and is \"a serious flight risk.\" The Justice Department has claimed that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, an allegation that his attorney and family have denied, and said there is a \"serious risk\" that Abrego Garcia would intimidate witnesses.",
      "But Abrego Garcia's lawyers have accused the Trump administration of abusing its power and engaging in \"delay and secrecy\" in the process of returning him to the U.S. A judge in Maryland ordered him to be returned to the U.S. in April, but the Justice Department declined to do so for months, only to bring him back days ago so he can be prosecuted.",
      "The federal judge overseeing Abrego Garcia's case did not rule on his detention Friday after an hours-long hearing, but said she will issue a written decision \"soon.\"",
      "Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of his attorneys, said last week that he doesn't believe Abrego Garcia will be convicted.",
      "\"There's no way a jury is going to see the evidence and agree that this sheet metal worker is the leader of an international MS-13 smuggling conspiracy,\" he said.",
      "The indictment unsealed last week alleges that between 2016 and 2025, Abrego Garcia conspired with others to bring migrants from Latin American countries into the U.S., passing through Mexico before crossing the border into Texas.",
      "Prosecutors said that he and an unnamed co-conspirator would pick up the migrants in Houston and transport them to other places in the U.S. They claimed that Abrego Garcia and the co-conspirator devised \"cover stories\" to provide law enforcement if stopped, like that they were transporting people for construction work.",
      "Abrego Garcia and his co-conspirators \"knowingly and unlawfully transported thousands\" of migrants who are not legally in the U.S., the indictment alleges.",
      "Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March after he was arrested by federal immigration authorities in Maryland, where he has lived since arriving in the U.S. in 2011. After the man and his wife sued over his removal, an immigration official with the Trump administration acknowledged that his deportation to El Salvador was an administrative error.",
      "In 2019, an immigration judge granted Abrego Garcia a legal status known as withholding of removal. That protection forbade the Department of Homeland Security from removing him to his country of origin \u2014 El Salvador \u2014 because he was likely to face persecution from gangs.",
      "The Maryland judge ordered the Trump administration in April to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., and that order was largely affirmed by the Supreme Court. But the administration resisted bringing him back to the U.S., arguing that the judge lacked the authority to require it to do so.",
      "Abrego Garcia had initially been held at El Salvador's supermax prison, the Terrorism Confinement Center, also known as CECOT. But he was transferred to a lower-security facility in April, the State Department said.",
      "Bondi said the Salvadoran government agreed to release Abrego Garcia to face the criminal charges in the U.S. after it was presented with a warrant for his release.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys have also moved to keep the civil case seeking his return active, rebuking a Justice Department filing after his return to the U.S. last week that claimed the Maryland judge's order mandating his return had been fulfilled and the case is now moot. The Salvadoran man's lawyers called the Trump administration's handling of his case \"pure farce\" in a court filing Monday.",
      "\"Instead of facilitating Abrego Garcia's return, for the past two months defendants have engaged in an elaborate, all-of-government effort to defy court orders, deny due process, and disparage Abrego Garcia,\" the attorneys wrote, asking the Maryland judge overseeing the case to start contempt proceedings and impose sanctions on the government.",
      "In response, the Justice Department said that it has \"done exactly what plaintiffs asked for and what this court ordered them to do,\" in facilitating his return to the US, and said it would file a motion to dismiss the case next week.",
      "\"The proof is in the pudding \u2014 defendants have returned Abrego Garcia to the United States just as they were ordered to do. None of plaintiffs' hyperbolic arguments change that or justify further proceedings in this matter,\" Justice Department attorneys wrote.",

      "\"Measles can spread quickly in summer camps because campers and staff spend a lot of time together in close contact with each other. Measles is more than just a rash \u2014 it can cause serious complications or even death,\" the CDC warned in a \"checklist\" for operators of summer camps published this week.",
      "The agency's new guidance says that tracking measles immunity status is important to help health departments quickly identify people who need to be vaccinated or offered antibody injections in the case of an outbreak within a camp.",
      "\"Decide if you will allow unvaccinated campers and staff at your camp. Understand the risk if you do accept a camper or staff member who has not been immunized for measles,\" the American Camp Association says in its guidance for camps, which shared the CDC's checklist.",
      "Other steps that the CDC recommends summer camps take to prepare for measles spread this year include stocking up on face masks and preparing a potential isolation space to separate campers who are sickened.",
      "The CDC's new recommendations come as confirmed measles cases have climbed to 1,197 infections so far in 2025, less than 100 cases away from topping the record 1,274 cases that were confirmed for all of 2019. That marked a record since the U.S. in 2000 declared uncontrolled community spread of the virus\u00a0eliminated\u00a0through widespread measles vaccinations.",
      "At the time in 2019, health officials said the total number of cases added up to the worst tally on record since the 20th century.",
      "This year's wave is already deadlier than the 2019 wave of outbreaks, which health officials and experts suspect is due to missed infections that have gone unreported.",
      "In 2019, summer camps in New York tightened their vaccination requirements amid record outbreaks in the state among underimmunized communities. In response to the outbreaks, then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a law\u00a0that year removing religious exemptions from measles vaccination requirements for school and child day care programs.",
      "About two in three confirmed measles cases this year have been in children or teens, according to the CDC's tally. Most have been linked to local outbreaks within the U.S., many from the outbreak in Texas and neighboring states earlier this year.",
      "While new cases around Texas slowed in April, preliminary CDC data from recently reported measles cases \u2014 backdated to when patients' symptoms began \u2014 suggests the pace of new infections nationwide began accelerating again in May.",
      "The agency also recently stepped up its warning about the risk of catching measles while traveling. The new guidance followed dozens of cases of travelers infectious while flying on airplanes within the U.S., and a suspected case of spread during air travel, CBS News previously reported.",

Mr. Trump spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, a White House official said.",
      "\"There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,\" Mr. Trump said in one post to his social media site, Truth Social, \"Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire.

But it marks a blow to the Trump administration's push to remove Khalil, a green card holder who was detained by immigration agents in March and is currently being held in Louisiana.",
      "The ruling focuses on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that Khalil's \"presence or activities would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\" Farbiarz had previously said that seeking to deport Khalil for that reason is probably unconstitutional, but had stopped short of issuing an injunction until Wednesday.",
      "Farbiarz said, \"the Court finds as a matter of fact that [Khalil's] career and reputation are being damaged and his speech is being chilled \u2014 and this adds up to irreparable harm.\"",
      "Crucially, Farbiarz said his findings \"have no impact on efforts to remove [Khalil] for reasons other than the Secretary of State's determination.\" That means the administration could still try to deport Khalil for allegedly leaving out details on his green card application \u2014 another reason that government lawyers have given for his detention.",
      "But Farbiarz found that the government is almost certainly detaining Khalil right now because of the Rubio determination, and not due to issues with his green card application. He noted it's very rare for green card holders to be held in detention for omitting information on their paperwork.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the State Department and Justice Department for comment.",
      "The Trump administration is pushing to deport Khalil and several other international students with links to pro-Palestinian campus activism. The government has typically cited a law allowing the government to deport people if the secretary of state believes their presence in the U.S. poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\"",
      "Another Columbia student and green card holder involved in pro-Palestinian protests \u2014 Mohsen Mahdawi \u2014 was detained weeks after Khalil while attending what he was told was a citizenship interview, though a judge ordered Mahdawi's release. Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, whose lawyers say she was targeted for co-writing a campus newspaper op-ed, was also detained for several weeks until a judge ordered her release. Both students could still face deportation proceedings.",
      "The moves have drawn stiff pushback from critics, who argue the Trump administration is punishing students for First Amendment-protected speech. The judge in Mahdawi's case compared the government's conduct to the 1950s-era Red Scare and McCarthyism.",
      "But the administration argues it has the right to revoke visas and has accused some of the students of antisemitic or threatening behavior, which the students have denied.",
      "\"We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa,\" Rubio said in March.",

    "story": [
      "Ford CEO Jim Farley said that a rare earth minerals shortage is hurting production and caused the automaker to temporarily shut down one of its plants last month, according to an interview with Bloomberg TV.",
      "Rare earth minerals, which are a set of 17 metallic elements, are integral to automobile production, and enable features like windshield wipers, seat belts and speakers to function. About 90% of the U.S.'s rare earth minerals come from China, the world's largest producer of rare earths, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Geological Survey.",
      "China has leveraged its grip on rare earths and their widespread utility amid a trade war with the U.S. In April, Beijing announced greater export controls on the materials \u2014 a sticking point in tariff negotiations \u2014 along with other retaliatory trade measures. The controls require businesses to apply for a license to export rare earths, which U.S. automakers say they have been struggling to secure.",
      "Earlier this week, on June 11, following two days of discussions in London, U.S. and Chinese negotiators struck an agreement under which Beijing would resume regular exports of rare earths to the U.S.",
      "\"The centrality of rare earth export restrictions to the trade deal underscores the criticality of minerals to the U.S. economy as well as the severity of the chokehold Beijing holds on global supply chains,\" policy experts from the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote in a research note.",

      "Farley said the slowing flow of the critical minerals into the U.S. has presented a challenge for Ford.",

      "Ford Chief Financial Officer\u00a0Sherry House addressed disruptions caused by new restrictions on rare earth minerals from China at a June conference.",
      "\"There are many components that rare earth minerals are in. And any of those that are coming from China require you to now go through export control,\" she said. \"And so there's an additional layer of administrative process that has to happen.\"",
      "The process isn't reliable, she added, noting that sometimes it goes \"really smoothly,\" while other times applications are not approved quickly.",
      "\"Most frequently, it goes through; it just may take more time,\" she said.",
      "For now, Ford is able to manage the cumbersome process, House said, but added that it has the potential to become a \"larger issue for us.\"",
      "Farley also told the outlet that he is optimistic about the developments in trade talks between the U.S. and China, and hopes that rare earth supply constraints will ease soon. He added that Ford is awaiting approval of applications with China's Ministry of Commerce to export more rare earths.",

For the past several weeks, he has been moving northward, with his tracking device pinging multiple times off the coast of South Carolina and North Carolina. On June 11, his tracker pinged just 22 miles off the coast of Cape Hatteras.",
      "OCEARCH said in an Instagram post that Contender appears to be following standard great white migratory patterns and heading up north for the summer season, and is \"making moves along the Atlantic coast.\" The species spends the winter in warmer, southern waters, OCEARCH said. The sharks then head to \"cooler, more prey-dense waters\" near Canada for the next few months.",
      "The Outer Banks are a \"common rest stop\" for the species, OCEARCH said, likely because of rich food resources in the area. The spot also allows the sharks to prepare for the journey north, which may span more than 1,000 miles.",

U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News that U.S. forces helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles on Friday.",

      "\"The Iranians tend to negotiate very slowly. And be very slow to make concessions,\" Todman said. \"And so I think he's now viewing these military actions by Israel as a way of increasing pressure on Iran to make those concessions and ultimately come to a deal.\"",

      "Israel's main international airport said Saturday it will remain closed until further notice.",

Iran's semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported a fire at Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport. A video posted on X showed a column of smoke and flames rising from what the outlet said was the airport.",

In Ramat Gan, east of Tel Aviv, an AP journalist saw burned-out cars and at least three damaged houses, including one where the front was nearly entirely torn away.",
      "Residents of a central Israeli city that was hit Friday night told the AP the explosion was so powerful it shook their shelter door open. \"We thought, that's it, the house is gone, and in fact half of the house was gone, it fell apart,\" said Moshe Shani.",

      "Israel's ongoing airstrikes and Iran's retaliation raised concerns about all-out war between the countries and propelled the region, already on edge, into even greater upheaval. Israel's 20-month-long war with Gaza shows no signs of ending. At least 27 people were killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza overnight Friday, according to local hospitals.",
      "Strikes raise fears of all-out war",

      "Israel had long threatened such a strike, and successive American administrations sought to prevent it, fearing it would ignite a wider conflict across the Middle East and possibly be ineffective at destroying Iran's dispersed and hardened nuclear program.",
      "But a confluence of developments triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack \u2014 plus the reelection of Mr. Trump \u2014 created the conditions that allowed Israel to finally follow through on its threats. Netanyahu said the U.S. was informed in advance of the attack.",

It also appeared to strike a second, smaller nuclear enrichment facility in Fordo, about 60 miles southeast of Tehran, according to an Iranian news outlet close to the government that reported hearing explosions nearby.",
      "Israel said it also struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan, and said it destroyed dozens of radar installations and surface-to-air missile launchers in western Iran. Iran confirmed the strike at Isfahan.",
      "U.N. nuclear chief Rafael Grossi told the Security Council that the above-ground section of the Natanz facility was destroyed. The main centrifuge facility underground did not appear to have been hit, but the loss of power could have damaged the infrastructure there, he said.",
      "Netanyahu said the attack had been months in the making and was planned for April before being postponed.",
      "Israel's Mossad spy agency positioned explosive drones and precision weapons inside Iran ahead of time, and used them to target Iranian air defenses and missile launchers near Tehran, according to two security officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "It was not possible to independently corroborate those claims.",
      "Over the past year, Israel has been targeting Iran's air defenses, hitting a radar system for a Russian-made air defense battery in April 2024, and surface-to-air missile sites and missile manufacturing facilities in October.",
      "The first wave of strikes gave Israel \"significant freedom of movement\" in Iran's skies, clearing the way for further attacks, according to an Israeli military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss details of the attack with the media.",
      "The official said Israel is prepared for an operation that could last up to two weeks, but that there was no firm timeline.",
      "Among those killed were three of Iran's top military leaders: one who oversaw the entire armed forces, Gen. Mohammad Bagheri; one who led the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, Gen. Hossein Salami; and the head of the Guard's ballistic missile program, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh.",

      "Recovery teams working until late Friday found at least 25 more bodies in the debris, officials said.",
      "Dr. Dhaval Gameti at the Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad told The Associated Press the facility had received 270 bodies, adding that the\u00a0lone surviving passenger was still under observation for some of his wounds.",
      "\"He is doing very well and will be ready to be discharged anytime soon,\" Gameti said Saturday.",
      "That survivor, British national\u00a0Viswash Kumar Ramesh, spoke about the moment the plane \"came to a standstill\" in midair, and how he escaped from seat 11A and walked out of the wreckage with a burnt hand.",
      "\"Everything happened in front of my eyes. I don't believe (know) how I survived,\" Ramesh, 40, said from his hospital bed on Friday. \"For some time I thought I was also going to die. But when I opened my eyes, I realized I was alive. ... It was in front of my eyes that the air hostess and others (died).\"",
      "Hundreds of relatives of the crash victims have provided DNA samples at the hospital. Most bodies were charred or mutilated, making them unrecognizable.",
      "Some relatives expressed frustration Saturday that the process was taking too long. Authorities say it normally takes up to 72 hours to complete DNA matching and they are expediting the process.",
      "\"Where are my children? Did you recover them?\" asked Rafiq Abdullah, whose nephew, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren were on the flight. \"I will have to ask questions. Government is not answering these questions.\"",
      "Another relative persistently asked hospital staff when his relative's body would be handed over to the family for last rites.",
      "\"Give us the body,\" the relative insisted.",
      "Alongside the formal investigation, the Indian government says it has formed a high-level, multi-disciplinary committee to examine the causes leading to the crash.",
      "The committee will focus on formulating procedures to prevent and handle aircraft emergencies in the future and \"will not be a substitute to other enquiries being conducted by relevant organisations,\" the Ministry of Civil Aviation said in a statement.",

      "Warning sirens sounded across Israel on Friday as Iran fired dozens of ballistic missiles in a retaliatory attack after Israel launched overnight airstrikes. A second round of missiles targeted Israel a few hours later. Some made it through Israel's missile defense system, causing damage and injuries, though the full extent of the damage is not yet clear.",
      "A little after 4:30 a.m. Saturday local time, the Israel Defense Forces wrote on social media that \"Israelis are currently running for shelter in northern Israel as sirens sound due to another missile launch from Iran.\" It was not immediately clear if this marked a third round of missiles or was still part of the second wave.",
      "In the first round, about 100 missiles were fired from Iran in two salvos, officials said. Israel has a robust missile defense system known as the\u00a0Iron Dome, which intercepted most of the missiles, the IDF said. The IDF reported a limited number of hits on structures, some from interception failures.",
      "Video and photos show a number of buildings damaged or on fire. The IDF reported that 21 people had been injured and two were in serious condition.",
      "Dozens more missiles came in the next wave, and again the IDF said some, but not all, were intercepted. \"Search and Rescue forces are currently operating in a number of locations across the country in which reports of fallen projectiles were received,\" the military said.",
      "A U.S. official and a White House official confirmed to CBS News that the United States helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles.",
      "During the strikes, U.S. troops at two bases in the Middle East were ordered into bunkers. Troops at Union III in the Green Zone in Baghdad, Iraq, and Al-Tanf Garrison in Syria spent about an hour in the bunkers, CBS News confirmed.",
      "The retaliatory action from Iran came after Israel launched over 200 airstrikes on Iran, continuing a\u00a0major operation\u00a0that began overnight, IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said Friday. Israel's airstrikes are continuing, Defrin said.",
      "Iran's U.N. ambassador said Friday that 78 people were killed and more than 320 were injured in Israeli attacks.",
      "Israel first launched airstrikes on Iran early Friday and announced its operation was targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, scientists and senior military commanders.",
      "Tehran responded by launching more than 100 drones at Israel on Friday morning, Israel's military said. Defrin said earlier Friday that Israel's air defenses had worked to \"intercept the threats.\" Later Friday, an Israeli military official told reporters that while the threat wasn't over, Israel had managed to intercept many of Iran's UAVs.",
      "\"Throughout the day, we once again demonstrated our ability to remove threats in a coordinated, precise and daring manner,\" Defrin said Friday night local time.",
      "In a televised statement on Friday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the Iranian Armed Forces would respond fiercely to the strikes and leave Israel \"helpless.\"",
      "Shortly after the statement, the IDF confirmed that its fighter jets had \"completed a strike on the Iranian regime's nuclear site in the Isfahan area.\" Ishafan is in central Iran. The strike \"dismantled a facility for producing metallic uranium, infrastructure for reconverting enriched uranium, laboratories and additional infrastructure,\" the IDF said.",
      "U.S. not involved in Israel's strikes, Rubio says",
      "The U.S. was not involved in Israel's strikes, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, adding a warning that \"Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.\"",
      "The State Department informed multiple U.S.-allied governments in the region Thursday in advance of the Israeli strikes and intelligence operations in Iran, four sources told CBS News. Rubio personally reached out to a number of them, sources said.",
      "The main message conveyed by the Trump administration in those messages was that this was not a U.S. operation and did not involve U.S. assets, and that the U.S. preferred diplomacy to military force.",
      "President Trump said in a post Friday morning on his Truth Social platform that he had given Iran \"chance after chance\" to make a deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program, but that despite his warnings to Tehran that the alternative would be \"much worse\" than anything seen before, \"they just couldn't get it done.\"",
      "\"There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left.\"",
      "In a later post on Friday, Mr. Trump said he \"gave Iran a 60 day ultimatum to 'make a deal.' They should have done it! Today is day 61. I told them what to do, but they just couldn't get there. Now they have, perhaps, a second chance!\"",
      "Israel has intercepted virtually every Iranian weapon launched in previous large-scale attacks by the Islamic republic. The retaliatory action by Iran was long anticipated and well planned for, Defrin said.",
      "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Friday on Iranian TV that the country would \"strongly take action\" against Israel in response to the attacks, promising \"a severe, wise and strong answer.\"",
      "\"The Iranian nation and the country's officials will not remain silent in the face of this crime, and the legitimate and powerful response of the Islamic Republic of Iran will make the enemy regret its foolish act,\" he said.",
      "Israel says it destroyed Iran's air defenses, killed top commanders",
      "Earlier Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the IDF had begun \"Operation Rising Lion,\" with a massive wave of airstrikes against dozens of Iranian nuclear sites, military commanders and research scientists, saying the goal was to \"roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival.\"",
      "Like Netanyahu, Defrin, the IDF spokesman, called the attack on Iran preemptive in a video statement delivered Friday, saying Israeli intelligence had uncovered an Iranian \"plan to destroy Israel that has taken shape in recent years.\" He said that plan involved Iran \"racing towards a nuclear bomb,\" working to double or triple its ballistic missile stockpile, and continuing to \"finance, arm, and operate its proxies throughout the Middle East against the State of Israel.\"",
      "\"I can confirm that the senior security leadership of the Iranian regime has been eliminated in the strike: the Iranian Chief of Staff, [Mohammad] Bagheri; the Commander of the Revolutionary Guards, [Hossein] Salami; and the Head of the Emergency Command, [Gholamali] Rashid,\" Defrin said, adding that other commanders had been killed and that Israeli would provide further updates. He said Israel had \"targeted and struck the Iranian regime's aerial defense arrays.\"",
      "The IDF said its operation would continue for days, but that the first wave consisted of 200 Israeli fighter jets dropping \"over 330 different munitions,\" to hit more than 100 targets in Iran.",
      "\"The breadth and scale of these strikes \u2014 against senior Iranian officials and other military facilities in addition to nuclear sites \u2014 suggest this operation is intended to not just dissuade Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons, but also cripple any potential military response and even to destabilize the regime,\" Matthew Savill, director of Military Sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a British military think tank, said in a statement.",
      "\"Israel has once again demonstrated its considerable conventional military superiority, and the size of the force allegedly assembled for this series of attacks represents the overwhelming bulk of their longer-range strike aircraft. They have the ability to conduct multiple such rounds of strikes, but operating for an extended duration over this considerable range will stretch even the Israeli Air Force,\" Savill said.",
      "Savill said Iran's response \"might be delayed or split into multiple phases, but their main weapon will be ballistic missiles, which have the best chance of inflicting damage on Israel, whereas drone and cruise missile attacks will face more extensive Israeli defenses. Israel operations have therefore targeted air defenses and ballistic missile sites to forestall this.\"",
      "Savill said that if Iran \"believes the U.S. or others were involved\" in the Israeli strike, then their retaliation could include targeting the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, and American air facilities in Qatar, \"though both would widen the conflict to drag in others.\"",
      "NATO chief urges de-escalation, says nuclear clash \"not close\"",
      "Iranian state media said the Israeli strikes had hit several cities, including in the capital of Tehran and the city of Natanz, a key center for Iran's uranium enrichment program. The IDF said it struck Iran's uranium enrichment site in the Natanz area.",
      "\"The underground area of the site was damaged,\" the IDF said in a statement. \"This area contains a multi-story enrichment hall with centrifuges, electrical rooms, and additional supporting infrastructure. In addition, critical infrastructure enabling the site's continuous operation and the Iranian regime's ongoing efforts to obtain nuclear weapons were targeted.\"",
      "The United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, said in a series of social media posts that its director-general, Rafael Grossi, had been in contact with Iranian authorities on Friday, who told him the country's highly sensitive and highly secured Fordo nuclear site \"has not been impacted\" by the Israeli strikes. Later Friday, Reuters reported that two explosions had been heard near the site and that state media said Iranian air defenses had shot down an Israeli drone near the facility.",
      "The IAEA also said Iran's \"Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant had not been targeted and that no increase in radiation levels has been observed at the Natanz site.\"",
      "On Friday, during a visit to Sweden, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told reporters that \"this was a unilateral action by Israel. So I think it is crucial for many allies, including the United States, to work as we speak to de-escalate.\"",
      "Despite the ongoing attacks, Rutte said he believed the region was \"not close\" to a possible nuclear conflict.",
      "While there have been no claims that Iran has yet built a nuclear weapon, Israel is believed to have multiple warheads, though it has never formally confirmed nor denied its status as a nuclear-armed nation.",
      "Iranian officials quickly threatened retaliation to the attack, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying Israel \"should await a harsh response.\"",
      "The IDF said in a statement before Iran's retaliatory strikes that it had prepared for \"a campaign on the frontline and on the home front.\"",
      "Netanyahu said Israel's strikes against Iran, \"will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.\"",
      "Shortly after Israel's strikes, the U.S. Embassy in Israel ordered American personnel to shelter in place.",
      "A day beforehand, the Trump administration\u00a0ordered\u00a0non-emergency U.S. personnel to leave Iraq and allowed U.S. military family members to leave the Middle East voluntarily.",
      "Risk of an escalating regional conflict",
      "Israel has carried out strikes against Iranian proxies in recent years, while Iran has backed foes of Israel, including the militant group Hamas.",
      "In April of last year, Iran\u00a0launched missiles and drones\u00a0at Israel after a strike on Iran's consulate\u00a0in Damascus\u00a0was widely attributed to Israel, but the Israeli military intercepted the vast majority of the weapons.",
      "Six months later, Iran\u00a0launched more\u00a0missiles at Israel, which retaliated with strikes on Iranian sites.",
      "Friday's back-and-forth could escalate to be among the most severe clashes between Israel and Iran, which have been adversaries for decades. Mr. Trump warned earlier in the week that the strikes could snowball into a \"massive\" conflict.",
      "Farea Al-Muslimi, a research fellow at the Chatham House think tank, said in a statement Friday that the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen could play a role in the Iranian response to Israel.",
      "\"With Iran currently weakened and humiliated, this marks the first time the Houthis will be called upon to repay decades of Iranian investment and support,\" Al-Muslimi predicted. \"Following the killing of Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon and the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis have effectively become Iran's first line of defense against Israel \u2014 an increasingly central role.\"",
      "Al-Muslimi said the Houthi response could extend beyond retaliatory strikes on Israel itself.",
      "\"Strikes in the Red Sea will likely resume, the ceasefire with the United States may unravel, and we shouldn't be surprised if Saudi Arabia and the UAE are dragged back into direct conflict in Yemen,\" Al-Muslimi said. \"Attacks by the Houthis on U.S. military bases in the Gulf, the Horn of Africa, and naval forces at sea are also highly plausible.\"",
      "Fabian Hinz, an air warfare expert at London's International Institute of Strategic Studies, told the Associated Press that Iran's current capabilities are potentially \"more threatening to the U.S. military than to Israel.\"",
      "Iran has a \"huge arsenal\" of shorter-range missiles, Hinz said, and there are a number of U.S. military bases in the region. He said Iran also has \"lots of anti-ship capabilities.\"",
      "\"Think of the Iranian shipping threat as similar in quality to the Houthi threat, but much larger in quantity,\" Hinz told the AP.",
      "Israeli attack casts doubt on fate of U.S.-Iran nuclear talks",
      "The Israeli strikes and Iranian counterattack came amid efforts by President Trump to strike a new deal with Iran to limit the country's nuclear ambitions \u2014 an idea Israel has long been dubious of.",
      "The U.S. and Iran were set to hold talks Sunday, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News. There was no immediate comment from any high-ranking Iranian officials that those plans would change after Israel's attack, but some reports in Iranian media outlets indicated Iran would likely no longer participate in the negotiations.",

      "The attacks came one day after the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors censured Iran for the first time in 20 years for not working with its inspectors. Iran immediately announced it would establish a third enrichment site in the country and swap out some centrifuges for more advanced ones.",
      "The IAEA is the United Nations' Vienna-based nuclear watchdog. It said in a confidential report last month that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, and called on Tehran to urgently change course and comply with the agency's probe.",
      "President Trump on Friday urged Iran to \"make a deal, before there is nothing left\" and to agree to new restrictions on its nuclear program while it still can. The president has previously said Iran cannot be allowed to enrich uranium, a term Iran has not been willing to accept. Steve Witkoff, the president's Middle East envoy, was set to hold a sixth round of talks with Iran in the Gulf state of Oman on Sunday.",
      "Here's a look at some major Iranian sites and their importance in Tehran's program.",
      "Natanz enrichment facility",
      "Iran's nuclear facility at Natanz, located some 135 miles southeast of Tehran, is the country's main enrichment site.",
      "Part of the facility on Iran's Central Plateau is underground to defend against potential airstrikes. It operates multiple cascades, or groups of centrifuges working together to more quickly enrich uranium.",
      "Iran also is burrowing into the K\u016bh-e Kolang Gaz L\u0101, or Pickax Mountain, which is just beyond Natanz's southern fencing. Natanz has been targeted by the Stuxnet computer virus, believed to be an Israeli and American creation, which destroyed Iranian centrifuges. Two separate sabotage attacks, attributed to Israel, also have struck the facility.",
      "In\u00a0testimony Friday before the U.N.\u00a0about Israel's strikes, IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi said Iran confirmed that its Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant had been attacked. He said the above-ground portion of the plant where Iran was producing uranium enriched up to 60% had \"been destroyed\" and centrifuges may have been damaged. He said Iranian authorities also reported attacks on the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant and Esfahan site.",
      "Fordo enrichment facility",
      "Iran's nuclear facility at Fordo is located some 60 miles southwest of Tehran. It also hosts centrifuge cascades, but isn't as big a facility as Natanz.",
      "Buried under a mountain and protected by anti-aircraft batteries,\u00a0Fordo appears designed to withstand airstrikes.",
      "Its construction began at least in 2007, according to the IAEA, although Iran only informed the U.N. nuclear watchdog about the facility in 2009 after the U.S. and allied Western intelligence agencies became aware of its existence.",
      "Bushehr nuclear power plant",
      "Iran's only commercial nuclear power plant is in Bushehr\u00a0on the Persian Gulf, some 465 miles south of Tehran. Construction on the plant began under Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in the mid-1970s. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the plant was repeatedly targeted in the Iran-Iraq war. Russia later completed construction of the facility.",
      "Iran is building two other reactors like it at the site. Bushehr is fueled by uranium produced in Russia, not Iran, and is monitored by the IAEA.",
      "Arak heavy water reactor",
      "The Arak heavy water reactor\u00a0is 155 miles southwest of Tehran. Heavy water helps cool nuclear reactors, but it produces plutonium as a byproduct that can potentially be used in nuclear weapons. That would provide Iran another path to the bomb beyond enriched uranium, should it choose to pursue the weapon. Iran had agreed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to redesign the facility to relieve proliferation concerns.",
      "The U.S. withdrew from the international nuclear agreement known as the JCPOA, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in 2018, and Iran partially withdrew in 2019.",
      "Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center",
      "The facility in Isfahan, some 215 miles southeast of Tehran, employs thousands of nuclear scientists. It also is home to three Chinese research reactors and laboratories associated with the country's atomic program.",
      "Tehran Research Reactor",
      "The Tehran Research Reactor is at the headquarters of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, the civilian body overseeing the country's atomic program. The U.S. actually provided Iran the reactor in 1967 as part of America's \"Atoms for Peace\" program during the Cold War. It initially required highly enriched uranium but was later retrofitted to use low-enriched uranium over proliferation concerns.",

      "The American, who wasn't identified, was detained on a European arrest warrant issued in Italy, citing \"strong evidence\" of his suspected involvement in the death of the baby girl, chief Rome prosecutor Francesco Lo Voi told a news conference in Rome.",
      "Italian investigators said that the cause of the woman's death wasn't known, \"but there is a reasonable suspicion that it is a double murder,\" deputy prosecutor Giuseppe Cascini said.",
      "The bodies of the baby girl and mother, also believed to be American, were found in Rome's Villa Pamphili park on Saturday. The mother's body was under a black bag, having been killed several days before the infant, who was found several hundred meters away in undergrowth.",

      "The suspect, who witnesses had seen in the presence of a woman and infant, fled Italy for Skiathos on Wednesday, Lo Voi said.",

And that reason is so the public can do what the public does in all issues of importance, which is receive them, and if someone has something to add, that person can come forward and add whatever it is that person has to add.\"",
      "The prosecution argued the defense's suggestion regarding the use of real names was \"nothing more than a pretense to attempt to harass and intimidate\" Combs' ex-girlfriend, who testified this week under the pseudonym Jane.",

      "He told the court he felt bullied by another juror and refused to rejoin the discussions.",
      "The judge's declaration comes after Weinstein was convicted of one of the top charges but was acquitted of another. Both charges concerned accusations of forcing oral sex on women in 2006. Weinstein denied all charges.",

      "The final verdict comes after the jury delivered its partial verdict on June 11. (Michael Nagle/Pool Photo via AP)",
      "\"After eight years, dozens of accusers, and three trials, we are left with a single conviction \u2013 one we firmly believe will not stand, due to gross juror misconduct,\" Juda Engelmayer, a spokesperson for Weinstein, told Fox News Digital. \"Harvey is, of course, disappointed by the verdict, but he remains determined and resolute in his fight to clear his name.\"Jessica Mann, a hairstylist and actor, had accused Weinstein of a rape she allegedly endured in a Manhattan hotel room. Mann testified for days, as she did in 2020, about why she continued to see and have consensual encounters with Weinstein afterward.",

      "\"We take the wins where we get them - and the acquittal on the Sokola charge was a major one,\" Engelmayer, Weinstein's spokesperson, told Fox News Digital. \"A conviction there would have reset the sentencing clock entirely\u2026 This trial has raised substantial appellate issues\u2026\"",
      "Kaja Sokala, who testified Weinstein forcibly performed unwanted oral sex on her in 2006, told Fox News Digital the partial verdict was \"a painful reminder.\" Weinstein was acquitted on the charge stemming from Sokala's testimony.",

      "She continued, \"At the same time, this partial verdict is a painful reminder of how deeply ingrained victim-blaming still is in our justice system. The defense used ambush tactics designed to confuse and manipulate the jury, relying on outdated and dangerous myths about how survivors \"should\" behave. These tactics didn\u2019t erase the truth, but they distorted it just enough to deny full justice.\"",
      "\"A mistrial or not guilty verdict does not mean the harm didn\u2019t happen. It means the system is still failing to fully grasp the reality of trauma and the courage it takes to speak up. I am deeply grateful to the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office for their tireless work on this case, and for treating survivors with the respect and seriousness we deserve. Their commitment made this conviction possible,\" the statement concluded. \"I stand with Jessica, Miriam, and every survivor who testified with strength, clarity, and truth. This fight has never been about one verdict, it\u2019s about changing the culture that allowed this abuse to thrive. Today, we move forward. Tomorrow, we keep fighting.\"",

      "Before cross-examination continued Wednesday of Diddy's ex-girlfriend, who testified using the pseudonym \"Jane,\" the defense told Judge Arun Subramanian that they'd like to respond to the government's attempt to dismiss a Black juror from the case. The U.S. Attorney's Office allegedly told the court that while the situation was less than desirable, they were compelled to because of a lack of candor.",
      "The judge told the court he would rule on the issue if there was any basis for removing a juror and once the defense submitted a letter.",

      "\"Around this time, I just really wanted my partner to get sober,\" Jane testified. \"I just really cared so much about Sean's health, and I could see that he just, like, was excessively partying on top of just so many pills that he takes daily for I don't know what.

      "\"Your body doesn't understand that this is healthy weight loss \u2014 your body thinks it's starving,\" he reiterated. \"It happens to almost everyone, to some people more than others.\"",

      "Watt said she often recommends a hair vitamin to her clients struggling with weight loss. \"Diet also has a lot to do with it,\" she noted.",

      "\"Israel took the decision that, on one hand, it's time to end the leadership of the Axis of Evil \u2014 the head of the snake,\" Yadlin told Fox News Digital. \"At the same time, deal with the main problems there. Which is the nuclear.\"",
      "Yadlin didn\u2019t say how long he thought the conflict would drag on. While he didn\u2019t openly call for regime change, Yadlin suggested the IDF take out regime targets \"beyond the military level.\"",

      "\"I hope that the achievements of the IDF, which are degrading the Iranian air defense, degrading the Iranian missile, ballistic missile capabilities, drones capabilities, and maybe even some regime targets beyond the military level that Israel started with, will convince the Iranians that it is time to stop. And then they will come to negotiation with the Trump administration much weaker.\"",

      "\"The military operation is aimed, in my view, to a political end, and the political end is an agreement with Iran that will block a possibility to go to the border,\" Yadlin said.",

      "\"All of the intelligence that Israel collected, from the time I was chief of intelligence 2005 to 2010, enabled this operation against the Iranian nuclear program to be very efficient, very much like the good intelligence enabled Israel to destroy Hezbollah. Unfortunately, the same intelligence agencies missed the seventh of October, 2023.\"",

In contrast, Yadlin suggested the current campaign could last weeks and involve broader goals.",
      "\"It\u2019s not a one-day operation. It seems more like a week, two weeks. But when you start a war, even if you start it very successfully, you never know when it is finished.\"",

      "How to protect your home address",
      "The good news is that you can take steps to reduce the risks and keep your address private. However, keep in mind that data brokers and people search sites can re-list your information after some time, so you might need to request data removal periodically.",
      "I recommend a few ways to\u00a0delete your private information, including your home address, from such websites.",
      "1. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0Data brokers can sell your home address and other personal data to multiple businesses and individuals, so the key is to act fast. If you\u2019re looking for an easier way to protect your privacy, a data removal service can do the heavy lifting for you, automatically requesting data removal from brokers and tracking compliance.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "2. Opt out manually : Use a free scanner provided by a data removal service to check which people search sites that list your address. Then, visit each of these websites and look for an opt-out procedure or form: keywords like \"opt out,\" \"delete my information,\" etc., point the way.",
      "Follow each site\u2019s opt-out process carefully, and confirm they\u2019ve removed all your personal info, otherwise, it may get relisted.",
      "3. Monitor your digital footprint:\u00a0I recommend regularly searching online for your name to see if your location is publicly available. If only your social media profile pops up, there\u2019s no need to worry. However, people finder sites tend to relist your private information, including your home address, after some time.",
      "4. Limit sharing your address online:\u00a0Be careful about sharing your home address on social media, online forms and apps. Review privacy settings regularly, and only provide your address when absolutely necessary. Also, adjust your phone settings so that apps don\u2019t track your location.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Your home address is more vulnerable than you think. People finder sites aggregate data from public records and private sources to display your address online, often without your knowledge or consent. This can lead to serious privacy and safety risks. Taking proactive steps to protect your home address is essential. Do it manually or use a data removal tool for an easier process. By understanding how your location is collected and taking measures to remove your address from online sites, you can reclaim control over your personal data.",

The platform owners may have privacy policies and use the latest security measures, but that doesn't mean you should let your guard down. When using these tools, refrain from sharing any personal information, such as your name, address, birthdate, passwords, financial details or sensitive conversations.

      "Your email is often the key to your online identity and a common target for spam. By creating disposable email aliases that forward messages to your main inbox, you can keep your real address hidden from websites and services. These unique aliases act as shields, so if one starts getting spammed or is involved in a data breach, you can simply deactivate it without affecting your main email account.",
      "My top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is\u00a0to use an alias email address. An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.",
      "In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.",
      "Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail or having your information taken in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",

The malware turns home electronics into participants in a global network of cybercrime, often before the user even powers them on.",
      "In a statement, the FBI says BadBox 2.0 is commonly found on cheap Android-based devices manufactured in mainland China. These include uncertified tablets, connected TV boxes and other Internet of Things hardware. Many of the infected devices ship with the malware preinstalled.

The original botnet was briefly disrupted in Germany in 2024 when security researchers \"sinkholed\" the malware's command servers. That wiped out part of the operation, but not for long. Just a week later, the malware reappeared on nearly 200,000 devices, including more recognizable brands like Hisense smartphones and Yandex TVs.",

      "1. You bought a low-cost Android-based device from an unknown or no-name brand:\u00a0Devices sold online through third-party sellers or unknown brands, especially if advertised as \"unlocked,\" \"jailbroken\" or offering free streaming, are at higher risk. Models like the T95 box or other generic Android TV boxes are known carriers. Specifically, the following devices have been identified as impacted by BadBox malware:",

Avoid generic or off-brand Android boxes, tablets and projectors, especially if they are advertised as unlocked or include free streaming. Cheap, uncertified devices are more likely to come with malware preinstalled.",
      "3. Avoid sideloading apps from unofficial sources:\u00a0Do not install apps from third-party app stores or download APK files from unknown websites. These files can contain hidden malware. Use only official app stores like the Google Play Store that scan apps for threats.",
      "4. Check your device settings for tampering:\u00a0Look for signs like Google Play Protect being turned off, the presence of unfamiliar app stores or suspicious apps running in the background. These are possible signs your device is compromised.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Monitor your network for unusual activity:\u00a0If your internet slows down suddenly, or you notice unknown devices on your Wi-Fi, investigate. Use your router's settings or a network monitoring app to track strange behavior or unauthorized connections.",
      "6. Disconnect and replace suspicious hardware:\u00a0If a device is behaving oddly or was purchased from an untrusted source, unplug it from your network. Consider replacing it with a product from a reputable brand and a verified seller.",
      "7. Keep your devices and apps updated:\u00a0Install system and app updates regularly. Even though cheap devices may not always offer updates,\u00a0keeping your software current reduces your risk. Choose brands that are known for providing reliable security patches.",
      "8. Secure your router and home network:\u00a0Your devices are only as safe as the network they're connected to. Set a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi router and update its firmware regularly. Disable remote access unless absolutely necessary and use WPA3 encryption if available. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",

      "If you've ever wondered what's next for prosthetic technology, you're not alone. For many people living with limb loss, finding a prosthetic that feels natural and works seamlessly with their body has always been a challenge.",
      "Now, a California startup called Atom Bodies is making headlines for its groundbreaking approach to prosthetic technology.",

      "How the Atom Touch prosthetic arm uses AI and muscle signals",
      "Atom Bodies' flagship product, Atom Touch, is setting a new standard in prosthetic arms. Unlike traditional prosthetics, which often offer only basic movement and can be uncomfortable to wear, Atom Touch uses EMG (electromyography) sensors placed on the user's skin to detect muscle activity. These signals are then interpreted by machine-learning algorithms, allowing users to control individual fingers, the wrist and the elbow with remarkable precision just by thinking about the movement they want to make.",
      "AI ENABLES PARALYZED MAN TO CONTROL ROBOTIC ARM WITH BRAIN SIGNALS",
      "The arm is powered by the Atom A1, an AI neural interface that can be trained in minutes for intuitive, natural control. The design also includes a load-balanced harness, which distributes weight across the torso, making the device lighter and more comfortable for all-day use.",

      "Atom Touch stands out for several reasons. It is the first prosthetic arm to offer true individual finger movement, which means users can perform tasks like typing, gripping and delicate manipulation with much greater ease. The device uses the Atom A1 AI neural interface, which learns from the user's muscle signals to provide seamless, natural movement. Dozens of sensors in the hand generate haptic feedback, so users can better gauge grip strength and control. With more than 10 motors in the hand alone, Atom Touch offers a near-human range of motion and dexterity. The load-balanced harness system also makes the arm lighter than a human arm and comfortable enough for extended wear, addressing a challenge that many current prosthetics have yet to solve.",

      "For the more than 2 million Americans living with limb loss, current prosthetic options are often expensive, uncomfortable and limited in capability. Jason Morris, who lost his arm due to a work accident and is Atom Bodies' lead test user, notes that most prosthetics can only be worn for about two hours due to discomfort. Atom Touch is designed for initial wear of four to six hours, with the goal of achieving all-day use. Atom Bodies has already attracted significant interest, with over 11,000 people on its\u00a0wait list and plans to begin clinical trials within the next year, pending FDA approval.",

While state-of-the-art myoelectric arms can cost around $200,000, Atom Bodies plans to offer Atom Touch for approximately $25,000.

However, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s completely safe from every threat. As with any computer, there are still vulnerabilities that determined hackers can exploit.",
      "iPads are generally secure devices, but it\u2019s still possible for hackers to gain access, so knowing the warning signs of a hacked iPad can help you act quickly to protect your data.

      "If your iPad suddenly feels more like a sluggish turtle than the speedy device it used to be, that\u2019s a warning sign. When a device is hacked, malicious software might be running in the background, using up memory and processing power. This can make apps slow to open, cause lagging or freezing and even lead to more frequent crashes. You might also notice the battery draining much faster than usual along with the slowdown, since unwanted software can chew through battery life while it secretly runs in the background.",
      "A sudden flood of pop-up ads or strange messages on your iPad screen is a big red flag. Under normal circumstances, iPads should not bombard you with random pop-ups, especially outside of safe apps or websites. If you start seeing lots of unsolicited ads or \"Your iPad is hacked!\" alerts popping up, it could mean an adware program or scam has found its way onto the device. These pop-ups might try to trick you or your kids into clicking links or downloading something harmful, so they\u2019re not just annoying, they\u2019re dangerous signs that something is wrong.",

An unusual spike in data usage or constant network activity (even when no one is actively using the iPad) might indicate the device is secretly sending or receiving information without your permission. For example, if your data plan suddenly maxes out or you notice the Wi-Fi icon flickering with activity when the iPad is idle, it could be a sign that a hacker\u2019s software is communicating in the background. Such suspicious network activity is concerning because it suggests someone else might be remotely accessing the iPad or siphoning off personal data.",

      "1) Reset your passwords: Change your Apple ID password right away (and any other important account passwords used on the iPad) to lock out any intruders. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don\u2019t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Remove unfamiliar apps: Check the iPad for any apps you or your child didn\u2019t install. If you find an unknown app or a suspicious profile, delete it immediately. This helps eliminate any malicious programs the hacker may have added. To do this, open\u00a0Settings, tap\u00a0General\u00a0>\u00a0iPad Storage, scroll to find the unfamiliar app, tap\u00a0it, then tap\u00a0Delete App and confirm.",
      "3) Update iOS: Make sure the iPad is running the latest version of iPadOS. Apple frequently releases security updates to fix vulnerabilities, so\u00a0updating the software can shut down any loopholes the hacker might have used. Turning on automatic updates is a good idea to stay protected going forward.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication: If you haven\u2019t already,\u00a0turn on two-factor authentication for your Apple ID account. This feature adds an extra verification step (like a code sent to your phone) whenever someone tries to sign in, which can stop hackers in their tracks even if they somehow know your password. It\u2019s an excellent safeguard to prevent unauthorized access.",
      "5) Have strong antivirus protection on all devices: Malware, spyware and viruses can run quietly in the background or compromise enough data before it is discovered. While not being hacked in the first place is the best position to be in, it is worse to give access to your iPad\u2019s data to a hacker for a prolonged period of time. That\u2019s why having strong antivirus software running consistently in the background of your device is a great way to prevent compromises from happening in the first place.\u00a0Best antivirus security software and apps to protect you.",

For example, a new iOS update or a heavy app can temporarily slow down your iPad\u2019s performance, so one isolated issue doesn\u2019t always mean you\u2019ve been hacked. However, if you notice multiple warning signs at the same time or anything that just doesn\u2019t feel right, it\u2019s best to act quickly and err on the side of caution.",

      "Even with digital access making your SSN more convenient, it\u2019s still one of the most sensitive pieces of personal information you own. If your SSN falls into the wrong hands, it can lead to identity theft, credit fraud and even tax return scams. Here are the best ways to protect it:",
      "1) Use a strong password for your SSA account: Create a unique, complex password for your\u00a0\"My Social Security\"\u00a0account and enable\u00a0two-factor authentication. This ensures that even if someone guesses your password, they won\u2019t be able to log in without a second verification step. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Avoid public Wi-Fi when accessing your SSN: If you're checking your SSA account, avoid doing so over unsecured networks like\u00a0public Wi-Fi. Use a secure home network or\u00a0VPN to encrypt your connection and protect your session from hackers.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Be cautious of phishing scams and use strong antivirus software: Scammers often pose as the SSA to trick you into revealing your SSN. Don\u2019t click links in unsolicited emails or texts and never give personal information unless you\u2019re sure the source is legitimate. Always go directly to\u00a0ssa.gov if in doubt.",
      "To block suspicious links and attachments before they reach you, consider using\u00a0strong antivirus software. The right antivirus can help detect phishing attempts and protect you from malicious downloads.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Monitor your credit and bank accounts and use an identity theft service: Staying on top of your financial activity is one of the most effective ways to catch identity theft early. That\u2019s where identity protection services come in. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "A man looking over his Social Security information (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5) Check your credit reports: Make it a habit to review your credit reports regularly. Look for unfamiliar accounts, unauthorized inquiries or incorrect personal information. If something seems off, contact the credit bureau right away to dispute it.",
      "6) Request an IRS Identity Protection PIN: Prevent fraudulent tax filings using your SSN by setting up an\u00a0Identity Protection PIN with the IRS. This six-digit number adds another layer of protection during tax season.",
      "7) Review your Social Security earnings record: Log in to your\u00a0\"My Social Security\" account regularly to review your earnings history and benefits. This helps ensure your information hasn\u2019t been altered or compromised.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Starting this summer, the SSA will let you view your Social Security number online through your \"My Social Security\" account. It\u2019s a secure, convenient update that cuts down on lost cards and office visits. To use it safely, set up strong login credentials and two-factor authentication. And since your SSN remains a top target for identity thieves, now\u2019s the time to protect it with tools like a password manager, VPN, antivirus software and identity theft monitoring.",

      "Glide underwater with CudaJet and make the ocean your playground. Kurt Knutsson discusses the redesigned tech that might be your next big thrilling adventure.",
      "If you've ever dreamed of gliding underwater with the freedom of a dolphin, the CudaJet might be the gadget for you. Unlike most underwater propulsion systems that strap onto your arms or legs, the CudaJet is worn like a backpack, giving you a hands-free way to cruise beneath the surface. It's a fresh approach that feels a lot more natural and comfortable, especially for longer swims.",
      "The CudaJet's story started almost seven years ago. Back then, it was just a prototype called the Cuda, a passion project by British designer Archie O'Brien during his final year at Loughborough College of Art and Design, now known as Loughborough Design School. Archie wanted something lighter and faster than anything else out there, and in 2023 his vision became reality with the first commercial CudaJet.",
      "Now, the CudaJet has been redesigned with a longer battery life, lighter build and updated features, making it even more appealing to underwater adventure seekers.",

      "CudaJet underwater jetpack: How it works and what\u2019s new",
      "So, what's it like to use? The main unit is a dual-jet-drive pack that attaches to a padded neoprene harness, which you wear on your torso. You control everything with a hardwired, trigger-style remote that lets you adjust your speed and keep an eye on the battery level. One of the biggest improvements for 2025 is the battery. While the original model provided approximately 40 minutes of underwater fun for every 75-minute charge, the latest version extends that time to a full 90 minutes per charge. That's more than double the original runtime, so you can explore even more on a single outing.",
      "CudaJet can take you down to a maximum depth of 131 feet, and it delivers about 88 pounds of thrust. That translates to a top speed of roughly 10 feet per second, or about 6.7 mph. Now, that might not sound fast on land, but underwater it's a whole different story. The company likes to point out that at 10 feet per second, the drag force on your body is about the same as flying through air at nearly 200 mph. It's an exhilarating experience that feels powerful and smooth.",
      "The 2025 redesign also trimmed some weight from the original, reducing it from approximately 33 pounds to just over 30 pounds, including the harness. The harness itself comes in four sizes, so you can get a fit that feels just right. Safety is clearly a priority as well. Each CudaJet ships with a factory-set safety depth of about 10 feet, which you can adjust up to the full 131 feet if you're feeling adventurous. If you ever go past your set limit, the motor cuts out and floats you right back to the surface. The controller's full-color display keeps you updated on your speed, battery and depth at all times.",

Each jetpack is made to order, handcrafted and painted in the U.K. The\u00a02025 package starts at around $31,000, which is a jump from the original price, but it now includes a two-year warranty, a luxury hard case and a fast charger. For those who want something even more exclusive, there's a Founder's Edition with lifetime product access, in-water training with the founder and a lifetime warranty, but only 20 of those are being made.",

The process involves custom-fitting the harness to your size and selecting your preferred finish, all of which are handcrafted in the U.K. Due to this approach, there is typically a wait time before delivery, which varies depending on demand and the customization options.

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Online scams thrive on the urgency and fear of their victims. If you've ever been a victim of a scam, you\u2019d know that bad actors often try to rush you into taking action by creating a sense of fear. A scammer may call you impersonating a government agency and claim your Social Security number has been linked to drug trafficking.",
      "A phishing email might ask you to update your tax details or claim you\u2019ve won a lottery or a free product, all to get you to click a malicious link.",
      "A more effective tactic scammers use is sending fake login alerts. These are warnings that someone has logged into your account, prompting you to take immediate action. This method works well because legitimate services like Google, Apple, Netflix and Facebook also send these types of notifications when someone, including you, logs in from a new device. It can be tricky to tell the difference.",
      "As Robert from Danville asks, \"I constantly get in my spam junk folder emails saying 'someone has logged into your account.' Is this spam? legitimate? concerning? How do I know? How to avoid wasting time checking? How do I check?\"",

      "A person logging into a Gmail account on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How login alert scams work and why they\u2019re so effective",
      "Scammers often pose as login alerts from Google, Apple, Meta or even your bank, complete with official-looking logos, because fear is effective. But not every alert is a scam. In many cases, these notifications are legitimate and can help you detect unauthorized access to your accounts. Let\u2019s focus on the scam side first.",
      "Login alert scams have been around for a while. Early reports date back to 2021, and the trend has persisted since then. In 2022, reports surfaced that scammers were impersonating Meta and sending phishing emails to users.",
      "FBI WARNS OF SCAM TARGETING VICTIMS WITH FAKE HOSPITALS AND POLICE",
      "One such email used a clean layout with minimal text. It avoided the usual scare tactics and stuck to a simple message. But that is not always the case. A common red flag in phishing attempts is the tendency to overload the email with unnecessary details. These messages often include cluttered formatting, excessive explanations and an increasing number of typos or design errors. One phishing email simply gets to the point:",
      "Someone tried to Iog into Your Account, User lD",
      "A user just logged into your Facebook account from a new device Samsung S21. We are sending you this email to verify it\u2019s really you.",
      "Thanks,",
      "The Facebook Team",
      "What\u2019s concerning now is that poor grammar is no longer a reliable sign of a scam. Thanks to AI, even those with limited English skills can write emails that sound polished and professional. As a result, many phishing messages today read just like legitimate emails from trusted companies.",
      "Receiving a phishing email is not the real issue. The real problem starts when you click on it. Most of these emails contain links that lead to fake login pages, designed to look exactly like platforms such as Facebook, Google or your bank.",
      "If you enter your credentials there, they go directly to the scammer. In some cases, simply clicking the link can trigger a malware download, especially if your browser is outdated or your device lacks proper security. Once inside, attackers can steal personal information, monitor your activity or take control of your accounts.",

      "Real login notifications\u00a0do exist; they\u2019re just much less scary. A genuine alert from Google, Apple or Microsoft will come from an official address (for example, no-reply@accounts.google.com or security@apple.com) and use consistent branding. The tone is factual and helpful.",
      "For instance, a legit Google security alert might say, \"We detected a login from a new sign-in to your Google Account on a Pixel 6 Pro device. If this was you, you don't need to do anything. If not, we'll help you secure your account.\"\u00a0\u00a0It may include a \"Check activity\" button, but that link always redirects to a google.com address, and it won\u2019t prompt you to reenter your password via the email link. Similarly, Apple notes it will never ask for passwords or verification codes via email.",

      "What to do if you get a suspicious login alert email",
      "1. Don\u2019t click any links or attachments and use strong antivirus software: Instead, manually log in to the real site (or open the official app) by typing the URL or using a bookmarked link. This guarantees you\u2019re not walking into a scammer\u2019s trap. The FTC recommends this: if you have an account with that company, contact them via the website or phone number you know is real,\u00a0not the info in the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Remove your data from the internet: Scammers are able to send you targeted messages because your data, like your email address or phone number, is already out there. This often happens due to past data breaches and shady data brokers. A data removal service can help clean up your digital trail by removing your information from public databases and people-search sites. It\u2019s not a quick fix, but over time, it reduces how easily scammers can find and target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "3. Check your account activity:\u00a0Go to your account\u2019s security or sign-in page. Services like Gmail, iCloud or your bank let you review recent logins and devices. If you see nothing unusual, you\u2019re safe. If you do find a strange login, follow the site\u2019s process (usually changing your password and logging out all devices). Even if you don\u2019t find anything odd, change your password as a precaution. Do it through the official site or app, not the email. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): This is your best backup. With\u00a02FA enabled, even if someone has your password, they can\u2019t gain access without your phone and an additional second factor. Both Google and Apple make 2FA easy and say it \"makes it harder for scammers\" to hijack your account.",
      "5. Report suspicious emails: If you receive a suspicious email claiming to be from a specific organization, report it to that organization\u2019s official support or security team so they can take appropriate action.",
      "THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING WRONG WHEN SCAMMERS CALL",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "You shouldn\u2019t have to vet every sketchy email. In fact, your email\u2019s spam filters catch most phishing attempts for you. Keep them enabled, and make sure your software is up to date so that malicious sites and attachments are blocked. Still, the most powerful filter is your own awareness. You're definitely not alone in this. People receive these spammy login scares every day. By keeping a cool head and following the steps above, you're already ahead of the game.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "The stunning downward spiral of Michael Madigan\u2019s political career ended Friday with a 7 1/2-year prison sentence and a $2.5 million fine for the former Illinois House speaker and the longest-serving legislative leader in U.S. history after he was convicted of trading legislation for the enrichment of his friends and allies.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Robert Blakey sentenced the 83-year-old in U.S. District Court in Chicago.",
      "Nicknamed the \"Velvet Hammer\" for his quiet but hard-nosed style, Madigan was convicted in February on 10 of 23 counts in a remarkable corruption trial that lasted four months. The case churned through 60 witnesses and mountains of documents, photographs and taped conversations.",
      "EX-GOP CONGRESSMAN GEORGE SANTOS FACES UP TO 87 MONTHS IN PRISON IN FEDERAL FRAUD CASE",
      "Federal prosecutors sought a 12 1/2-year prison term. Madigan\u2019s attorneys wanted five years' probation, saying he is a good man who tried to do right by taxpayers and needs to be home to care for his ailing wife, Shirley, who submitted a videotaped statement to the court requesting her husband be able to come home.",
      "But Blakey noted that federal sentencing guidelines allowed for a term of 105 years based on findings in evidence \u2014 notably that Madigan committed perjury when he took the stand in his own defense. Blakey was particularly piqued over what he called \"a nauseating display of perjury and evasion.\"",
      "\"You lied. You did not have to. You had a right to sit there and exercise your right to silence,\" Blakey said. \"But you took the stand, and you took the law into your own hands.\"",

      "During a legislative career spanning half a century, Madigan served nearly four decades as speaker, the longest on record for a U.S. legislator. Combined with more than 20 years as chairperson of the Illinois Democratic Party, he set much of the state\u2019s political agenda while handpicking candidates for political office. More often than not, he also controlled political mapmaking, drawing lines to favor his party.",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutors said, the Chicago Democrat built a private legal career that allowed him to amass a net worth of $40 million.",
      "Madigan was convicted on 10 counts of bribery, conspiracy, wire fraud and other charges for ensuring approval of legislation favorable to utility giant ComEd in exchange for kickbacks and jobs and contracts for loyalists, including a Chicago alderman seeking a paid job on a state board after retiring from government.",

      "\"I\u2019m truly sorry for putting the people of the state of Illinois through this,\" Madigan said. \"I tried to do my best to serve the people of the state of Illinois. I am not perfect.\"",

      "During a three-and-a-half-hour hearing, Blakey noted the numerous letters sent to the court supporting Madigan. The judge said Madigan was a good family man and a kind man, helping his neighbors without pause.",
      "But he said, \"Being great is hard. Being honest is not. It's hard to commit crimes. It actually takes effort.\"",

      "Streicker noted that Madigan, having served as speaker through seven governors, \"had every opportunity to set the standard for honest government.\" Instead, she said, \"he fit right into the mold of yet another corrupt leader in Illinois.\"",
      "Defense lawyers had called the government\u2019s recommended sentence \"Draconian\" and, given Madigan\u2019s age, a life sentence.",
      "\"He did not seek to be greedy. He lived a very frugal life \u2026,\" Madigan attorney Dan Collins said. \"The rhetoric wants to make Mike responsible for the long history of corruption in Illinois. He is not, Judge. He is one man.\"",
      "They asked Blakey to consider the totality of Madigan\u2019s life and work and the need to care for his wife in requesting a sentence of five years\u2019 probation, with one year of home confinement, a requirement to perform community service and a \"reasonable fine.\"",

      "Tried alongside Madigan was his former legislative colleague and longtime confidant, Michael McClain. The jury couldn\u2019t reach a decision on any of the six counts against McClain. He was convicted, though, in a separate trial over the ComEd conspiracy last year."

    "summary": "Israeli strikes leave Iran's wounded government facing a number of questions, including whether it should give up on negotiations and rush its nuclear program.",
    "story": [
      "Israel\u2019s military strikes on Iran have struck at the heart of the country\u2019s military leadership and nuclear program, creating a possible vacuum at the top of the regime that could hinder its ability to recover from the onslaught, experts say.",
      "But \u2014 assuming that it still can \u2014 there is a scenario in which the strikes could lead Tehran to abandon negotiations over its nuclear program and instead rush toward building a bomb, according to analysts and former U.S. officials.",
      "The killing of top Iranian military officers as well as several nuclear scientists will likely have sparked fears in Tehran that Israeli intelligence had deeply penetrated the regime and that other senior figures could also be in danger.",
      "Israel has previously pulled off brazen assassinations inside Iran, targeting senior government scientists involved in the country\u2019s nuclear program and the political leader of the Iranian-backed Palestinian group Hamas when he was visiting Tehran.",
      "\u201cYou have to assume the system is shell-shocked,\u201d said Alex Vatanka of the Middle East Institute think tank. \u201cThey don\u2019t know\u2026 how badly they\u2019re infiltrated\u201d by Israel.",
      "Iranian media and the Israeli military said Israel\u2019s strikes on Thursday killed Iran\u2019s top military officer, Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, as well as the commander of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, Hossein Salami, and a major general in the Revolutionary Guards, Gholam Ali Rashid.",
      "The senior military officers targeted had deep ties to Iran\u2019s regime and were known personally by the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, particularly Bagheri, according to Vatanka. Khamenei promoted Bagheri to his post as chief of the armed forces in 2016.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a personal element here, which might be a factor in terms of what Khamenei decides to do,\u201d he said.",
      "Shahid Beheshti University said five professors were killed in Thursday\u2019s attack as well as \u201csome\u201d family members.",
      "Nuclear program\u2019s future",
      "The first wave of Israeli military strikes launched Thursday likely inflicted serious damage on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that air raids will continue for \u201cas many days as it takes\u201d to ensure Iran does not develop a nuclear arsenal.",
      "But Iran still has buried nuclear facilities at Fordow and elsewhere that it could potentially use if it chose to pull out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and rescind its commitment not to pursue nuclear weapons. In that case, Iran would need to enrich uranium to weapon-grade levels, a short technical step with its current stockpile, and then build a nuclear warhead. That effort could take roughly a year or more, most experts estimate.",
      "The CIA declined to comment as to whether there were any indications that Iran was moving to pull out of the NPT and pursue nuclear weapons.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump appears to be trying to use the Israeli military attack as leverage over Iran, pushing it to make concessions or else face even harsher military strikes. But Iran may calculate that the time for negotiations is over and opt to build nuclear weapons, according to Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group think tank.",
      "\u201cOne of the strategic risks in targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure is the potential for backlash,\u201d Vaez said. The strikes \u201ccould incentivize Tehran to reconstitute its program with renewed urgency, driven by a heightened resolve to achieve a credible nuclear deterrent,\u201d he said.",
      "Iran has invested decades of effort and trillions of dollars in building its nuclear program, and Iranian political leaders portray it as a point of national pride, a symbol of the country\u2019s independence and technological progress.",
      "Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank, said Iran\u2019s leadership will likely choose to develop nuclear weapons rather than give up the program it sees as a patriotic endeavor.",
      "\u201cIt has become a symbol of national prestige and honor,\u201d Miller said on MSNBC.",
      "\u201cWhen all is said and done, and this regime stays in power, which I suspect it will, the Iranians will probably make a decision to go all out in an effort to weaponize,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd the Americans and the Israelis are going to have to figure out, over time, how to deal with it.\u201c",
      "Jonathan Panikoff, a former deputy national intelligence officer for the Near East at the U.S. National Intelligence Council, said that Iran may conclude that pursuing nuclear weapons is the only way to safeguard the regime.",
      "Iran \u201cmay determine that the Israeli strikes mean time is up for the regime to decide whether to obtain a bomb, if it hasn\u2019t done so already,\u201d Panikoff, now at the Atlantic Council think tank, wrote in an analysis. \u201cThe conclusion could be that it can no longer sit on the proverbial nuclear fence, and that it has to rush for a bomb or risk never having one.\u201d",
      "To many Iranian political leaders, securing a nuclear weapon -- or nuclear weapons capability -- is vital for the survival of the regime itself, he added.",
      "But it was unclear if Israel\u2019s military strikes could deliver a knock-out blow that would make it impossible for Iran to build nuclear weapons, some experts said.",
      "Alex Plitsas, a former senior Pentagon official and a fellow at the Atlantic Council, said it was likely that the Israeli assault, which included sabotage operations, had caused too much damage to Iran\u2019s nuclear sites and equipment to enable Iran to rush toward building a bomb.",
      "Iran was caught flat-footed by the Israeli attack, even though Israel had sent clear warnings for years and in recent months that it would not tolerate an advancing Iranian nuclear program, Plitsas said.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians have misread the signals from Israel again and again,\u201d he said.",
      "Even a successful series of strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear sites might only delay Tehran\u2019s ability to develop the bomb by up to two years, according to past comments by U.S. officials and estimates by experts.",
      "In 2012, Robert Gates, shortly after he stepped down as defense secretary, said military strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear program would likely fail in the end to prevent Tehran from developing the bomb.",
      "\u201cSuch an attack would make a nuclear-armed Iran inevitable,\u201d Gates said at the time. \u201cThey would just bury the program deeper and make it more covert.\u201d",
      "Iran maintains its nuclear program is designed for purely civilian purposes to generate energy and research, but Western powers have long accused Tehran of laying the ground for a nuclear weapons project, citing enrichment activity far beyond what\u2019s required for peaceful uses. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Iran had a nuclear weapons program but halted the project in 2003.",
      "A report in May from the International Atomic Energy Agency concluded Iran was not fully cooperating with U.N. inspectors and that the agency could not provide assurance that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u201cexclusively peaceful.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, the IAEA censured Iran for failing to comply with nonproliferation obligations designed to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon. It was the first such censure in 20 years.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have criticized Trump for pulling, during his first term, the U.S. out of a 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran that imposed limits on its nuclear activities, saying that decision opened the way to the current crisis."

    "story": [
      "As the percussion of Israeli munitions rattled Tehran on Thursday night, President Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA movement observed a rare silence \u2014 a sign, influential Republicans say, of the divide within their own party when it comes to the prospect of a war between Israel and Iran.",
      "It took Trump, who comments publicly more often than any president in recent memory, about 10 hours to put out a statement on his Truth Social platform, in which he urged Iran to give up its nuclear weapons program.",
      "The first official U.S. assessment had been issued by the White House under Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s name, and it emphasized that America was \u201cnot involved\u201d in the strikes.",
      "But three U.S. officials told NBC News later Friday that the U.S. is assisting in shooting down Iranian missiles and projectiles targeting Israel. The Pentagon also moved a number of military assets into the region in recent days to support the operation, according to another U.S. official.",
      "In the meantime, Charlie Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA, polled his 5 million X followers on the question of whether America should \u201cget involved in Israel\u2019s war against Iran.\u201d By Friday afternoon, the poll showed more than 350,000 votes, with an overwhelming proportion in the \u201cNo\u201d column.",
      "When Kirk read Rubio\u2019s statement on the strikes during a podcast Thursday night, Jack Posobiec, a right-wing activist popular with the MAGA audience, interjected that it was \u201cnot a supportive statement at all.\u201d Earlier Thursday, before the strikes, Posobiec had warned on X that a \u201cdirect strike on Iran right now would disastrously split the Trump coalition.\u201d",
      "And Steve Bannon, host of the \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast, which is influential with MAGA adherents within the administration and outside of it, steered clear of public commentary Thursday night.",
      "It all adds up to a demonstration of the quandary facing Trump as he and other elected Republicans seek safe political turf.",
      "Trump\u2019s electoral success owes in no small part to his isolationist-leaning \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform and his fierce criticism of drawn-out U.S. engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan that were launched by Republican President George W. Bush and continued by Democratic President Barack Obama.",
      "But Israel\u2019s latest action pits traditional Republican support for the Jewish state \u2014 and antipathy toward Iran \u2014 against the MAGA base\u2019s fear that the U.S. will be drawn into a new foreign war. And even within Trump\u2019s MAGA wing, there\u2019s a long-running split over  American backing of Israel. Trump has always been on the pro-Israel side of the divide.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are a pro-Israel party, and the president hasn\u2019t wavered on that,\u201d said one longtime Trump adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity within the MAGA movement. \u201cI think the challenge here is not how to move forward. The question is how to sell that to the recalcitrant base.\u201d",
      "If Trump is able to do that, it will be despite powerful voices on the other side of the debate weighing in. Tucker Carlson, one of Trump's most influential supporters, wrote in his newsletter Friday that the U.S. should \"drop Israel.\"",
      "\"If Israel wants to wage this war, it has every right to do so. It is a sovereign country, and it can do as it pleases,\u201d Carlson wrote, according to Jewish Insider. \u201cBut not with America\u2019s backing.\u201d",
      "Israel launched its attack to forestall Iran\u2019s development of a nuclear weapon and perhaps pressure Tehran into giving up that goal. Trump has been trying to construct a new version of an Obama-era nuclear deal that he shredded during his first term, and he articulated his hope Friday that Israel\u2019s campaign will help serve as a catalyst for Iran to sign a new pact. But it is not at all clear that the fighting won\u2019t have the opposite effect and spark a broader war between the two Middle Eastern powers.",
      "That\u2019s a showdown that establishment Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have been itching for.",
      "\u201cGame on,\u201d Graham \u2014 whose hawkish worldview predates the rise of the MAGA movement \u2014 wrote on X on Thursday night as video of explosions in Tehran bounced around the world.",
      "On the other side of the spectrum, Infowars host Owen Shroyer, one of the hundreds of people pardoned by Trump in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, posted a video to X that framed the new conflict as an existential question for the president\u2019s base.",
      "\u201cAmerica, the Trump movement, MAGA \u2014 however you want to say it, there\u2019s going to be a lot of soul-searching as these events go on, because a lot of MAGA is anti-war,\u201d Shroyer said. \u201cWhat good is \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 if we can\u2019t even be isolated from this war-torn region of the world, if we can\u2019t even be isolated from these foreign countries and these foreign conflicts that are just filled with hate?\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll never be able to make America great again,\u201d he added, \u201cas long as we\u2019re entangled in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "With Trump signaling approval for how Israel conducted strikes while cajoling Iran to make a deal Friday morning, some of the president\u2019s MAGA faithful seemed to settle on a narrative that U.S. involvement is acceptable to a point: troops on the ground.",
      "On a call with reporters Friday, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., asserted his own opposition to U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts while expressing confidence that Trump feels the same.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to support our ally, which we\u2019re doing, and we should do, unequivocally,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to provide them with arms for their own self-defense, which we have done and should do. But I can\u2019t imagine a world in which we would send United States troops, in which we would be involved in any kinetic activity, as the defense people like to say, there in the region, unless it\u2019s just defending our own installations.\u201d",
      "Israeli airstrikes on Iran are a far cry from American troops invading a nation that has been far more vulnerable to internal revolution than foreign conquest over the course of thousands of years of existence. Even the Republicans who are most aggressive when it comes to Iran talk about missiles and bombs rather than staging an incursion with American ground forces.",
      "But drawing a line on that is a middle ground that may satisfy most, if not all, Trump supporters for the moment.",
      "In the hours after the strikes, Trump allies hewed closely to the administration\u2019s sparse talking points.",
      "Alex Bruesewitz, a Republican consultant with close ties to the White House, shared Rubio\u2019s statement on X, emphasizing that the \u201cUS WAS NOT INVOLVED IN STRIKES AGAINST IRAN.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Laura Loomer, the right-wing conspiracy theorist aligned with Trump, posted several messages supportive of Trump and Israel.",
      "\u201cIran,\u201d Loomer wrote, \u201cmust never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "Mehek Cooke, an attorney and pro-Trump political commentator active in the MAGA movement, said Friday that her recent visit to Israel opened her eyes to the \u201cdevastation of Iran\u2019s Oct. 7 proxy war\u201d there.",
      "Israel\u2019s strikes, Cooke added, \u201cwere not just justified; they were inevitable. This matters to every American, including the MAGA movement. You can\u2019t negotiate with regimes chanting \u2018Death to America.\u2019\u201d",
      "Cooke also pointed to recent polling from Rasmussen, a right-leaning firm, that found that 57% of respondents favored U.S. military action to combat Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program. She said she believes MAGA loyalists will \u201cremain united\u201d behind Trump.",
      "\u201cMAGA wants peace, but we\u2019re not blind,\u201d Cooke added. \u201cYes, some in MAGA lean isolationist. But appeasement is not an option. Iran\u2019s leaders just threatened both Israel and the U.S., bringing us to a dangerous tipping point. Trump\u2019s 60-day deadline \u2014 blatantly ignored by Iran was followed by real consequences.\u201d",
      "Still, the political perils of taking sides in the early stages of what Israel says could be a sustained campaign were underscored by the reluctance of some MAGA figures to deal with the question head-on.",
      "Asked to explain the tension within the MAGA movement, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., a close Trump ally, texted: \u201cMAGA is more concerned with the Battle for Los Angeles,\u201d where Trump has deployed the National Guard and Marines in a standoff with Americans protesting against immigration raids, \u201cthan the Battle for Tehran.\u201d",
      "What the White House appears to be most concerned about, at least in terms of Trump\u2019s domestic politics, is portraying the U.S. as uninvolved in the Middle East conflict.",
      "The word that trickled out overnight from the White House, and from a phone interview Trump gave to Fox News, emphasized that U.S. military had no role in the strikes.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until Friday morning that Trump weighed in directly \u2014 and ominously.",
      "\u201cThere has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cIran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. God Bless You All!\u201d"

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/israel-iran-conflict-splits-maga-leaving-trump-navigate-rcna212786",
    "published": "Fri, 13 Jun 2025 19:37:59 GMT",
    "summary": "Israel's latest action pits traditional Republican support for Israel \u2014 and antipathy toward Iran \u2014 against the MAGA base's fear that the U.S. will be drawn into a new foreign war.",
    "story": [
      "As the percussion of Israeli munitions rattled Tehran on Thursday night, President Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA movement observed a rare silence \u2014 a sign, influential Republicans say, of the divide within their own party when it comes to the prospect of a war between Israel and Iran.",
      "It took Trump, who comments publicly more often than any president in recent memory, about 10 hours to put out a statement on his Truth Social platform, in which he urged Iran to give up its nuclear weapons program.",
      "The first official U.S. assessment had been issued by the White House under Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s name, and it emphasized that America was \u201cnot involved\u201d in the strikes.",
      "But three U.S. officials told NBC News later Friday that the U.S. is assisting in shooting down Iranian missiles and projectiles targeting Israel. The Pentagon also moved a number of military assets into the region in recent days to support the operation, according to another U.S. official.",
      "In the meantime, Charlie Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA, polled his 5 million X followers on the question of whether America should \u201cget involved in Israel\u2019s war against Iran.\u201d By Friday afternoon, the poll showed more than 350,000 votes, with an overwhelming proportion in the \u201cNo\u201d column.",
      "When Kirk read Rubio\u2019s statement on the strikes during a podcast Thursday night, Jack Posobiec, a right-wing activist popular with the MAGA audience, interjected that it was \u201cnot a supportive statement at all.\u201d Earlier Thursday, before the strikes, Posobiec had warned on X that a \u201cdirect strike on Iran right now would disastrously split the Trump coalition.\u201d",
      "And Steve Bannon, host of the \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast, which is influential with MAGA adherents within the administration and outside of it, steered clear of public commentary Thursday night.",
      "It all adds up to a demonstration of the quandary facing Trump as he and other elected Republicans seek safe political turf.",
      "Trump\u2019s electoral success owes in no small part to his isolationist-leaning \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform and his fierce criticism of drawn-out U.S. engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan that were launched by Republican President George W. Bush and continued by Democratic President Barack Obama.",
      "But Israel\u2019s latest action pits traditional Republican support for the Jewish state \u2014 and antipathy toward Iran \u2014 against the MAGA base\u2019s fear that the U.S. will be drawn into a new foreign war. And even within Trump\u2019s MAGA wing, there\u2019s a long-running split over  American backing of Israel. Trump has always been on the pro-Israel side of the divide.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are a pro-Israel party, and the president hasn\u2019t wavered on that,\u201d said one longtime Trump adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity within the MAGA movement. \u201cI think the challenge here is not how to move forward. The question is how to sell that to the recalcitrant base.\u201d",
      "If Trump is able to do that, it will be despite powerful voices on the other side of the debate weighing in. Tucker Carlson, one of Trump's most influential supporters, wrote in his newsletter Friday that the U.S. should \"drop Israel.\"",
      "\"If Israel wants to wage this war, it has every right to do so. It is a sovereign country, and it can do as it pleases,\u201d Carlson wrote, according to Jewish Insider. \u201cBut not with America\u2019s backing.\u201d",
      "Israel launched its attack to forestall Iran\u2019s development of a nuclear weapon and perhaps pressure Tehran into giving up that goal. Trump has been trying to construct a new version of an Obama-era nuclear deal that he shredded during his first term, and he articulated his hope Friday that Israel\u2019s campaign will help serve as a catalyst for Iran to sign a new pact. But it is not at all clear that the fighting won\u2019t have the opposite effect and spark a broader war between the two Middle Eastern powers.",
      "That\u2019s a showdown that establishment Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have been itching for.",
      "\u201cGame on,\u201d Graham \u2014 whose hawkish worldview predates the rise of the MAGA movement \u2014 wrote on X on Thursday night as video of explosions in Tehran bounced around the world.",
      "On the other side of the spectrum, Infowars host Owen Shroyer, one of the hundreds of people pardoned by Trump in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, posted a video to X that framed the new conflict as an existential question for the president\u2019s base.",
      "\u201cAmerica, the Trump movement, MAGA \u2014 however you want to say it, there\u2019s going to be a lot of soul-searching as these events go on, because a lot of MAGA is anti-war,\u201d Shroyer said. \u201cWhat good is \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 if we can\u2019t even be isolated from this war-torn region of the world, if we can\u2019t even be isolated from these foreign countries and these foreign conflicts that are just filled with hate?\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll never be able to make America great again,\u201d he added, \u201cas long as we\u2019re entangled in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "With Trump signaling approval for how Israel conducted strikes while cajoling Iran to make a deal Friday morning, some of the president\u2019s MAGA faithful seemed to settle on a narrative that U.S. involvement is acceptable to a point: troops on the ground.",
      "On a call with reporters Friday, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., asserted his own opposition to U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts while expressing confidence that Trump feels the same.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to support our ally, which we\u2019re doing, and we should do, unequivocally,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to provide them with arms for their own self-defense, which we have done and should do. But I can\u2019t imagine a world in which we would send United States troops, in which we would be involved in any kinetic activity, as the defense people like to say, there in the region, unless it\u2019s just defending our own installations.\u201d",
      "Israeli airstrikes on Iran are a far cry from American troops invading a nation that has been far more vulnerable to internal revolution than foreign conquest over the course of thousands of years of existence. Even the Republicans who are most aggressive when it comes to Iran talk about missiles and bombs rather than staging an incursion with American ground forces.",
      "But drawing a line on that is a middle ground that may satisfy most, if not all, Trump supporters for the moment.",
      "In the hours after the strikes, Trump allies hewed closely to the administration\u2019s sparse talking points.",
      "Alex Bruesewitz, a Republican consultant with close ties to the White House, shared Rubio\u2019s statement on X, emphasizing that the \u201cUS WAS NOT INVOLVED IN STRIKES AGAINST IRAN.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Laura Loomer, the right-wing conspiracy theorist aligned with Trump, posted several messages supportive of Trump and Israel.",
      "\u201cIran,\u201d Loomer wrote, \u201cmust never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "Mehek Cooke, an attorney and pro-Trump political commentator active in the MAGA movement, said Friday that her recent visit to Israel opened her eyes to the \u201cdevastation of Iran\u2019s Oct. 7 proxy war\u201d there.",
      "Israel\u2019s strikes, Cooke added, \u201cwere not just justified; they were inevitable. This matters to every American, including the MAGA movement. You can\u2019t negotiate with regimes chanting \u2018Death to America.\u2019\u201d",
      "Cooke also pointed to recent polling from Rasmussen, a right-leaning firm, that found that 57% of respondents favored U.S. military action to combat Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program. She said she believes MAGA loyalists will \u201cremain united\u201d behind Trump.",
      "\u201cMAGA wants peace, but we\u2019re not blind,\u201d Cooke added. \u201cYes, some in MAGA lean isolationist. But appeasement is not an option. Iran\u2019s leaders just threatened both Israel and the U.S., bringing us to a dangerous tipping point. Trump\u2019s 60-day deadline \u2014 blatantly ignored by Iran was followed by real consequences.\u201d",
      "Still, the political perils of taking sides in the early stages of what Israel says could be a sustained campaign were underscored by the reluctance of some MAGA figures to deal with the question head-on.",
      "Asked to explain the tension within the MAGA movement, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., a close Trump ally, texted: \u201cMAGA is more concerned with the Battle for Los Angeles,\u201d where Trump has deployed the National Guard and Marines in a standoff with Americans protesting against immigration raids, \u201cthan the Battle for Tehran.\u201d",
      "What the White House appears to be most concerned about, at least in terms of Trump\u2019s domestic politics, is portraying the U.S. as uninvolved in the Middle East conflict.",
      "The word that trickled out overnight from the White House, and from a phone interview Trump gave to Fox News, emphasized that U.S. military had no role in the strikes.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until Friday morning that Trump weighed in directly \u2014 and ominously.",
      "\u201cThere has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cIran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. God Bless You All!\u201d"

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/waymo-cars-set-fire-sitting-ducks-la-protests-rcna212426",
    "published": "Sat, 14 Jun 2025 12:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Five vehicles owned by Google\u2019s self-driving spinoff Waymo were set ablaze last Sunday during protests against the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies.",
    "story": [
      "Engineers working on self-driving technology have given a lot of thought to difficult questions over the years, including how to keep pedestrians safe and how to avoid collisions with other vehicles.",
      "But last weekend\u2019s protests in Los Angeles threw a spotlight on one of the thorny problems that remain for autonomous vehicles: what to do about arson, vandalism or other physical attacks.",
      "Five vehicles owned by Google\u2019s self-driving spinoff Waymo were set ablaze last Sunday during protests against the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies. Images and video of the flaming cars quickly went viral, illustrating for a global audience how vulnerable robotaxis can be in volatile situations.",
      "For all their advanced technology, including expensive cameras and sensors, the cars seemed to be defenseless. Waymo says the five cars were in downtown Los Angeles to serve passengers when they were attacked. There were no drivers to plead for mercy, and with crowds surrounding the vehicles, there was no escape path that didn\u2019t include threatening pedestrians \u2014 something Waymo vehicles are programmed not to do.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re very much sitting ducks,\u201d said Jeff Fong, who has worked at tech companies including Lyft and Postmates and now writes a newsletter about cities and technology.",
      "And it wasn\u2019t the first time Waymo was a victim of arson. Last year, a Waymo in San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown was set on fire during Lunar New Year celebrations. Police later charged a juvenile with starting the blaze, saying they had thrown a lit firework into the vehicle.",
      "Waymos have been vandalized in other ways, too, including having their tires slashed, their windshields smashed, their doors torn off and their exteriors defaced with spray paint. Local prosecutors have charged individuals in at least some cases.",
      "Part of what makes robotaxis vulnerable is their caution. While it\u2019s impossible to know if a human driver behind the steering wheel could have deterred or escaped vandalism in any specific case involving a robotaxi, driverless vehicles are generally designed to stay put if there\u2019s any risk that they\u2019d hit a person while moving.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been so much effort into making sure they can\u2019t hurt human beings,\u201d Fong said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem Waymo has been solving for, rightfully so, but when you have the problem where a human wants to do harm, these cars have no countermeasures.\u201d",
      "Autonomous technology companies, including Waymo, appear to be largely at a loss for ideas on how to deter vandalism over the long term. Their cameras may be a partial deterrent \u2014 Waymo says each of its cars has 29 cameras \u2014 and the company has cooperated with police to help find vandalism suspects after the fact. But Waymo\u2019s collection of street data through its cameras and sensors is also one of the sources of anger against the company and other startups like it.",
      "Some Uber and Lyft drivers have said that vandalism incidents bolster the importance of human drivers as a deterrent.",
      "A spokesperson for Waymo said that in response to the protests in Los Angeles and elsewhere, it was temporarily adjusting its service area. Waymo declined to make anyone available for an interview about the problems of arson and vandalism and how the company plans to deal with such incidents in the long term.",
      "The vandalism problem is mostly limited for now to Waymo, which is the biggest self-driving car company. It has about 1,500 vehicles operating in four regions, with additional cities scheduled to come online this year. But the market is set to become more competitive soon, with Tesla saying it plans to launch a robotaxi service this month in Austin, Texas, and Amazon-backed Zoox planning a service in Las Vegas and San Francisco.",
      "Representatives for Tesla and Zoox did not respond to requests for comment about how they plan to avoid incidents like last Sunday\u2019s attack on Waymo vehicles.",
      "The problem has been gnawing at robotaxi fans on message boards on Reddit. In one thread in January, users tossed around ideas like having dedicated security on motorcycles nearby or equipping Waymo vehicles with pepper spray.",
      "Adam Millard-Ball, director of the UCLA Institute of Transportation Studies, said that robotaxis are a symbolic target for some street demonstrators.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re attacked not because they\u2019re autonomous cars but because they\u2019re a symbol of inequality in cities and a symbol of the power of large technology companies,\u201d he said. He noted that electric scooters are also sometimes targets.",
      "He also said it\u2019s hard to imagine what the companies, police or city officials could do to eliminate the threat entirely.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think any country in the world has eliminated vandalism in public spaces,\u201d he said.",
      "The incidents are problematic for Waymo on multiple levels: not only the cost of repairing or replacing the vehicles, but also the reputational risk when images and videos spread widely online.",
      "There\u2019s also the possible danger to passengers. And although no passengers were harmed in the arson incidents, some passengers have been delayed or reported feeling threatened when the cars they were riding in were vandalized from the outside. Last year, a San Francisco woman posted a video online after she said two men targeted her while riding in a Waymo.",
      "Then there\u2019s the lost business from what Waymo calls \u201ctemporary service adjustments.\u201d In Los Angeles and San Francisco this past week, Waymo stopped serving certain areas that are part of its normal service area. People using the company\u2019s app in recent days were greeted with a message, alluding to the street protests: \u201cPickup times and routing may be affected by local events. Thank you for your patience.\u201d",
      "In San Francisco, that meant Waymo refused to take customers through or to several neighborhoods, including parts of the Financial District, the Civic Center area near City Hall and the sprawling South of Market neighborhood.",
      "Waymo also limited service to the Mission District, a historically working-class and Latino neighborhood that\u2019s also home now to many tech workers and a vibrant nightlife scene. Thousands of people attended an anti-President Trump protest in the Mission on Monday night, and the effects on Waymo reverberated for days: A post on X with an example of rerouting around the Mission went viral Wednesday, getting 1.2 million views.",
      "Searches of the Waymo app by NBC News showed the service continuing to refuse service to parts of the Mission throughout the week, including during relatively quiet morning hours and on Friday. The app labeled certain destinations as \u201cunreachable.\u201d",
      "A Waymo spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re taking these heightened measures now out of an abundance of caution.\u201d They said the situation was temporary and subject to change quickly in response to conditions on the ground. Waymo hasn\u2019t published a map of which areas are restricted.",
      "Mass anti-Trump protests advocating for \u201cNo Kings\u201d are scheduled for Saturday nationwide, providing another potential disruption for robotaxis.",
      "Though the service restrictions may be temporary, they struck some people as discriminatory against poorer neighborhoods, with some social media users on X calling the practice \u201credlining\u201d on the part of Waymo. The term refers to the decadeslong practice of refusing home loans to predominantly Black neighborhoods.",
      "In contrast, ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft, which use human drivers, still offered rides to the Mission in recent days, according to NBC News searches of their apps. San Francisco\u2019s Municipal Transportation Agency rerouted some buses during the height of anti-Trump administration protests, but then resumed regular service.",
      "There have been no arrests for the attacks on Waymo vehicles in Los Angeles last Sunday. On Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said it was taking the lead in investigating the Waymo attacks, making them the subject of a federal investigation.",
      "\u201cThe cause of these fires is quite obvious,\u201d ATF special agent in charge Kenneth Cooper of the Los Angeles Field Division said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe task at hand now is to determine who is responsible. ATF\u2019s National Response Team is going to be a tremendous asset, and we look forward to the results of their efforts to hold the responsible parties accountable,\u201d he said."

    "summary": "Two women who took the stand using pseudonyms in the sex trafficking trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs were exposed when their presumed names were leaked online.",
    "story": [
      "In recent years, the defamation suit between actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard and the shooting of Megan Thee Stallion by fellow rapper Tory Lanez put a new spin on how celebrity trials are covered, as content creators and vloggers flooded social media feeds with the most explosive moments.",
      "The federal trial of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs is no exception.",
      "Each day, outside a towering courthouse in lower Manhattan, a horde of traditional media outlets, online streamers and curious spectators jostle to score a seat inside the main courtroom where Combs is facing sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges that could result in a lengthy prison sentence if convicted.",
      "Sign up for the \u201cDiddy on Trial\u201d newsletter for key developments and analysis",
      "When the proceedings pause for a lunch break or conclude for the day, it\u2019s the dozens of content creators who take center stage, scrambling to the sidewalks to set up their cellphone tripods and emote the latest testimony and courtroom drama for their eager followers.",
      "But with Combs\u2019 fate unfolding in a trial that is not being televised, the rush to relay every sordid detail and rack up views can pose challenges fraught with ethical issues as well. The real-life consequences came to light when two women who took the stand using pseudonyms were exposed when their presumed names were leaked online, highlighting how irresponsible behavior in this new wave of content creation can be harmful.",
      "Federal prosecutors said \u201cMia,\u201d a former assistant to Combs, had her identity revealed by a YouTube streamer who had been in the courtroom and her name was also posted on X, while another court watcher may have unmasked \u201cJane,\u201d an ex-girlfriend of Combs who testified over six days.",
      "Jane\u2019s personal lawyer told U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian last week that such \u201cposts and media outlets threaten her safety and privacy that led to the court\u2019s pseudonym order.\u201d Subramanian has said he would consider specific media gag orders or barring violators from court in a trial poised to continue through early July.",
      "Revealing the names of Combs\u2019 accusers wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact the trial itself, since jurors aren\u2019t supposed to consume media about the case or talk about it to others \u2014 but it still represents a line that must be tread carefully, said Mark Chutkow, a defense lawyer who handled racketeering cases as a federal prosecutor in Detroit.",
      "If names are leaked, he said, \u201cit could deter victims from coming forward in future high-profile cases because they won\u2019t believe the law enforcement assurances that their identities will be protected.\u201d",
      "To help protect the accusers\u2019 identities, the court sketches of them released publicly have not included their facial features, and traditional media coverage of their testimonies hasn\u2019t included physical descriptions.",
      "For the creator behind the YouTube account Make It Make Sense, which has more than 213,000 subscribers, shining a light on the accusers\u2019 experiences was an important reason to cover the trial, he said. He temporarily moved to New York to be in the courthouse each day.",
      "\u201cDo not try to guess who Jane is, please,\u201d he told his followers recently. \u201cIt\u2019s not a joke. She is supposed to remain anonymous.\u201d",
      "The creator behind Make It Make Sense told NBC News after court ended this week that \u201clegacy media\u201d may understand the repercussions of certain actions, but there is a different attitude among some content creators who are attending these high-profile trials for the first time and seeking to go viral.",
      "\u201cExposing people\u2019s names does not move the needle or change the story,\u201d said the channel\u2019s creator, who asked for his real name not to be used because of fears for his personal safety.",
      "One afternoon after Combs\u2019 trial let out, a woman who said she works as a court employee gushed as she watched popular online streamers \u2014 like the man behind Make It Make Sense \u2014 leaving the courthouse.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re how I get my information,\u201d she said.",

      "For some content creators, it\u2019s simply about fulfilling people\u2019s curiosity \u2014 and their own.",
      "Michelle Bracy of Manhattan said her TikTok account, miss_knockout, has grown from about 9,000 followers since Combs\u2019 trial began in mid-May to now more than 35,800. She said she goes live in the mornings before the trial starts, sits in court where she takes extensive notes on a legal pad, and then returns outside the courthouse at the day\u2019s end, sometimes broadcasting through the evening.",
      "\u201cI do follow the rules because, of course, it\u2019s TikTok, and you don\u2019t want to be removed,\u201d Bracy said, \u201cbut I also make my coverage more relatable to people. And I stay in the middle. I\u2019m not on this side, I\u2019m not on that side. I just get the facts on both sides.\u201d",
      "The 2022 courtroom dispute between Depp and Heard showcased a new frontier among online content creation. The trial, which was televised, attracted droves of livestreamers and spectators to outside a Fairfax, Virginia, courthouse where they could show their support for either side. Online as well, memes and hashtags, particularly ones manufactured to support Depp, popped up and gained billions of views on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram.",
      "Combs\u2019 case has not attracted that same groundswell, as the initial appearance of people in \u201cFree Diddy\u201d T-shirts early in the trial has subsided outside the courthouse. But on days when certain witnesses have taken the stand, including his ex-girlfriend, Casandra \u201cCassie\u201d Ventura, the rapper Kid Cudi and Jane, their presence reinvigorates interest.",
      "On Friday, the courthouse was buzzing with a surprise appearance by the rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, who tried to get inside the main courtroom to support Combs and was ushered instead to a court overflow room, where he stayed for several minutes. When he left, members of the media and vloggers ran for the elevators to follow him outside, sprinting across the promenade to catch him before a car could whisk him away.",
      "It\u2019s these viral moments and quick interactions with key figures in the trial that content creators like Bracy yearn for, she said.",
      "She had her own moment last month with one of Combs\u2019 defense lawyers that helped increase her followers.",

      "\u201cHey,\u201d Steel responded.",
      "The idea that other content creators would defy court orders in Combs\u2019 trial is disappointing, Bracy told NBC News.",
      "\u201cYou got to respect the court system and the judge,\u201d she said, \u201cand be bright enough not to repeat the names.\u201d",
      "Competition can be stiff among the creators. When court lets out, they jockey for position with television cameras as Combs\u2019 family, including his mother and children, are escorted by security to their car. The spectacle can draw a small crowd from interested passersby.",
      "Oota Ongo, a YouTube streamer from Brooklyn, gives street preacher energy as he talks to his more than 13,600 subscribers from outside the courthouse.",
      "He told NBC News that he started covering the trial, his first, to \u201csee everything for myself and put my biases aside.\u201d",
      "The most surprising thing about the trial, he added, has been knowing how much sway he can have.",

    "story": [
      "Israeli military assaults on the Gaza Strip\u2019s hospitals have ramped up in recent weeks to the highest level so far this year, bringing a health system already weakened by 19 months of war to a breaking point. NBC News has analyzed 27 videos and images from the last two months taken by civilians and our own journalists on the ground to piece together a picture of the full extent of the destruction of a health system engulfed in war.",
      "In footage from a surveillance camera, men, women and children could be seen crossing the entrance to Khan Younis\u2019 European Hospital moments before a missile hit, blasting people into the air as others scattered in panic. Another video, posted to social media and verified by NBC News, showed the fiery aftermath of an explosion at a medical warehouse near Al-Awda Hospital, in northern Gaza, which has been attacked repeatedly, including on May 22 and again on May 24.",
      "\u201cNearly all hospitals in Gaza are now damaged or destroyed, and half of them are no longer operational,\u201d Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, told NBC News. During the war, Gaza\u2019s hospitals have eked back services, only to be repeatedly struck or besieged again.",
      "Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law, but Israel has maintained that Hamas uses hospitals and medical centers for military activities, opening them to attack. Hamas has denied doing so. Humanitarian groups, including the United Nations, have said Israel has not provided sufficient information to substantiate many of its claims and have called for independent investigations of Israel\u2019s attacks and Hamas\u2019 alleged misuse of the facilities.",
      "Earlier this week, however, the Israeli military gave a small group of reporters a tour of a tunnel that was uncovered beneath the European Hospital, where it said it had recovered the body of Hamas\u2019 military chief Mohammed Sinwar.",
      "\u201cWe cannot stress this enough: Hospitals must never be militarized or targeted. If they are, it may constitute a war crime,\u201d Laerke said.",
      "Of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals, none are fully functioning; 17 are providing partial services, and 19 are not functioning at all, according to World Health Organization data from Monday. The wider health system, including ambulances, field hospitals and clinics, has been attacked more than 700 times since the start of the war, killing at least 900 people and injuring more than 1,000. (The death toll across Gaza is more than 55,000, according to the health ministry.)",
      "After a ceasefire was called in January, Israeli military attacks on Gaza\u2019s health system had abated. The truce fell apart in March, and WHO data shows a ramping up of attacks in recent weeks. While the organization tallied five attacks on Gaza\u2019s health system in April, after the first three weeks of May, the number of attacks had quadrupled to 21, with at least three more attacks since, including on the vicinity of a dialysis center at the Indonesian Hospital on June 1 and strikes on Al-Aqsa and Al-Ahli Hospitals on June 4 and 5. In addition, hostilities near Al-Amal Hospital have rendered it \u201cout of service,\u201d the WHO said Monday.",
      "The earliest attack recorded by NBC News during that two-month period was on April 2, when an Israeli airstrike hit a UNRWA clinic in Jabalia, north of Gaza City, that was housing displaced people. Video captured by NBC News on the ground documented the chaotic aftermath: walls crushed to rubble, charred mattresses, furniture blasted into shards. A child\u2019s small, shrouded body was loaded onto a donkey cart to be taken to the morgue.",
      "In another case, the Israel Defense Forces struck two hospitals on the same day, May 13, both in Khan Younis. Video verified by NBC News shows several large plumes of smoke rising from the grounds of the European Hospital. Palestinian health officials said at least 16 people were killed and dozens more injured. The WHO said the facility had been forced to suspend services.",
      "Also struck that day was the Nasser Medical Complex. Video posted by the U.N. showed scattered debris, twisted hospital beds and damaged equipment. It was the fourth time Nasser had been hit during the war, according to the U.N., with the latest strike killing two people and injuring a dozen others.",
      "In a statement in response to those attacks, the IDF said its forces had targeted a command and control center located at Nasser Hospital and \u201ca Hamas underground terrorist infrastructure site\u201d underneath the European Hospital.",
      "The IDF provided evidence of what it said was a Hamas tunnel beneath the European Hospital. It did not, however, provide evidence for the command and control center at Nasser, or for the following cases, but broadly said: \u201cThe Hamas terrorist organization continues to use hospitals in the Gaza Strip for terrorist activity.\u201d NBC News is not able to independently verify the IDF\u2019s statements."

    "published": "Sat, 14 Jun 2025 11:15:00 GMT",
    "summary": "A growing range of attractions are testing algorithmic pricing practices, similar to those used by airlines, as many struggle with attendance shortfalls.",
    "story": [
      "How much will it cost to visit a museum, zoo or aquarium this summer? The answer, increasingly, is: It depends.",
      "John Linehan can rattle off almost two dozen factors that Zoo New England\u2019s dynamic pricing contractor, Digonex, uses to recommend what to charge guests.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d said Linehan, president and CEO of the operator of two zoos in eastern Massachusetts.",
      "Before adopting dynamic pricing, the organization was changing prices seasonally and increasing entry rates little by little. \u201cAs we watched that pattern, we were afraid some families were going to get priced out,\u201d he said of the earlier approach. \u201cI\u2019m a father of four and I know what it is like.\u201d",
      "Now, Zoo New England\u2019s system provides cheaper rates for tickets purchased far in advance. That, coupled with the zoo\u2019s participation in the Mass Cultural Council\u2019s discounted admissions program for low-income and working families, \u201cputs some control back in the consumer\u2019s hands,\u201d Linehan said.",
      "We charge what we need to make ends meet while delivering on our mission.",
      "John Linehan, CEO of Zoo New England",
      "The zoo is one of many attractions embracing pricing systems that were earlier pioneered by airlines, ride-hailing apps and theme parks. While these practices allow operators to lower prices when demand is soft, they also enable the reverse, threatening to squeeze consumers who are increasingly trimming their summer travel budgets.",
      "Before the pandemic, less than 1% of attractions surveyed by Arival, a tourism market research and events firm, used variable or dynamic pricing. Today, 17% use variable pricing, in which entry fees are adjusted based on predictable factors such as the day of the week or the season, Arival said. And 6% use dynamic pricing, in which historical and real-time data on weather, staffing, demand patterns and more influence rates.",
      "The changes come as barely half of U.S. museums, zoos, science centers and similar institutions have fully recovered to their pre-Covid attendance levels, according to the American Alliance of Museums. That has led many to pursue novel ways of filling budget gaps and offsetting cost increases.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a saying: \u2018No margin, no mission,\u2019\u201d Linehan said, \u201cand we charge what we need to make ends meet while delivering on our mission.\u201d",
      "Entry costs are climbing even at attractions that aren\u2019t using price-setting technology. The broad \u201cadmissions\u201d category in the federal government\u2019s Consumer Price Index, which includes museum fees alongside sports and concert tickets, climbed 3.9% in May from the year before, well above the annual 2.4% inflation rate.",
      "In 2024, the nonprofit Monterey Bay Aquarium raised adult ticket prices from $59.95 to $65 and recently upped its individual membership rate, which includes year-round admission, from $95 to $125. \u201cGate admission from ticket sales funds the core operation of the aquarium,\u201d a spokesperson said.",
      "While the Denver Art Museum has no plans to test dynamic pricing, it raised admissions fees last fall, three years after a $175 million renovation and a survey of ticket prices elsewhere, a spokesperson said. Entry costs went from $18 to $22 for Colorado residents and from $22 to $27 for out-of-state visitors. Prices rise on weekends and during busy times, to $25 and $30 for in- and out-of-state visitors, respectively. Guests under age 19 always get in free thanks to a sponsored program.",
      "Some attractions are doing a daily analysis of their bookings over the next several days or weeks and making adjustments.",
      "Douglas Quinby, CEO of Arival",
      "Like many attractions, the art museum posts these prices on its website. But many attractions\u2019 publicly listed ticket prices are liable to fluctuate. The Seattle Aquarium \u2014 which raised its price ranges last summer by about $10 ahead of the opening of a new ocean pavilion \u2014 also uses Digonex\u2019s algorithmic recommendations.",
      "During the week of June 8, for example, the aquarium\u2019s online visit planner, which displays the relative ticket availability for each day, offered out-of-state adult admissions as low as $37.95 for dates later in the month and as much as $46.95 for walk-in tickets that week. In addition to booking in advance, there are more than half a dozen other discounts available to certain guests, including seniors and tribal and military members, a spokesperson noted.",
      "At many attractions, however, admission fees aren\u2019t even provided until a guest enters the specific day and time they want to visit \u2014 making it difficult to know that lower prices may be available at another time.",
      "\u201cSome attractions are doing a daily analysis of their bookings over the next several days or weeks and making adjustments\u201d to prices continuously, said Arival CEO Douglas Quinby. Prices might rise quietly on a day when slots are filling up and dip when tickets don\u2019t seem to be moving, he said.",
      "Digonex, which says it provides automated dynamic pricing services to more than 70 attractions worldwide, offers recommendations as frequently as daily. It\u2019s up to clients to decide how and whether to implement them, a spokesperson said. Each algorithm is tailored to organizations\u2019 goals and can account for everything from weather to capacity constraints and even Google Analytics search patterns.",
      "Data-driven pricing can be \u201ca financial win for both the public and the museum,\u201d said Elizabeth Merritt, vice president of strategic foresight at the American Alliance of Museums. It can reduce overcrowding, she said, while steering budget-minded guests toward dates that are both cheaper and less busy.",
      "But steeper prices during peak periods and for short-notice visits could rankle guests \u2014 who may see anything less than a top-notch experience as a rip-off, said Stephen Pratt, a professor at the University of Central Florida\u2019s Rosen College of Hospitality Management who studies tourism.",
      "\u201cBecause of the higher prices, you want an experience that\u2019s really great,\u201d he said, transforming a low-key day at the zoo into a big-ticket, high-stakes outing. \u201cYou\u2019ve invested this money into family time, into creating memories, and you don\u2019t want any service mishaps.\u201d",
      "That could raise the risk of blowback at many attractions, especially those grappling with Trump administration cuts this summer. Some historic sites and national parks have already warned that their operations are under pressure.",
      "Consumers should expect more price complexity to come. Arival said 16% of attractions ranked implementing dynamic pricing as a top priority for 2025-26. Among large attractions serving at least half a million guests annually, 37% are prioritizing dynamic pricing, up from the 12% that use it currently.",
      "For visitors, that could mean hunting harder for cheaper tickets. While many museums are free year-round, others provide lower rates for off-season visits and those booked in advance. It\u2019s also common to reduce or waive fees on certain days or hours, and many kids and seniors can often get discounted entry.",
      "Here are a few other ways to keep admissions costs low:",
      "Ways to save on museum tickets:",
      "Ask your local library. Many have museum passes that cardholders can check out.Bundling programs such as CityPass, GetOutPass, Go City and others allow visitors to save money on admissions to a range of attractions.Bank of America\u2019s Museums on Us program offers cardholders free entry to many institutions during the first full weekend of each month.For the past decade, Museums for All has been providing free or reduced entry at more 1,400 U.S. museums and attractions to anyone receiving SNAP food assistance benefits.And each summer, the Blue Star Museums program offers museum discounts to actively serving military personnel and their families.",

    "summary": "Posts using fake images and baseless claims have sought to connect protests to left-wing Latin American governments, similar to misinformation that has swirled around previous news events.",
    "story": [
      "A surge of false or misleading posts, photographs and videos about the Los Angeles protests have been circulating on social media, with many of those shared among Latinos \u2014 mostly in Spanish \u2014 tying the protesters to socialist or communist governments.",
      "One post on X with over 600,000 views claims that in the U.S., immigration protest groups have links to \u201cthe Venezuelan mafia,\u201d the Communist Party of Cuba, and the Morena Party, the left-wing ruling party of Mexico. But the post doesn\u2019t specify any groups and doesn\u2019t give evidence of this.",
      "The narrative echoes similar falsehoods that circulated during the 2020 George Floyd protests and the 2024 pro-Palestinian student protests on university campuses.",
      "Parts of Los Angeles and other cities across the country have seen protests against immigration raids as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration enforces a hard-line immigration policy. Dramatic scenes where cars, including Waymo taxis, were set on fire and protesters confronted law enforcement by throwing objects at them have filled social media feeds.",
      "While some far-left groups have encouraged and even glorified violence in the protests, the onslaught of posts, mostly in Spanish, appears to be an attempt to link protests against immigrant raids to leftist Latin American governments, and the posts show support for President Donald Trump and his policies.",
      "\u201cThough there is always inaccurate information swirling around, there has certainly been a spike since the Los Angeles protests took off,\u201d said Evelyn P\u00e9rez-Verd\u00eda, president of We Are M\u00e1s, which focuses on social impact consulting. \u201cIn the past we would find false or inaccurate information more hidden in platforms like Telegram, WhatsApp. Now it\u2019s more in the open and more easily found on social media and online publications.\u201d",
      "The falsehoods revive prior conspiracies that the protests are a planned provocation from leftist governments and not a spontaneous response to the immigration raids. On his platform, Truth Social, Trump has baselessly claimed protesters are \u201cPaid Insurrectionists!\u201d",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom have been targets of some of the misinformation that seeks to link them to communism.",
      "A fake picture of Bass with Cuba\u2019s late leader Fidel Castro, with his arm around her has circulated on social media. The original picture showed Castro with the late activist and former South African President Nelson Mandela.",
      "Bass does have some connections to Cuba; she traveled to the country with the Venceremos Brigade in the 1970s to do volunteer construction work and later went there as a member of Congress. She received criticism in 2020 for calling Castro\u2019s death \u201ca great loss,\u201d but the fake picture is a step further to link her directly with Fidel Castro.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in Spanish is different from what we\u2019re seeing in English,\u201d said P\u00e9rez-Verd\u00eda. In Spanish, she added, the false information is mainly focused on elected officials, like Newsom and Bass.",
      "\u201cThey talk about the extreme left, communism \u2014 actors, whether domestic or foreign, are changing the messaging based on the community they are targeting,\u201d said P\u00e9rez-Verd\u00eda.",
      "In some cases, false information has made its way to the federal government.",
      "Some conservative and pro-Russian social media accounts have circulated a video of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum from before the protests, claiming she encouraged them, according to Newsguard, a fact-checking website.",
      "The move was \u201cportrayed as foreign interference in domestic U.S. politics,\u201d Newsguard reported.",
      "During an oval office briefing Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Sheinbaum of encouraging \u201cviolent protests.\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum responded on X, saying it\u2019s \u201cabsolutely false\u201d and included a video of herself from the day before saying she does not agree with violent actions as a form of protest. She also accused the opposition party of falsely saying she incited the protests.",
      "In some cases, videos and photos that include a hammer and sickle, are taken out of context to make it seem the protests are a communist movement. One post with tens of thousands of views claims that the protests are \u201cURBAN COMMUNIST TERRORISM.\u201d",
      "One Spanish-language post from an account with over 1 million followers glorifies violence against \u201cprogressive anti-ICE protestors.\u201d",
      "Situations like these create fertile ground for disinformation to spread. Fake accounts in Spanish are more prevalent than they are in English, according to Darren Linvill, a professor at Clemson University and co-director of its Media Forensic Hub. Social media platforms are more likely to identify and shut down accounts in English than in other languages.",
      "Linvill said that another reason accounts in Spanish are more common than in English is that the use of marketing companies utilizing fake accounts \u2014 on behalf of political organizations or politicians \u2014 has spiked in the last few years.",
      "The spread of false information \u201cis absolutely having an effect on driving partisanship, conspiratorial thinking, distrust for expertise and the lack of a sort of shared reality,\u201d said Linvill. \u201cA shared reality is important for us to build compromise and govern nations together. And I think it is absolutely having an effect on that.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe degree to which motivated actors [bad actors], are responsible, versus the fundamental nature of social media to create a giant game of telephone that virtually generates the spread of false information, it\u2019s hard to say,\u201d Linvill said."

      "The shootings came on the same day as sweeping rallies planned nationwide, including in Minnesota, organized under the slogan \"No kings.\" A major parade is also being held in Washington, D.C., in honor of the Army's 250th birthday, coinciding with Trump's birthday.",
      "The \"no kings\" event in northeast Minnesota was canceled, and Minnesota state police asked people to stay away from public demonstrations while a suspect is on the loose.",
      "\"Given the targeted shootings of state lawmakers overnight, we are asking the public to not attend today's planned demonstrations across Minnesota out of an abundance of caution,\" state police said."

    "story": [
      "Israeli military assaults on the Gaza Strip\u2019s hospitals have ramped up in recent weeks to the highest level so far this year, bringing a health system already weakened by 19 months of war to a breaking point. NBC News has analyzed 27 videos and images from the last two months taken by civilians and our own journalists on the ground to piece together a picture of the full extent of the destruction of a health system engulfed in war.",
      "In footage from a surveillance camera, men, women and children could be seen crossing the entrance to Khan Younis\u2019 European Hospital moments before a missile hit, blasting people into the air as others scattered in panic. Another video, posted to social media and verified by NBC News, showed the fiery aftermath of an explosion at a medical warehouse near Al-Awda Hospital, in northern Gaza, which has been attacked repeatedly, including on May 22 and again on May 24.",
      "\u201cNearly all hospitals in Gaza are now damaged or destroyed, and half of them are no longer operational,\u201d Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, told NBC News. During the war, Gaza\u2019s hospitals have eked back services, only to be repeatedly struck or besieged again.",
      "Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law, but Israel has maintained that Hamas uses hospitals and medical centers for military activities, opening them to attack. Hamas has denied doing so. Humanitarian groups, including the United Nations, have said Israel has not provided sufficient information to substantiate many of its claims and have called for independent investigations of Israel\u2019s attacks and Hamas\u2019 alleged misuse of the facilities.",
      "Earlier this week, however, the Israeli military gave a small group of reporters a tour of a tunnel that was uncovered beneath the European Hospital, where it said it had recovered the body of Hamas\u2019 military chief Mohammed Sinwar.",
      "\u201cWe cannot stress this enough: Hospitals must never be militarized or targeted. If they are, it may constitute a war crime,\u201d Laerke said.",
      "Of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals, none are fully functioning; 17 are providing partial services, and 19 are not functioning at all, according to World Health Organization data from Monday. The wider health system, including ambulances, field hospitals and clinics, has been attacked more than 700 times since the start of the war, killing at least 900 people and injuring more than 1,000. (The death toll across Gaza is more than 55,000, according to the health ministry.)",
      "After a ceasefire was called in January, Israeli military attacks on Gaza\u2019s health system had abated. The truce fell apart in March, and WHO data shows a ramping up of attacks in recent weeks. While the organization tallied five attacks on Gaza\u2019s health system in April, after the first three weeks of May, the number of attacks had quadrupled to 21, with at least three more attacks since, including on the vicinity of a dialysis center at the Indonesian Hospital on June 1 and strikes on Al-Aqsa and Al-Ahli Hospitals on June 4 and 5. In addition, hostilities near Al-Amal Hospital have rendered it \u201cout of service,\u201d the WHO said Monday.",
      "The earliest attack recorded by NBC News during that two-month period was on April 2, when an Israeli airstrike hit a UNRWA clinic in Jabalia, north of Gaza City, that was housing displaced people. Video captured by NBC News on the ground documented the chaotic aftermath: walls crushed to rubble, charred mattresses, furniture blasted into shards. A child\u2019s small, shrouded body was loaded onto a donkey cart to be taken to the morgue.",
      "In another case, the Israel Defense Forces struck two hospitals on the same day, May 13, both in Khan Younis. Video verified by NBC News shows several large plumes of smoke rising from the grounds of the European Hospital. Palestinian health officials said at least 16 people were killed and dozens more injured. The WHO said the facility had been forced to suspend services.",
      "Also struck that day was the Nasser Medical Complex. Video posted by the U.N. showed scattered debris, twisted hospital beds and damaged equipment. It was the fourth time Nasser had been hit during the war, according to the U.N., with the latest strike killing two people and injuring a dozen others.",
      "In a statement in response to those attacks, the IDF said its forces had targeted a command and control center located at Nasser Hospital and \u201ca Hamas underground terrorist infrastructure site\u201d underneath the European Hospital.",
      "The IDF provided evidence of what it said was a Hamas tunnel beneath the European Hospital. It did not, however, provide evidence for the command and control center at Nasser, or for the following cases, but broadly said: \u201cThe Hamas terrorist organization continues to use hospitals in the Gaza Strip for terrorist activity.\u201d NBC News is not able to independently verify the IDF\u2019s statements."

      "The GHF began distributing food packages in Gaza at the end of May, overseeing a new model of aid distribution which the United Nations says is neither impartial nor neutral.",
      "The Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Saturday at least 274 people have so far been killed, and more than 2,000 wounded, near aid distribution sites since the GHF began operations in Gaza.",
      "Later on Saturday, the Israeli military ordered residents of Khan Younis and the nearby towns of Abassan and Bani Suhaila in the southern Gaza Strip to leave their homes and head west towards the so-called humanitarian zone area, saying it would forcefully work against \u201cterror organizations\u201d in the area.",
      "The war in Gaza erupted 20 months ago after Hamas-led militants raided Israel and took 251 hostages and killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, on October 7, 2023, Israel\u2019s single deadliest day.",
      "Israel\u2019s military campaign since has killed more than 55,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to health authorities in Gaza, and flattened much of the densely populated strip, which is home to more than two million people. Most of the population is displaced, and malnutrition is widespread.",
      "Despite efforts by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar to restore a ceasefire in Gaza, neither Israel nor Hamas has shown willingness to back down on core demands, with each side blaming the other for the failure to reach a deal."

      "\u201cHe is doing very well and will be ready to be discharged anytime soon,\u201d Gameti said Saturday.",
      "Hundreds of relatives of the crash victims have provided DNA samples at the hospital. Most bodies were charred or mutilated, making them unrecognizable.",
      "Some relatives expressed frustration Saturday that the process was taking too long. Authorities say it normally takes up to 72 hours to complete DNA matching and they are expediting the process.",
      "\u201cWhere are my children? Did you recover them?\u201d asked Rafiq Abdullah, whose nephew, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren were on the flight. \u201cI will have to ask questions. Government is not answering these questions.\u201d",

    "published": "Sat, 14 Jun 2025 12:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Five vehicles owned by Google\u2019s self-driving spinoff Waymo were set ablaze last Sunday during protests against the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies.",
    "story": [
      "Engineers working on self-driving technology have given a lot of thought to difficult questions over the years, including how to keep pedestrians safe and how to avoid collisions with other vehicles.",
      "But last weekend\u2019s protests in Los Angeles threw a spotlight on one of the thorny problems that remain for autonomous vehicles: what to do about arson, vandalism or other physical attacks.",
      "Five vehicles owned by Google\u2019s self-driving spinoff Waymo were set ablaze last Sunday during protests against the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies. Images and video of the flaming cars quickly went viral, illustrating for a global audience how vulnerable robotaxis can be in volatile situations.",
      "For all their advanced technology, including expensive cameras and sensors, the cars seemed to be defenseless. Waymo says the five cars were in downtown Los Angeles to serve passengers when they were attacked. There were no drivers to plead for mercy, and with crowds surrounding the vehicles, there was no escape path that didn\u2019t include threatening pedestrians \u2014 something Waymo vehicles are programmed not to do.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re very much sitting ducks,\u201d said Jeff Fong, who has worked at tech companies including Lyft and Postmates and now writes a newsletter about cities and technology.",
      "And it wasn\u2019t the first time Waymo was a victim of arson. Last year, a Waymo in San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown was set on fire during Lunar New Year celebrations. Police later charged a juvenile with starting the blaze, saying they had thrown a lit firework into the vehicle.",
      "Waymos have been vandalized in other ways, too, including having their tires slashed, their windshields smashed, their doors torn off and their exteriors defaced with spray paint. Local prosecutors have charged individuals in at least some cases.",
      "Part of what makes robotaxis vulnerable is their caution. While it\u2019s impossible to know if a human driver behind the steering wheel could have deterred or escaped vandalism in any specific case involving a robotaxi, driverless vehicles are generally designed to stay put if there\u2019s any risk that they\u2019d hit a person while moving.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been so much effort into making sure they can\u2019t hurt human beings,\u201d Fong said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem Waymo has been solving for, rightfully so, but when you have the problem where a human wants to do harm, these cars have no countermeasures.\u201d",
      "Autonomous technology companies, including Waymo, appear to be largely at a loss for ideas on how to deter vandalism over the long term. Their cameras may be a partial deterrent \u2014 Waymo says each of its cars has 29 cameras \u2014 and the company has cooperated with police to help find vandalism suspects after the fact. But Waymo\u2019s collection of street data through its cameras and sensors is also one of the sources of anger against the company and other startups like it.",
      "Some Uber and Lyft drivers have said that vandalism incidents bolster the importance of human drivers as a deterrent.",
      "A spokesperson for Waymo said that in response to the protests in Los Angeles and elsewhere, it was temporarily adjusting its service area. Waymo declined to make anyone available for an interview about the problems of arson and vandalism and how the company plans to deal with such incidents in the long term.",
      "The vandalism problem is mostly limited for now to Waymo, which is the biggest self-driving car company. It has about 1,500 vehicles operating in four regions, with additional cities scheduled to come online this year. But the market is set to become more competitive soon, with Tesla saying it plans to launch a robotaxi service this month in Austin, Texas, and Amazon-backed Zoox planning a service in Las Vegas and San Francisco.",
      "Representatives for Tesla and Zoox did not respond to requests for comment about how they plan to avoid incidents like last Sunday\u2019s attack on Waymo vehicles.",
      "The problem has been gnawing at robotaxi fans on message boards on Reddit. In one thread in January, users tossed around ideas like having dedicated security on motorcycles nearby or equipping Waymo vehicles with pepper spray.",
      "Adam Millard-Ball, director of the UCLA Institute of Transportation Studies, said that robotaxis are a symbolic target for some street demonstrators.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re attacked not because they\u2019re autonomous cars but because they\u2019re a symbol of inequality in cities and a symbol of the power of large technology companies,\u201d he said. He noted that electric scooters are also sometimes targets.",
      "He also said it\u2019s hard to imagine what the companies, police or city officials could do to eliminate the threat entirely.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think any country in the world has eliminated vandalism in public spaces,\u201d he said.",
      "The incidents are problematic for Waymo on multiple levels: not only the cost of repairing or replacing the vehicles, but also the reputational risk when images and videos spread widely online.",
      "There\u2019s also the possible danger to passengers. And although no passengers were harmed in the arson incidents, some passengers have been delayed or reported feeling threatened when the cars they were riding in were vandalized from the outside. Last year, a San Francisco woman posted a video online after she said two men targeted her while riding in a Waymo.",
      "Then there\u2019s the lost business from what Waymo calls \u201ctemporary service adjustments.\u201d In Los Angeles and San Francisco this past week, Waymo stopped serving certain areas that are part of its normal service area. People using the company\u2019s app in recent days were greeted with a message, alluding to the street protests: \u201cPickup times and routing may be affected by local events. Thank you for your patience.\u201d",
      "In San Francisco, that meant Waymo refused to take customers through or to several neighborhoods, including parts of the Financial District, the Civic Center area near City Hall and the sprawling South of Market neighborhood.",
      "Waymo also limited service to the Mission District, a historically working-class and Latino neighborhood that\u2019s also home now to many tech workers and a vibrant nightlife scene. Thousands of people attended an anti-President Trump protest in the Mission on Monday night, and the effects on Waymo reverberated for days: A post on X with an example of rerouting around the Mission went viral Wednesday, getting 1.2 million views.",
      "Searches of the Waymo app by NBC News showed the service continuing to refuse service to parts of the Mission throughout the week, including during relatively quiet morning hours and on Friday. The app labeled certain destinations as \u201cunreachable.\u201d",
      "A Waymo spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re taking these heightened measures now out of an abundance of caution.\u201d They said the situation was temporary and subject to change quickly in response to conditions on the ground. Waymo hasn\u2019t published a map of which areas are restricted.",
      "Mass anti-Trump protests advocating for \u201cNo Kings\u201d are scheduled for Saturday nationwide, providing another potential disruption for robotaxis.",
      "Though the service restrictions may be temporary, they struck some people as discriminatory against poorer neighborhoods, with some social media users on X calling the practice \u201credlining\u201d on the part of Waymo. The term refers to the decadeslong practice of refusing home loans to predominantly Black neighborhoods.",
      "In contrast, ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft, which use human drivers, still offered rides to the Mission in recent days, according to NBC News searches of their apps. San Francisco\u2019s Municipal Transportation Agency rerouted some buses during the height of anti-Trump administration protests, but then resumed regular service.",
      "There have been no arrests for the attacks on Waymo vehicles in Los Angeles last Sunday. On Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said it was taking the lead in investigating the Waymo attacks, making them the subject of a federal investigation.",
      "\u201cThe cause of these fires is quite obvious,\u201d ATF special agent in charge Kenneth Cooper of the Los Angeles Field Division said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe task at hand now is to determine who is responsible. ATF\u2019s National Response Team is going to be a tremendous asset, and we look forward to the results of their efforts to hold the responsible parties accountable,\u201d he said."

    "published": "Sat, 14 Jun 2025 11:15:00 GMT",
    "summary": "A growing range of attractions are testing algorithmic pricing practices, similar to those used by airlines, as many struggle with attendance shortfalls.",
    "story": [
      "How much will it cost to visit a museum, zoo or aquarium this summer? The answer, increasingly, is: It depends.",
      "John Linehan can rattle off almost two dozen factors that Zoo New England\u2019s dynamic pricing contractor, Digonex, uses to recommend what to charge guests.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d said Linehan, president and CEO of the operator of the two zoos in eastern Massachusetts.",
      "Before adopting dynamic pricing, the organization was changing prices seasonally and increasing entry rates little by little. \u201cAs we watched that pattern, we were afraid some families were going to get priced out,\u201d he said of the earlier approach. \u201cI\u2019m a father of four and I know what it is like.\u201d",
      "Now, Zoo New England\u2019s system provides cheaper rates for tickets purchased far in advance. That, coupled with the zoo\u2019s participation in the Mass Cultural Council\u2019s discounted admissions program for low-income and working families, \u201cputs some control back in the consumer\u2019s hands,\u201d Linehan said.",
      "We charge what we need to make ends meet while delivering on our mission.",
      "John Linehan, CEO of Zoo New England",
      "The zoo is one of many attractions embracing pricing systems that were earlier pioneered by airlines, ride-hailing apps and theme parks. While these practices allow operators to lower prices when demand is soft, they also enable the reverse, threatening to squeeze consumers who are increasingly trimming their summer travel budgets.",
      "Before the pandemic, less than 1% of attractions surveyed by Arival, a tourism market research and events firm, used variable or dynamic pricing. Today, 17% use variable pricing, in which entry fees are adjusted based on predictable factors such as the day of the week or the season, Arival said. And 6% use dynamic pricing, in which historical and real-time data on weather, staffing, demand patterns and more influence rates.",
      "The changes come as barely half of U.S. museums, zoos, science centers and similar institutions have fully recovered to their pre-Covid attendance levels, according to the American Alliance of Museums. That has led many to pursue novel ways of filling budget gaps and offsetting cost increases.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a saying: \u2018No margin, no mission,\u2019\u201d Linehan said, \u201cand we charge what we need to make ends meet while delivering on our mission.\u201d",
      "Entry costs are climbing even at attractions that aren\u2019t using price-setting technology. The broad \u201cadmissions\u201d category in the federal government\u2019s Consumer Price Index, which includes museum fees alongside sports and concert tickets, climbed 3.9% in May from the year before, well above the annual 2.4% inflation rate.",
      "In 2024, the nonprofit Monterey Bay Aquarium raised adult ticket prices from $59.95 to $65 and recently upped its individual membership rate, which includes year-round admission, from $95 to $125. \u201cGate admission from ticket sales funds the core operation of the aquarium,\u201d a spokesperson said.",
      "While the Denver Art Museum has no plans to test dynamic pricing, it raised admissions fees last fall, three years after a $175 million renovation and a survey of ticket prices elsewhere, a spokesperson said. Entry costs went from $18 to $22 for Colorado residents and from $22 to $27 for out-of-state visitors. Prices rise on weekends and during busy times, to $25 and $30 for in- and out-of-state visitors, respectively. Guests under age 19 always get in free thanks to a sponsored program.",
      "Some attractions are doing a daily analysis of their bookings over the next several days or weeks and making adjustments.",
      "Douglas Quinby, CEO of Arival",
      "Like many attractions, the art museum posts these prices on its website. But many attractions\u2019 publicly listed ticket prices are liable to fluctuate. The Seattle Aquarium \u2014 which raised its price ranges last summer by about $10 ahead of the opening of a new ocean pavilion \u2014 also uses Digonex\u2019s algorithmic recommendations.",
      "During the week of June 8, for example, the aquarium\u2019s online visit planner, which displays the relative ticket availability for each day, offered out-of-state adult admissions as low as $37.95 for dates later in the month and as much as $46.95 for walk-in tickets that week. In addition to booking in advance, there are more than half a dozen other discounts available to certain guests, including seniors and tribal and military members, a spokesperson noted.",
      "At many attractions, however, admission fees aren\u2019t even provided until a guest enters the specific day and time they want to visit \u2014 making it difficult to know that lower prices may be available at another time.",
      "\u201cSome attractions are doing a daily analysis of their bookings over the next several days or weeks and making adjustments\u201d to prices continuously, said Arival CEO Douglas Quinby. Prices might rise quietly on a day when slots are filling up and dip when tickets don\u2019t seem to be moving, he said.",
      "Digonex, which says it provides automated dynamic pricing services to more than 70 attractions worldwide, offers recommendations as frequently as daily. It\u2019s up to clients to decide how and whether to implement them, a spokesperson said. Each algorithm is tailored to organizations\u2019 goals and can account for everything from weather to capacity constraints and even Google Analytics search patterns.",
      "Data-driven pricing can be \u201ca financial win for both the public and the museum,\u201d said Elizabeth Merritt, vice president of strategic foresight at the American Alliance of Museums. It can reduce overcrowding, she said, while steering budget-minded guests toward dates that are both cheaper and less busy.",

    "story": [
      "In recent years, the defamation suit between actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard and the shooting of Megan Thee Stallion by fellow rapper Tory Lanez put a new spin on how celebrity trials are covered, as content creators and vloggers flooded social media feeds with the most explosive moments.",
      "The federal trial of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs is no exception.",
      "Each day, outside a towering courthouse in lower Manhattan, a horde of traditional media outlets, online streamers and curious spectators jostle to score a seat inside the main courtroom where Combs is facing sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges that could result in a lengthy prison sentence if convicted.",
      "Sign up for the \u201cDiddy on Trial\u201d newsletter for key developments and analysis",
      "When the proceedings pause for a lunch break or conclude for the day, it\u2019s the dozens of content creators who take center stage, scrambling to the sidewalks to set up their cellphone tripods and emote the latest testimony and courtroom drama for their eager followers.",
      "But with Combs\u2019 fate unfolding in a trial that is not being televised, the rush to relay every sordid detail and rack up views can pose challenges fraught with ethical issues as well. The real-life consequences came to light when two women who took the stand using pseudonyms were exposed when their presumed names were leaked online, highlighting how irresponsible behavior in this new wave of content creation can be harmful.",
      "Federal prosecutors said \u201cMia,\u201d a former assistant to Combs, had her identity revealed by a YouTube streamer who had been in the courtroom and her name was also posted on X, while another court watcher may have unmasked \u201cJane,\u201d an ex-girlfriend of Combs who testified over six days.",
      "Jane\u2019s personal lawyer told U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian last week that such \u201cposts and media outlets threaten her safety and privacy that led to the court\u2019s pseudonym order.\u201d Subramanian has said he would consider specific media gag orders or barring violators from court in a trial poised to continue through early July.",
      "Revealing the names of Combs\u2019 accusers wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact the trial itself, since jurors aren\u2019t supposed to consume media about the case or talk about it to others \u2014 but it still represents a line that must be tread carefully, said Mark Chutkow, a defense lawyer who handled racketeering cases as a federal prosecutor in Detroit.",
      "If names are leaked, he said, \u201cit could deter victims from coming forward in future high-profile cases because they won\u2019t believe the law enforcement assurances that their identities will be protected.\u201d",
      "To help protect the accusers\u2019 identities, the court sketches of them released publicly have not included their facial features, and traditional media coverage of their testimonies hasn\u2019t included physical descriptions.",
      "For the creator behind the YouTube account Make It Make Sense, which has more than 213,000 subscribers, shining a light on the accusers\u2019 experiences was an important reason to cover the trial, he said. He temporarily moved to New York to be in the courthouse each day.",
      "\u201cDo not try to guess who Jane is, please,\u201d he told his followers recently. \u201cIt\u2019s not a joke. She is supposed to remain anonymous.\u201d",
      "The creator behind Make It Make Sense told NBC News after court ended this week that \u201clegacy media\u201d may understand the repercussions of certain actions, but there is a different attitude among some content creators who are attending these high-profile trials for the first time and seeking to go viral.",
      "\u201cExposing people\u2019s names does not move the needle or change the story,\u201d said the channel\u2019s creator, who asked for his real name not to be used because of fears for his personal safety.",
      "One afternoon after Combs\u2019 trial let out, a woman who said she works as a court employee gushed as she watched popular online streamers \u2014 like the man behind Make It Make Sense \u2014 leaving the courthouse.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re how I get my information,\u201d she said.",
      "And no legal background is required.",
      "For some content creators, it\u2019s simply about fulfilling people\u2019s curiosity \u2014 and their own.",
      "Michelle Bracy of Manhattan said her TikTok account, miss_knockout, has grown from about 9,000 followers since Combs\u2019 trial began in mid-May to now more than 35,800. She said she goes live in the mornings before the trial starts, sits in court where she takes extensive notes on a legal pad, and then returns outside the courthouse at the day\u2019s end, sometimes broadcasting through the evening.",
      "\u201cI do follow the rules because, of course, it\u2019s TikTok, and you don\u2019t want to be removed,\u201d Bracy said, \u201cbut I also make my coverage more relatable to people. And I stay in the middle. I\u2019m not on this side, I\u2019m not on that side. I just get the facts on both sides.\u201d",
      "The 2022 courtroom dispute between Depp and Heard showcased a new frontier among online content creation. The trial, which was televised, attracted droves of livestreamers and spectators to outside a Fairfax, Virginia, courthouse where they could show their support for either side. Online as well, memes and hashtags, particularly ones manufactured to support Depp, popped up and gained billions of views on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram.",
      "Combs\u2019 case has not attracted that same groundswell, as the initial appearance of people in \u201cFree Diddy\u201d T-shirts early in the trial has subsided outside the courthouse. But on days when certain witnesses have taken the stand, including his ex-girlfriend, Casandra \u201cCassie\u201d Ventura, the rapper Kid Cudi and Jane, their presence reinvigorates interest.",
      "On Friday, the courthouse was buzzing with a surprise appearance by the rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, who tried to get inside the main courtroom to support Combs and was ushered instead to a court overflow room, where he stayed for several minutes. When he left, members of the media and vloggers ran for the elevators to follow him outside, sprinting across the promenade to catch him before a car could whisk him away.",
      "It\u2019s these viral moments and quick interactions with key figures in the trial that content creators like Bracy yearn for, she said.",
      "She had her own moment last month with one of Combs\u2019 defense lawyers that helped increase her followers.",
      "\u201cAre you Brian Steel?\u201d she said before Steel entered the courthouse. \u201cCan you say \u2018hi\u2019 to my TikTok real quick?\u201d",
      "\u201cHey,\u201d Steel responded.",
      "The idea that other content creators would defy court orders in Combs\u2019 trial is disappointing, Bracy told NBC News.",
      "\u201cYou got to respect the court system and the judge,\u201d she said, \u201cand be bright enough not to repeat the names.\u201d",
      "Competition can be stiff among the creators. When court lets out, they jockey for position with television cameras as Combs\u2019 family, including his mother and children, are escorted by security to their car. The spectacle can draw a small crowd from interested passersby.",
      "Oota Ongo, a YouTube streamer from Brooklyn, gives street preacher energy as he talks to his more than 13,600 subscribers from outside the courthouse.",
      "He told NBC News that he started covering the trial, his first, to \u201csee everything for myself and put my biases aside.\u201d",
      "The most surprising thing about the trial, he added, has been knowing how much sway he can have.",
      "\u201cHow small content creators, big content creators, big publications, big news programs, all of these people are merging as one,\u201d Ongo said.",
      "\u201cI really dived in,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is our trial of the century.\u201d",
      "On a recent afternoon after court, he began streaming to his channel, contending with several other online streamers pacing the sidewalk, a crush of media cameras and reporters, and unrelenting New York City street noise. He took it all in, anticipating what\u2019s to come when the jury finally reaches a verdict after weeks of an energized trial.",
      "Like \u201cMadison Square [Garden] out here. Psychos. People on unicycles, like this,\u201d an expressive Ongo told his followers, pointing to a man pedaling a unicycle. \u201cAll of that going on. Drinking and juggling going by you. The Moon Man. All of that is out here because they\u2019re here every day.\u201d"

      "Charles Levine was blindsided in February when he was about to retire from the Army and found out it would not cover more than $40,000 in final moving costs \u2014 an end-of-service benefit given to retirees.",
      "The lieutenant colonel had served for 30 years, deploying five times and leading an airborne infantry company in Iraq and Afghanistan. But because he chose to continue serving after he was eligible to retire in 2022, he was stripped of moving and storage perks promised to nearly every retired soldier.",
      "\u201cIt was a broken promise,\u201d Levine, 59, said. \u201cI was incredulous.\u201d",
      "News of the noncoverage delivered a sharp emotional sting and a financial gut punch. Levine and his wife, Ginger, were relying on the benefit.",
      "They have been renting an apartment in Charlottesville, Virginia, for $2,800 a month, thinking the military would help them vacate their on-post housing at West Point, the military academy in New York.",
      "By the couple\u2019s estimates, it would cost at least $42,000 to pack, transport and store a lifetime of belongings themselves, so they feel stuck at West Point, paying another $4,400 a month for rent.",
      "\u201cWe cannot afford to move and we cannot afford to stay,\u201d Ginger said.",
      "To save money, Ginger, 53, has been driving around, scrounging up used cardboard boxes and paper from new neighbors, while \u201cfeeling humiliated that this is how our service ends.\u201d",
      "Levine said he had a fulfilling career. But when he thinks about the toll the last few months has taken on him and his wife of 18 years, he questions his choice to stay longer in the military.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the one thing that rises to the level where perhaps I did make a mistake,\u201d he said.",
      "Levine served in the National Guard from 1995 to 2001, when, three months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he started active duty in the Army.",
      "During the next 21 years, he crawled through enemy caves; participated in more than two dozen air assaults looking for Taliban-captured soldier Bowe Bergdahl, who was in his battalion; rose to battalion executive officer; and earned several medals, including three Bronze Stars.",
      "In that time, back home, he missed the entirety of his first year of marriage, many holidays, the birth of his first grandchild, the death of his father-in-law, and all of his son\u2019s high school football games.",
      "\"We\u2019ve given everything we have,\" said Levine, who spent the last six years of his service teaching calculus to cadets at West Point.",
      "In fall 2022, Levine had served the maximum number of years in active duty and could retire. But, he said, senior Army Reserve leaders convinced him to transition to the Reserve and continue teaching at West Point instead.",
      "Levine officially separated from active duty and went on to teach for two more years as part of the Army Reserve. Just before he officially retired from the military in March, he learned he had lost the moving benefits.",
      "\u201cWe were told, without warning, that our family would not receive any support for our final move,\u201d Ginger said. \u201cNo shipment of household goods, no storage, and no recognition of the circumstances.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Lt. Col. Orlandon Howard, an Army spokesperson, said soldiers like Levine who choose to be released from active duty after at least 20 years of service, deferring retirement to continue working for the Reserve, have about six months to use their moving benefits. Those who elect to retire from active duty have three years.",
      "To guide their decision-making, Howard said the Army provides soldiers with \u201csignificant resources, education and support,\u201d including transition assistance programs across the country.",
      "\u201cTransitioning Soldiers must weigh their options, and associated advantages and disadvantages to make the best decision for their circumstances,\u201d Howard said in his statement.",
      "Levine said he did not choose to be released from active duty and was instead involuntarily separated, which he said should have afforded him moving benefits for three years. Levine, a doctoral candidate at Northeastern University and a visiting scholar at the University of Virginia, also said a section of the regulation allows those who pursue advanced education four years to move.",
      "The Army said soldiers who leave active duty and join the Reserve are not considered involuntarily separated, but Levine said his separation papers show otherwise.",
      "After fighting their case for more than three months, the Levines have reached their breaking point. They\u2019ve decided to dip into their savings to move themselves, fearing they were already wasting so much money paying two rents.",
      "\u201cI broke,\u201d Ginger said. \u201cI was emotionally broken.\u201d",
      "The couple crunched estimates from multiple moving and storage companies. On the low end, if they pack themselves, they\u2019d pay about $42,000 out of pocket.",

      "\u201cFor the first time in our life, we have debt now,\u201d Levine said.",
      "He thinks back to the sheer happiness and pride he felt in February during his retirement ceremony. A retired four-star general flew in from the Middle East to preside over the event, and Levine was celebrated for his feats while surrounded by loved ones and senior leaders.",
      "\u201cIt was amazing. I was dreading leaving. I felt really fulfilled,\u201d he said. \u201cAll those things went away and evaporated.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Israel\u2019s military strikes on Iran have struck at the heart of the country\u2019s military leadership and nuclear program, creating a possible vacuum at the top of the regime that could hinder its ability to recover from the onslaught, experts say.",
      "But \u2014 assuming that it still can \u2014 there is a scenario in which the strikes could lead Tehran to abandon negotiations over its nuclear program and instead rush toward building a bomb, according to analysts and former U.S. officials.",
      "The killing of top Iranian military officers as well as several nuclear scientists will likely have sparked fears in Tehran that Israeli intelligence had deeply penetrated the regime and that other senior figures could also be in danger.",
      "Israel has previously pulled off brazen assassinations inside Iran, targeting senior government scientists involved in the country\u2019s nuclear program and the political leader of the Iranian-backed Palestinian group Hamas when he was visiting Tehran.",
      "\u201cYou have to assume the system is shell-shocked,\u201d said Alex Vatanka of the Middle East Institute think tank. \u201cThey don\u2019t know\u2026 how badly they\u2019re infiltrated\u201d by Israel.",
      "Iranian media and the Israeli military said Israel\u2019s strikes on Thursday killed Iran\u2019s top military officer, Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, as well as the commander of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, Hossein Salami, and a major general in the Revolutionary Guards, Gholam Ali Rashid.",
      "The senior military officers targeted had deep ties to Iran\u2019s regime and were known personally by the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, particularly Bagheri, according to Vatanka. Khamenei promoted Bagheri to his post as chief of the armed forces in 2016.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a personal element here, which might be a factor in terms of what Khamenei decides to do,\u201d he said.",
      "Shahid Beheshti University said five professors were killed in Thursday\u2019s attack as well as \u201csome\u201d family members.",
      "Nuclear program\u2019s future",
      "The first wave of Israeli military strikes launched Thursday likely inflicted serious damage on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that air raids will continue for \u201cas many days as it takes\u201d to ensure Iran does not develop a nuclear arsenal.",
      "But Iran still has buried nuclear facilities at Fordow and elsewhere that it could potentially use if it chose to pull out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and rescind its commitment not to pursue nuclear weapons. In that case, Iran would need to enrich uranium to weapon-grade levels, a short technical step with its current stockpile, and then build a nuclear warhead. That effort could take roughly a year or more, most experts estimate.",
      "The CIA declined to comment as to whether there were any indications that Iran was moving to pull out of the NPT and pursue nuclear weapons.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump appears to be trying to use the Israeli military attack as leverage over Iran, pushing it to make concessions or else face even harsher military strikes. But Iran may calculate that the time for negotiations is over and opt to build nuclear weapons, according to Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group think tank.",
      "\u201cOne of the strategic risks in targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure is the potential for backlash,\u201d Vaez said. The strikes \u201ccould incentivize Tehran to reconstitute its program with renewed urgency, driven by a heightened resolve to achieve a credible nuclear deterrent,\u201d he said.",
      "Iran has invested decades of effort and trillions of dollars in building its nuclear program, and Iranian political leaders portray it as a point of national pride, a symbol of the country\u2019s independence and technological progress.",
      "Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank, said Iran\u2019s leadership will likely choose to develop nuclear weapons rather than give up the program it sees as a patriotic endeavor.",
      "\u201cIt has become a symbol of national prestige and honor,\u201d Miller said on MSNBC.",
      "\u201cWhen all is said and done, and this regime stays in power, which I suspect it will, the Iranians will probably make a decision to go all out in an effort to weaponize,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd the Americans and the Israelis are going to have to figure out, over time, how to deal with it.\u201c",
      "Jonathan Panikoff, a former deputy national intelligence officer for the Near East at the U.S. National Intelligence Council, said that Iran may conclude that pursuing nuclear weapons is the only way to safeguard the regime.",
      "Iran \u201cmay determine that the Israeli strikes mean time is up for the regime to decide whether to obtain a bomb, if it hasn\u2019t done so already,\u201d Panikoff, now at the Atlantic Council think tank, wrote in an analysis. \u201cThe conclusion could be that it can no longer sit on the proverbial nuclear fence, and that it has to rush for a bomb or risk never having one.\u201d",
      "To many Iranian political leaders, securing a nuclear weapon -- or nuclear weapons capability -- is vital for the survival of the regime itself, he added.",
      "But it was unclear if Israel\u2019s military strikes could deliver a knock-out blow that would make it impossible for Iran to build nuclear weapons, some experts said.",
      "Alex Plitsas, a former senior Pentagon official and a fellow at the Atlantic Council, said it was likely that the Israeli assault, which included sabotage operations, had caused too much damage to Iran\u2019s nuclear sites and equipment to enable Iran to rush toward building a bomb.",
      "Iran was caught flat-footed by the Israeli attack, even though Israel had sent clear warnings for years and in recent months that it would not tolerate an advancing Iranian nuclear program, Plitsas said.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians have misread the signals from Israel again and again,\u201d he said.",
      "Even a successful series of strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear sites might only delay Tehran\u2019s ability to develop the bomb by up to two years, according to past comments by U.S. officials and estimates by experts.",
      "In 2012, Robert Gates, shortly after he stepped down as defense secretary, said military strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear program would likely fail in the end to prevent Tehran from developing the bomb.",
      "\u201cSuch an attack would make a nuclear-armed Iran inevitable,\u201d Gates said at the time. \u201cThey would just bury the program deeper and make it more covert.\u201d",
      "Iran maintains its nuclear program is designed for purely civilian purposes to generate energy and research, but Western powers have long accused Tehran of laying the ground for a nuclear weapons project, citing enrichment activity far beyond what\u2019s required for peaceful uses. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Iran had a nuclear weapons program but halted the project in 2003.",
      "A report in May from the International Atomic Energy Agency concluded Iran was not fully cooperating with U.N. inspectors and that the agency could not provide assurance that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u201cexclusively peaceful.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, the IAEA censured Iran for failing to comply with nonproliferation obligations designed to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon. It was the first such censure in 20 years.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have criticized Trump for pulling, during his first term, the U.S. out of a 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran that imposed limits on its nuclear activities, saying that decision opened the way to the current crisis."

      "The first such parade since Washington welcomed victorious U.S. troops home from the Gulf War in 1991 \u2014 and an echo of similar extravaganzas following the Civil War and World Wars I and II \u2014 Saturday's affair will feature more than 6,000 troops, a procession of various types of armored vehicles alongside the National Mall on Constitution Avenue, and dozens of military aircraft cruising overhead.",
      "Trump, who relishes pomp, will have his own reviewing stand.",
      "But he runs the risk, literally and metaphorically, of watching rain  drench his parade. Weather forecasts show a significant chance of precipitation and the possibility of evening thunderstorms. More substantively, the demonstrative show of American force will play out against the backdrop of Trump's inability to leverage U.S. power to fulfill campaign promises to end wars in Ukraine and Gaza.",
      "In a twist of timing, the long-planned exercises come the day after the U.S. began providing aid to Israel in shooting down Iranian missiles, and days after Trump deployed National Guard and Marine troops to Southern California to quell protests against immigration raids.",

And if he views it, as in his first term, 'his generals,' and, if he views it as 'his military,' then you tie it to your personal special day of your birthday \u2014 that's what's different.\"",
      "Trump critics say he is exploiting the military to nurture his own ego \u2014 at a cost of as much as $45 million to taxpayers \u2014 and, as he claims sweeping executive powers, presenting himself in the manner of a dictator. For decades, Americans have associated heavily armed military parades with Cold War-era authoritarianism in the former Soviet Union and other countries.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., also made that comparison this week and said he didn't think the parade was the best idea.",
      "\"I wouldn't have done it,\" Paul said Tuesday. \"The images you saw in the Soviet Union and North Korea, we were proud not to be that.\"",
      "That may help explain why most American adults are sour on the idea. New NBC News Decision Desk polling, released Saturday morning, shows that 64% of adults surveyed say they disapprove of the parade. Protests are planned in Washington and across the country, organized under the slogan \"No kings.\"",
      "Trump, who promised to meet protesters with \"very big force,\" has sought to rebut the notion that he is celebrating himself.",
      "\"It will be a parade like we haven\u2019t had in many, many decades here,\" he said this week. \"And it\u2019s a celebration of our country. It\u2019s a celebration of the Army, actually.\"",
      "Democratic lawmakers pushed back on Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was on Capitol Hill for a round of hearings this week, over their choices in how to use the military.",
      "\"You are deploying the American military to police the American people. Sending the National Guard into California without the governor\u2019s request. Sending the Marines \u2014 not after foreign threats, but after American protesters,\" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, told Hegseth.",
      "\u201cAnd now President Trump is promising heavy force against peaceful protesters at his D.C. military parade,\" she said. \"Those sorts of actions, and that sort of rhetoric from the president, should stop every one of us cold. Threatening to use our own troops \u2014 on our own citizens \u2014 at such scale is unprecedented, it is unconstitutional, and it is downright un-American.\"",
      "Ken Carodine, a retired Navy rear admiral, said in a telephone interview with NBC News that the parade is not just \"a terrible idea\" but one that many of the service members may not be excited about.",
      "\"Most of the guys that are involved in either organizing or participating in this thing, it\u2019s the last thing they want to be doing. But they can\u2019t say anything,\" he said, explaining that they must follow the orders of their superiors, right up to the commander in chief.",
      "\"It\u2019s a stupid order,\" Carodine said. \"But it\u2019s a legal order.\"",
      "Some Republican lawmakers, including those who routinely back the president's actions, said this week that they are not enamored of the idea of the display.",
      "\"The United States of America is the most powerful country in all of human history,\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said on Tuesday. \"We\u2019re a lion, and a lion doesn\u2019t have to tell you it\u2019s a lion. Everybody else in the jungle knows. And we\u2019re a lion.\u201d",
      "Federal officials held discussions Friday afternoon about whether to move the start of the parade, scheduled for 6:30 p.m. after a day of festivities around the National Mall, to try to avoid the dangers and discomfort of possible thunderstorms. They ultimately decided to move ahead as planned.",
      "For Trump, it promises to be another moment of triumph, an exclamation point on the 2024 election victory that brought him back to the helm of the most powerful nation on the planet.",
      "But while the U.S. military has executed many successful missions in the years since Operation Desert Storm pushed Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait in 1991, the more memorable wars for most Americans are the drawn-out engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq. The U.S. is not fighting any war abroad right now, and it is not coming off any recent victory.",
      "The Iraq and Afghanistan wars, once supported by the American public, became unpopular over time as they cost the nation dearly in blood and treasure. The U.S. retreated from Afghanistan in 2021 \u2014 after 20 years \u2014 under an agreement negotiated by Trump and fulfilled by President Joe Biden.",
      "\"Nobody had a parade for the kids coming back from Afghanistan,\" Carodine said. \"That would have made a lot more sense than what we\u2019re doing tomorrow.\""

    "story": [
      "If you stand still too long, people will peg you \u2014 at least according to Bryan Cranston. \u201cI like to keep people guessing,\u201d he tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview.",
      "That\u2019s why the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d actor says he prefers to \u201ckeep moving around\u201d instead.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m playing a lot of dramatic roles recently, I will look for comedic roles and I keep swimming back and forth so that I\u2019m not pegged as any given one person,\u201d he says.",
      "It\u2019s that versatility that\u2019s earned Cranston six Emmy Awards, two Tonys, a best actor Oscar nomination and a host of other accolades. And, at 69, he shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.",
      "Cranston currently appears in the latest Wes Anderson film, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d along with starring in \u201cEverything\u2019s Going to Be Great,\u201d a new drama for which Cranston learned how to play the bagpipes. If that\u2019s not enough, he\u2019ll soon be crossing the Atlantic to perform on London\u2019s famed West End in the Arthur Miller play \u201cAll My Sons,\u201d starting in November.",
      "\u201cI do love it. I have a relationship with this,\u201d explains Cranston. \u201cIt takes a committed relationship, that you\u2019re committing to this as your life, just like you would in your personal life. And if you do so, you have a chance to be successful in your personal life or your business life.\u201d",
      "No stranger to success, Cranston got his start doing bit parts in a variety of TV shows and movies before landing the breakout role of Hal Wilkerson in \u201cMalcolm in the Middle\u201d in 2000. It's a role that earned him a handful of Emmy nominations and made Cranston a household name.",
      "However, it was the brief part he played in a 1998 episode of \u201cThe X-Files\u201d that put Cranston on the radar of one of the show\u2019s writers, Vince Gilligan. Eight years later, when Gilligan went to cast Walter White in his new antihero show, \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d he remembered Cranston and rang up the actor\u2019s agent. That decision would forever cement their legacies in television history.",
      "'You\u2019re Only as Good as You Dare to Be Bad'",
      "With a storied career in film, stage and television (both behind and in front of the camera), Cranston says he continues to seek out unique roles and opportunities that speak to him on a personal level.",
      "\u201cMy real life is filled with a variety of different characters. I\u2019m sometimes sincere, sometimes silly, sometimes moody, sometimes romantic ... and so there are different facets of ourselves that you are familiar with in your own life. Sometimes you\u2019re sad, sometimes you\u2019re joyous,\u201d explains Cranston.",
      "\u201cSo, I curate the roles I do. I look for roles that I can be different or something that challenges me that, 'Ooh, that\u2019s really not like me at all,' so I need to dive into that and see what comes of it,\u201d he says.",
      "In fact, it\u2019s his willingness to take risks that\u2019s gotten him this far, and it\u2019s based on advice he once received. Though Cranston can\u2019t quite remember exactly where he got it from, he says that outside of being kind, working hard and showing up on time, it's the best advice he's ever gotten.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re only as good as you dare to be bad, right? If you take chances that you could fall on your face, you could fail, it\u2019s that point that you can also turn and have it really work. So, don\u2019t play safe. Extend yourself, take chances, take risks and see what happens,\u201d Cranston tells TODAY.com.",
      "Is that the advice he gives his daughter, actor Taylor Dearden?",
      "\u201cFirst of all, as her dad, she does not want my direct advice,\u201d he says with a laugh about Dearden, whom he shares with wife Robin Dearden. The 32-year-old currently stars in the Max hospital drama \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d a role for which she\u2019s garnered glowing reviews.",
      "\u201cTaylor is a wonderful, hardworking actor,\u201d Cranston told Craig Melvin during a recent segment on TODAY. \u201cShe grew up in this business with my wife and I being actors. And so, we\u2019re so proud of her.\u201d",
      "\u2018I Need to Outwork Everyone\u2019",
      "While Cranston may not dole out much career advice to Dearden, he tells TODAY.com that he does what he can to be a solid role model instead.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that I can relay to her is how I have been for her 32 years on this planet and try to live a good life and be an exemplar to her, as she can look at and say, \u2018Well, this is how he did things and that seemed to work for him.\u2019 Or, \u2018Oh, he tried that and that didn\u2019t work, so I\u2019m going to do something different,\u2019\u201d he explains.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s basically it. Just live a true life and let your kids see that and hopefully they\u2019ll make their own proper decisions.\u201d",
      "That mindset likely comes from his parents, who Cranston says were instrumental in instilling his own work ethic.",
      "\u201cBoth my mother and father were hardworking people and they came from very humble, hardworking families, (they were) children during the Depression. It was, go out there every single day, try to find a job. That\u2019s what their parents were faced with. And so it carries on,\u201d says Cranston.",
      "With his parents as his example, Cranston says he learned early on that if he wanted to make a career out of acting, he needed to be fully committed.",
      "\u201cI realized as a young actor that there were always going to be actors who were better than me. At the same time, there were always going to be actors who weren\u2019t as good as me. And the only thing I can control is how hard I worked,\u201d he explains.",
      "\u201cI know I can outwork people and that was my motto \u2014 I need to outwork everyone. So when I was a young actor, 22, 23, people were going out and they were partying every night. Not me. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to class. I\u2019m studying. I\u2019m learning monologues because I need to outwork everybody and I need to be ready.\u2019 And that was it, because this is what I wanted. I wanted a career as an actor.\u201d",
      "And it\u2019s that advice that Cranston passes along to young actors hoping to follow in his footsteps.",
      "\u201cI say, \u2018You\u2019ve got to commit.\u2019 It\u2019s got to be, \u2018You\u2019re all in, go all in.\u2019 Because if you\u2019re not putting all of your energy into it, what are you waiting for? Why would you not? You've got to. And it still doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to be successful, just like a personal life. But you\u2019ve got to try, and that\u2019s what it comes down to.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Spoilers ahead for \u201cMaterialists.\u201d",
      "When Celine Song wrote the script for her debut feature film, \u201cPast Lives,\u201d she was inspired by a conversation she had at a New York bar with her husband and her childhood sweetheart, who was visiting from South Korea.",
      "While translating between Korean and English for these important men in her life, she discovered that she was also translating \u201ctwo parts of myself,\u201d Song explained in an interview with BAFTA.",
      "The romantic drama, starring Greta Lee and Teo Yoo, showcased a love triangle \u2014 but one that Song has previously described as the past, present and future of her life and the \u201cwhat ifs\u201d that so many people oftentimes think about.",
      "The 36-year-old director and writer captivated audiences with her authentic and heartbreaking film \u2014 and it\u2019s all because of her real-life experience.",
      "\u201cPast Lives\u201d earned Song an original screenplay Oscar nomination, and the film was also nominated for best picture.",
      "So when it came to her latest romantic comedy, \u201cMaterialists,\u201d Song once again took inspiration from her personal life.",
      "As an aspiring playwright in New York City, Song didn\u2019t have the experience to work as a barista or in retail. Instead, after meeting a matchmaker at a party, she applied for the same position.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Well, maybe I\u2019ll try to get that job,\u2019\u201d Song tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd then I worked on it for like, six months. But I feel like I learned more about human beings in those six months than I did in any other part of my life. And in fact, it become kind of a big part of what I know about people too.\u201d",
      "Years later, those six months would eventually lead to her second feature film starring Dakota Johnson as Lucy, a high-end New York matchmaker who attempts to set up her rich and successful clients with other elite bachelors and bachelorettes. She's good at her job, which has led to nine successful marriages.",
      "However, Lucy's approach to having someone find their happily ever after is determined by math, calculations and numbers. When Lucy asks who her clients want to be buried next to and change their diapers when they grow old, her clients tell her the weight, height, salary and age range they want in a partner, focusing on the material aspects.",
      "At first it appears as if these marriages aren't based on happiness and how another person makes you feel. These are business transactions and what each person brings to the table.",
      "Lucy, on her end, also considers herself a professional \u2014 cold at times, and practical. At a wedding, she meets Harry (Pedro Pascal), a tall, handsome and extremely rich businessman who is very interested in her. At that same wedding, she runs into her ex-boyfriend John (Chris Evans), a struggling cater waiter and aspiring actor.",
      "Flashbacks show that Lucy and Chris, despite having a strong bond, had called it quits over financial issues.",
      "What comes next is someone torn between being in love with a person who doesn't check all the boxes and another who does.",
      "This love triangle was not a part of Song\u2019s own time as a matchmaker, though other moments in the film do come from her past. An ending courthouse wedding scene was inspired by her own civil ceremony with husband and \u201cChallengers\u201d screenwriter Justin Kuritzkes.",
      "\u201cI got married at the courthouse first,\u201d she says. \u201cI had a party after.\u201d",
      "Song ultimately decided to call it quits as a matchmaker, \u201cbecause I wasn\u2019t writing, because it was too fun,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was supposed to be a day job and it was becoming like my full time thing ... I only did it for six months but some of them resulted in a second date, which is a win.\u201d",
      "When it comes to drawing inspiration from her personal experiences for her work, Song says it has to teach her something and \u201cit always has to be something that fascinates me.\u201d",
      "\u201cOr something that makes me feel like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know enough about that,\u2019\u201d she continues. \u201cThe story has to feel like it knows more than me, is wiser than me, and it\u2019s better than me in that way.\u201d",
      "\u201cMaterialists\u201d asks: Is love easy? Is checking the boxes better than a real connection? Does being taller make you a better catch, among other measurable features.",
      "There\u2019s a scene in \u201cMaterialists\u201d when Lucy is talking to her co-worker about a surgery that can make a person taller. The two matchmakers candidly speak about the benefits of such procedure when it comes to finding a partner.",
      "Later on, Lucy discovers that Harry actually had the surgery and added six inches to his height. He admits that after the procedure, his whole life changed and more women became interested in him.",
      "While the audience laughed in the screening I attended during those moments, Song calls it \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking because you\u2019re seeing the way that it is materially and tangibly affecting somebody like Harry. The standards, numbers like height, all of that,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhat Harry is going through is very difficult as well, and I\u2019m really interested in depicting men fairly.\u201d",
      "The idea of a \u201cunicorn,\u201d a rare and nearly perfect candidate, is also a product of the materialistic world, Song says. She hopes male viewers can relate.",
      "\u201cSo often the topics of romance are reduced to girl s---,\u201d she says, adding that matters of the heart are not just for women. \u201cThe truth is, men are also crushed by the dating market. They\u2019re also crushed by the way that we date and with the way that we objectify and commodify ourselves and each other. I really wanted there to be a very real consequence for men in the film, and have them be crushed by the same dating market that crushes (Lucy's client) Sophie or Lucy.\u201d",
      "Song hopes \u201cMaterialists\u201d start an open-hearted and honest conversation about what it\u2019s like to date and love in 2025.",
      "And when asked, \u201cIs love easy?\u201d Song replies, \u201cLove is easy.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut it\u2019s also hard when people are afraid to let go of control and completely surrender,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut the truth is, I think, when it happens, it just happens. They say, \u2018If you know, you know.\u2019 That\u2019s kind of what it is. You face it, and then when you face love, it\u2019s very simple and it\u2019s very easy.\u201d"

I was like, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s listening, and he\u2019s watching me, and he\u2019s reacting, and it\u2019s so funny.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cMeet the Parents\u201d was one of the first big comedies of the new millennium, with a relatable premise honing in on how tough it can be when meeting the people who may become your in-laws. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the movie has several quotable lines, including Jack threatening Greg to \u201cbring you down to Chinatown\u201d and the infamous one at the family dinner gone wrong.",
      "\u201cI have nipples, Greg,\u201d Jack says to his future son-in-law. \u201cCould you milk me?\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us had any idea that it was going to be so stinking successful,\u201d Polo said of the movie, which spawned two sequels, \u201cMeet the Fockers\u201d and \u201cLittle Fockers.\u201d A fourth installment is on the way.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Bob\u2019s age now, when he was when we made the first movie. And so it seemed like there was sort of this mirror to the first film,\u201d Stiller said.",
      "Ariana Grande will join the cast for the new movie, with great things expected from the Oscar-nominated \"Wicked\" star.",
      "\u201cI think she\u2019s going to bring a whole new life to the franchise,\u201d Polo said.",
      "\u201cThe character she\u2019s playing is \u2014 she\u2019s going to be really, really funny and kind of the whole engine of the new movie. So it\u2019s exciting,\u201d Stiller added."

    "summary": "Oprah Winfrey says in a new Barbara Walters documentary, \"Tell Me Everything,\" the late journalist's relationship with her daughter is one reason she didn't have kids.",
    "story": [
      "Barbara Walters had a profound professional impact on Oprah Winfrey, who calls the interviewing legend her \u201cmentor\u201d in the new documentary \u201cBarbara Walters Tell Me Everything.\u201d",
      "As it turns out, Walters had a profound impact on Winfrey\u2019s personal life, too. Winfrey reveals in the documentary that Walters played a part in her decision not to have children.",
      "Walters was a trailblazing journalist who entered the news business at a time when few women were a part of it. She got her start on TODAY in the 1960s, but eventually landed a long-term spot on ABC\u2019s news team, becoming a celebrity herself thanks to her insightful, often pointed, interviews.",
      "Walters, who earned multiple Daytime Emmys for her work on TODAY and \u201cThe View,\u201d married three different men over the course of her life. In 1968, she and her second husband, Lee Guber, adopted a daughter, Jacqueline, with whom she had a tempestuous relationship. Walters died in 2022 at the age of 93.",
      "Walters' life story in the ABC News Studios documentary, which is sprinkled throughout with new interviews from prominent news figures like Winfrey, Katie Couric, Connie Chung and Cynthia McFadden, is mainly told in her own words through old clips.",
      "\u201cI was in my 30s when Jackie was born,\u201d Walters says. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s a blessing. My world came together. I mean, I was already on the TODAY show, and I'd had three miscarriages, and now I had everything.\u201d",
      "Winfrey ties her own ascent as a journalist to watching what Walters did first.",
      "\u201cShe was a mentor for me before she knew that she was a mentor,\u201d Winfrey says in the film while describing watching Walters on television growing up.",
      "Walters' interviewing style inspired Winfrey, who explains she would look down at her question cards, and then up again at her subject to ask the next question, just like Walters.",
      "Winfrey later reflects on Walters' \u201ccharged, complex relationship\u201d with Jacqueline and its influence on her.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why I never had children,\u201d Winfrey says. \u201cI remember her telling me once that \u2018there\u2019s nothing more fulfilling than having children, and you should really think about it.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018OK, but I\u2019m looking at you. So, no.\u2019\u201d",
      "Jacqueline struggled with her mother's fame and ran away at one point when she was about 16. In old interview footage, Walters recalls having someone else pick up her daughter after learning where she ended up, and taking Jacqueline to an \u201cemotional growth school,\u201d where she remained for three years. She also says  Jacqueline had a problem with pills.",
      "\u201cIt's important to say Jackie had a father, and Jackie had a governess,\u201d McFadden, who is also adopted and conducted an interview in 2001 with Jacqueline at Walters' request, says. \u201cSo it wasn't that Jackie was left alone in a playpen. Barbara articulated many times that she had made mistakes as a mother. She had made choices for herself, for her work.\u201d",
      "Despite the struggle with work-life balance, Walters embraced being a mother from the beginning.",
      "Footage from an interview she did in the 1970s with Dolly Parton, who also does not have kids, shows the singer asking during a break if Walters only has one child. Walters responds that her daughter is adopted and says, \u201cFor me, it was the best thing I ever did.\u201d",
      "Later in the documentary, Winfrey goes into greater depth about how focusing on her career was also a stumbling block to having a family, much like Walters.",
      "\u201cYou are a pioneer in your field, and you are trying to break the mold for yourself and for women who are going to follow you, then something is going to have to give for that,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd that is why I did not have children. I knew I could not do both well. Both are sacrifices: Sacrifice to do the work, and it's also a sacrifice to be the mother and to say, \u2018No, let somebody else have that.\u2019",
      "\u201cAnd at no time have I ever heard a story, read a story, and based on what I know of Barbara Walters, at no time, has Barbara Walters ever said, \u2018No, let someone else take that story.\u2019 No.\u201d",
      "In fact, Walters took a big interview from Winfrey in the late 1990s.",
      "Winfrey recalls having an agreement with Monica Lewinsky's team for an interview after Lewinsky and President Bill Clinton's scandal.",
      "\u201cAnd then Barbara swooped in,\u201d Winfrey says, describing the various ABC platforms Walters could offer Lewinsky to share her story, whereas Winfrey just had her talk show.",
      "\u201cSo, I didn't like that,\u201d Winfrey says.",
      "\u201cBecause Barbara had been No. 1, she had been it, she had been the madam for so long that she saw that as her rightful place in the space,\u201d she explains.",
      "\u201cAnd if there was something that deserved a special one-on-one interview, I think she felt that she was the one that was supposed to have it. And 9.9 times out of 10 she got it.\u201d",
      "\u201cBarbara Walters Tell Me Everything\u201d begins streaming June 23 on Hulu and on Disney+."

      "The singer's fans have been asking themselves just that since the art was released June 11, sparking conversation and controversy.",
      "\"Man's Best Friend\" is the first followup to Carpenter's 2024 album \"Short 'n' Sweet\" that launched her to new heights of fame, with songs like \"Espresso\" and Please Please Please.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the cover art for \"Man's Best Friend.\"",
      "What is the cover art for 'Man's Best Friend'?",
      "The cover art is immediately provocative. In the photo, Carpenter kneels on all fours wearing a tight black dress. Her hand rests on a man's leg. His hand, meanwhile, holds a chunk of her blond hair. Carpenter stares at the camera with an open-mouthed expression.",
      "On Instagram, Carpenter shared another image: A closeup of a dog wearing a collar with the words \"Man's Best Friend.\"",
      "She captioned the post, \"My new album, 'Man\u2019s Best Friend' \ud83d\udc3e is out on August 29, 2025. I can\u2019t wait for it to be yours xPre-order now.\"",
      "What are fans saying about the art?",
      "The art has gotten mixed reactions from fans, as evidenced by the comments on the original post and multiple Reddit threads.",
      "In the comments of Carpenter's post, people used words like \"disgusting\" and \"disturbing\" to describe the imagery, saying it was \"not a very empowering image for women.\" Another told her to \"please please please stand UP.\"",
      "Others tried to read into image's connection to the album's title and found a deeper meaning.",
      "\"Man\u2019s best friend double meaning for dogs and female dogs are b---hes so it\u2019s a play on the ideology of men being so dependent on women,\" one commenter said. \"Her cover shows her being in a submissive role but in reality she\u2019s the one who has actual control.\"",
      "Commenters debated back-and-forth. One said they were getting \"secondhand embarrassment\" by looking at the picture. Another responded, \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s to embarrass women but rather to show how women are regarded by certain men.\"",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Carpenter's reps for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "What is Sabrina Carpenter trying to say? A PR expert breaks it down",
      "Beth Booker, public perception expert and creator of \"The Uncensored Publicist,\" says the artwork should be situated within Carpenter's own brand and the way female pop stars are often marketed.",
      "The image is a familiar one at first: A \u201cfemale pop star posed and packaged perfectly for the male gaze,\" Booker says, comparing it to Britney Spears in the early 2000s or Madonna's \"Like a Virgin\" era.",
      "However, Booker sees this as Carpenter \"flipping the script\" on a familiar format. Since humor is such a \"huge part of her brand,\" she says this should be interpreted with a wink.",
      "\"The cover is hypersexualized, yes, but intentionally exaggerated to feel almost absurd,\" she says. \"She\u2019s sexy, but she\u2019s also funny, self-aware, and in complete control of how she\u2019s being seen.\"",
      "Booker says that Carpenter's submissive posture in the photo is not an indication she's like that in real life.",
      "\"She\u2019s not performing desire for someone else\u2019s approval, she\u2019s expressing it for herself and her audience. The title, 'Man\u2019s Best Friend,' directly nods to how women have been labeled 'b-----s' for decades and she\u2019s essentially saying: fine, I\u2019ll take the word, flip it, and turn it into part of my brand,\" Booker says.",
      "Fans are debating Carpenter's intentions, which Booker says may have been Carpenter's intention.",
      "\"That confusion is the point. Great pop culture lives in that gray area where people aren\u2019t quite sure how they\u2019re supposed to feel. Is it satire? Is it sexy? The answer is yes. She knows exactly how this image would land and she\u2019s allowing people to sit in that tension because that\u2019s what keeps the conversation going. She\u2019s not being provocative accidentally, she\u2019s doing it on her own terms,\" she says.",
      "\u201cThe fact that some people, even some of her own fans, are uncomfortable with it actually reinforces the point. Brand evolution doesn\u2019t always feel comfortable in real time, and that\u2019s part of what makes this moment important for her career.\u201d",
      "\"Man's Best Friend\" is Carpenter's seventh studio album and it'll follow the release of \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d her sixth studio album, which won pop album of the year at the 2025 Grammys."

      "Israeli military assaults on the Gaza Strip\u2019s hospitals have ramped up in recent weeks to the highest level so far this year, bringing a health system already weakened by 19 months of war to a breaking point. NBC News has analyzed 27 videos and images from the last two months taken by civilians and our own journalists on the ground to piece together a picture of the full extent of the destruction of a health system engulfed in war.",
      "In footage from a surveillance camera, men, women and children could be seen crossing the entrance to Khan Younis\u2019 European Hospital moments before a missile hit, blasting people into the air as others scattered in panic. Another video, posted to social media and verified by NBC News, showed the fiery aftermath of an explosion at a medical warehouse near Al-Awda Hospital, in northern Gaza, which has been attacked repeatedly, including on May 22 and again on May 24.",
      "\u201cNearly all hospitals in Gaza are now damaged or destroyed, and half of them are no longer operational,\u201d Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, told NBC News. During the war, Gaza\u2019s hospitals have eked back services, only to be repeatedly struck or besieged again.",
      "Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law, but Israel has maintained that Hamas uses hospitals and medical centers for military activities, opening them to attack. Hamas has denied doing so. Humanitarian groups, including the United Nations, have said Israel has not provided sufficient information to substantiate many of its claims and have called for independent investigations of Israel\u2019s attacks and Hamas\u2019 alleged misuse of the facilities.",
      "Earlier this week, however, the Israeli military gave a small group of reporters a tour of a tunnel that was uncovered beneath the European Hospital, where it said it had recovered the body of Hamas\u2019 military chief Mohammed Sinwar.",
      "\u201cWe cannot stress this enough: Hospitals must never be militarized or targeted. If they are, it may constitute a war crime,\u201d Laerke said.",
      "Of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals, none are fully functioning; 17 are providing partial services, and 19 are not functioning at all, according to World Health Organization data from Monday. The wider health system, including ambulances, field hospitals and clinics, has been attacked more than 700 times since the start of the war, killing at least 900 people and injuring more than 1,000. (The death toll across Gaza is more than 55,000, according to the health ministry.)",
      "After a ceasefire was called in January, Israeli military attacks on Gaza\u2019s health system had abated. The truce fell apart in March, and WHO data shows a ramping up of attacks in recent weeks. While the organization tallied five attacks on Gaza\u2019s health system in April, after the first three weeks of May, the number of attacks had quadrupled to 21, with at least three more attacks since, including on the vicinity of a dialysis center at the Indonesian Hospital on June 1 and strikes on Al-Aqsa and Al-Ahli Hospitals on June 4 and 5. In addition, hostilities near Al-Amal Hospital have rendered it \u201cout of service,\u201d the WHO said Monday.",
      "The earliest attack recorded by NBC News during that two-month period was on April 2, when an Israeli airstrike hit a UNRWA clinic in Jabalia, north of Gaza City, that was housing displaced people. Video captured by NBC News on the ground documented the chaotic aftermath: walls crushed to rubble, charred mattresses, furniture blasted into shards. A child\u2019s small, shrouded body was loaded onto a donkey cart to be taken to the morgue.",
      "In another case, the Israel Defense Forces struck two hospitals on the same day, May 13, both in Khan Younis. Video verified by NBC News shows several large plumes of smoke rising from the grounds of the European Hospital. Palestinian health officials said at least 16 people were killed and dozens more injured. The WHO said the facility had been forced to suspend services.",
      "Also struck that day was the Nasser Medical Complex. Video posted by the U.N. showed scattered debris, twisted hospital beds and damaged equipment. It was the fourth time Nasser had been hit during the war, according to the U.N., with the latest strike killing two people and injuring a dozen others.",
      "In a statement in response to those attacks, the IDF said its forces had targeted a command and control center located at Nasser Hospital and \u201ca Hamas underground terrorist infrastructure site\u201d underneath the European Hospital.",
      "The IDF provided evidence of what it said was a Hamas tunnel beneath the European Hospital. It did not, however, provide evidence for the command and control center at Nasser, or for the following cases, but broadly said: \u201cThe Hamas terrorist organization continues to use hospitals in the Gaza Strip for terrorist activity.\u201d NBC News is not able to independently verify the IDF\u2019s statements."

      "The Israeli military launched a massive attack on Iran on Friday in a dramatic escalation of their long-running conflict that drew a retaliatory missile assault from Tehran and raised the risk of another war in the Middle East.",
      "The Israeli strikes took out a significant swath of Iran's top military leaders and senior scientists, as Israel unleashed more than 200 fighter jets across roughly 100 targets. They were aimed at Iran\u2019s main enrichment facility and targets associated with the country\u2019s ballistic missile program, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.",
      "In a firm response Friday evening local time, Iran launched missiles toward Israel, the nation\u2019s defense forces said, prompting its highly sophisticated defense systems to \"intercept the threat.\"",
      "Heavy smoke appeared in the night sky over Tel Aviv as incoming rockets from Iran descended on the city, with many intercepted by Israel\u2019s missile defense systems. Before the retaliatory attack began, the Israel Defense Forces directed residents across the country to remain close to protected spaces, minimize movement in public areas and avoid public gatherings.",

      "Israel's emergency service, Magen David Adom, said it was providing medical treatment to 34 injured people following a rocket strike in Israel's central region.",
      "The Israeli paramedic organization also said it was providing treatment and evacuating at least 21 people after a strike south of Tel Aviv.",
      "Iran later launched a fresh wave of missiles in the early hours of Saturday morning local time, Israel Defense Forces said.",
      "A Tel Aviv hospital treated seven people with injuries following the early morning attack, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Israel's strikes have killed 78 people so far, including senior military officials, and injured 320 people, according to Iranian ambassador to the United Nations Ali Bahreini. Residential buildings were among the structures damaged in Tehran.",
      "Loud explosions in Iran were heard in the northern part of the capital on Friday night, while state media reported attacks in Qom, located south of Tehran and a holy city for Shia Muslims.

    "story": [
      "As U.S. and Chinese negotiators meet for trade talks in London this week, a primary concern for Washington will be whether Beijing eases the flow of rare earth materials, which have become key components of modern life.",
      "China dominates the global supply chain for rare earths, mining about 70% and refining 90% of the materials used to produce everything from wind turbines and defense equipment to electric vehicles and car seats. The United States produces virtually none of the world\u2019s rare earths, whose extraction can be devastating for the environment.",
      "That economic vulnerability has come into sharper focus since April, when China imposed export controls on seven strategic rare earth metals and related magnets amid an escalating trade war with President Donald Trump. Companies, especially automakers and business associations in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere have sounded the alarm, warning that China\u2019s rare earth restrictions risk delays that could bring manufacturing to a halt.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC on Monday that U.S. negotiators in London were seeking a \u201chandshake\u201d from China on rare earths after Trump said last week that Chinese President Xi Jinping had agreed to resume their flow in the first call between the two leaders since Trump returned to office.",
      "\u201cThey were kind of releasing them, but it was going a lot slower than some companies believed was optimal,\u201d Hassett said.",
      "In an editorial Monday, the Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said the rare earth export controls were not a \u201cshort-term bargaining chip\u201d for trade talks but a responsible policy aimed at preventing rare earths, which have both civilian and military uses, \u201cfrom being used in activities that threaten international peace and security.\u201d",
      "\u201cImposing export controls on strategic resources with clear dual-use characteristics is a common international practice and a legitimate right of sovereign nations to safeguard their own security,\u201d the editorial said.",

    "story": [
      "A Burmese American woman was eager to bring her siblings over to the U.S. from Myanmar amid a more than 15-year wait for visas. She\u2019d been hoping to reunite with them since the 1990s, during military rule in her home country, so her brother\u2019s family could start a life in the U.S. But a day after she bought the plane tickets, President Donald Trump ordered a travel ban that included Myanmar.",
      "The woman, 51, and her husband, who were granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation, had sponsored her brother and sister-in-law to immigrate to the U.S. The siblings were then were hoping to bring their own adult kids, too, so that they wouldn\u2019t have to fulfill mandatory military service in the country\u2019s active civil war.",
      "With the travel ban in effect Monday, they said the policy has a heightened impact on people from war-torn countries like Myanmar who had hopes of finding sanctuary in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating because we were on the cusp of securing their safety to leave that situation,\u201d said her husband, 57, adding he felt like a \u201crug got pulled out from under us in an instant.\u201d",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump\u2019s policy is in the \u201cbest interest of the American people and their safety.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis commonsense, country-specific travel restrictions include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe restrictions fulfill the President\u2019s day one promise to protect American citizens from dangerous foreign actors who may come to the United States and cause us harm.\u201d",
      "The travel restrictions, announced on Wednesday, completely bar entry to the U.S. for people from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, in addition to those from Afghanistan, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Other countries, including Cuba, Laos and Venezuela, are under partial travel restrictions.",
      "According to Trump\u2019s proclamation, several of the countries on the list had declined to accept the repatriation of their nationals while others had visa overstay rates that the administration deemed \u201cunacceptable.\u201d A few countries lacked \u201cthe competence of the central authority\u201d for issuing passports, the proclamation said.",
      "Jackson also pointed out a section in the proclamation that allows for applications for refugee status.",
      "\u201cNothing in this proclamation shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the [international Convention Against Torture], consistent with the laws of the United States,\u201d the proclamation said.",
      "However, after he took office, Trump limited refugee admissions for almost all countries including Myanmar. And in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke the temporary legal status of more than 500,000 immigrants that was granted by the Biden administration. Those immigrants came from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and are now subject to deportation.",
      "Myanmar was among the nine countries in the latest proclamation that Trump also targeted during his first term. In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. issued 13,284 visas to the country, with business and tourism permits making up the most common types of visas. Myanmar recorded 1,384 overstays that fiscal year, equating to an overstay rate of almost 30%.",
      "The new travel ban comes as Myanmar\u2019s violent military regime fights to hold on to power after it seized control from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in a 2021 coup. Since then, violence has escalated across the region as the military clashes with ethnic minority rebel groups and pro-democracy militias.",
      "\u201cJunta forces have slaughtered thousands of civilians, bombed and burned villages, and displaced millions of people,\u201d Tom Andrews, United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, said in a press release earlier this year. \u201cMore than 20,000 political prisoners remain behind bars. The economy and public services have collapsed. Famine and starvation loom over large parts of the population.\u201d",
      "Under the new travel ban, anyone who obtained a visa prior to the policy is still able to come to the U.S. But there\u2019s confusion over how the restrictions will be implemented and enforced. The Burmese American woman and her husband are among those with concerns, particularly as there have been several cases of lawful permanent residents and citizens being swept up in the dragnet of Trump\u2019s immigration policies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to think that they could be randomly picked up because somebody had a bad day at the office, or somebody didn\u2019t do their job or didn\u2019t believe that their visa was true,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite frankly terrifying.\u201d",
      "For the woman, reunification with her brother has been a long time coming. She became a citizen in the late 1990s and began the process to help bring her sibling over a few years later. At the time, Myanmar had been under the control of a strict military junta that held power from the 1960s until 2011, and for decades had kept the country in a state of extreme isolation and deprivation. She said her brother, whose children were just a few years old then, hoped to come over and root his family in more stability.",
      "\u201cTheir circumstances in Myanmar at that time were very, very bad. That was the system that I grew up in. There was no future for them, no prosperity,\u201d the woman said. \u201cMy brother was concerned for his children\u2019s future and education.\u201d",
      "Amid moves and address changes, the couple said they never received the standard letter notifying them that the woman's brother had been able to progress in his visa process. They assumed the wait was a product of notorious immigration backlogs. It wasn\u2019t until the situation in Myanmar intensified again in recent years that the couple found out that the brother was close to finally being able to immigrate. But by then, the woman said, her brother\u2019s kids had aged out of the system.",
      "According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, those who turn 21 before being approved for legal permanent resident status are no longer considered a child for immigration purposes and need to file an entirely new application, prolonging the green card process.",
      "At this point, the woman said, her brother and sister-in-law said they were willing to risk possible detention to come to the U.S., particularly if it meant easier access to the American immigration system that would enable them to fight to get their children to come over as well. However, with Myanmar\u2019s military draft in effect, the family is particularly concerned for their safety now that the travel ban adds another barrier to leaving.",
      "\u201cThe reason they wanted to come here was for their kids,\u201d the woman said of her brother and sister-in-law. \u201cNow, it\u2019s really hard to bring my nephews here to save their lives.\u201d",
      "Quyen Dinh, executive director of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, said the bans are ultimately another part of \u201cthe engine of Trump\u2019s mass deportation machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s focused on demonizing immigrant families and communities by denying them family reunification, that we all rightfully deserve to be whole \u2014 especially now, when the world is more dangerous than ever,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "Rather than protecting individuals\u2019 safety, Dinh said, she believes Trump\u2019s policy punishes those who need an escape from dangerous conditions.",
      "\u201cIt perpetuates the violence that is happening across the world, as opposed to creating conditions for peace or humanitarian relief, and for these families who\u2019ve been separated,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "She also said she views the ban as evidence that the U.S. is misunderstanding its role as a humanitarian leader.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got people who are legitimately trying to escape a civil war,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cNow, because of some arbitrary decision by the Trump administration to pick a certain number of countries \u2026 without consideration of the actual cases, without an exception policy, it hurts them. They\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 British soccer legend David Beckham, a sporting icon and one of the world's most recognizable faces, has received a knighthood from King Charles III for services to sport and charity,  Buckingham Palace announced Friday.",
      "\u201cGrowing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honor,\" Beckham said in a statement issued Friday through the Press Association News Agency.",
      "The award, the highest Britain's antiquated honors system can bestow, was almost inevitable given Beckham's success as a player and his contribution to the country's culture. For years, Britons have wondered how he has not already been elevated to Sir David.",
      "He gets the \"gong,\" as it's known in British parlance, as part of the king's birthday honors list, which rewards notable people from across British society.",
      "The move also means his famous wife, Spice Girl-turned-fashion mogul Victoria, will now be known as Lady Beckham. Their marriage in 1999 made them Britain's most famous couple and a near-permanent fixture in tabloid newspapers and magazines, an obsession that has lasted into the age of social media.",
      "\u201cIt will take a little while for the news to sink in but I\u2019m immensely proud and it\u2019s such an emotional moment for me to share with my family,\" Beckham said.",
      "Beckham, 50, rose from an unremarkable east London upbringing to reach sporting glory with his beloved Manchester United, before going on to star for several of Europe's elite teams. He played more than 100 games for the English men's national team, many as captain, and scored at three World Cups.",
      "He was part of the famous \"Class of 92,\" a supremely talented group of young players who signed professional deals in 1992 and went on to form the basis of United's imperial phase of dominance in the 1990s and early 2000s. This culminated in the club winning an unprecedented \"treble\" of titles in 1999: the Premier League, the European Champions League and the English FA Cup, under manager Alex Ferguson.",
      "Beckham won 19 major trophies in his career and became the first English player to win major titles in four different countries.",
      "\u201cTo have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career and literally a boyhood dream come true,\u201d Beckham said in his statement.",
      "An elegant player, Beckham's intelligence made up for his lack of pace and trickery. He was famous for his long passes that opened up defenses and for devastating free kicks, which, according to former teammates, he spent countless hours perfecting.",
      "His career took him to the United States in 2007, where he played for the LA Galaxy and helped to build soccer's profile in the country.",
      "Beckham has been an ambassador for UNICEF, the United Nations' children's fund, since 2005. Ten years later, the organization launched a fund in his name.",
      "\u201cOff the pitch I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to represent Britain around the world and work with incredible organisations that are supporting communities in need and inspiring the next generation,\" his statement said. \"I\u2019m so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I\u2019m grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment.\"",
      "Beckham's post-playing career was shaped in part by media entrepreneur Simon Fuller, formerly manager of the Spice Girls. Fuller was instrumental in putting a clause in his contract that would give him a stake in an MLS franchise for $25 million when he finished playing.",

    "summary": "Israel's latest action pits traditional Republican support for Israel \u2014 and antipathy toward Iran \u2014 against the MAGA base's fear that the U.S. will be drawn into a new foreign war.",
    "story": [
      "As the percussion of Israeli munitions rattled Tehran on Thursday night, President Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA movement observed a rare silence \u2014 a sign, influential Republicans say, of the divide within their own party when it comes to the prospect of a war between Israel and Iran.",
      "It took Trump, who comments publicly more often than any president in recent memory, about 10 hours to put out a statement on his Truth Social platform, in which he urged Iran to give up its nuclear weapons program.",
      "The first official U.S. assessment had been issued by the White House under Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s name, and it emphasized that America was \u201cnot involved\u201d in the strikes.",
      "But three U.S. officials told NBC News later Friday that the U.S. is assisting in shooting down Iranian missiles and projectiles targeting Israel. The Pentagon also moved a number of military assets into the region in recent days to support the operation, according to another U.S. official.",
      "In the meantime, Charlie Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA, polled his 5 million X followers on the question of whether America should \u201cget involved in Israel\u2019s war against Iran.\u201d By Friday afternoon, the poll showed more than 350,000 votes, with an overwhelming proportion in the \u201cNo\u201d column.",
      "When Kirk read Rubio\u2019s statement on the strikes during a podcast Thursday night, Jack Posobiec, a right-wing activist popular with the MAGA audience, interjected that it was \u201cnot a supportive statement at all.\u201d Earlier Thursday, before the strikes, Posobiec had warned on X that a \u201cdirect strike on Iran right now would disastrously split the Trump coalition.\u201d",
      "And Steve Bannon, host of the \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast, which is influential with MAGA adherents within the administration and outside of it, steered clear of public commentary Thursday night.",
      "It all adds up to a demonstration of the quandary facing Trump as he and other elected Republicans seek safe political turf.",
      "Trump\u2019s electoral success owes in no small part to his isolationist-leaning \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform and his fierce criticism of drawn-out U.S. engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan that were launched by Republican President George W. Bush and continued by Democratic President Barack Obama.",
      "But Israel\u2019s latest action pits traditional Republican support for the Jewish state \u2014 and antipathy toward Iran \u2014 against the MAGA base\u2019s fear that the U.S. will be drawn into a new foreign war. And even within Trump\u2019s MAGA wing, there\u2019s a long-running split over  American backing of Israel. Trump has always been on the pro-Israel side of the divide.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are a pro-Israel party, and the president hasn\u2019t wavered on that,\u201d said one longtime Trump adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity within the MAGA movement. \u201cI think the challenge here is not how to move forward. The question is how to sell that to the recalcitrant base.\u201d",
      "If Trump is able to do that, it will be despite powerful voices on the other side of the debate weighing in. Tucker Carlson, one of Trump's most influential supporters, wrote in his newsletter Friday that the U.S. should \"drop Israel.\"",
      "\"If Israel wants to wage this war, it has every right to do so. It is a sovereign country, and it can do as it pleases,\u201d Carlson wrote, according to Jewish Insider. \u201cBut not with America\u2019s backing.\u201d",
      "Israel launched its attack to forestall Iran\u2019s development of a nuclear weapon and perhaps pressure Tehran into giving up that goal. Trump has been trying to construct a new version of an Obama-era nuclear deal that he shredded during his first term, and he articulated his hope Friday that Israel\u2019s campaign will help serve as a catalyst for Iran to sign a new pact. But it is not at all clear that the fighting won\u2019t have the opposite effect and spark a broader war between the two Middle Eastern powers.",
      "That\u2019s a showdown that establishment Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have been itching for.",
      "\u201cGame on,\u201d Graham \u2014 whose hawkish worldview predates the rise of the MAGA movement \u2014 wrote on X on Thursday night as video of explosions in Tehran bounced around the world.",
      "On the other side of the spectrum, Infowars host Owen Shroyer, one of the hundreds of people pardoned by Trump in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, posted a video to X that framed the new conflict as an existential question for the president\u2019s base.",
      "\u201cAmerica, the Trump movement, MAGA \u2014 however you want to say it, there\u2019s going to be a lot of soul-searching as these events go on, because a lot of MAGA is anti-war,\u201d Shroyer said. \u201cWhat good is \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 if we can\u2019t even be isolated from this war-torn region of the world, if we can\u2019t even be isolated from these foreign countries and these foreign conflicts that are just filled with hate?\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll never be able to make America great again,\u201d he added, \u201cas long as we\u2019re entangled in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "With Trump signaling approval for how Israel conducted strikes while cajoling Iran to make a deal Friday morning, some of the president\u2019s MAGA faithful seemed to settle on a narrative that U.S. involvement is acceptable to a point: troops on the ground.",
      "On a call with reporters Friday, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., asserted his own opposition to U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts while expressing confidence that Trump feels the same.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to support our ally, which we\u2019re doing, and we should do, unequivocally,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to provide them with arms for their own self-defense, which we have done and should do. But I can\u2019t imagine a world in which we would send United States troops, in which we would be involved in any kinetic activity, as the defense people like to say, there in the region, unless it\u2019s just defending our own installations.\u201d",
      "Israeli airstrikes on Iran are a far cry from American troops invading a nation that has been far more vulnerable to internal revolution than foreign conquest over the course of thousands of years of existence. Even the Republicans who are most aggressive when it comes to Iran talk about missiles and bombs rather than staging an incursion with American ground forces.",
      "But drawing a line on that is a middle ground that may satisfy most, if not all, Trump supporters for the moment.",
      "In the hours after the strikes, Trump allies hewed closely to the administration\u2019s sparse talking points.",
      "Alex Bruesewitz, a Republican consultant with close ties to the White House, shared Rubio\u2019s statement on X, emphasizing that the \u201cUS WAS NOT INVOLVED IN STRIKES AGAINST IRAN.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Laura Loomer, the right-wing conspiracy theorist aligned with Trump, posted several messages supportive of Trump and Israel.",
      "\u201cIran,\u201d Loomer wrote, \u201cmust never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "Mehek Cooke, an attorney and pro-Trump political commentator active in the MAGA movement, said Friday that her recent visit to Israel opened her eyes to the \u201cdevastation of Iran\u2019s Oct. 7 proxy war\u201d there.",
      "Israel\u2019s strikes, Cooke added, \u201cwere not just justified; they were inevitable. This matters to every American, including the MAGA movement. You can\u2019t negotiate with regimes chanting \u2018Death to America.\u2019\u201d",
      "Cooke also pointed to recent polling from Rasmussen, a right-leaning firm, that found that 57% of respondents favored U.S. military action to combat Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program. She said she believes MAGA loyalists will \u201cremain united\u201d behind Trump.",
      "\u201cMAGA wants peace, but we\u2019re not blind,\u201d Cooke added. \u201cYes, some in MAGA lean isolationist. But appeasement is not an option. Iran\u2019s leaders just threatened both Israel and the U.S., bringing us to a dangerous tipping point. Trump\u2019s 60-day deadline \u2014 blatantly ignored by Iran was followed by real consequences.\u201d",
      "Still, the political perils of taking sides in the early stages of what Israel says could be a sustained campaign were underscored by the reluctance of some MAGA figures to deal with the question head-on.",
      "Asked to explain the tension within the MAGA movement, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., a close Trump ally, texted: \u201cMAGA is more concerned with the Battle for Los Angeles,\u201d where Trump has deployed the National Guard and Marines in a standoff with Americans protesting against immigration raids, \u201cthan the Battle for Tehran.\u201d",
      "What the White House appears to be most concerned about, at least in terms of Trump\u2019s domestic politics, is portraying the U.S. as uninvolved in the Middle East conflict.",
      "The word that trickled out overnight from the White House, and from a phone interview Trump gave to Fox News, emphasized that U.S. military had no role in the strikes.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until Friday morning that Trump weighed in directly \u2014 and ominously.",
      "\u201cThere has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cIran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. God Bless You All!\u201d"

In October, Israel damaged nearly every one of Iran\u2019s strategic air defense systems (mainly S-300s), but much of the damage was to the radars or other parts that can be rebuilt.

    "summary": "Ballymena, Northern Ireland, has endured a third night of rioting by racist thugs targeting immigrants, with homes, stores and cars destroyed.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Dozens of mostly young men torched homes and smashed in windows in a Northern Irish town late Wednesday, in a third night of what officials described as coordinated \u201cracist thuggery\u201d against the community\u2019s ethnic minorities.",
      "Some residents of Ballymena, a town about 25 miles northwest of Belfast with a population of 30,000, responded to the anti-foreigner vigilantism by sticking the Union Jack or signs in their windows reading \u201cBritish household\u201d and \u201clocals live here\u201d in an apparent attempt to be spared by the rioters.",
      "NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News has seen residents from ethnic minorities packing up suitcases and leaving their homes, while others have spoken of their terror that the mob violence will continue.",
      "The violence first flared Monday during a vigil for a teenage girl who was the victim of an alleged sexual assault two days before. Two teenage boys, both 14, were charged with attempted rape and appeared in court Monday, communicating through a Romanian translator. The boys' identities have not been released because of their age.",
      "Masked rioters broke away from the otherwise peaceful vigil, building barricades and throwing bricks, Molotov cocktails and fireworks at houses and police.",
      "Riot police responded with rubber bullets and a water cannon. More than 40 officers have been injured over the three nights, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, known as the PSNI, said.",
      "The violence also spread to other towns in Northern Ireland, such as Coleraine, where a bus station was attacked, access to the train station was blocked and rioters pushed trash cans onto the rails and set them alight Wednesday night, police said.",
      "In Larne, some people whose homes were destroyed were given shelter at a leisure center \u2014 until that was targeted and set on fire, too.",
      "In total, 10 people, all men in their teens, 20s and 30s, have been arrested. Three of them, aged 18, 17 and 15, have been charged and are set to appear in court Thursday.",
      "\u201cThis violence was clearly racially motivated and targeted at our minority ethnic community and police,\u201d Ryan Henderson, PSNI assistant chief constable, said Tuesday at a news conference. \u201cIt was racist thuggery pure and simple and any attempt to justify and explain it as something else is misplaced.\u201d",
      "A Bulgarian national who lives in Ballymena and asked that her identity be protected told Sky News, \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying, honestly, I\u2019m scared to get out of the house,\u201d",
      "She said she had been in Northern Ireland \u201cfor a while \u2014 I\u2019ve pursued an education here,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve done multiple things for the community and it\u2019s just absolutely heartbreaking that it\u2019s not the same Ballymena that I had when I first came here.\u201d",
      "\"It is important,\" said Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, a think tank that focuses on immigration, identity and integration, \"to draw the clearest red line between the legitimate debate about immigration policy, including numbers, the pace of change and the quality of integration, and hateful abuse and threats.\"",
      "\u201cGovernments need to manage asylum much better nationally and locally,\u201d he said, \u201cbut must challenge more forcefully those stoking hatred and socializing violence against migrants, and the platforms that let hatred run riot without impediment.\u201d",
      "Northern Ireland is no stranger to unrest, but usually between \u201cunionists\u201d \u2014 mostly Protestants who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom \u2014 and \u201crepublicans\u201d \u2014 mostly Catholics who want it to become part of the Irish Republic.",
      "Though this conflict, called \u201cthe Troubles,\u201d officially ended with a peace deal in 1998, sporadic clashes still break out between these often segregated communities and police.",
      "This week\u2019s unrest in Ballymena follows a different trend, however. Anti-foreigner sentiment has in recent years surged across the U.K. and indeed Europe and the West.",
      "As prices for food, fuel and housing rise due to inflation, and public services become squeezed, some politicians mainly on the populist hard-right have sought to blame mass immigration for putting undue stress on the system.",
      "Pro-immigration progressives argue that immigrants provide an essential net benefit to society, both bringing high-level skills and filling less glamorous but necessary jobs.",
      "Last summer, anti-immigrant violence flared across the U.K. after three young girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party in the town of Southport in northwest England.",
      "Online misinformation wrongly identified the British-born attacker as an immigrant."

      "Australia in 2023 committed to spend 368 billion Australian dollars ($239 billion) over three decades on AUKUS, the country\u2019s biggest ever defense project with the U.S. and Britain, to acquire and build nuclear-powered submarines.",

      "In an Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio interview, Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said AUKUS was in the strategic interests of all three countries and that the new review of the deal signed in 2021 when Joe Biden was the U.S. president was not a surprise.",
      "\u201cI am very confident this is going to happen,\u201d he said of AUKUS, which would give Australia nuclear-powered submarines.",
      "\u201cThis is a multi-decade plan. There will be governments that come and go and I think whenever we see a new government, a review of this kind is going to be something which will be undertaken,\u201d Marles told the ABC.",
      "Albanese is expected to meet Trump for the first time next week on the sidelines of the Group of 7 meeting in Canada, where the security allies will discuss a request from Washington for Australia to increase defense spending from 2% to 3.5% of gross domestic product.",

      "The opposition Liberal party on Thursday pressed Albanese to increase defense spending.",

      "The first $500 million payment was made when Marles met with his U.S. counterpart, Pete Hegseth, in February.",
      "The Pentagon\u2019s top policy adviser Elbridge Colby, who has previously expressed concern that the U.S. would lose submarines to Australia at a critical time for military deterrence against China, will be a key figure in the review, examining the production rate of Virginia-class submarines, Marles said.",
      "\u201cIt is important that those production and sustainment rates are improved,\u201d he added.",
      "AUKUS would grow the U.S. and Australian defense industries and generate thousands of manufacturing jobs, Marles said in a statement.",
      "John Lee, an Australian Indo-Pacific expert at Washington\u2019s conservative Hudson Institute think tank, said the Pentagon review was \u201cprimarily an audit of American capability\u201d and whether it can afford to sell up to five nuclear-powered submarines when it is not meeting its own production targets.",
      "\u201cRelatedly, the low Australian defense spending and ambiguity as to how it might contribute to a Taiwan contingency is also a factor,\u201d Lee said.",
      "John Hamre, president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former senior Pentagon official, told a Lowy Institute seminar in Sydney on Thursday there is a perception in Washington that \u201cthe Albanese government has been supportive of AUKUS but not really leaning in on AUKUS,\u201d and that defense spending is part of this.",
      "Under the multi-stage pact, four U.S.-commanded Virginia submarines will be hosted at a Western Australian navy base on the Indian Ocean starting in 2027, which a senior U.S. Navy commander told Congress in April gives the U.S. a \u201cstraight shot to the South China Sea.\u201d",

      "The U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation accused Hamas of killing at least five of its Palestinian employees on Wednesday, as almost 40 other Palestinians were killed near the foundation\u2019s aid sites in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), whose aid delivery has been mired in controversy and violence, said in a statement that more than two dozen of its employees were traveling by bus to a distribution center west of the southern city of Khan Younis when it was \u201cbrutally attacked by Hamas\u201d around 10 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET), leaving at least five people dead and multiple others injured.",
      "The foundation said there was also \u201cfear that some of our team members may have been taken hostage.\u201d",
      "\u201cDespite this heinous attack, we will continue our mission to provide critical aid to the people of Gaza,\u201d it said.",
      "Hamas has not responded to the allegations and NBC News was unable to independently verify them.",
      "The GHF, which said it had been threatened by Hamas in recent days, began distributing aid in Gaza after Israel in mid-May eased its three-month total blockade on all supplies into the enclave, including food, medicine and other vital items, following an international outcry and warnings of famine from United Nations food experts.",
      "Despite the apparent loosening of the blockade, it is mostly the GHF that has been allowed to distribute aid \u2014 partly because it is supported by Israel and the U.S., which has raised doubts over its independence.",
      "GHF executive chairman Johnnie Moore has declined to reveal the organization\u2019s sources of funding.",
      "\u201cLike lots of private foundations, you know, it doesn\u2019t disclose its donors,\u201d he told NBC News in an exclusive interview.",
      "\u201cAnything that we do and anything that we say publicly is going to distract from the mission, and we have one mission, just one mission, which is to feed Gazans,\u201d said Moore, an evangelical Christian and former adviser to President Donald Trump who was appointed last week after his predecessor resigned citing \u201chumanitarian principles.\u201d",
      "Scrutiny of GHF has intensified in the past week as dozens of Palestinians were killed in and around its multiple aid sites in Gaza, which are in military zones and off-limits to independent media.",
      "Dr. Munir al-Barsh, director-general of the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, said 39 Palestinians had been shot and killed Wednesday as they sought aid from GHF.",
      "\u201cAid distribution sites have become death traps in the Gaza Strip,\u201d he said.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 200 Palestinians have been killed and about 1,500 have been injured in shootings near GHF sites, according to the health ministry, whose numbers are considered credible by the World Health Organization.",
      "While the GHF says there has been no violence in and around those distribution points, the Israeli military has previously acknowledged firing warning shots.",
      "On Wednesday, the U.N. said that even though people in Gaza were being killed and injured while trying to access food, Israel was still declining more than half of its requests to access critical supplies of fuel and to coordinate humanitarian movement inside the enclave.",
      "\u201cIf the population is inadequately supplied with the essentials for their survival, Israel must agree to humanitarian relief and facilitate it by all the means at its disposal,\u201d Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the U.N. secretary-general, said at a news briefing.",
      "The U.N. agency in Gaza, UNRWA, also renewed its criticism of GHF on Wednesday, saying in a post on X that the aid distribution model was \u201cputting lives at risk.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is also a distraction from the ongoing atrocities and a waste of resources,\u201d it said.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas carried out a terrorist attack on southern Israel in which at least 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage, according to an Israeli tally. Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas in response, launching a military campaign in Gaza that has so far killed more than 55,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry.",
      "The U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote Thursday on a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas, and the opening of all Israeli border crossings to allow for the delivery of aid. A similar resolution failed last week in the U.N. Security Council, where it was supported by 14 of the 15 members but vetoed by the United States because it was not tied to the release of the hostages.",
      "The U.N. vote comes a day after Israeli forces said they had recovered the bodies of two of the hostages inside Gaza, naming one of them as Yair Yaakov and not releasing the name of the other.",
