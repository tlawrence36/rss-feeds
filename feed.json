      "An arbitrator upheld five-year suspensions of the chief executives of Bad Bunny\u2019s sports representation firm for making improper inducements to players and cut the ban of the company\u2019s only certified baseball agent to three years",
      "NEW YORK -- An arbitrator upheld five-year suspensions of the chief executives of Bad Bunny\u2019s sports representation firm for making improper inducements to players and cut the ban of the company's only certified baseball agent to three years.",
      "Ruth M. Moscovitch issued the ruling Oct. 30 in a case involving Noah Assad, Jonathan Miranda and William Arroyo of Rimas Sports. The decision became become public Tuesday when the Major League Baseball Players Association filed a petition to confirm the 80-page decision in New York Supreme Court in Manhattan.",
      "The union issued a notice of discipline on April 10 revoking Arroyo's agent certification and denying certification to Assad and Miranda, citing a $200,000 interest-free loan and a $19,500 gift. It barred them from reapplying for five years and prohibited certified agents from associating with any of the three or their affiliated companies. Assad, Miranda and Arroyo then appealed the decision, and Moscovitch was jointly appointed as the arbitrator on June 17.",
      "Moscovitch said the union presented unchallenged evidence of \u201cuse of non-certified personnel to talk with and recruit players; use of uncertified staff to negotiate terms of players\u2019 employment; giving things of value \u2014 concert tickets, gifts, money \u2014 to non-client players; providing loans, money, or other things of value to non-clients as inducements; providing or facilitating loans without seeking prior approval or reporting the loans.\u201d",
      "\u201cI find MLBPA has met its burden to prove the alleged violations of regulations with substantial evidence on the record as a whole,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThere can be no doubt that these are serious violations, both in the number of violations and the range of misconduct. As MLBPA executive director Anthony Clark testified, he has never seen so many violations of so many different regulations over a significant period of time.\u201d",
      "Mar\u00eda de Lourdes Mart\u00ednez, a spokeswoman for Rimas Sports, said the company declined to comment. Arroyo did not respond to a text message seeking comment.",
      "Moscovitch held four in-person hearings from Sept. 30 to Oct. 7 and three on video from Oct. 10-16.",
      "\u201cWhile these kinds of gifts are standard in the entertainment business, under the MLBPA regulations, agents and agencies simply are not permitted to give them to non-clients,\u201d she said.",
      "Arroyo's clients included Mets catcher Francisco Alvarez and teammate Ronny Mauricio.",
      "\u201cWhile it is true, as MLBPA alleges, that Mr. Arroyo violated the rules by not supervising uncertified personnel as they recruited players, he was put in that position by his employers,\u201d Moscovitch wrote. \u201cThe regulations hold him vicariously liable for the actions of uncertified personnel at the agency. The reality is that he was put in an impossible position: the regulations impose on him supervisory authority over all of the uncertified operatives at Rimas, but in reality, he was their underling, with no authority over anyone.\u201d",
      "In its petition to the court, the MLBPA asked the court to confirm Moscovitch's decision and to order the three individuals to pay the union $400,000, the amount they were fined by the union, plus interest dating from Moscovitch's decision.",

      "The background check showed that a judge issued a warrant in December over a 2018 citation for operating a vehicle without proof of insurance. Because of the outstanding warrant, Nelly was arrested and searched. That's when the officer allegedly found four ecstasy pills. Police had sought a charge of felony possession of a controlled substance.",
      "Meanwhile, the insurance charge has been resolved. Rosenblum said it was dismissed after Nelly provided proof that he has car insurance.",

      "Amano's prolific career across media \u2014 from his start as an animator at the Tatsunoko studio at age 15 to recent work including posters celebrating Puccini\u2019s centenary \u2014 reflects his notion that an artist is someone with many talents.",

      "The exhibition also includes more recent, and perhaps lesser-known, works: an illustration of a model for the January 2020 issue of Vogue Italia, its only cover ever not to feature a live model; an album cover for David Bowie featuring the artist and his wife, Iman; and the Candy Girl series of Pop Art and manga-inspired paintings on aluminum.",

Amano does not sell any work that has not been specifically commissioned, Viola said, and he had not seen many pieces since storing them decades ago.",
      "\u201cEvery fan would immediately recognize his style,\u201d Viola said. \u201cTrue, it is full of influences. Whoever has a little background in art history would find art nouveau, Klimt, bites of Renaissance, or the Ukiyo-e and the traditional Japanese art prints techniques. But all of this is revisited in a way that Amano\u2019s woman is clearly Amano\u2019s woman.\"",
      "Trademarks include the lightly drawn eyebrows, smears of color and the brush strokes of acrylic paint, Viola said.",

      "A nine-person delegation had traveled to Norway this week to collect the items. Four of them spent the night at the Oslo museum, alongside the remains as part of a ritual ceremony to take back the spirits of the remains.",
      "\u201cFirst one must awaken the spirits, and then speak to them in our original language. Food is then prepared to eat a meal with them, where the smell of the food goes to the spirits,\u201d a member of the delegation, Laura Tarita Rapu Alarc\u00f3n, told NTB.",
      "\u201cIt is important that those who own the culture are involved in the process,\" Liv Heyerdahl was quoted as saying by NTB. \"Of course these remains should be returned, and it feels right because they belong to the Rapa Nui.\u201d",

      "Dolly Parton\u2019s musical story starts further back than most might expect \u2014 to the British Isles of the 1600s",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Dolly Parton's musical story starts further back than most might expect \u2014 to the British Isles of the 1600s. That's where her ancestors hail from, eventually landing in the hollers of East Tennessee and its familiar mountain ranges, bringing their songs with them. A new album out Friday, \u201cSmoky Mountain DNA: Family, Faith & Fables\u201d credited to Dolly Parton and Family, explores the great legacy of the Partons and the Owens, her maternal family, as she performs alongside five generations of family members.",
      "\u201cMy grandpa used to say when I got famous, he said, \u2018Well, she came out crying in the key of D,'\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cI think we all did.\u201d",
      "\u201cSmoky Mountain DNA\u201d was an inevitable labor of love, one that taught Parton more about her family line.",
      "\u201cWe're kind of like the Carter family. We go back generations,\u201d Parton said. (The Carters are widely considered the first family of country music.)",
      "\u201cI would imagine this will be my favorite album,\u201d Parton said. \u201cThis really involves, you know, my grandmas and my grandpas, my uncles and my aunts and all the people going all the way back that had the biggest influence on my life. The ones that I remember from being little, and it even goes on farther back from there.\u201d",
      "Richie Owens \u2014 Parton's cousin, who she describes as \u201cthe family historian\u201d \u2014 produced \u201cSmoky Mountain DNA.\" He says that the family has long been archivists, but the idea to curate a record started around 2010 and 2011, delayed by a few deaths. Then, right before the pandemic, Parton approached Owens and said, \u201cwe need to get together and start trying to get all this information (and) material together,\u201d he recalls. Because Owens had already been working on a family story, specifically tied to his grandfather's fiddle, they teamed up for what is now \u201cSmoky Mountain DNA.\u201d",
      "For some of the new songs, Owens utilized digital technology \u2014 what he compares to the AI-assist on the last new Beatles song, \u201cNow and Then,\u201d used to extract John Lennon\u2019s voice from an old demo for a new composition \u2014 for \u201crestoration work.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith the technology that\u2019s been available, we were able to achieve wonderful, miraculous situations where we were able to go in and build new music tracks\" from previous vocal recordings of deceased family members, he says. It was about cleaning up the crackles and noise \u2014 not about creating doctored recordings.",
      "\u201cI got very, very emotional many times when I was singing, especially with the ones that have already passed and just remembering their voices, hearing them,\" Parton says. \"It just kind of threw me in to a deep emotional place, just like I had them back again. So, the whole thing was very heart wrenching. But it was really amazing and very restoring. It had so many colors of emotions in it.\u201d",
      "Parton and Owens started curating the album by finding songs that she had co-written with deceased family members \u2014 or those of deceased family members that she had recorded previously. Others were hits and integral to the story of their heritage, and the songs recorded with younger members of the family \u2014 including those born in the 21st century \u2014 included more Parton co-writes, but with styles that felt true to each person.",
      "That's one of the many reasons the album, which is centered in country, folk, hymns and bluegrass, spans a wide swath of genres, including a kind of soulful R&B performance (like on \"Not Bad\" with Shelley Ren\u00e1), swamp pop (\"I Just Stopped By\" with Parton's late uncle Robert \u201cJohn Henry\u201d Owens), various rock genres (\u201cWhere Will We Live Tomorrow\u201d with Rebecca Seaver and \u201cCrazy in Love with You\" with Richie Owens' daughter Estelle).",
      "The album revisits Parton's own career, too: There is a delightful cover of \u201cPuppy Love,\u201d originally recorded when she was 13, now sang with some of the youngest members of her family.",
      "\u201cSome of the little ones,\u201d she says, \u201cremind me so much of myself when I was young and playing the guitar.\u201d",
      "\u201cSmoky Mountain DNA\u201d could only end with one song: \u201cWhen It's Family,\u201d originally co-written by Parton and released as \u201cFamily\u201d on her 1991 album \u201cEagle When She Flies.\u201d It's a moving song about acceptance, Parton singing: \u201cSome are preachers, some are gay / Some are addicts, drunks and strays / But not a one is turned away / When it\u2019s family.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t condemn nor condone anything. I just love and accept people where they are for who they are,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t judge because I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019ve got some of everybody in my immediate family, whether they be trans, whether they be gay, whether they be drag queens or whatever. I mean, we\u2019ve got drunks, we\u2019ve got strays, we've got drug addicts \u2014 you always have that when you got a family as big as ours. And you love them all.\u201d",
      "So, what about all the material that isn't included here? \u201cI'm sure we'll be doing compilation albums,\u201d says Parton. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a docuseries as well, taking all the music back to the old country with a lot of our relatives over there that are still singing all those old songs that got brought over here...

      "BANGKOK -- In case you can\u2019t get enough of the little pygmy hippo Moo Deng from Thailand, there's now an official song featuring the internet's favorite baby animal \u2014 released in four languages for her global fans.",
      "The upbeat 50-second song \u201cMoodeng Moodeng,\" available in Thai, English, Chinese and Japanese versions, features simple lyrics like \u201cMoo Deng Moo Deng, boing boing boing/ Mommy mommy, play with me.\u201d Its music video consists of short clips of the baby hippo bouncing, playing with her keeper or hanging out with her mom Jona.",
      "The catchy number was produced and written by well-known Thai composer Mueanphet Ammara, and released by one of Thailand's largest music companies, GMM Music.",
      "Moo Deng \u2014 the name literally means \u201cbouncy pork,\u201d a type of meatball, in Thai \u2014 became a global phenomenon just a month after she was unveiled on Facebook by the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand\u2019s southern Chon Buri province.",

      "Zoo director Narongwit Chodchoi has said the increasing income from Moo Deng will help its breeding programs for many endangered species like the pygmy hippopotamus, which is threatened by poaching and loss of habitat. The species is native to West Africa and there are only 2,000-3,000 of them left in the wild.",
      "The zoo sits on 800 hectares (almost 2,000 acres) of land and is home to more than 2,000 animals.",
      "All four versions of the Moo Deng song are available on YouTube and streaming platforms including Spotify and Apple Music."

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Daniele Rustioni will become just the third principal guest conductor of the Metropolitan Opera in its nearly century-and-a-half history, leading at least two productions each season starting in 2025-26 as a No. 2 to music director Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin.",
      "Rustioni agreed to a three-year term, the company announced Wednesday. He is to helm revivals of \u201cDon Giovanni\u201d and \u201cAndrea Ch\u00e9nier\u201d next season, Puccini\u2019s \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me\u201d and \u201cTosca\u201d in 2026-27 and a new production of Verdi\u2019s \u201cSimon Boccanegra,\u201d possibly in 2027-28.",
      "\u201cThis all started because of the chemistry between the orchestra and me and the chorus and me,\u201d Rustioni said. \u201cIt may be the best opera orchestra on the planet in terms of energy and joy of playing and commitment.\u201d",
      "N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin has conducted four-to-five productions per season and will combine Rustioni for about 40% of a Met schedule that currently includes 18 productions per season, down from 28 in 2007-08.",
      "The music director role has changed since James Levine led about 10 productions a season in the mid-1980s. N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin has been Met music director since 2018-19 and also has held the roles with the Philadelphia Orchestra since 2012-13 and of Montreal\u2019s Orchestre M\u00e9tropolitain since 2010.",
      "\u201cMusic directors today typically don\u2019t spend as much time as they did in past decades because music directors typically are very busy fulfilling more than one fulltime job,\u201d Met general manager Peter Gelb said. \u201cIn the case of Yannick, he has three, plus being very much in-demand as a guest conductor of the leading orchestras like Berlin and Vienna. To know we have somebody who\u2019s at the very highest level of the world, which I think Daniele is, to be available on a consistent basis is something that will provide artistic surety to the Met.\u201d",
      "A 41-year-old Italian, Rustioni made his Met debut leading a revival of Verdi\u2019s \u201cAida\u201d in 2017 and conducted new productions in a pair of New Year\u2019s Eve galas, Verdi\u2019s \u201cRigoletto\u201d in 2021 and Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen\u201d last December. He took over a 2021 revival of Mozart\u2019s \u201cLe Nozze di Figaro\u201d on short notice when N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin withdrew for a sabbatical and Rustioni also led Verdi\u2019s \u201cFalstaff\u201d in 2023.",
      "\u201cI dared to try tempos in this repertoire that they know very well,\u201d Rustioni said of the orchestra. \u201cI offered and tried to convince them in some places to try to find more intimacy and to offer the music with a little bit more breathing here and there, maybe in a different space than they are used to,\u201d",
      "Valery Gergiev was the Met\u2019s principal guest conductor from 1997-98 through 2008-09, leading Russian works for about half of his performances. Fabio Luisi assumed the role in April 2010 and was elevated to principal conductor in September 2011 when Levine had spinal surgery. The role has been unfilled since Luisi left at the end of the 2016-17 season.",
      "Rustioni lives in London with his wife, violinist Francesca Dego, and 7-month-old daughter Sophia Charlotte. He has been music director of the Lyon Opera since 2017-18, a term that concludes this season. He was music director of the Ulster Orchestra in Northern Ireland from 2019-20 through the 2023-24 season and was the first principal guest conductor of Munich\u2019s Bavarian State Opera from 2021-23.",
      "Rustioni made his London Symphony Orchestra debut this month in a program that included his wife and has upcoming debuts with the New York Philharmonic (Jan. 8), Detroit Symphony Orchestra (Jan. 16) and San Diego Symphony (Jan. 24)."

      "The rhythms of bustling, working-class Mumbai are brought to vivid life in \u201cAll We Imagine as Light.\u201d",
      "The rhythms of bustling, working-class Mumbai are brought to vivid life in \u201cAll We Imagine as Light.\u201d The stunning narrative debut of filmmaker Payal Kapadia explores the lives of three women in the city whose existence is mostly transit and work. Even that isn\u2019t always enough to get by and pay the rent. One of the women, a widow, recently retired from working her whole life at a city hospital, Parvaty (Chhaya Kadam), is even facing eviction.",
      "The other two, roommates and co-workers in the maternity ward are in different parts of life. Prabha (Kani Kusruti) has a husband from an arranged marriage who she doesn\u2019t see and rarely speaks to. His life, we learn, is in Germany. She gets an occasional, ominous physical reminder of his existence in objects, like a fancy rice maker, that arrives one day. But she carries the weight of her arrangement everywhere, an invisible anchor on her being.",
      "Anu (Divya Prabha) is even younger, trying to figure out what her life is going to look like and already in something of an impossible situation: She\u2019s fallen in love with Shiz (Hridhu Haroon), who is Muslim. She\u2019s Hindu. But in a city of over 20 million, a secret relationship can have some room to grow. Yes, they\u2019re hiding this from their families, a burden in and of itself, but in the night markets with the city glimmering and moving around them, they\u2019re able to just be.",
      "Prabha is a little judgmental of her more carefree (possibly careless) younger housemate. More companions by circumstance than friends exactly, these women have different ideas about life, but we watch as they grow closer and understand one another more. Prabha even allows herself to go for a walk with a doctor who is clearly interested in her. A small act of agency and rebellion against her circumstances.",
      "These are not easy lives, either: Their apartment is drab and small, their activities mundane, their conversations ordinary. But even as hard as it is to exist in a place that not only doesn\u2019t love you back, it barely even notices you, something is always happening. How can anything be truly dull in a place always thrumming with life? Far from being a maudlin, bleak affair, Kapadia makes the banal cinematic. There is a dreamlike incandescence to it all, not a rejection of reality so much as a poetic detachment from it.",
      "And like a dream, this is a film that washes over you. The mechanisms of the plot are not really the point, we\u2019re just moving in time with Anu and Prabha. And while Anu\u2019s forbidden love and Prabha\u2019s existential longing will surely come to a head at some point in their journey, the most urgent of realities is Parvaty\u2019s unexpected housing crisis. The city is making way for more luxury high rises and pricing out the people who make everything run and work. So, they go to the sea.",
      "Anu and Prabha accompany Parvaty on her move back to her small coastal village in the final act. Suddenly it feels like everyone can breathe. It may be a little clich\u00e9, but you really feel it in your bones as an audience member. Our characters get a release: Anu can have a truly private rendezvous with Shiz; Prabha gets to be seen, too.",
      "\u201cAll We Imagine as Light,\u201d in theaters Friday, has been widely celebrated since its Cannes premiere, and Kapadia heralded as a major new talent to watch, which is just as it should be. The film is a reminder of the transcendent power of cinema, even, and perhaps especially, when not all that much is happening.",
      "\u201cAll We Imagine as Light,\u201d a Sideshow/Janus Films release in select theaters Friday, has not been rated by the Motion Picture Association. Running time: 118 minutes. Four stars out of four."

      "James Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G",
      "For the late James Bond producer Albert \u201cCuddy\u201d Broccoli, receiving the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award was a true high point in his career. He said as much accepting the prize, a non-competitive honorary Oscar, at the Academy Awards in 1982.",
      "Roger Moore presented it to him that night while his family in the audience looked on, including his daughter, Barbara Broccoli, who was reduced to a puddle of tears, and her brother, Michael G. Wilson.",
      "\u201cHe always treasured it,\u201d Barbara Broccoli said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt was the most important physical possession he had.\u201d",
      "The award, then a bust of the inimitable \u201cboy wonder\u201d producer of Hollywood\u2019s early years, sat on his mantlepiece for many years. Now, Broccoli, 64, and Wilson, 82, are following in \u201cCubby\u2019s\u201d footsteps as the 40th recipients, collecting the Oscar statuette Sunday at the 15th Governors Awards in Hollywood.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a rare honor, and I think that makes it extra special,\u201d Wilson said.",
      "Since its inception in 1937, the award has only been given 39 times, celebrating creative producers for a lifetime of quality films. The roster of honorees is a who\u2019s-who of Hollywood legends from David O. Selznick and Walt Disney to Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. And only once before Broccoli has it gone to a woman, Kathleen Kennedy in 2018.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very humbling,\" Broccoli said. \u201cI think of so many people who have come before us, so many people I wish had been given the honor who aren\u2019t with us anymore.\u201d",
      "Though she is quick to point out all the others she thinks more deserving, the fact is that no one quite occupies the space that Broccoli and Wilson do as the guardians of the Bond franchise, one of the longest running film series in history.",
      "Since Cubby and Harry Saltzman purchased the rights to Ian Fleming\u2019s novels in 1961, the 25 films released by EON productions have grossed over $7.6 billion at the global box office. And despite all odds, the major creative decisions, including who gets to be Bond, have stayed in the family through massive changes in the business, including new corporate overlords.",
      "For many years, EON split profits with MGM, which financed and distributed the movies. But that got slightly more complicated in May 2021, several months before the last Daniel Craig Bond, \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d opened, when Amazon purchased MGM for $8.45 billion. The siblings continue to own 50% of Bond and maintain creative control over its future. They're also adamant about theatrical.",
      "\u201cPeople are playing it very safe. I think in times of crisis like this, you've got to be brave,\" Broccoli said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a new era in the movie business, so we\u2019re trying to figure it out.\"",
      "Broccoli has been entrenched in the world of Bond her entire life. She was only a year old when the deal was signed and spent much of her youth on sets around the world. One of her earliest memories was filming \u201cYou Only Live Twice\u201d in Japan. She was 6.",
      "Her father\u2019s passion for the films was infectious and she followed him into the business, learning the trade from the ground up. Though she didn\u2019t quite start without connections, as Cubby had when he came to Hollywood in 1934, she never shied away from doing \u201cthe dirty work.\u201d During one indie shoot, she remembers scrubbing toilets before the wrap party.",
      "Wilson came into the family when his mother married Cubby in 1959. With two actor parents, he didn\u2019t imagine a career in entertainment for himself. Instead, he pursued law. Then Cubby asked for his advice during a dispute, Wilson \u201ccaught the bug\u201d and never looked back.",
      "Cubby passed the torch to the kids in 1995; he died the next year. Since then, Wilson has operated as the business affairs person and Broccoli as more of a creative and practical producer. Their different skills and interests were compatible.",
      "\u201cI think it worked out pretty well,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe were a good team.\u201d",
      "During their tenure, they bid farewell to the Pierce Brosnan era and welcomed Daniel Craig as the seventh Bond; firm in their decision, despite the immense backlash. They also produced non-Bond films, like \u201cTill.\u201d",
      "But the spotlight on them has intensified as the world awaits official word on Bond No. 8. People are always playing the guessing game with the role, whether it was the long-running fan campaign for Idris Elba or any number of promising young actors who pop on the scene. The latest, stickiest rumor is Aaron Taylor-Johnson, but Broccoli and Wilson are staying tight-lipped on even a general timeline for when an announcement might come.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big decision,\u201d she said.",
      "They\u2019ve teased some things: It will be a man. He\u2019ll likely be in his 30s. Whiteness is not a given. And whoever says yes is doing so with the expectation of at least a decade\u2019s worth of films. One thing is certain: There's going to be a period of adjustment for audiences in the transition. Every Bond had its detractors, especially at the start. Broccoli saw firsthand the vitriol of the internet era when Craig was cast (\"anti-Daniel nonsense,\" she called it.)",
      "But when people finally saw \u201cCasino Royale,\u201d the sentiment shifted to love. The five Craig Bonds are the highest grossing in the series, not adjusting for inflation. It remains one of her proudest moments. And a new Bond means new opportunity.",
      "\u201cEvery time we cast a new actor, the films change. It\u2019s the excitement of a new Bond, a new direction,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cEvery one of these people who took on the role offered something new and different.\u201d",
      "Plus, they're playing the long game with Bond, producing and cinema in general. And not losing sight of the Cubby spirit.",
      "\u201cHe always said films were like the circus coming to town,\u201d Broccoli said. \u201cYou set up your tent, everybody comes and you create magic. It's all about pleasing the audience, making sure that people get their bang for their buck.\u201d"

      "TORONTO -- Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s performance in \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d as a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender affirmation surgery to become a woman has brought her global acclaim and set Gasc\u00f3n on a path that may make her the first openly transgender actor ever nominated for an Oscar. But on this morning, she\u2019s feeling contemplative.",
      "\u201cI woke up with such a philosophical streak,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n says, smiling. \u201cIn life, everything can be good or bad. We are a mix of so many things. There are things that make you happy and instead they make you sad, or the other way around.\u201d",
      "The dichotomies of life are a fitting subject for Jacques Audiard\u2019s \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d a film that puts just about every genre \u2014 musical, crime thriller, melodrama \u2014 into a grandiose mixer, and, by sheer nerve, manages to coalesce into one of the year\u2019s most memorable movie experiences. \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d which began streaming Wednesday on Netflix, is widely expected to be a best picture nominee.",
      "At the center of the \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d phenomenon \u2013 which began with a barn-storming premiere at the Cannes Film Festival \u2014 is Gasc\u00f3n who plays both the menacing cartel kingpin Manitas and the woman who emerges after Manitas fakes his own death, Emilia P\u00e9rez. Years later, Emilia contacts the lawyer who facilitated her transition (Zoe Salda\u00f1a) to her reunite with her wife (Selena Gomez) and their children.",
      "The wild swings of \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d \u2013 a movie that has earned comparisons to both \u201cSicario\u201d and \u201cMrs. Doubtfire\u201d \u2013 wouldn\u2019t be possible without Gasc\u00f3n. In Cannes, she and her co-stars shared in the best actress prize, which Gasc\u00f3n accepted.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been insulted, denigrated, subjected to a lot of violence without even knowing why,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n said that evening. \u201cI think this is award is so much more than anyone could imagine.\u201d",
      "Now, Gasc\u00f3n is widely forecast to be nominated for best actress at the Academy Awards. At a time when trans rights in the U.S. are the subject of intense political debate, Gasc\u00f3n is on the cusp of making trans history. (Only cisgender actors have previously been Oscar nominated for playing trans roles.) But, when Gasc\u00f3n sat down for an interview a few hours before the premiere of \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, she was more inclined to gently muse about what might be in store for her.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a little like Nostradamus. I like to think about what can happen. But at the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n says. \u201cIf it does happen, I would be so grateful. It would be a beautiful thing. But if it doesn\u2019t, whatever. I\u2019d go back to my old life. I\u2019ll do my grocery shopping. I\u2019ll play with cats. I\u2019ll see my family. Maybe I\u2019ll do other jobs and people will like those jobs.",
      "\u201cI like to go lightly in my life,\u201d she adds, smiling.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n, 52, is Spanish and lives in Mexico. She spoke through an interpreter but understands English enough to sometimes giggle and shake her head at her own words while they're being translated. She was a regular in Mexican telenovels before transitioning in 2018.",
      "\u201cAll people that live in a body that they don\u2019t feel matches who they truly are do suffer one way or the other. But in my case, I feel like I handled it quite well,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n says. \u201cI always tried to be happy with the life I had, even before my transition. Maybe I chose to do this job as an actor because I wasn\u2019t quite happy with my life with the way I was before, so I wanted to experiment with other lives.\u201d",
      "Playing Emilia P\u00e9rez was in many ways a giant leap for Gasc\u00f3n. She had to change her voice (she uses a Mexican accent in the film), work on singing and movement, and change her posture. But there were also things Gasc\u00f3n shared with her character. Gasc\u00f3n has a 13-year-old daughter from a marriage pre-transition with whom she remains close.",
      "\u201cWe all find it hard to accept the loss of the people we love. You constantly try to get back your loved ones,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I tried to implement in the character. This is what does unite me with the character \u2014 doing everything possible to get back the people you love. It\u2019s been a constant in my life. And sometimes it\u2019s impossible.\u201d",
      "Audiard, the protean French filmmaker, has long specialized in films of transformation and metamorphosis, including \u201cA Prophet,\u201d \u201cDheepan\u201d and \u201cRust and Bone.\u201d He initially balked, though, at having Gasc\u00f3n play Manitas as well as Emilia. For Gasc\u00f3n, it would mean returning to a male persona, something Audiard hesitated to ask of her. But Gasc\u00f3n insisted. To her, the only kind of character she doesn\u2019t want to play is a boring one.",
      "\u201cIf I was asked to play Abraham Lincoln tomorrow, I\u2019d love it. Bring it on! For me, the farther the character is from me in real life, the better,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n says.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve met actresses who had a hard time stepping back and going through stuff that was part of their past. They would cry and take it badly. Never for me.\u201d",
      "In conversation, Gasc\u00f3n seems still tickled by the whole experience. She\u2019s delighted that many people don\u2019t realize Manitas is played by her. She laughs at how a movie about a violent drug lord, someone who\u2019d normally be a villain, should inspire so much empathy. And for someone with a very big spotlight on her, she seems remarkably at peace.",
      "\u201cIf I were asked to do my life over again, I\u2019d probably do it exactly as it was, with all of it,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n says. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful that one gets to experience with these two poles, these two extremes. In a way, it\u2019d be wonderful if all of us had access to this. Having done that allowed to me to better understand so many things that weren\u2019t so clear to me before. In the end, what I realized is that we\u2019re all the same.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has stunned the Pentagon and the broader defense world by nominating Fox News host Pete Hegseth to be defense secretary",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump stunned the Pentagon and the broader defense world by nominating Fox News host Pete Hegseth to serve as his defense secretary, tapping someone largely inexperienced and untested on the global stage to take over the world's largest and most powerful military.",
      "The news was met with bewilderment and worry among many in Washington as Trump passed on a number of established national security heavy-hitters and chose an Army National Guard major well known in conservative circles as a co-host of Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends Weekend.\u201d",
      "While some Republican lawmakers had a muted response to the announcement, others called his combat experience an asset or said he was \u201ctremendously capable.\u201d",
      "Hegseth's choice could bring sweeping changes to the military. He has made it clear on his show and in interviews that, like Trump, he is opposed to \u201cwoke\u201d programs that promote equity and inclusion. He also has questioned the role of women in combat and advocated pardoning service members charged with war crimes.",
      "In June, at a rally in Las Vegas, Trump encouraged his supporters to buy Hegseth\u2019s book and said that if he won the presidency, \"The woke stuff will be gone within a period of 24 hours. I can tell you.\u201d",
      "The 44-year-old Hegseth, a staunch conservative who embraces Trump's \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies, has pushed for making the military more lethal. During an interview on \u201cThe Shawn Ryan Show\u201d podcast, he said allowing women to serve in combat hurts that effort.",
      "\u201cEverything about men and women serving together makes the situation more complicated, and complication in combat, that means casualties are worse,\u201d Hegseth said.",
      "And while he said diversity in the military is a strength, he said it was because minority and white men can perform similarly, but the same isn't true for women.",
      "By opening combat slots to women, \u201cwe\u2019ve changed the standards in putting them there, which means you\u2019ve changed the capability of that unit,\u201d Hegseth said in the podcast interview.",
      "Since then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter opened all combat roles to women in 2016, women have successfully passed the military's grueling tests to become Green Berets and Army Rangers, and the Naval Special Warfare's test to serve as a combatant-craft crewman \u2014 the boat operators who transport Navy SEALs and conduct their own classified missions at sea.",
      "While Trump lauded Hegseth as \u201ctough, smart and a true believer in America First,\u201d others were quick to point to the TV personality's lack of experience. Some suggested he could be Pentagon chief in name only as the Trump White House runs the department.",
      "A number of other names floated as possible defense choices had included Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee; retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg; Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa; and Robert Wilkie, a former Pentagon official who was head of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Trump's first term.",
      "\u201cThere is reason for concern that this is not a person who is a serious enough policymaker, serious enough policy implementer, to do a successful job,\u201d said Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee.",
      "Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Hegseth's lack of senior national security experience makes it more difficult to get Senate confirmation.",
      "\u201cI think Trump was tired of fighting with his secretaries of defense and picked one who would be loyal to him,\u201d Cancian said.",
      "Military officials said the choice came out of the blue. A senior military officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, said Hegseth's selection is raising concerns about whether he has the practical experience to manage a large department with an enormous budget.",
      "The Defense Department has a budget exceeding $800 billion, with about 1.3 million active-duty troops and another 1.4 million in the National Guard, Reserves and civilian employees based worldwide.",
      "If confirmed, Hegseth would face a daunting array of global crises, from the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine and the expanding alliance between Russia and North Korea to the growing competition with China. There is also the need to upgrade the complex U.S. missile and nuclear defense apparatus and ensure the defense industry can keep up with America's need for weapons systems.",
      "Smith said that while Hegseth's combat experience is a plus, running the Pentagon requires a lot of other skill sets, and his nomination will need some time for consideration.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan? What are you going to do? ... How can you assure us that that lack of experience, you know, isn\u2019t going to make it impossible for you to do the job?\u201d Smith said. \u201cI think those are questions that need to be answered over the next couple of months.\u201d",
      "Even some Republicans in the Senate, who would vote on his nomination, had a subdued response.",
      "North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis called the choice \u201cinteresting.\u201d Indiana Sen. Todd Young, who served in the Marine Corps, said, \u201cI don\u2019t know much about his background or his vision, so I look forward to learning more.\u201d",
      "North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven said he\u2019s not surprised that Trump chose Hegseth because Trump is \u201cclose to him and likes him and trusts him.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe guy\u2019s obviously tremendously capable, a great communicator,\" Hoeven said. \"I look forward to getting to know him better.\u201d",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Hegseth brings a lot to the table and will be \"reform-minded in the areas that need reform.\u201d",
      "According to the Army, Hegseth served in the Guard from 2002 to 2021 as an infantry officer, but is not currently serving. He deployed to Iraq in 2005, Afghanistan in 2011 and to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in 2004. He has two Bronze Stars.",
      "He has been a contributor since 2014 for Fox News, developing a friendship with Trump, who made regular appearances on his show. He is the author of \u201cThe War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith Pete at the helm, America\u2019s enemies are on notice \u2014 Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cNobody fights harder for the Troops, and Pete will be a courageous and patriotic champion of our \u2018Peace through Strength\u2019 policy.\u201d",

      "CHANGCHUN, China -- Crouch through the small metal door and walk down the dark tunnel, and even before you step into the abandoned air raid shelter, the air reverberates with pounding techno beats. Young Chinese holding booze and cigarettes shake and sway in a red-lit passageway, below a big screen rolling through quotations from Chairman Mao.",
      "This is an underground rave in China, part of a subculture growing in hidden corners of the nation\u2019s cities, even as its political and cultural mainstream grow increasingly controlled, staid and predictable.",
      "For Chinese ravers, these gatherings \u2014 often called \u201cye di,\u201d or \u201cwild dances\u201d \u2014 not only offer a rare space for unfettered fun, but signal resistance to the narrowly prescribed future a rigid society expects for them.",
      "By day, Xing Long works in the office of a state-owned company in Changchun, an industrial city in China's northeastern rust belt region.",
      "By night, he\u2019s a DJ and underground rave organizer, a side gig that offers an escape from the humdrum of reviewing corporate contracts.",
      "\u201cMy job cannot make me feel I fulfilled my values,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing to work is like executing a prewritten program.\u201d",
      "Chinese young people face intense pressure and high expectations from the society around them. In recent years, facing bleak economic prospects, Chinese youth culture has been swept by a series of viral slang terms to describe frustration and hopelessness: \u201c 996 \u201d \u2014 the brutal 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week work schedule many companies ask of employees. \u201cInvolution\u201d \u2014 an endless treadmill of pointless competition that fresh graduates face. \u201c Lying flat \u201d \u2014 the growing trend among young people of giving up all ambition and aiming to do as little as possible.",
      "Techno dance parties are an escape from all that for people like Xing. Every time he walks into a rave, the 31-year-old said, his brain \u201cjolts awake like a bang.\u201d",
      "Xing first learned about techno music from a documentary made by the American media company Vice.",
      "\u201cMy eyes brightened up when I heard it,\" he said. \"I should\u2019ve listened to this kind of music earlier.\u201d",
      "Xing began going to raves in Shenzhen, a southern city with a population of 17 million, but when he moved home in 2021 he realized no one else was organizing them.",
      "\u201cI want this city to have an underground techno music scene,\" he said. \"I want to listen to it myself, so I want to make it happen.\u201d",
      "Xing said that the underground techno scene fascinated him because it's \u201creal\u201d even if not perfect, bad, not in the right order, or broken.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a beautiful thing that was deliberately produced into a mold to present to the mainstream.\u201d",
      "In recent years, space for culture and creativity has been shrinking in China as the authorities have ramped up censorship of concerts, shows, and other cultural events. Comedians have been silenced after joking about topics considered politically sensitive. A growing number of independent bookstores and creative spaces have shut down under pressure, while state-sanctioned media promotes uplifting, often saccharine narratives.",
      "Yet underground raves are free from all those limitations because they sprout in gray zones. Hidden from public view, they skirt formal approval processes, neither supported nor suppressed by the state.",
      "Feng Zhe, 27, a rave organizer in Shenyang, a northeastern city about 400 miles from Beijing, said raves are about \u201crefusing to be disciplined by society.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is probably not how the world functions nowadays,\u201d he said, adding that societies want to make people follow their rules and be useful but \"underground culture is useless.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost people are going to be repressed,\" Feng said.",
      "But for most rave organizers, the real meaning of underground rave culture is simply having fun. Loong Wu, a 26-year-old art student, started organizing raves in 2021 during COVID-19 lockdowns out of boredom.",
      "\u201cMy original intention was just to break through the boredom,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you are truly enjoying it, you don\u2019t think about meanings.\u201d",
      "On one recent Saturday night, civil servants, students, an ex-firefighter, girls with dyed hair, and a man with a full face mask and goggles filed into a bar tucked behind a flower shop in downtown Changchun to attend one of Xing\u2019s raves.",
      "They danced to fast-paced industrial techno spun by Du Jizhe, a local part-time DJ who works in HR by day.",
      "He said it\u2019s the natural soundtrack of auto manufacturing cities like Changchun and Detroit, which prides itself on being the birthplace of techno. For Du, techno evokes childhood memories of the auto factory where his father worked.",
      "\u201cTechno is basically industrial noise like hammering and mechanical sounds,\u201d Du said \u201cThese noises exert a subtle influence on people\u2019s ears in industrial cities.\u201d",
      "Chen Xiangyu, a fashion student in an oversized black t-shirt with hair dyed blond, a black leather choker, a lip piercing, and smoky eye makeup, said raves are a pure release.",
      "\u201cThe first time I came, I thought to myself, I don\u2019t know anyone, no one knows me, so nobody\u2019s paying any attention to how I dance, so long as I\u2019m happy, it\u2019s all good,\" she said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t care too much about what others think.\u201d",
      "Even at raves, illegal drugs are rarely seen in China, but promoters still face risks from authorities who have little patience for unapproved social gatherings.",
      "Advertisements promoting raves are often cryptic, with only a date, a DJ line-up, and the cost of admission. Sometimes, the location won\u2019t be revealed until an hour ahead of the party. Some organizers require guests to cover their phone\u2019s camera with a sticker.",
      "Loong Wu said her requirements for a rave spot were no CCTV cameras, no security, and no nearby residents. Even those aren't a guarantee \u2014 local police once busted one of her raves in an industrial port.",
      "\u201cIt was pathetic how few such places exist in the city,\u201d she said.",
      "Frustrated with how hard it was to find a good rave spot, she once organized a public party where she put her DJ equipment on a cart and pushed it through city streets as revelers danced alongside.",
      "\u201cRestrictions exist for sure, but that\u2019s exactly why we need to create our own scene,\u201d she said. \u201cWe always need \u2018wild dances.\u2019 We always need to dance outside of set rules.\u201d",

      "Professors at other colleges and universities have also incorporated Beyonc\u00e9 into their courses or offered classes on the superstar.",
      "Brooks sees Beyonc\u00e9 in a league of her own, crediting the singer with using her platform to \u201cspectacularly elevate awareness of and engagement with grassroots, social, political ideologies and movements\u201d in her music, including the Black Lives Matter movement and Black feminist commentary.",
      "\u201cCan you think of any other pop musician who\u2019s invited an array of grassroots activists to participate in these longform multimedia album projects that she\u2019s given us since 2013,\" asked Brooks. She noted how Beyonc\u00e9 has also tried to tell a story through her music about \u201crace and gender and sexuality in the context of the 400-year-plus history of African-American subjugation.\"",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a fascinating artist because historical memory, as I often refer to it, and also the kind of impulse to be an archive of that historical memory, it's just all over her work,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cAnd you just don\u2019t see that with any other artist.\u201d",
      "Brooks previously taught a well-received class on Black women in popular music culture at Princeton University and discovered her students were most excited about the portion dedicated to Beyonc\u00e9. She expects her class at Yale will be especially popular, but she's trying to keep the size of the group relatively small.",
      "For those who manage to snag a seat next semester, they shouldn't get their hopes up about seeing Queen Bey in person.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too bad because if she were on tour, I would definitely try to take the class to see her,\" Brooks said."

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 \u201cOutlander\u201d is returning with the concluding episodes of its seventh season this month, but its stars have already wrapped official production on the show\u2019s eighth and final season.",
      "Caitr\u00edona Balfe and Sam Heughan, who have played time traveler Claire and 18th century Highlander Jamie since the show began, recently teased their bittersweet goodbye. Speaking less than a fortnight after their official wrap day, with only a few pick-up shots left to shoot, the stars described filming their final scene for the upcoming season.",
      "\u201cIt was very emotional. I was very emotional,\u201d Balfe said.",
      "\u201cI was, too,\u201d Heughan agreed. \u201cWe ended on a scene, well, I think \u2014 it was quite tough to do because it was a real Jamie-Claire moment, so it felt quite fitting. And I think they scheduled it like that. But it was also quite intense because a lot of the crew came to sort of celebrate or watch the final take of the final scene.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd there was a lot of words,\u201d added Balfe. \u201cIt was really hard to get through it because it also felt like everything had sort of this double meaning, you know, it\u2019s a lot of talk about goodbyes and things.\u201d",
      "Based on the books by Diana Gabaldon and mostly filmed in Scotland, the long-running show has leapt across time periods, including the Jacobite Rising, 1740s Versailles, 1960s Boston, the Revolutionary War \u2014 and more.",
      "\u201cI played Jamie when he was 23 and now he\u2019s sort of around 60. So it\u2019s quite a journey,\u201d said Heughan. \u201cThe show is always changing, always moving, it\u2019s a real journey that they\u2019ve been on from Scotland to America. And I think it\u2019s very rewarding. I\u2019m glad we weren\u2019t in a sort of procedural where we had to sort of be in the same location all the time.\u201d",
      "The concluding half of Season 7, premiering Nov. 22 on Starz, begins with the couple returning to Jamie\u2019s homeland of Scotland, before America \u2014 and the rebel cause in the Revolutionary War \u2014 calls again, testing their marriage like never before.",
      "\u201cReturning home obviously is going to be so rewarding for Jamie, but also for the fans,\u201d Heughan said, \u201cbecause I think the fans, they get to see a lot of, their favorite characters and their favorite locations.\u201d",
      "The latest episodes weave in storylines involving Claire and Jamie\u2019s time-traveling daughter Brianna and her husband Roger (Sophie Skelton and Richard Rankin) and Jamie\u2019s nephew Ian (John Bell), as well as Jamie\u2019s secret son William (Charles Vandervaart) and the British lord who is raising him.",
      "Season 7 also features one of Heughan's favorite co-stars \u2014 one he confirms fans won\u2019t be seeing in Season 8.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually the last time you see Sleepy,\u201d Heughan says. \u201cHe was my horse throughout first seasons. And he\u2019s a black Friesian with a white spot on him. And actually, if you look closely, he somehow transports himself to America as well because he doubles up as a horse in America. But yeah, I mean, we say goodbye to a lot of locations, a lot of characters in Season 7B.\u201d",
      "With the last season still to come, and the \u201cOutlander\u201d universe expanding with the upcoming prequel \u201cOutlander: Blood of My Blood,\u201d the story will continue for fans \u2014 although Balfe and Heughan will be getting used to their \u201cDroughtlander,\u201d the term fans coined for periods without the show.",
      "\u201cIt has been our lives for the last 11 years. We\u2019ve built families and homes in Scotland,\u201d said Heughan. \u201cSo, yes, it\u2019s quite a change that we\u2019re about to face.\u201d"

      "It\u2019s not often that a historical novel is set in the Vietnam of the 1920s, a period when the land in Indochina was occupied and exploited by French colonizers. It\u2019s also unusual that such a novel would be a whodunit murder mystery.",
      "\u201cThose Opulent Days,\u201d the debut novel of Jacquie Pham, is both \u2014 and a grim coming-of-age story as well.",
      "Pham, who grew up in Vietnam before moving to Australia, ably describes the land of her youth, its history and culture, including the well-heeled Vietnamese who were complicit in the French plunder of resources a century ago.",
      "\u201cThe French ruled the colony,\u201d she writes in the novel, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t understand its people \u2014 they needed locals, rich enough, corrupt and ambitious enough, to supply them with insight and cash.\u201d",
      "She vividly describes the Vietnamese peasants working long hours in rice paddies, bare feet in muddy water, pale yellow conical hats to block the harsh sun. \u201cThe fields were a vast, luscious green carpet,\u201d Pham writes, \u201calways filled with the fresh, intoxicating scent of young shoots.\u201d But little of this bounty went to impoverished, starving peasant families. \u201cThey would pay ground rent on a monthly basis, with hardly anything to call their own,\u201d Pham writes.",
      "As a mystery novel, \u201cThose Opulent Days\u201d is well-plotted, with a tangled web of possible outcomes. But the allure of the book\u2019s guessing-game narrative and its historical context does not carry over into a fully satisfying reading experience.",
      "The story is beset in part by a cast of vile characters and an overdose of melodramatic scenes. The French rulers and their prosperous Vietnamese collaborators, while living in regal splendor, partake of casual cruelty and horrid murders to such an extent they resemble cardboard cutouts of villains.",
      "This extends partly to the four boys whose fate growing up is at the core of the coming-of-age story. The four are Duy, Minh and Phong, sons of well-to-do families in Annam, as the region then was known, and Edmond, a French youth who met them at a boarding school. They are a mix of friends, rivals and would-be lovers. They binge on opium and alcohol. When they reach their early 20s, they near a dreaded, deadly end predicted by a fortune teller years earlier.",
      "The author understandably wants to convey the reality of the raw power held by the occupying masters over helpless underlings in the French Indochina era. But she has done so at the expense of solid storytelling.",
      "Pham is a young writer with a lot to offer. She succeeds admirably in laying out an enticing mystery, which makes for easy reading even when overwrought. And by linking it to a faded period of history, presaging the United States\u2019 own tragedy in the Vietnam War, she establishes herself as a writer to watch.",

      "Tim Matheson has portrayed a president and vice president. A police officer and military officer. And more than a few doctors. He's worked with Lucille Ball, Henry Fonda, Jackie Gleason, Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell and Steven Spielberg. He appeared in episodes of everything from \u201cLeave to Beaver\u201d and \u201cMy Three Sons\u201d to \u201cThis is Us\u201d and \u201cCSI.\u201d",

      "Matheson transports readers to the sets of quite a few of his Hollywood gigs in the enjoyable and illuminating memoir, \u201cDamn Glad to Meet You: My Seven Decades in the Hollywood Trenches.\u201d",
      "The book's title is a nod to the recurring line Matheson delivers as Eric \u201cOtter\u201d Stratton, the Delta rush chairman in the all-time comedy, \u201cAnimal House.\"",
      "The section on the making of the classic 1978 film is almost worth the book's purchase price alone. Spoiler alert: Some of the actors who played Delta House members got up to their own hijinks while on location at the University of Oregon, the stand-in for the fictional Faber College. The description of the cast's visit to a real frat party in Eugene is a particular highlight.",
      "\u201cDamn Glad to Meet You\" isn't all fun and games, though. It features some helpful tips and tricks on acting/directing and navigating the Hollywood jungle as well as some poignant moments. Matheson recounts the time he spent with some actors/comedians who were taken too early, including John Candy, Chris Farley and Sam Kinison \u2014 plus, his \u201cAnimal House\u201d co-star John Belushi.",
      "\u201cYou came for some Belushi stories,\u201d Matheson writes. \u201cI know. He's who I'm asked about more than anyone else I've ever worked with, and I've worked with almost everyone.\u201d",
      "These days, Matheson is working north of the border, where his hit Netflix show, \u201cVirgin River,\u201d is shot.",
      "It's just the latest in a very long line of roles the native Californian has taken on in his productive and lengthy career.",
      "\u201cI've been lucky. I know that,\" Matheson writes. \u201cI've always found a place to tell a story.\u201d",

      "\u201cPeople will walk up and spend one minute and come up to me and say, \u2018Wow, this is amazing. This made my day. This made my week. I really needed this,' \" Chavez said on Friday. \"It seems like such a small thing, but it can be really, really important to the people that participate.\u201d",
      "Chavez, 36, said the project was not a reaction to the election of Republican Donald Trump as president but that \"because it invites people to express how they\u2019re feeling at the time that they\u2019re feeling it, certainly the context of the election influences what people write about.\u201d",
      "Quickly scribbled notes went up on the tiled wall under 14th Street in Manhattan as Chavez spoke.",

      "Doctors say requests for permanent sterilizations and long-term birth control like IUDs have surged across the nation since Donald Trump was elected president last week",
      "Hours after Donald Trump was elected president for the second time, Dr. Clayton Alfonso had two messages from patients seeking to replace their IUDs. Over the next few days, three women inquired about getting their tubes tied.",
      "All of them said the election was the reason they were making these choices now.",
      "Requests for long-term birth control and permanent sterilizations have surged across the nation since the election, doctors told The Associated Press. And companies that sell emergency contraception and abortion pills say they're seeing significant spikes in requests from people who are stockpiling the medications \u2014 one saw a 966% increase in sales of emergency contraception from the week before in the 60 hours after the election.",
      "\u201cI saw this bump after the Trump election in 2016\" and after Roe vs. Wade was overturned in 2022, said Alfonso, an OB-GYN at Duke University in North Carolina. \u201cBut the patients seem more afraid this time.\u201d",
      "Although anti-abortion advocates are pressing Trump for more restrictions on abortion pills, it's unclear what \u2014 if much \u2014 will be done regarding access to contraceptives of any kind during the second Trump administration. Trump told a Pittsburgh television station in May that he was open to supporting regulations on contraception. But after media reports on the interview, he wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that he \u201chas never and will never\u201d advocate for restricting birth control and other contraceptives.",
      "Alfonso said his patients want to replace still-effective IUDs and \u201crestart\u201d the 3-to-12-year clock on them before the inauguration. He also said the women are particularly concerned about IUDs, which have been attacked by abortion opponents who believe life begins when an egg is fertilized. Experts believe the devices work mostly by blocking fertilization, but also may make it harder for a fertilized egg to implant in the womb.",
      "A patient who requested a tubal ligation Tuesday told Alfonso she doesn\u2019t want kids and is \u201cjust absolutely terrified of either forced pregnancy or inability to access contraception.\"",
      "Pittsburgh OB-GYN and abortion provider Dr. Grace Ferguson said more of her patients are scheduling IUD insertions or stockpiling emergency contraception, telling her upfront that it\u2019s \u201cbecause of the upcoming administration change.\u201d",
      "One patient, Mara Zupko, said she wants prescription emergency contraception since she\u2019s on the cusp of the weight limit for Plan B, the most well-known over-the-counter type. Her husband is getting a vasectomy.",
      "\u201cWe always kind of teetered on whether we wanted children or not,\u201d said Zupko, 27. \u201dBut as the world has become scarier and scarier, we realized we didn\u2019t want to bring a child into that environment. And I also have several health risks.\u201d",
      "Women are also turning to companies that sell emergency contraception online or offer abortion pills mifepristone and misoprostol through telehealth \u2014 something that's been happening even before the election, but that some companies say has accelerated.",
      "A study earlier this year showed the abortion pill supplier Aid Access received about 48,400 requests from across the U.S. for so-called \u201cadvance provision\u201d pills from September 2021 through April 2023 \u2014 with requests highest right after news leaked about Roe being overturned but before the formal announcement. Other research found that more women had their tubes tied post-Roe, with the biggest increases in states that ban abortion.",
      "Mifepristone has a shelf life of about five years and misoprostol around two years, according to Plan C, an organization that provides information about medical abortions. Plan B typically has a shelf life of four years.",
      "Telehealth company Wisp saw orders for abortion pills spike 600% between Election Day and the following day. And between Nov. 6 and 11, the company saw a 460% increase in sales of its emergency contraception and birth control offerings.",
      "At Gen Z-focused Winx Health, which sells emergency contraception called Restart, company leaders saw a 966% increase in sales in the 60 hours following the election compared with the week before. Sales of \u201cvalue packs\u201d of Restart \u2014 four doses instead of one \u2014 were up more than 7,000% in the past week.",
      "\"Morning after pills\u201d are legal in all states, but Winx co-founder Cynthia Plotch said many people seem confused about what emergency contraception is compared to abortion pills. In a 2023 poll by the health policy research organization KFF, a majority of responders said they know these two things aren't the same, but only 27% reported knowing emergency contraceptive pills cannot end a pregnancy.",
      "Doctors agree confusion around morning after pills may explain some of the stockpiling. But Alfonso at Duke suspects most people are doing this for the same reason they are seeking longer-term methods of birth control: to avoid abortion by preventing pregnancy in the first place.",
      "Alfonso predicts the birth control and abortion pill surge may level out like it did in 2016 and 2022. If the new administration \u201cis not focused on health care right away,\" he said, \"then I think it\u2019ll go to the back of people\u2019s minds until it picks up in the media.\u201d",

      "BEIRUT -- When Zarifa Nawfal\u2019s family arrived in Beirut for her wounded daughter\u2019s surgery, one of the first things she wanted to do was go to the sea. The Mediterranean had been a constant companion at their home in Gaza before the war.",
      "\u201cThe moment I smelled the sea, I felt at peace inside \u2014 as if I were in Gaza,\u201d she said.",
      "But soon their place of refuge reminded her of home in far more distressing ways.",
      "Nawfal\u2019s 7-year-old daughter, Halima Abou Yassine, is one of a dozen severely wounded Palestinian children brought to Lebanon this year for treatment through a program launched by a British-Palestinian surgeon, Dr. Ghassan Abu Sitta.",
      "But months after their arrival, Lebanon is itself embroiled in a war some fear will end in Gaza-like destruction.",

      "The children were filling water containers outside when two missiles struck, Nawfal said. She rushed outside and found Halima, the youngest, lying in the street, her skull cracked open, her brain exposed.",
      "Through her shock, Nawfal said, \u201cI was relieved that her body was in one piece.\u201d In Gaza, blasts often ripped people apart, leaving their loved ones without even a body to bury.",
      "Halima\u2019s brother was unconscious next to her. He was quickly revived at the hospital. But staff at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital confirmed Nawfal\u2019s fears, she said: Halima was dead. Her small body was placed in the morgue.",
      "But as the family was preparing to bury her, the little girl\u2019s uncle noticed faint signs of life, the family said.",
      "Officials at Al-Aqsa hospital could not be reached to confirm the account. But Abu Sitta, who has worked in several Gaza hospitals during the war, said in the chaotic situation it was not uncommon for patients to be misidentified as dead because normal protocols for emergency room examinations were often abandoned.",
      "\u201cBecause of the sheer number of cases that would come in with each air raid ... the ambulance staff would take to the morgue immediately those who they thought were dead,\" he said.",
      "In the days after her daughter was determined to be alive, Nawfal stayed with her, manually pumping oxygen into her lungs. After a week, the little girl began to breathe on her own. Finally, she woke up.",
      "\u201cSome of the doctors cried and said this is a miracle,\u201d Nawfal said.",
      "But they were unable to do more than keep the little girl alive. Her skull was still gaping open, a shard of bone missing. Her brain was beset by infection.",
      "The family was evacuated to Egypt in May. In July, they boarded a plane for Lebanon.",
      "The first of the wounded Palestinian children arrived in Lebanon in May. Five-year-old Adam Afana had nearly lost his left arm in a blast that killed his father and sister. His arm was paralyzed and he needed a complex surgery to correct the nerve damage.",
      "At the time, Lebanon was already embroiled in a low-simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "The Lebanese militant group began firing rockets across the border into Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Palestinian militants staged the deadly surprise incursion into southern Israel that sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes.",
      "For months, the conflict in Lebanon was mainly confined to the border area, far from Beirut.",
      "Abu Sitta said he chose Lebanon for the wounded children's treatment because the Mediterranean country has specialists with wide experience treating war injuries.",
      "Lebanon has been through its share of conflicts, including a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990 and a brutal monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, as well as spillover effects from other regional conflicts.",
      "\u201cEven after the end of the wars (in Lebanon), the wounded from Iraq and Syria would come here for that kind of complex and multistage treatment,\u201d Abu Sitta said.",
      "In July, Halima underwent successful surgery to repair her skull at the American University of Beirut Medical Center.",
      "Nawfal said her daughter has lingering memory problems but is improving with therapy. A chipper, happy-go-lucky child, Halima thrived in Beirut. She swam in the hotel pool, loved to color and played with the other children from Gaza. She walked with her siblings to pick out fruit at the neighborhood produce stand, a straw hat covering the scar on the back of her head.",
      "In mid-September, Israel launched an offensive against Hezbollah. It pummeled wide swathes of Lebanon with airstrikes, including Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs and some sites within the city center.",
      "The children quickly snapped back into wartime habits. They cracked open the balcony's sliding glass doors to prevent the glass shattering from the pressure of a blast and began sleeping in the central sitting room in the family\u2019s hotel suite, away from windows.",
      "Nawfal said some organizations offered to evacuate the family from Lebanon to continue treatment elsewhere, but she \u201ccompletely refused.\u201d",
      "\u201cLebanon isn\u2019t just another Arab country or a country we came to for treatment \u2014 Lebanon is a sister to Gaza,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are like two souls in one body. ... We live or die together.\u201d",
      "Adam Afana's uncle, Eid Afana, said the escalation in Lebanon \u201creminds us of the beginning of the war in Gaza.\u201d Afana said the sound of airstrikes frightened Adam, who felt the war was pursuing them.",
      "\u201cWhat we hope for Lebanon is that what happened in Gaza won\u2019t happen here \u2014 that the beginning and the ending won\u2019t both be the same,\u201d Afana said.",
      "The Ghassan Abu Sitta Fund halted bringing wounded Palestinian children to Lebanon but continues to treat the existing patients \u2014 with some challenges.",
      "Since arriving in Beirut, Adam has undergone a procedure to clear infection from his bones, a neurosurgery and regular physiotherapy sessions. With effort, he can now slightly clench his hand.",
      "But the final operation \u2014 a muscle transfer and surgery to repair the damaged nerves to his arm \u2014 is on hold.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just a handful of people who specialize in this globally, and we were expecting one of them to come to Lebanon,\u201d Abu Sitta said. The trip has been delayed by the escalation in Lebanon.",
      "When he first launched the program, Abu Sitta hoped to treat 50 Palestinian children from Gaza at any given time. Unable to bring more patients in, the team is turning its resources to treating Lebanese children.",
      "The numbers of wounded Lebanese children are still far lower than in Gaza. As of last week, Lebanon\u2019s Ministry of Public Health said 192 children had been killed and at least 1,255 wounded since October 2023. In Gaza, more than 13,000 children have been killed and thousands more have been wounded, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "Abu Sitta said the wounds of children in Lebanon are \u201cidentical to the injuries of Palestinian children from Gaza.\u201d Most were wounded while at home. They suffered \u201ccrush injuries to the limbs, blast injuries to the face\u201d and often \u201cmultiple members of the family killed at the same time,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAs in Gaza, this war takes its toll on children,\u201d he said. \u201cAll wars are waged on children.\u201d"

      "The 71-year-old retiree starts each morning this way with a walking club.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m obsessed,\u201d she said. Not only does it ease her joint pain, \u201cit just gives me energy \u2026 And then it calms me, too.\u201d",
      "Medical experts agree that walking is an easy way to improve physical and mental health, bolster fitness and prevent disease. While it\u2019s not the only sort of exercise people should do, it\u2019s a great first step toward a healthy life.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need equipment and you don\u2019t need a gym membership,\u201d said Dr. Sarah Eby, a sports medicine physician with Mass General Brigham. \u201cAnd the benefits are so vast.\u201d",
      "Walking can help meet the U.S. surgeon general\u2019s recommendation that adults get at least 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity physical activity every week. This helps lower the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, dementia, depression and many types of cancer.",
      "Walking also improves blood sugar levels, is good for bone health and can help you lose weight and sleep better, added Julie Schmied, a nurse practitioner with Norton Healthcare, which runs the free Get Healthy Walking Club.",
      "Another advantage? It\u2019s a low-impact exercise that puts less pressure on joints as it strengthens your heart and lungs.",
      "James Blankenship, 68, said joining the walking club at the Louisville Zoo last year helped him bounce back after a heart attack and triple bypass in 2022.",
      "\u201cMy cardiologist says I\u2019m doing great,\u201d he said.",

      "That's especially important for women\u2019s bone health as they age.",
      "Experts recommend adding such activities at least twice weekly \u2013 using weights, gym equipment or your own body as resistance \u2014 and doing exercises that improve flexibility like yoga or stretching.",
      "Nearly everyone has heard about this walking goal, which dates back to a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan. But experts stress that it\u2019s just a guideline.",
      "The average American walks about 3,000 to 4,000 steps a day and it's fine to gradually work up to 10,000, Shmied said.",
      "Setting a time goal can also be useful. Shmied suggests breaking the recommended 150 minutes per week into 30 minutes a day, or 10 minutes three times a day, for five days. During inclement weather, people can walk in malls or on treadmills.",
      "As they become seasoned walkers, they can speed up the pace or challenge themselves with hills while still keeping the activity level moderate.",
      "\u201cIf you can talk but not sing,\u201d Eby said, \u201cthat\u2019s what we consider moderate-intensity exercise.\u201d",

      "Punjab, Pakistan\u2019s most populous province with 127 million residents, has been hit by a record-high ongoing wave of pollution since October. The U.N. children\u2019s agency on Monday warned that the health of 11 million children there was at risk.",
      "Lahore and Multan, the province\u2019s two main cities hit by smog, remained the two most polluted cities in the world on Wednesday, with air quality index readings of about 400, according to the Environmental Protection Department. Anything over 300 is considered hazardous to health.",
      "The dangerous smog is a byproduct of large numbers of vehicles, construction and industrial work as well as burning crops at the start of the winter wheat-planting season, experts say.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 200 clinics on board vehicles have been roaming the smog-hit province of Punjab since last week in search of people who can't afford treatment and the elderly who can't make it to hospitals, a top government official at the Health Department, Aun Abbas, said.",

      "Food and beverage manufacturer Kraft Heinz said Tuesday that it no longer is serving the Lunchables meals it created for U.S. schools.",
      "The company introduced the two packaged meals \u2014 one starring pizza and the other a turkey, cheddar cheese and cracker plate \u2014 at the beginning of the 2023-2024 academic year. At the time, Kraft Heinz said the offerings were protein-enriched and contained reduced levels of saturated fat and sodium to meet the requirements of the national free and reduced-price school lunch program.",
      "Nutritionists and advocacy groups were not thrilled by the launch. The Center for Science in the Public Interest called having Lunchables in cafeterias \u201ca highly questionable move for school nutrition\u201d that might confuse families into thinking the versions sold at supermarkets were a healthy option.",
      "The drumbeat quickened in April, when Consumer Reports said its tests showed the school-approved Lunchables contained more sodium than the store varieties. The organization also reported that commercially available Lunchables had more lead compared to ready-made meals made several other companies.",
      "Consumer Reports petitioned the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ban Lunchables and similar processed meal kits from schools.",
      "In a statement, Pittsburgh-based Kraft Heinz attributed the decision to pull out of the market served by the National School Lunch Program to a lack of demand. The company described the business impact as \u201cnegligible,\u201d saying sales of the school-designed meals \u201cwere far less than 1% of overall Lunchables sales\u201d during the last academic year.",
      "\u201cLast year, we brought two NSLP compliant Lunchables options to schools that had increased protein. While many school administrators were excited to have these options, the demand did not meet our targets,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis happens occasionally across our broad portfolio, especially as we explore new sales channels. Lunchables products are not available in schools this year and we hope to revisit at a future date.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "New government data shows that U.S. drug overdose deaths appear to be showing a sustained decline",
      "NEW YORK -- The decline in U.S. drug overdose deaths appears to have continued this year, giving experts hope the nation is seeing sustained improvement in the persistent epidemic.",
      "There were about 97,000 overdose deaths in the 12-month period that ended June 30, according to provisional Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data released Wednesday. That's down 14% from the estimated 113,000 for the previous 12-month period.",
      "\u201cThis is a pretty stunning and rapid reversal of drug overdose mortality numbers,\u201d said Brandon Marshall, a Brown University researcher who studies overdose trends.",
      "Overdose death rates began steadily climbing in the 1990s because of opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths led by other opioids like heroin and \u2014 more recently \u2014 illicit fentanyl. Provisional data had indicated a slight decline for 2023, and the tally released Wednesday showed that the downward trend has kept going.",
      "Of course, there have been moments in the last several years when U.S. overdose deaths seemed to have plateaued or even started to go down, only to rise again, Marshall noted.",
      "\u201cThis seems to be substantial and sustained,\u201d Marshall said. \"I think there's real reason for hope here.\"",
      "Experts aren't certain about the reasons for the decline, but they cite a combination of possible factors.",
      "One is COVID-19. In the worst days of the pandemic, addiction treatment was hard to get and people were socially isolated \u2014 with no one around to help if they overdosed.",
      "\u201cDuring the pandemic we saw such a meteoric rise in drug overdose deaths that it\u2019s only natural we would see a decrease,\u201d said Farida Ahmad of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "Still, overdose deaths are well above what they were at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The recent numbers could represent the fruition of years of efforts to increase the availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, and addiction treatments such as buprenorphine, said Erin Winstanley, a University of Pittsburgh professor who researches drug overdose trends.",
      "Marshall said such efforts likely are being aided by money from settlements of opioid-related lawsuits, brought by state, local and Native American governments against drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies. Settlement funds have been rolling out to small towns and big cities across the U.S., and some have started spending the money on naloxone and other measures.",
      "Some experts have wondered about changes in the drug supply. Xylazine, a sedative, has been increasingly detected in illegally manufactured fentanyl, and experts are sorting out exactly how it's affecting overdoses.",
      "In the latest CDC data, overdose death reports are down in 45 states. Increases occurred in Alaska, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington.",
      "The most dramatic decreases were seen in North Carolina and Ohio, but CDC officials voiced a note of caution. Some jurisdictions have had lags in getting death records to federal statisticians \u2014 particularly North Carolina, where death investigations have slowed because of understaffing at the state medical examiner's office. The CDC made estimates to try to account for incomplete death records, but the decline in some places may ultimately turn out not to be as dramatic as initial numbers suggest.",
      "Another limitation of the provisional data is that it doesn't detail what's happening in different groups of people. Recent research noted the overdose deaths in Black and Native Americans have been growing disproportionately larger.",
      "\u201cWe really need more data from the CDC to learn whether these declines are being experienced in all racial ethnic subgroups,\" Marshall said.",

      "KANSAS CITY, Kan. -- After working at a crowded and dangerous internment camp in Iraq, Air Force Staff Sgt. Heather O'Brien brought home with her anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "A bouncy labradoodle and a Kansas City-area program helped her get back on her feet.",
      "Dogs 4 Valor, operated through the Olathe, Kansas-based organization called The Battle Within, helps retired veterans and first responders work with their service dogs to help manage depression, anxiety and other challenges.",
      "\u201cA lot of times the veteran with severe PTSD is homebound,\u201d said Sandra Sindeldecker, program manager for Dogs 4 Valor. \u201cThey\u2019re isolated. They\u2019re very nervous. They won\u2019t make eye contact. Some won\u2019t leave the house at all.\u201d",
      "The program involves both group and one-on-one training. The goal is to get the veteran and the dog comfortable with each other and understanding each other. The group takes outings to help the veterans regain their footing in public places like airports. Program leaders also provide mental health therapy at no cost.",
      "The veterans and dogs graduate in six to nine months, but group gatherings continue.",
      "There is growing evidence of the value of service dogs for veterans with PTSD. A small study published in JAMA Network Open in June looked at a program operated by K9s For Warriors. Service dogs in the program are taught to pick up a veteran\u2019s physical signs of distress and can interrupt panic attacks and nightmares with a loving nudge.",
      "Researchers compared 81 veterans who received service dogs with 75 veterans on the waiting list for a trained dog. After three months, PTSD symptoms improved in both groups, but the veterans with dogs saw a bigger improvement on average.",
      "O'Brien, 40, recalled that the camp where she worked in Iraq sometimes had over 20,000 detainees. Violence and rioting were common and it left her with severe anxiety.",
      "\u201cWhen I got out of the military, I just assumed that you\u2019re supposed to be on edge all the time as a veteran,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.",
      "O\u2019Brien\u2019s mother spotted the frisky lab-poodle mix on Facebook and convinced her daughter to adopt the dog she named Albus. Months later, O'Brien learned about Dogs 4 Valor, and the pair joined the program in October 2023.",
      "O\u2019Brien says she can now go out in public again \u2014 she even went on vacation to Branson, Missouri, \u201cthings that I never would have thought I would do really, probably ever again.\u201d",
      "Mark Atkinson, 38, served in Afghanistan as a corporal in the Marine Corps. He returned home with PTSD and major depressive disorder, causing sleeplessness and anxiety. He adopted Lexi, now 5, in 2020.",
      "Lexi, a muscular cane corso breed, needed Atkinson as much as he needed her. Her previous owner had kept Lexi in chains before surrendering her. Since joining Dogs 4 Valor, the two can get out together and enjoy life.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really like leaving the house because I\u2019m safe there, you know?\" Atkinson said. \u201cAnd having Lexi has just made me get out to be more social.\u201d",
      "Having a group of fellow veterans facing the same challenges has also helped, Atkinson said.",
      "\u201cWe come from the same backgrounds, different branches,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cSame issues. You know, PTSD or traumatic brain injuries. And they\u2019re all very welcoming, as well. There\u2019s no judgment.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Brien compared living with Albus to a relationship with a sometimes pushy best friend who often wants to go out.",
      "\u201cThe best friend constantly wants to make you do things that make you nervous,\u201d O\u2019Brien laughed, acknowledging that it is ultimately up to her.",
      "\u201cI have to decide to walk out and just deal with life,\" O'Brien said. \"And so that has been hard. And it still is hard from time to time, but it\u2019s it\u2019s getting manageable.\u201d",
      "Some veterans said their family relationships have improved since they started the program.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m able to talk, not fly off the handle and just get along with people and not be as stressed, not have as much anxiety,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cOr even if I do, she (Lexi) is right there with me.\u201d",
      "Timothy Siebenmorgen, 61, said his relationships also are better with help from his 1-year-old American bulldog, Rosie, and Dogs 4 Valor, which he joined in July. He served in both the Marines and the Army, deploying 18 times.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re in the military, kind of taught not to show weakness,\" Siebenmorgen said. \"So you figure you can tackle everything yourself and you honestly believe that. And then you realize you can\u2019t do it on your own.\u201d",
      "Veterans said the dogs, and the program, have given them new hope and a renewed ability to move forward.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 23andMe is laying off 40% of its workforce, or more than 200 employees, and discontinuing its therapeutics division as the struggling genetic testing company attempts to slash costs.",
      "The latest restructuring efforts were announced by 23andMe on Monday. The company said it plans to wind down ongoing clinical trials \u201cas quickly as practical\u201d \u2014 and that it was currently evaluating \u201cstrategic alternatives\u201d for assets related to its drug development and research programs, which include studies on potential cancer treatments.",
      "In a prepared statement, 23andMe CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki said the company was \"taking these difficult but necessary actions\u201d as it focuses on \u201cthe long-term success of our core consumer business and research partnerships.\u201d",
      "The restructuring arrives during a period of turmoil at California-based 23andMe, which has recently included a high-profile data breach, several rounds of previous layoffs and piling losses that plunged the company's stock over recent years.",
      "Back in September, all of 23andMe\u2019s independent directors also resigned from its board \u2014 in a rare move that followed drawn-out negotiations with Wojcicki, who has been trying to take the company private. The seven resigning directors said they had yet to receive an adequate transaction proposal from the chief executive and cited a \u201cclear\u201d difference of opinion on 23andMe\u2019s future.",
      "At the time, Wojcicki said she was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d by the resignations but maintained that taking 23andMe private and \u201coutside of the short-term pressures of the public markets\u201d would be best for the company long term.",
      "After more than a month with Wojcicki left as the sole member of the board, 23andMe announced that it had appointed three new independent directors in late October.",
      "23andMe went public in 2021 and has struggled to find a profitable business model since \u2014 particularly with most buyers of its saliva-based testing kits only needing to purchase once. The company reported a net loss of $667 million for its last fiscal year, more than double the loss of $312 million for the year prior.",
      "23andMe posted another loss in quarterly earnings released Tuesday, although with less of a dent than in previous quarters. The company reported a net loss of $59.1 million for the 2025 fiscal year's second quarter, compared to a loss of $75.3 million for the same year prior.",
      "Revenue, however, totaled at $44.1 million for the second quarter \u2014 down from $50 million from the year prior. The company cited lower testing kit sales and telehealth orders, as well as a decrease in research revenue, but said that was partially offset by a growth in membership services.",
      "23andMe anticipates the job cuts and other restructuring efforts announced Monday to reduce its operating expenses and save the company more than $35 million annually. 23andMe also expects to incur up to $12 million in costs, primarily related to one-time severance and other termination-related expenses.",
      "23andMe ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $127 million, compared with $216 million as of March 31, 2024.",
      "Last month, 23andMe completed a 1-for-20 reverse stock split. Shares were down nearly 4% by midday Tuesday, sitting at around $4.43."

      "LONDON -- Cases of mpox in the region of Congo where a new and more infectious variant was first detected appear to be \u201cplateauing,\u201d the World Health Organization said on Monday, even as the virus continues to increase in other areas of the country, as well as in Burundi and Uganda.",
      "A report by the U.N. health agency said the number of mpox infections \u201cshows a general rising trend,\u201d but that they may have plateaued in South Kivu, where the more infectious form of mpox was first identified to be spreading earlier this year among sex workers and miners in the gold mining town of Kamituga.",
      "WHO acknowledged that testing is still not widespread, making it difficult to understand how exactly the virus is spreading.",
      "According to data from last week, Congo reported fewer than 100 laboratory-confirmed mpox cases, down from nearly 400 in July. In recent weeks, experts say that infections appear to be stabilizing, offering a chance for health authorities to definitively stamp out the outbreak.",
      "So far, about 50,000 people in Congo have been immunized against mpox. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 3 million vaccines are needed to stop the outbreak.",
      "Last week, Africa CDC's director Dr. Jean Kaseya said the continent was \u201cstill in the acute phase\u201d of the mpox epidemic, with 19 countries affected. He warned that without more resources, the virus could become a global threat.",
      "WHO said the Burundi outbreak is also being driven by the newer variant, which causes less severe symptoms \u2014 meaning people who are infectious may not realize they are spreading it. In the last two weeks, Burundi has reported more than 200 new mpox cases every week, mostly in children and young adults.",
      "In Uganda, which reported 100 new cases last week, WHO said the virus is spreading mostly through sex, with the vast majority of cases in adults.",
      "Mpox -- previously known as monkeypox because it was first seen in research monkeys \u2014 is spread primarily through close skin-to-skin contact with infected people or their soiled clothes or bedsheets. It often causes visible skin lesions that could make people less likely to be in close contact with others.",
      "In August, WHO declared the rapid spread of mpox in Congo and elsewhere in Africa to be a global health emergency. To date, Africa has reported more than 46,000 suspected cases, including 1,081 deaths.",
      "WHO said it would convene an expert meeting on Nov. 22 to determine if mpox still constitutes an international emergency.",
      "Last week, Britain announced the first instance of the more infectious kind of mpox spreading beyond Africa. It identified mpox in a person who had recently traveled to Africa and in three of their household contacts. All the individuals are currently being treated in two London hospitals.",

      "Four-year-old Hussein Mikdad survived an Israeli airstrike on his home in a Beirut suburb last month",
      "BEIRUT -- Curled up in his father \u2019s lap, clinging to his chest, Hussein Mikdad cried his heart out. The 4-year-old kicked his doctor with his intact foot and pushed him away with the arm that was not in a cast. \u201cMy Dad! My Dad!\" Hussein said. \"Make him leave me alone!\u201d With eyes tearing up in relief and pain, the father reassured his son and pulled him closer.",
      "Hussein and his father, Hassan, are the only survivors of their family after an Israeli airstrike last month on their Beirut neighborhood. The strike killed 18 people, including his mother, three siblings and six relatives.",
      "\u201cCan he now shower?\u201d the father asked the doctor.",
      "Ten days after surgery, doctors examining Hussein's wounds said the boy is healing properly. He has rods in his fractured right thigh and stitches that assembled his torn tendons back in place on the right arm. The pain has subsided, and Hussein should be able to walk again in two months \u2014 albeit with a lingering limp.",
      "A prognosis for Hussein's invisible wounds is much harder to give. He is back in diapers and has begun wetting his bed. He hardly speaks and has not said a word about his mother, two sisters and brother.",
      "\u201cThe trauma is not just on the muscular skeletal aspect. But he is also mentally hurt,\u201d Imad Nahle, one of Hussein\u2019s orthopedic surgeons, said.",
      "Israel said, without elaborating, that the strike on the Mikdad neighborhood struck a Hezbollah target. In the war that has escalated since September, Israeli airstrikes have increasingly hit residential areas around Lebanon. Israel accuses the Lebanese militant group of hiding its capabilities and fighters among civilians. It vows to cripple Hezbollah, which began firing into northern Israel after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza.",
      "But children have been caught in the midst.",
      "With more strikes on homes and in residential areas, doctors are seeing more children affected by the violence. More than 100 children have been killed in Lebanon in the past six weeks and hundreds injured. And of the 14,000 wounded since last year, around 10% are children. Many have been left with severed limbs, burned bodies, and broken families \u2014 scars that could last for a lifetime.",
      "Ghassan Abu Sittah, a renowned British-Palestinian surgeon who is also treating Hussein, sees that long road ahead. This is his worry: \u201cIt leaves us with a generation of physically wounded children, children who are psychologically and emotionally wounded.\"",
      "At the American University of Beirut Medical Center, which is receiving limited cases of war casualties, Nahle said he operated on five children in the past five weeks \u2014 up from no cases before. Most were referred from south and eastern Lebanon.",
      "A few miles away, at the Lebanese Hospital Geitaoui, one of the country\u2019s largest burns centers increased its capacity by nearly 180% since September so it could accommodate more war wounded, its medical director Naji Abirached said. About a fifth of the newly admitted patients are children.",
      "In one of the burn center\u2019s ICU units lies Ivana Skakye. She turned 2 in the hospital ward last week. Ivana has been healing from burns she sustained following an Israeli airstrike outside their home in southern Lebanon on Sept. 23. Israel said it struck ammunition depots and launchers in southern Lebanon that day when its warplanes launched hundreds of airstrikes in different parts of Lebanon, making it the deadliest day of the war so far. More than 500 people were killed.",
      "Six weeks later, the tiny Ivana remains wrapped in white gauze from head to toe except her torso. She sustained third-degree burns over 40 percent of her body. Her hair and head, her left side all the way to her legs, both her arms and her chest were burned. Her family home was damaged, its ceiling set afire. The family\u2019s valuables, packed in their car as they prepared to leave, were also torched. Ivana\u2019s older sister, Rahaf, 7, has recovered faster from burns to her face and hands.",
      "Fatima Zayoun, their mother, was in the kitchen when the explosion hit. Zayoun jumped up to grab the girls, who were playing on the terrace.",
      "It was, Zayoun said, \"as if something lifted me up so that I can grab my kids. I have no idea how I managed to pull them in and throw them out of the window. She spoke from the ICU burns unit. \u201cThey were not on fire, but they were burned. Black ash covered them. ... (Ivana) was without any hair. I told myself, `That is not her.'\u201d",
      "Now, Ivana's wound dressings are changed every two days. Her doctor, Ziad Sleiman, said she could be discharged in a few days. She\u2019s back again to saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cBye \u2014 shorthand for wanting to go out.",
      "Like Hussein, though, Ivana has no home to return to. Her parents fear collective shelters could cause an infection to return.",
      "After seeing her kids \u201csizzling on the floor,\u201d Zayoun, 35, said that even if their home is repaired, she wouldn\u2019t want to return. \u201cI saw death with my own eyes,\u201d she said.",
      "Zayoun was 17 last time Israel and Hezbollah were at war, in 2006. Displaced with her family then, she said she almost enjoyed the experience, riding out of their village in a truck full of their belongings, mixing with new people, learning new things. They returned home when the war was over.",
      "\u201cBut this war is hard. They are hitting everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do they want from us? Do they want to hurt our children? We are not what they are looking for.\"",
      "Abu Sittah, the reconstructive surgeon, said most of the children's injuries are from blasts or collapsing rubble. That attack on a space they expect to be inviolable can have lingering effects.",
      "\u201cChildren feel safe at home,\" he said. \"The injury makes them for the first time lose that sense of security \u2014 that their parents are keeping them safe, that their homes are invincible, and suddenly their homes become not so.\u201d",
      "One recent morning, children were playing in the courtyard of a vocational school-turned-shelter in Dekwaneh, north of Beirut, where nearly 3,000 people displaced from the south are now living. The parents were busy with an overflowing bathroom that serves one floor in a building that houses nearly 700 people.",
      "Only playtime brings the children, from different villages in the south, together. They were divided in two teams, ages ranging between 6 and 12, competing to get the handkerchief first. A tiny girl hugged and held hands with strangers visiting the shelter. \u201cI am from Lebanon. Don't tell anyone,\u201d she whispered in their ears.",
      "The game turned rowdy when two girls in their early teens got into a fist fight. Pushing and shoving began. Tears and tantrums followed. The tiny girl walked away in a daze.",
      "Maria Elizabeth Haddad, manager of the psychosocial support programs in Beirut and neighboring areas for the U.S.-based International Medical Corps, said parents in shelters reported signs of increased anxiety, hostility and aggression among kids. They talk back to parents and ignore rules. Some have developed speech impediments and clinginess. One is showing early signs of psychosis.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be residual symptoms when they grow up, especially related to attachment ties, to feeling of security,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cIt is a generational trauma. We have experienced it before with our parents. ... They don\u2019t have stability or search for (extra) stability. This is not going to be easy to overcome.\u201d",
      "Children represent more than a third of over 1 million people displaced by the war in Lebanon and following Israeli evacuation notices, according to U.N. and government estimates (more than 60,000 people have been displaced from northern Israel). That leaves hundreds of thousands in Lebanon without schooling, either because their schools were inaccessible or have been turned into shelters.",
      "Hussein's father says he and his son must start together from scratch. With help from relatives, the two have found a temporary shelter in a home \u2014 and, for the father, a brief sense of relief. \u201cI thank God he is not asking for or about his mother and his siblings,\u201d said Hassan Mikdad, the 40-year-old father.",
      "He has no explanation for his son, who watched their family die in their home. His two sisters \u2014 Celine, 10, and Cila, 14 \u2014 were pulled out of the rubble the following day. His mother, Mona, was pulled out three days later. She was locked in an embrace with her 6-year-old son, Ali.",
      "The strike on Oct. 21 also caused damage across the street, to one of Beirut\u2019s main public hospitals, breaking solar panels and windows in the pharmacy and the dialysis unit. The father survived because he had stepped out for coffee. He watched his building crumble in the late-night airstrike. He also lost his shop, his motorcycles and car \u2014 all the evidence of his 16 years of family life.",
      "His friend, Hussein Hammoud, arrived on the scene to help sift through rubble. Hammoud spotted young Hussein Mikdad\u2019s fingers in the darkness in an alley behind their home. At first, he thought they were severed limbs \u2014 until he heard the boy\u2019s screams. He dug out Hussein with glass lodged in his leg and a metal bar in his shoulder. Hammoud said he didn\u2019t recognize the boy. He held the child's almost-severed wrist in place.",
      "In the hospital now, Hussein Mikdad sipped a juice as he listened to his father and his friend. His father turned to him, asking if he wanted a Spider-Man toy \u2014 an effort to forestall a new outburst of tears. He said he buys Hussein a toy each day.",
      "\u201cWhat I am living through seems like a big lie. ...The mind can\u2019t comprehend,\u201d he said. \u201cI thank God for the blessing that is Hussein.\u201d",

      "BOISE, Idaho -- Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion bans told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\u201cWe felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\u201d said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \u201cnecessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\u201d",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant it would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \u201cmirror syndrome,\u201d a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband decided to seek an abortion, and learned they would have to go out of state to get one after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat.",
      "\u201cNo parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cI wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\u201d",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \u201cBrooks\u201d for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\u201cIf I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\u201d Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\u201d she said. They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\u201cAll four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\u201d attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \u201cto protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\u201d",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General\u2019s office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\u201cUnborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\u201d Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \u201crare circumstances where abortion is necessary\u201d to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \u201cusurp the role of the Legislature\u201d by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho\u2019s multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \u201cbasically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\u201d Corrigan said.",
      "\u201cI have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\u201d she said. \u201cI have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\u201d",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\u201cWe are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\u201d she said."

    "summary": "There's some good news about sexually-transmitted diseases in newly released U.S. health data",
    "story": [
      "There's some good news about sexually-transmitted diseases in newly released U.S. health data",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. syphilis epidemic slowed dramatically last year, gonorrhea cases fell and chlamydia cases remained below prepandemic levels, according to federal data released Tuesday.",
      "The numbers represented some good news about sexually transmitted diseases, which experienced some alarming increases in past years due to declining condom use, inadequate sex education, and reduced testing and treatment when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.",
      "Last year, cases of the most infectious stages of syphilis fell 10% from the year before \u2014 the first substantial decline in more than two decades. Gonorrhea cases dropped 7%, marking a second straight year of decline and bringing the number below what it was in 2019.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m encouraged, and it\u2019s been a long time since I felt that way\u201d about the nation\u2019s epidemic of sexually transmitted infections, said the CDC\u2019s Dr. Jonathan Mermin. \u201cSomething is working.\"",
      "More than 2.4 million cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia were diagnosed and reported last year \u2014 1.6 million cases of chlamydia, 600,000 of gonorrhea, and more than 209,000 of syphilis.",
      "Syphilis is a particular concern. For centuries, it was a common but feared infection that could deform the body and end in death. New cases plummeted in the U.S. starting in the 1940s when infection-fighting antibiotics became widely available, and they trended down for a half century after that. By 2002, however, cases began rising again, with men who have sex with other men being disproportionately affected.",
      "The new report found cases of syphilis in their early, most infectious stages dropped 13% among gay and bisexual men. It was the first such drop since the agency began reporting data for that group in the mid-2000s.",
      "However, there was a 12% increase in the rate of cases of unknown- or later-stage syphilis \u2014 a reflection of people infected years ago.",
      "Cases of syphilis in newborns, passed on from infected mothers, also rose. There were nearly 4,000 cases, including 279 stillbirths and infant deaths.",
      "\u201cThis means pregnant women are not being tested often enough,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine at the University of Southern California.",
      "What caused some of the STD trends to improve? Several experts say one contributor is the growing use of an antibiotic as a \u201cmorning-after pill.\u201d Studies have shown that taking doxycycline within 72 hours of unprotected sex cuts the risk of developing syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia.",
      "In June, the CDC started recommending doxycycline as a morning-after pill, specifically for gay and bisexual men and transgender women who recently had an STD diagnosis. But health departments and organizations in some cities had been giving the pills to people for a couple years.",
      "Some experts believe that the 2022 mpox outbreak \u2014 which mainly hit gay and bisexual men \u2014 may have had a lingering effect on sexual behavior in 2023, or at least on people's willingness to get tested when strange sores appeared.",
      "Another factor may have been an increase in the number of health workers testing people for infections, doing contact tracing and connecting people to treatment. Congress gave $1.2 billion to expand the workforce over five years, including $600 million to states, cities and territories that get STD prevention funding from CDC.",
      "Last year had the \"most activity with that funding throughout the U.S.,\u201d said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors.",
      "However, Congress ended the funds early as a part of last year\u2019s debt ceiling deal, cutting off $400 million. Some people already have lost their jobs, said a spokeswoman for Harvey's organization.",
      "Still, Harvey said he had reasons for optimism, including the growing use of doxycycline and a push for at-home STD test kits.",
      "Also, there are reasons to think the next presidential administration could get behind STD prevention. In 2019, then-President Donald Trump announced a campaign to \u201celiminate\u201d the U.S. HIV epidemic by 2030. (Federal health officials later clarified that the actual goal was a huge reduction in new infections \u2014 fewer than 3,000 a year.)",
      "There were nearly 32,000 new HIV infections in 2022, the CDC estimates. But a boost in public health funding for HIV could also also help bring down other sexually transmitted infections, experts said.",
      "\u201cWhen the government puts in resources, puts in money, we see declines in STDs,\u201d Klausner said.",

      "The Justice Department is suing to block UnitedHealth Group\u2019s $3.3 billion purchase of Amedisys",
      "NEW YORK -- The Justice Department is suing to block UnitedHealth Group's $3.3 billion purchase of Amedisys, citing concerns the combination would hinder access to home health and hospice services in the U.S.",
      "The antitrust complaint, filed in Maryland by the Justice Department and four states' attorneys general Tuesday, argues that a potential merger is illegal because the two companies are \"such large competitors\" already \u2014 and the deal would give UnitedHealth too much control in many local markets.",
      "That would mean less choice for patients looking for affordable care, the suit alleges, as well as fewer employment options for nurses seeking competitive pay and benefits.",
      "\u201cAmerican healthcare is unwell,\" Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, said in a prepared statement. \u201cUnless this $3.3 billion transaction is stopped, UnitedHealth Group will further extend its grip to home health and hospice care, threatening seniors, their families and nurses.\u201d",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit follows UnitedHealth's acquisition of LHC Group Inc., another home health and hospice provider. Since that transaction's completion last year, the Justice Department said, UnitedHealth and Amedisys have emerged as two of the largest providers of home health and hospice care in the country.",
      "The complaint alleges that UnitedHealth's plan to acquire Amedisys is the result of \"an intentional, sustained strategy of acquiring, rather than beating, competition.\u201d After completing the LHC acquisition, the suit says UnitedHealth prevented Amedisys' 2023 plans to merge with infusion provider OptionCare by paying a \u201cbreakup fee\u201d \u2014 and then separately made its own acquisition offer, which Amedisys eventually accepted.",
      "UnitedHealth is seeking to add Amedisys to Optum, its subsidiary that provides care as well as pharmacy and technology services. In a response Tuesday to the antitrust suit, Optum said the transaction \u201cwould be pro-competitive and further innovation.\u201d It said it plans to \u201cvigorously defend (itself) against the DOJ\u2019s overreaching interpretation of the antitrust laws.\u201d",
      "Amedisys added that it also remains committed to the deal, which it believes \u201cwill create more opportunities to deliver quality, compassionate and value-based care to patients and their families.\u201d",
      "In details about the deal published on Optum's website, the company maintained Optum and Amedisys \u201cwould operate just a fraction\" of all home health and hospice care markets nationwide when combined. Optum also noted plans to divest some of its care centers to home health provider VitalCaring upon the deal's completion. It said the divestments would aid competition but the Justice Department said that the proposal is inadequate.",
      "Beyond its Optum unit, UnitedHealth Group also runs one of the nation\u2019s largest health insurers, UnitedHealthcare. The Minnesota-based healthcare giant reported third-quarter net income of $6.06 billion on revenue of $100.82 billion.",
      "Louisiana-based Amedisys reported third-quarter earnings of $16.9 million and a revenue of $587.7 million for the period.",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit arrives in the final months of the Biden administration, which has been particularly aggressive in antitrust enforcement. In recent years, the Justice Department has also targeted companies accused of engaging in illegal monopolies and driving up prices across industries like entertainment, travel and tech.",
      "The four states\u2019 attorneys general joining Tuesday's suit against UnitedHealth and Amedisys are from Maryland, Illinois, New Jersey and New York."

    "story": [
      "A pregnant woman has filed a lawsuit seeking the right to an abortion in Kentucky",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A pregnant woman filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to restore the right to an abortion in Kentucky in the latest challenge to the state's near-total ban on the procedure.",
      "The suit, filed in state court in Louisville, claims that Kentucky laws blocking abortions violate the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights to privacy and self-determination. It asks that both state laws be struck down by a judge in Jefferson County Circuit Court.",
      "The woman, a state resident identified by the pseudonym Mary Poe to protect her privacy, is about seven weeks pregnant, the suit said. She wants to terminate her pregnancy but cannot legally do so in Kentucky, it said.",
      "The decision about whether to become or remain pregnant is among the \u201cmost personal and consequential decisions a person will make in their lifetime,\u201d the suit said. Her legal team includes attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "\u201cWithout the ability to decide whether to continue a pregnancy, Kentuckians have lost the right to make critical decisions about their health, bodies, lives and futures,\u201d the suit said.",
      "The plaintiff said in a statement that ending her pregnancy is the best decision for her and her family.",
      "\u201cI feel overwhelmed and frustrated that I cannot access abortion care here in my own state, and I have started the difficult process of arranging to get care in another state where it\u2019s legal,\u201d she said in the statement issued by the ACLU of Kentucky. \u201cThis involves trying to take time off work and securing child care, all of which place an enormous burden on me.\u201d",
      "Defendants in the latest suit include Russell Coleman, Kentucky\u2019s Republican attorney general.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the attorney general\u2019s responsibility to defend the laws passed by the General Assembly, and we will zealously work to uphold these laws in court,\u201d Coleman said in a statement.",
      "The suit was quickly denounced as meritless by David Walls, executive director of The Family Foundation, a conservative group staunchly opposed to abortion.",
      "\u201cThe ACLU\u2019s suggestion that the Kentucky Constitution somehow secretly contains a hidden right to terminate the life and stop the beating heart of an unborn human being, despite Kentucky\u2019s clear 150-year pro-life history, is absolutely absurd,\u201d Walls said in a statement.",
      "The suit is seeking class-action status to include others who are or will become pregnant and want the right to have an abortion. It is challenging Kentucky\u2019s near-total trigger law ban and a separate six-week ban, both of which were passed by Republican legislative majorities.",
      "The trigger law took effect when Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 and bans abortions except to save the life of the patient or to prevent disabling injury. It does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.",
      "The lawsuit is similar to legal action taken nearly a year ago, also by a pregnant woman who sought the right to an abortion in Kentucky. That challenge was dropped after the woman learned her embryo no longer had cardiac activity, but abortion rights groups said the legal fight was far from over.",
      "In 2022, Kentucky voters rejected a ballot measure that would have denied any constitutional protections for abortion, but abortion rights supporters have made no inroads in the Republican-controlled Legislature at chipping away at the laws.",
      "Kentucky's Supreme Court refused last year to halt the near-total ban, resulting in abortion access remaining virtually shut off in the. Abortion rights groups have searched for plaintiffs to challenge the ban.",
      "Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said Tuesday that bans in Kentucky and elsewhere have \u201cwreaked havoc on people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose who can scrape together the resources may be able to travel out of state to get care, but others will be forced to carry their pregnancies to term against their will, often at great cost to their health or lives,\u201d Amiri said in a statement.",
      "The plaintiff in the new lawsuit said the decision whether to end her pregnancy should be hers.",
      "\"I am bringing this case to ensure that other Kentuckians will not have to go through what I am going through, and instead will be able to get the health care they need in our community,\u201d she said."

      "The family of a security guard who was fatally shot at a hospital in Portland, Oregon, has sued the facility for $35 million",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- The family of a security guard who was shot and killed at a hospital in Portland, Oregon, sued the facility for $35 million on Tuesday, accusing it of negligence and failing to respond to the dangers that the gunman posed to hospital staff over multiple days.",
      "In a wrongful death complaint filed Tuesday, the estate of Bobby Smallwood argued that Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center failed to enforce its policies against violence and weapons in the workplace by not barring the shooter from the facility, despite staff reporting threats and aggression toward them in the days before the shooting.",
      "\u201cThe repeated failures of Legacy Good Samaritan to follow their own safety protocols directly led to the tragically preventable death of Bobby Smallwood,\u201d Tom D\u2019Amore, the attorney representing the family, said in a statement. \u201cDespite documented threats and abusive behavior that required immediate removal under hospital policy, Legacy allowed a dangerous individual to remain on the premises for three days until those threats escalated to violence.\u201d",
      "In an email, Legacy Health said it was unable to comment on pending litigation.",
      "The shooting at Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center in Portland was part of a wave of gun violence sweeping through U.S. hospitals and medical centers, which have struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have helped make health care one of the nation\u2019s most violent fields. Health care workers racked up 73% of all nonfatal workplace violence injuries in 2018, the most recent year for which figures are available, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "The gunman at the Portland hospital, PoniaX Calles, first visited the facility on July 19, 2023, as his partner was about to give birth. On July 20 and July 21, nursing staff and security guards filed multiple incident reports describing outbursts, violent behavior and threats, but they weren't accessible or provided to workers who were interacting with him, according to the complaint.",
      "On July 22, nurse supervisors decided to remove Calles from his partner's room, and Smallwood accompanied him to the waiting room area outside the maternity ward. Other security guards searching the room found two loaded firearms in a duffel bag, and his partner told them he likely had a third gun on his person, the complaint said.",
      "According to the complaint, over 40 minutes passed between the discovery of the duffel bag and Smallwood's death. Two minutes before he was shot, a security guard used hand gestures through glass doors to notify him that Calles was armed. Smallwood then told Calles he would pat him down, but Calles said he would leave instead. Smallwood began escorting him out of the hospital, and as other staff members approached them, Calles shot Smallwood in the neck.",
      "The hospital did not call a \u201ccode silver,\u201d the emergency code for an active shooter, until after Smallwood had been shot, the complaint said.",
      "Smallwood's family said his death has profoundly impacted them.",
      "\u201cEvery day we grieve the loss of our son and all the years ahead that should have been his to live,\u201d his parents, Walter \u201cBob\u201d and Tammy Smallwood, said in the statement released by their attorney. \u201cNothing can bring Bobby back, but we will not stop fighting until Legacy is held fully responsible for what they took from our family.\u201d",
      "After the shooting, Legacy said it planned to install additional metal detectors; require bag searches at every hospital; equip more security officers with stun guns; and apply bullet-slowing film to some interior glass and at main entrances.",
      "Around 40 states have passed laws creating or increasing penalties for violence against health care workers, according to the American Nurses Association. Hospitals have armed security officers with batons, stun guns or handguns, while some states allow hospitals to create their own police forces."

      "An attorney representing a conservate prosecutor is struggling to convince Wisconsin's liberal-leaning Supreme Court to reactivate the state's 175-year-old abortion ban",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A conservative prosecutor's attorney struggled Monday to persuade the Wisconsin Supreme Court to reactivate the state's 175-year-old abortion ban, drawing a tongue-lashing from two of the court's liberal justices during oral arguments.",
      "Sheboygan County\u2019s Republican district attorney, Joel Urmanski, has asked the high court to overturn a Dane County judge\u2019s ruling last year that invalidated the ban. A ruling isn't expected for weeks but abortion advocates almost certainly will win the case given that liberal justices control the court. One of them, Janet Protasiewicz, remarked on the campaign trail that she supports abortion rights.",
      "Monday's two-hour session amounted to little more than political theater. Liberal Justice Rebecca Dallet told Urmanski's attorney, Matthew Thome, that the ban was passed in 1849 by white men who held all the power and that he was ignoring everything that has happened since. Jill Karofsky, another liberal justice, pointed out that the ban provides no exceptions for rape or incest and that reactivation could result in doctors withholding medical care. She told Thome that he was essentially asking the court to sign a \u201cdeath warrant\u201d for women and children in Wisconsin.",
      "\u201cThis is the world gone mad,\u201d Karofsky said.",
      "The ban stood until 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide nullified it. Legislators never repealed the ban, however, and conservatives have argued the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe two years ago reactivated it.",
      "Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul filed a lawsuit challenging the law in 2022. He argued that a 1985 Wisconsin law that prohibits abortion after a fetus reaches the point where it can survive outside the womb supersedes the ban. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation.",
      "Urmanski contends that the ban was never repealed and that it can co-exist with the 1985 law because that law didn\u2019t legalize abortion at any point. Other modern-day abortion restrictions also don\u2019t legalize the practice, he argues.",
      "Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled last year that the ban outlaws feticide \u2014 which she defined as the killing of a fetus without the mother\u2019s consent \u2014 but not consensual abortions. The ruling emboldened Planned Parenthood to resume offering abortions in Wisconsin after halting procedures after Roe was overturned.",
      "Urmanski asked the state Supreme Court in February to overturn Schlipper\u2019s ruling without waiting for a lower appellate decision.",
      "Thome told the justices on Monday that he wasn't arguing about the implications of reactivating the ban. He maintained that the legal theory that new laws implicitly repeal old ones is shaky. He also contended that the ban and the newer abortion restrictions can overlap just like laws establishing different penalties for the same crime. A ruling that the 1985 law effectively repealed the ban would be \u201canti-democratic,\u201d Thome added.",
      "\u201cIt's a statute this Legislature has not repealed and you're saying, no, you actually repealed it,\u201d he said.",
      "Dallet shot back that disregarding laws passed over the last 40 years to go back to 1849 would be undemocratic.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin filed a separate lawsuit in February asking the state Supreme Court to rule directly on whether a constitutional right to abortion exists in the state. The justices have agreed to take the case but haven't scheduled oral arguments yet.",

      "LONDON -- Details of a proposed law to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales have been published, rekindling debate on the controversial topic ahead of a vote in Parliament later this month.",
      "The draft bill, published Monday, proposes allowing terminally ill adults expected to have less than six months to live to ask for and be provided with help to end their own life, subject to safeguards and protections.",
      "Opponents have voiced concerns that the bill would mean people could become pressured to end their lives.",
      "But Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater, who proposed the bill, said the law has robust safeguards built into it and contains \u201cthree layers of scrutiny\" \u2014 two doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision.",
      "A debate and first vote on the bill is expected to take place on Nov. 29.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday he will study the details of the bill and \u201cwill not be putting pressure on any MP (Member of Parliament) to vote one way or the other.\u201d",
      "Here's a look at what's in the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill and the next steps:",
      "Under the draft legislation, only those over 18-years-old in England and Wales and who are expected to die within six months can request assisted dying.",
      "They must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and will be required to make two separate declarations about their wish to die. Two independent doctors have to be satisfied the person is eligible and a High Court judge will need to approve the decision.",
      "Anyone found guilty of pressuring, coercing or dishonestly getting someone to make a declaration that they wish to die will face up to 14 years in prison.",
      "Assisted suicide is currently banned in most parts of the U.K. It is not a specific criminal offense in Scotland, but assisting the death of someone can result in a criminal charge.",
      "The patient must self-administer the life-ending medication themselves. No doctor or anyone else can give the medication.",
      "No health professional is under any obligation to provide assistance to the patient.",
      "Doctors who do take part would have to be satisfied the person making their declaration to die has made it voluntarily. They also must ensure the person is making an informed choice.",
      "The bill will be debated in Parliament and lawmakers will be able to vote on it according to their conscience, rather than along party lines.",
      "Opinion among lawmakers appears to be divided, though some senior ministers including Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he intended to vote against the bill. Starmer has previously supported assisted dying, but the government says it will remain neutral on the issue.",
      "If the bill passes the first stage in the House of Commons, it will face further scrutiny and votes in both Houses of Parliament. Leadbeater suggested that any new law is unlikely to come into effect within the next two to three years.",
      "One argument supporting the bill is that wealthy individuals can travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to go there to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones to die.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different to euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves healthcare practitioners killing patients with a lethal injection at their request and in specific circumstances."

      "A ship suspected of carrying a large amount of hazardous waste has been allowed to dock at Albania\u2019s main port, where its cargo was being unloaded for inspection",
      "TIRANA, Albania -- A ship suspected of carrying a large amount of hazardous waste was allowed to dock on Friday at Albania\u2019s main port, where its cargo was being unloaded for inspection on the orders of the prosecutor, officials said.",
      "Albania had prevented the Turkish-flagged Moliva XA443A from docking early last week at the port of Durres, 33 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital, Tirana, after a watchdog alerted authorities that it was carrying hazardous waste.",
      "Instead, the ship was kept at an anchorage place away from the port.",
      "The prosecutors then ordered the containers to be seized and stored \u201cat an environmentally\" safe place. Once unloaded, the containers are expected to be sent to an agency in Porto Romano, 6 kilometers (4 miles) away, for inspection.",
      "The prosecutor\u2019s office has asked different institutions to conduct lab tests of the cargo.",
      "The Seattle-based non-government organization Basel Action Network, or BAN, which focuses on environmental issues, flagged the ship to authorities in August after receiving information from a whistleblower that the containers on board are suspected to be carrying an estimated 2,100 tons of toxic dust from pollution control filters from the steel industry.",
      "The dust is suspected to have originated at an Albanian company and that it was also illegally smuggled to Albania from neighboring Kosovo and Germany.",
      "BAN said the containers left Durres on July 4 on two Maersk-chartered ships with the intended destination of Thailand. The group said it alerted several transit countries and collaborated with EARTH, a Thai environmental organization, and together raised the alarm about the shipment.",
      "Thailand refused to accept the shipment, asking authorities in Singapore to stop it. The ships then docked at a Turkish port and the containers were loaded on the Turkish-flagged ship, which briefly stopped at the Italian port of Gioia Tauro before going to Albania, BAN said.",
      "The customs documentation stated the containers contained iron oxide, according to local reports.",
      "\u201cThe case is under investigation from the Durres prosecutor's office and the Ministry of Tourism and Environment is cooperating for anything that the justice institution asks for,\u201d ministry spokesperson Erjon Uka told The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "Albania's opposition accused the government in August of taking part in illegally trafficking hazardous material.",
      "Prime Minister Edi Rama said in Parliament in September that the shipment\u2019s documents were verified and that iron oxide is \u201cnot considered as toxic waste in the European catalogs on which the environmental and customs procedure of our country is based.\u201d",
      "Speaking to a parliamentary commission on Friday, Environment Minister Mirela Kumbaro said the case should not be politically exploited to spread panic.",
      "She urged for calm to allow the investigation to proceed.",
      "The ship, she said, is suspected of carrying hazardous waste but \u201chazardous waste does not mean toxic\u201d waste, adding that transport companies had declared the cargo consisted of \u201cnormal goods\u201d \u2014 and that it was only now being described as hazardous waste.",
      "The Seattle-based NGO has called on Albanian authorities to have a public opening and sampling of the containers to ensure transparency of the investigation.",
      "BAN has also said that while Albania is looking to join the European Union and the government has been eager to align its hazardous waste policy with that of the 27-nation bloc, it should ban \u201cthe export of hazardous wastes, household wastes, electronic wastes and plastic wastes to developing countries.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Department of Treasury said in a statement on Tuesday that Abdel Rahman Juma Barakallah led the Rapid Support Forces campaign in West Darfur, committing human rights abuses against civilians, including sexual violence and ethnically-motivated attacks. The United Nations and international rights groups have said the atrocities in Sudan amount to war crimes.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s action underscores our commitment to hold accountable those who seek to facilitate these horrific acts of violence against vulnerable civilian populations in Sudan,\u201d said Bradley T. Smith, the acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.",

      "The treasury department said Barakallah also played a key role in the kidnapping and killing West Darfur Governor Khamis Abbakar.",
      "The war in Sudan broke out in April 2023 when simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital Khartoum and spread to other regions including Darfur. The U.N. says over 20,000 people have been killed in the war and more than 33,000 injured.",
      "The war forcibly displaced 11.6 million Sudanese, including 8.3 million people internally and 3.1 million people who fled to neighboring countries. The conflict also resulted in the outbreak of diseases and food insecurity.",
      "Tuesday's sanctions came after the U.N. Security Council\u2019s decision last week to add Barakallah and Maj. Gen. Osman Mohamed Hamid Mohamed, head of the paramilitary\u2019s operations department, to the sanctions blacklist. The treasury department previously designated Mohamed in May.",
      "The U.S. sanctions against Barakallah means he is subjected to U.S. visa restrictions, and that any properties and interests he has in the U.S. or are in control of U.S. citizens are blocked and must be reported to the Treasury Department.",

Algoney controls the UAE-based Tradive General Trading LLC, a front company that imported vehicles to Sudan on behalf of the paramilitary RSF and retrofitted them with machine guns."

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Hard-right Dutch political leader Geert Wilders on Wednesday blamed \u201cMoroccans\u201d for attacks on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam last week, asserting that they \u201cwant to destroy Jews\u201d and recommending the deportation of people convicted of involvement if they have dual nationality.",
      "While lawmakers condemned antisemitism and agreed that perpetrators of the violence should be prosecuted and handed harsh punishments, opposition legislators accused Wilders of \u201cpouring oil on the fire\u201d and said his statements during a parliamentary debate were not conducive to \u201ca better society.\u201d",
      "Violence erupted in the Dutch capital before and after last week's soccer match between Ajax Amsterdam and Maccabi Tel Aviv. Fans from both sides were involved in unrest; a number of Maccabi fans attacked a cab and chanted anti-Arab slogans while some men carried out \u201chit and run\u201d attacks on people they thought were Jews, according to Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema.",
      "After the match, parts of a large group of Maccabi supporters armed with sticks ran around \u201cdestroying things,\u201d a 12-page report on the violence issued by Amsterdam authorities said. There were also \u201crioters, moving in small groups, by foot, scooter or car, quickly attacking Maccabi fans before disappearing,\u201d it said.",
      "Amsterdam police said five people were treated in hospital for injuries. Police detained dozens of people before the match, but there were no immediate arrests for violence after it.",
      "On Wednesday night, hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered on Amsterdam's central Dam Square to hold a demonstration despite a new city ban on such gatherings. Large numbers of police, including some on horseback, were present and detained most of the protesters after they refused to leave, escorting them mostly peacefully into two buses and driving them away from the square.",
      "Reports of antisemitic speech, vandalism and violence have been on the rise in Europe since the start of the war in Gaza, and tensions were high in Amsterdam ahead of the soccer match. The assaults on Maccabi fans sparked outrage and were widely condemned as antisemitic.",
      "The violence badly tarnished Amsterdam's long-held image as a haven of tolerance and sparked soul-searching across the country.",
      "Wilders, whose anti-immigration Party for Freedom won elections last year and now is part of a four-party ruling coalition government, said Wednesday that on the night Amsterdam commemorated Kristallnacht, the 1938 anti-Jewish pogrom in Nazi Germany, \u201cwe saw Muslims hunting Jews on the streets of Amsterdam,\u201d and blamed \u201dMoroccans who want to destroy Jews.\"",
      "He gave no evidence. Police and prosecutors have not disclosed the identities of any of the suspects that were detained, in line with Dutch privacy rules.",
      "Wilders advocated canceling the Dutch passports of people convicted of involvement in the violence \u2014 if they have a double passport \u2014 and deporting them.",
      "Wilders, who is sometimes described as the Dutch Donald Trump because of his fierce anti-immigration rhetoric, has lived under round-the-clock protection for 20 years because of death threats from Islamic extremists. He has also long been a staunch supporter of Israel.",
      "Some lawmakers warned that his new comments only served to deepen divisions in Dutch society.",
      "Rob Jetten of the centrist D66 party said Wilders' rhetoric \"does not contribute in any way to healing. In no way does he contribute to bringing our country together, but he throws oil on the fire and thus does not bring solutions against antisemitism and for a better society any closer, but only further away.\u201d",
      "Frans Timmermans, who leads the biggest center-left bloc in parliament, agreed.",
      "\u201cWhat you are doing is just stirring things up, dividing this country when this country needs politicians who bring people together, who bring solutions closer,\" Timmermans said.",
      "In Amsterdam, a prominent Jewish member of the City Council, Itay Garmy, said that although there\u2019s a lot of anger and fear within the Jewish community, inflammatory remarks wouldn\u2019t help.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t use my security or my suffering or my fear as a Jew to create political gains for yourself and make your points about integration, migration or Muslim hate,\u201d Garmy said.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- Legislators from Mexico\u2019s ruling party reelected the head of the National Human Rights Commission on Wednesday despite widespread opposition and her failure to call out the government for abuses.",
      "The reelection of Rosario Piedra in a party-line Senate vote appeared to be another example of the ruling Morena party's attempts to weaken independent oversight bodies. Morena has proposed eliminating a host of other oversight, transparency and freedom-of-information agencies, claiming they cost too much to run.",
      "Mexico's civic and nonprofit rights groups have been almost unanimous in their criticism of Piedra's reelection.",
      "\u201cThis is an undeserved prize for a career marked by inaction, the loss of independence and the weakening of the institution,\u201d the Miguel Agust\u00edn Pro Ju\u00e1rez human rights center wrote on social media.",
      "Piedra is a committed supporter of former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office on Sept. 30, and she once affirmed that none of the deaths caused by the armed forces under his administration were illegal or unjustified. She shared the former president's delight in attacking and criticizing other independent human rights groups.",
      "Since her first election in 2019, Piedra has done little to investigate allegations of massacres or extrajudicial killings by soldiers and members of the militarized National Guard, to whom L\u00f3pez Obrador gave sweeping powers.",
      "Despite receiving over 1,800 citizen complaints against the armed forces between 2020 and 2023, her commission issued only 39 recommendations, and most of the few military cases her commission did follow up on involved abuses committed under previous administrations.",
      "The rights commission has the power to make nonbinding recommendations to government agencies. If they do not agree to follow the recommendations, they are at least required by law to explain why.",
      "Piedra has almost exclusively focused the commission's work on issuing recommendations in cases where people have not received proper health care at government-run hospitals. Those recommendations accomplish little, because they don't address the underlying problem of underfunded, poorly equipped hospitals forced to handle too many patients.",
      "At times Piedra acted as if human rights violations no longer existed under L\u00f3pez Obrador. In 2019, she expressed disbelief when asked about the killing of journalists, despite the fact that almost a dozen were killed in L\u00f3pez Obrador's first year in office.",
      "\u201cAre they killing journalists?\u201d she said with an expression of disbelief.",
      "Piedra comes from a well-known activist family: Her mother founded one of Mexico's first groups to demand answers for families whose relatives had been abducted and disappeared by the government in the 1960s and '70s. But even her mother's group, the Eureka Committee, did not support Piedra's reelection.",
      "\u201cHer actions appear to support impunity for the perpetrators of governmental terrorism, and the government's line of obedience and forgetting\u201d rights abuses, the committee wrote in a statement.",
      "Piedra broke with two important traditions: she was a member of the ruling party up until she was elected to her first term in 2019. The job has usually gone to nonpartisan human rights experts.",
      "And she has openly endorsed and supported government policies and actions. Previous heads of the commission had a more critical relationship with the government.",
      "Piedra also failed to make the final cut for candidates for the post this year in a congressional examination of their qualifications, but was put on the ballot anyway.",
      "That's important, since similar evaluation committees will decide who gets on the ballot in judicial reforms that make federal judges stand for election next year. Activists worry that the same kind of favoritism will come into play in the election of judges.",
      "\u201cThis decision comes after a selection process in which she (Piedra) wasn't found to be the most qualified,\u201d a coalition or rights groups said in a statement. \u201cThat reveals the political, partisan considerations that put her onto the ballot.\u201d",
      "She also apparently falsified a letter of recommendation, after a bishop and human rights activist said a letter she presented to support her reelection had not been signed by him.",

On Sheinbaum's first day in office, the army killed six migrants near the Guatemalan border; 10 days later, soldiers and National Guard killed three bystanders  in the northern border city of Nuevo Laredo while chasing suspects.",
      "Sheinbaum\u2019s third week in office was capped by the killing of a crusading Catholic priest who had been threatened by gangs, and a lopsided encounter in northern Sinaloa state in which soldiers killed 19 drug cartel suspects, but suffered not a scratch themselves. That awakened memories of past human rights abuses, like a 2014 incident in which soldiers killed about a dozen cartel suspects after they had surrendered.",

      "In June, an outspoken volunteer advocate for missing people found an apparent body dumping ground with human remains in Mexico City, embarrassing ruling party officials who had done little to look for such clandestine grave sites. City prosecutors lashed out at her, claiming \u201cthe chain of custody\u201d of the evidence had been manipulated, which could lead to charges.",

      "CHANGCHUN, China -- Crouch through the small metal door and walk down the dark tunnel, and even before you step into the abandoned air raid shelter, the air reverberates with pounding techno beats. Young Chinese holding booze and cigarettes shake and sway in a red-lit passageway, below a big screen rolling through quotations from Chairman Mao.",
      "This is an underground rave in China, part of a subculture growing in hidden corners of the nation\u2019s cities, even as its political and cultural mainstream grow increasingly controlled, staid and predictable.",
      "For Chinese ravers, these gatherings \u2014 often called \u201cye di,\u201d or \u201cwild dances\u201d \u2014 not only offer a rare space for unfettered fun, but signal resistance to the narrowly prescribed future a rigid society expects for them.",
      "By day, Xing Long works in the office of a state-owned company in Changchun, an industrial city in China's northeastern rust belt region.",
      "By night, he\u2019s a DJ and underground rave organizer, a side gig that offers an escape from the humdrum of reviewing corporate contracts.",
      "\u201cMy job cannot make me feel I fulfilled my values,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing to work is like executing a prewritten program.\u201d",
      "Chinese young people face intense pressure and high expectations from the society around them. In recent years, facing bleak economic prospects, Chinese youth culture has been swept by a series of viral slang terms to describe frustration and hopelessness: \u201c 996 \u201d \u2014 the brutal 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week work schedule many companies ask of employees. \u201cInvolution\u201d \u2014 an endless treadmill of pointless competition that fresh graduates face. \u201c Lying flat \u201d \u2014 the growing trend among young people of giving up all ambition and aiming to do as little as possible.",
      "Techno dance parties are an escape from all that for people like Xing. Every time he walks into a rave, the 31-year-old said, his brain \u201cjolts awake like a bang.\u201d",
      "Xing first learned about techno music from a documentary made by the American media company Vice.",
      "\u201cMy eyes brightened up when I heard it,\" he said. \"I should\u2019ve listened to this kind of music earlier.\u201d",
      "Xing began going to raves in Shenzhen, a southern city with a population of 17 million, but when he moved home in 2021 he realized no one else was organizing them.",
      "\u201cI want this city to have an underground techno music scene,\" he said. \"I want to listen to it myself, so I want to make it happen.\u201d",
      "Xing said that the underground techno scene fascinated him because it's \u201creal\u201d even if not perfect, bad, not in the right order, or broken.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a beautiful thing that was deliberately produced into a mold to present to the mainstream.\u201d",
      "In recent years, space for culture and creativity has been shrinking in China as the authorities have ramped up censorship of concerts, shows, and other cultural events. Comedians have been silenced after joking about topics considered politically sensitive. A growing number of independent bookstores and creative spaces have shut down under pressure, while state-sanctioned media promotes uplifting, often saccharine narratives.",
      "Yet underground raves are free from all those limitations because they sprout in gray zones. Hidden from public view, they skirt formal approval processes, neither supported nor suppressed by the state.",
      "Feng Zhe, 27, a rave organizer in Shenyang, a northeastern city about 400 miles from Beijing, said raves are about \u201crefusing to be disciplined by society.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is probably not how the world functions nowadays,\u201d he said, adding that societies want to make people follow their rules and be useful but \"underground culture is useless.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost people are going to be repressed,\" Feng said.",
      "But for most rave organizers, the real meaning of underground rave culture is simply having fun. Loong Wu, a 26-year-old art student, started organizing raves in 2021 during COVID-19 lockdowns out of boredom.",
      "\u201cMy original intention was just to break through the boredom,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you are truly enjoying it, you don\u2019t think about meanings.\u201d",
      "On one recent Saturday night, civil servants, students, an ex-firefighter, girls with dyed hair, and a man with a full face mask and goggles filed into a bar tucked behind a flower shop in downtown Changchun to attend one of Xing\u2019s raves.",
      "They danced to fast-paced industrial techno spun by Du Jizhe, a local part-time DJ who works in HR by day.",
      "He said it\u2019s the natural soundtrack of auto manufacturing cities like Changchun and Detroit, which prides itself on being the birthplace of techno. For Du, techno evokes childhood memories of the auto factory where his father worked.",
      "\u201cTechno is basically industrial noise like hammering and mechanical sounds,\u201d Du said \u201cThese noises exert a subtle influence on people\u2019s ears in industrial cities.\u201d",
      "Chen Xiangyu, a fashion student in an oversized black t-shirt with hair dyed blond, a black leather choker, a lip piercing, and smoky eye makeup, said raves are a pure release.",
      "\u201cThe first time I came, I thought to myself, I don\u2019t know anyone, no one knows me, so nobody\u2019s paying any attention to how I dance, so long as I\u2019m happy, it\u2019s all good,\" she said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t care too much about what others think.\u201d",
      "Even at raves, illegal drugs are rarely seen in China, but promoters still face risks from authorities who have little patience for unapproved social gatherings.",
      "Advertisements promoting raves are often cryptic, with only a date, a DJ line-up, and the cost of admission. Sometimes, the location won\u2019t be revealed until an hour ahead of the party. Some organizers require guests to cover their phone\u2019s camera with a sticker.",
      "Loong Wu said her requirements for a rave spot were no CCTV cameras, no security, and no nearby residents. Even those aren't a guarantee \u2014 local police once busted one of her raves in an industrial port.",
      "\u201cIt was pathetic how few such places exist in the city,\u201d she said.",
      "Frustrated with how hard it was to find a good rave spot, she once organized a public party where she put her DJ equipment on a cart and pushed it through city streets as revelers danced alongside.",
      "\u201cRestrictions exist for sure, but that\u2019s exactly why we need to create our own scene,\u201d she said. \u201cWe always need \u2018wild dances.\u2019 We always need to dance outside of set rules.\u201d",

      "MEXICO CITY -- MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 U.S. Ambassador Ken Salazar lashed out Wednesday at Mexico\u2019s failure to accept aid in the fight against drug cartels, claiming the country \u201cclosed the doors\u201d on security cooperation.",
      "In a press conference, Salazar launched his harshest criticism yet of rampant violence, police corruption and the Mexican government\u2019s mistaken attitude that \u201cthere is no problem.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen they just say \u2018there is no problem, we have these statistics to show people there is no problem,\u2019 that is not based on reality,\u201d\u201c Salazar said. \u201cThere is a very big problem.\u201d",
      "Mexico's foreign relations ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the statements by Salazar.",
      "Salazar cited violence in recent days in the northern state of Sinaloa as an example. Sinaloa state police chief Gerardo M\u00e9rida said Wednesday authorities found a pile of between five and seven bodies on a roadside there, but were still counting body parts to see how many there were.",
      "\u201cThere is a pile of various bodies, with what we have found we have identified five bodies, but some are in pieces, they have been dismembered, there are mentions of seven,\u201d said M\u00e9rida.",
      "Sinaloa's embattled governor, Ruben Rocha, seemed to typify Mexico's attitude when he said Tuesday \u2014after a similar number of dead bodies were dumped on roadsides - that \u201cwe're doing well, we'll get over this soon.\u201d",
      "Salazar countered that in Sinaloa \u201cthe dead can be seen everywhere.\u201d",
      "Salazar had previously defended many of the Mexican government\u2019s actions, but he now says former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s \u201chugs not bullets\u201d strategy of not confronting the cartels \u201cdid not work.\u201d",
      "L\u00f3pez Obrador left office on Sept. 30, but his successor, President Claudia Sheinbaum, has pledged to continue the policy, even though under her leadership troops appear more willing to open fire.",
      "Fighting between two factions of the Sinaloa drug cartel broke out after two drug capos \u2014 one from each faction \u2014 flew to the United States and were arrested there on July 25.",
      "Drug lords Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada and Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez were apprehended in the United States after flying there in a small plane.",
      "Zambada later claimed he was kidnapped and forced aboard the plane by Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, causing a violent battle between Zambada\u2019s faction and the \u201cChapitos\u201d group led by the sons of imprisoned drug lord Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n.",
      "Mexico later blamed the United States for detaining the capos, saying that had caused the outbreak of violence. Salazar said Mexico also shut down anti-drug cooperation after that.",
      "\u201cIt totally accelerated from there, the Mexican government closed its doors,\u201d Salazar said. The ambassador also criticized efforts by both L\u00f3pez Obrador and Sheinbaum to downplay the problem of crime and violence, claiming the problem was being exaggerated and crime statistics were dropping.",
      "Salazar did not clarify why he thought the Mexican government's numbers were untrustworthy, but in recent days the government appears to have changed the way it reports homicide figures.",
      "\u201cThe reality for the Mexican people, and that is for businesspeople, members of the press like you who work on the streets, those who have ranches, like the cattleman killed in Sinaloa over the weekend because he was a leader, they don't live with security,\u201d Salazar said.",
      "The continuing violence \u201cis a very serious problem in Mexico and saying there is no problem, blaming someone else, blaming the United States, obviously is not (the solution)\", he continued.",
      "He also blamed L\u00f3pez Obrador for having refused \u201c$22 million,\u201d an apparent reference to L\u00f3pez Obrador's decision to drop out of the Merida Initiative, a U.S.-funded program to donate money to train and equip Mexican police.",
      "\u201cIt was rejected for ideological problems, and other explanations,\u201d Salazar said. L\u00f3pez Obrador said at the time he didn't want U.S. helicopters and guns, but by that point most of the U.S. money was going for training, professionalization and legal reform.",
      "After taking office on Dec. 1, 2018, L\u00f3pez Obrador also cut funding for police forces and gave the army, navy and militarized National Guard the lead role in law enforcement.",
      "\u201cPolice become corrupt because they don't earn enough to live on,\u201d Salazar said. \u201cYou cannot pay a police officer almost nothing and expect them to do their job.\u201d",
      "Salazar had been previously known for defending L\u00f3pez Obrador despite his constant efforts to militarize law enforcement, concentrate power, eliminate regulatory and oversight bodies and shore up Mexico's government-run companies even at the expense of U.S. firms.",
      "It was unclear if Wednesday's critical turn in his rhetoric was in any way related to the victory of Donald Trump in last week's U.S. presidential elections. Trump has long been fiercely critical of Mexico.",

In recent years, however, several of the companies which supply goods or services to the royal household are not on the list of Royal Warrant holders.",
      "King Frederik took over Denmark's throne last January after his mother, Queen Margrethe II, then Europe\u2019s longest-serving monarch, became the first Danish monarch to voluntarily relinquish the throne in nearly 900 years. Margrethe had stunned the nation when she announced during her traditional New Year\u2019s Eve speech that she would step down for health reasons.",

      "Alexander Kolesnikov spoke to The Associated Press a day after seeing his daughter at a prison near Gomel where the 42-year-old musician-turned-activist is serving her 11-year sentence. The meeting in the prison's hospital took place after her family and friends had not heard anything from the popular and charismatic symbol of resistance for more than 20 months.",
      "\u201cI finally could embrace her,\u201d Kolesnikov said, adding that she \u201cwas in relatively normal condition.\u201d He said he couldn\u2019t comment further because authorities only allowed the brief meeting on condition that he not release any other details.",
      "Kolesnikov said he and his daughter discussed the possibility of appealing to Lukashenko for a pardon. \u201cShe is thinking about it,\u201d he said.",
      "In November 2022, Kolesnikova was moved to an intensive care ward to undergo surgery for a perforated ulcer. Former inmates told her sister, Tatiana Khomich, that the 5-foot-9-inch Kolesnikova weighed only about 45 kilograms (100 pounds).",
      "\u201cWe are very grateful for the permission to meet and thankful to all those involved,\u201d Khomich told AP on Wednesday, voicing hope the authorities would allow the family to maintain contact with Kolesnikova.",
      "A photo of Kolesnikova embracing her father was released by Raman Pratasevich, a former opposition journalist who became a government supporter after his arrest.",
      "Lukashenko, who is seeking a seventh term in an election set for January 2025 to extend his more than 30-year rule, has released 146 political prisoners since July. Those freed had health problems, wrote petitions for pardons and said they repented.",

      "Other top opposition figures also were imprisoned or fled the country amid the sweeping crackdown in which about 65,000 people were arrested and thousands were brutally beaten by police.",
      "Even as Lukashenko has pardoned some political prisoners, Belarusian authorities have launched a new wave of arrests, seeking to uproot any sign of dissent before the election.",
      "Kolesnikova gained prominence when mass protests broke out in Belarus after the widely disputed August 2020 election gave Lukashenko a sixth term. With her close-cropped hair, broad smile and trademark gesture of forming her outstretched hands into the shape of a heart, she often was seen at the front of the demonstrations.",
      "A classical flautist before the protests, Kolesnikova became an even more powerful symbol of defiance the next month when she tore up her passport to avoid deportation when the authorities drove her to the border. A year later, she was convicted of charges including conspiracy to seize power.",
      "Pavel Sapelka of Viasna said allowing Kolesnikova to see her father could be a signal by Lukashenko that he\u2019s open for a dialogue about political prisoners. \"Lukashenko is waiting for Western reaction to the latest steps and is prepared to bargain ahead of January\u2019s election,\u201d Sapelka said."

      "Meanwhile, more than 200 clinics on board vehicles have been roaming the smog-hit province of Punjab since last week in search of people who can't afford treatment and the elderly who can't make it to hospitals, a top government official at the Health Department, Aun Abbas, said.",
      "Abbas said the mobile clinics are equipped to handle basic laboratory tests and doctors onboard can prescribe medication as needed.",
      "Uzma Bukhari, a spokesperson for the Punjab provincial government, said more than 2.1 million patients affected by smog have so far been treated at state-owned hospitals, adding the number is expected to grow.",
      "Schools in the province have been ordered to shut down until Nov. 17, to protect children, and all parks and museums until Nov. 18. Doctors have urged people to avoid unnecessary travel and wear face masks.",
      "\u201cMost patients with respiratory-related diseases are coming to hospitals because they did not wear face masks,\u201d said Azam Mushtaq, a medical specialist at Nishtar Hospital in Multan told The Associated Press.",
      "Asthma patients seemed to suffer the most as they had a hard time breathing even after being admitted and provided with oxygen support, according to an AP reporter on the scene.",
      "However, many violate the mask mandate and are being fined by authorities. Traffic police also penalize drivers whose vehicles emit smoke.",
      "Weather forecasters predict light rain in some of the areas in Punjab, which can help improve air quality. The government has also said it is looking into methods to induce artificial rainfall to combat the pollution in Punjab.",

      "Italy's president has sharply rebuked Elon Musk",
      "ROME -- Italian President Sergio Mattarella sharply rebuked Elon Musk on Wednesday for weighing in on Italian court rulings that have stymied the government\u2019s plans to process some asylum-seekers in Albania.",
      "Musk, who is expected to have a top advisory role in Donald Trump\u2019s new administration, wrote Tuesday on X that \u201cthese judges need to go.\u201d He was referring to the latest Italian court ruling against right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni\u2019s much-touted Albania immigration deal.",
      "\u201cThis is unacceptable. Do the people of Italy live in a democracy or does an unelected autocracy make the decisions?\u201d he wrote in a subsequent post Wednesday.",
      "The posts concerned a Rome court's refusal to rule on a formal request to detain seven migrants rescued at sea and transferred to Albania for processing. Monday's ruling resulted in the men being brought to Italy for processing.",
      "Mattarella didn\u2019t cite Musk by name but \u2014 in an unusually piqued statement \u2014 made clear on Wednesday that he was referring to him. Italy's head of state demanded respect for the country's sovereignty, especially from other soon-to-be public officials.",
      "\u201cItaly is a great democratic country and \u2026 knows how to take care of itself while respecting its Constitution,\u201d Mattarella said in a statement issued by his spokesman.",
      "\u201cAnyone, particularly if as announced is about to assume an important role of government in a friendly and allied country, must respect its sovereignty and cannot attribute to himself the task of imparting prescriptions,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Trump announced Tuesday that Musk, one of the most influential people around the U.S. president-elect, would help lead a Department of Government Efficiency, essentially an independent advisory panel to eliminate waste and fraud.",
      "Musk is a supporter of Meloni and has met with her in Rome on a few occasions, and in September joined her at an awards ceremony on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Photos of them together made such news that Musk seemingly felt the need to tamp down speculation by posting \u201cWe are not dating.\u201d",
      "Musk has a history of making provocative statements and sparring with leaders on X. Earlier this year, he posted messages insulting U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and saying the United Kingdom was headed for civil war. He has also clashed with a Brazilian supreme court justice over free speech, far-right accounts and purported misinformation on X, and also accused Venezuela\u2019s socialist president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, of \u201cmajor election fraud\u201d after that country\u2019s disputed election.",
      "Later Wednesday, an Italian representative of X, Andrea Stroppa, tweeted what appeared to be a statement from Musk that said he had spoken during the day with Meloni. According to Stroppa's tweet, Musk \u201cexpresses his respect\u201d for Mattarella and the Italian Constitution but insists on his right to freedom of expression.",
      "The courts\u2019 rulings have raised the ire of Meloni\u2019s far-right-led government, which has been seeking strategies to ease the strain on Italy of the arrival of migrants seeking a better life in Europe. The government had held up the opening of the Albanian centers as a centerpiece of its immigration crackdown, also as a means of deterrence, and said they could be a model for Europe.",
      "In both cases, Italian courts referred the cases to the EU court of justice in Luxembourg to rule if the countries of origin for the migrants are considered safe for repatriation. There is no word on when the European court might rule.",
      "But as a result of the Rome court decisions, no migrant has yet been processed in the Albanian centers, which are budgeted to cost Italy 670 million euros ($730 million) over five years to build and operate.",
      "Italy's opposition says the money could be much better spent on reinforcing Italian-operated migrant processing centers, while human rights groups say the outsourcing of asylum processing contravenes international law.",
      "The centers opened in October after a months-long delay, because crumbling soil at one of the facilities needed to be repaired. They are run by Italy and are under the country's jurisdiction, while Albanian guards provide external security."

      "Protests have erupted in Paris against a controversial gala organized by far-right figures in support of Israel",
      "PARIS -- Protests erupted in Paris on Wednesday against a controversial gala organized by far-right figures in support of Israel. The event, intended to raise funds for the Israeli military, included Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich among its invited guests.",
      "The demonstrations came on the eve of a high-stakes soccer match at France's national stadium against the Israeli national team, overshadowed by tensions around the wars in the Middle East. Authorities in Paris announced that more than 4,000 police officers and 1,600 stadium staff will be deployed for the game.",
      "Smotrich, a vocal advocate of Israeli settlements, had been expected to attend Wednesday's gala, dubbed \u201cIsrael is Forever,\u201d which was planned by an association of the same name. The group\u2019s stated goal is to \u201cmobilize French-speaking Zionist forces.\u201d",
      "After days of growing criticism of the event, Smotrich's office confirmed Wednesday that the minister would not travel to Paris to participate.",
      "But the invitation to Smotrich drew sharp criticism from local associations, unions and left-wing political parties, prompting two protests in the French capital. The minister, a hard-line settler leader, has been accused of inflaming tensions in the West Bank and drew international condemnations this week by saying he hopes the election of Donald Trump will clear the way for Israeli annexation of the West Bank \u2014 a step that would extinguish Palestinian statehood dreams.",
      "The French Foreign Ministry called Smotrich\u2019s remarks \u201ccontrary to international law\u201d and counterproductive to efforts to reduce regional tensions.",
      "\u201cFrance reiterates its commitment to the implementation of the two-state solution, with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security, which is the only prospect for a just and lasting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.",
      "Critics also pointed at Nili Kupfer-Naouri, president of the \u201cIsrael is Forever\u201d association, who sparked outrage in 2023, after the Israel-Hamas war started, when she tweeted that \u201cno civilian in Gaza was innocent.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday night, several hundred protesters marched through central Paris, denouncing the event as a \u201cgala of hatred and shame.\u201d",
      "\u201cImagine if an association were hosting a gala for Hezbollah or Hamas \u2014 there\u2019s no way the police would allow that,\u201d said Melkir Saib, a 30-year-old protester. \u201cThe situation is just unfair.\u201d",
      "The march was largely peaceful, but some demonstrators broke windows at a McDonald's along the route.",
      "A separate group, including Jewish leftist organizations opposed to racism and antisemitism, gathered near the Arc de Triomphe chanting slogans against the gala and Smotrich.",
      "French authorities defended the event, with Paris police chief Laurent Nunez stating that the gala posed \u201cno major threat to public order.\u201d",
      "The protests came days after tensions flared in Paris and Amsterdam related to the conflicts in the Mideast. A massive \u201cFree Palestine\u201d banner was displayed during a Paris Saint-Germain Champions League match against Atletico Madrid, while violence broke out in Amsterdam last week targeting fans of an Israeli soccer club."

      "A hacking group that is believed to be Chinese state-sponsored has compromised two websites with ties to the Tibetan community in an attack meant to install malware on users\u2019 computers",
      "BANGKOK -- A hacking group that is believed to be Chinese state-sponsored has compromised two websites with ties to the Tibetan community in an attack meant to install malware on users' computers, according to findings released Wednesday by a private cybersecurity firm.",
      "The hack of the Tibet Post and Gyudmed Tantric University websites appears geared toward obtaining access to the computers of people visiting to obtain information on them and their activities, according to the analysis by the Insikt Group, the threat research division of the Massachusetts-based cybersecurity consultancy Recorded Future.",
      "The hackers, known in the report as TAG-112, compromised the websites so that visitors are prompted to download a malicious executable file disguised as a security certificate, Insikt Group said. Once opened, the file loads Cobalt Strike Beacon malware on the user's computer that can be used for key logging, file transferring and other purposes, including deploying additional malware.",
      "\u201cWhile we do not have visibility into the activity that TAG-112 conducted on compromised devices in this campaign, given their likely cyber espionage remit and the targeting of the Tibetan community, it is almost certain that they were engaged in information collection and/or surveillance rather than destructive attacks,\u201d Insikt Group senior director Jon Condra told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThis behavior aligns with historical targeting of the Tibetan community,\u201d he said.",
      "Chinese authorities have consistently denied any form of state-sponsored hacking, saying China itself is a major target of cyberattacks.",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was not aware of the hacking of the two websites reported by the Insikt Group.",
      "\u201cChina's stance on the issue of cybersecurity is consistent and clear,\u201d the ministry said in a faxed reply to a request for comment without elaborating.",
      "According to the Insikt group research, the sites were first compromised in late May and the attacks bear many overlaps with a previously tracked hacker group known as TAG-102, leading analysts to conclude it is a subgroup of the already known group \u201cworking toward the same or similar intelligence requirements,\u201d Insikt Group said.",
      "Overlaps include reuse of specific tactics, techniques and procedures and going after identical targets, Condra said.",
      "\u201cThese two threat clusters are almost certainly interrelated,\u201d he said.",
      "TAG-102, known by multiple names such as Evasive Panda and StormBamboo, has been in operation since as early as 2012, and is widely thought to be a Chinese-sponsored advanced persistent threat, or APT, group, Insikt Group said.",
      "Among other things, it uses custom malware frameworks used by other Chinese APT groups and its targeting \u201caligns with likely Chinese intelligence requirements,\u201d Condra said.",
      "\u201cThe group has engaged in a wide variety of campaigns over the years, with an emphasis on targeting individuals and organizations in opposition to the Chinese government, such as human rights organizations, religious organizations, ethnic minority groups, academic institutions, and supporters of democracy or independence movements in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and even in mainland China,\u201d Insikt Group said.",
      "The university and the news website, which are both located in India, have been informed by Insikt Group of the hack. As of this week, it appears the Gyudmed Tantric University, which is a place of learning about Tibetan Buddhism, language, history and culture, has remediated the problem while the news website remained compromised, Condra said.",
      "The Tibet Post is known for promoting democracy, freedom of speech and for advocating Tibetan independence from China, he said.",
      "China claims Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, although it only established firm control over the Himalayan region after the Communist Party swept to power during a civil war in 1949.",
      "Many Tibetans' loyalties still lie with the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader who has lived in exile in India since a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959.",
      "China has been regularly accused of human rights abuses in Tibet, including earlier this year over its efforts to forcibly urbanize villagers and herders as part of a drive to assimilate rural Tibetans through control over their language and traditional Buddhist culture."

      "The Nuclear Regulation Authority said the Tsuruga No. 2 reactor is \u201cunfit\u201d as its operator failed to address safety risks stemming from the presence of possible active fault lines, which can potentially cause earthquakes, underneath it.",
      "Tsuruga No. 2, operated by the Japan Atomic Power Co., is the first reactor to be rejected under safety standards adopted in 2013 based on lessons from the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi meltdown disaster following a massive earthquake and tsunami.",
      "\u201cWe reached our conclusion based on a very strict examination,\u201d NRA chairperson Shinsuke Yamanaka told reporters.",
      "The verdict comes after more than eight years of safety reviews that were repeatedly disrupted by data coverups and mistakes by the operator, Yamanaka said. He called the case \u201cabnormal\u201d and urged the utility to take the result seriously.",
      "The decision is a blow to Japan Atomic Power because it virtually ends its hopes for a restart. The operator, which is decommissioning its other reactor, Tsuruga No. 1, had hoped to put No. 2 back online, but it would require an examination of dozens of faults around the reactor to prove their safety.",
      "\u201cThe decision is extremely regrettable,\" Japan Atomic Power said in a statement. It said it will continue efforts to restart.",
      "An NRA safety panel concluded three months ago it could not rule out the possibility of active fault lines about 300 meters (330 yards) north of the No. 2 reactor stretching to right underneath the facility, meaning the reactor cannot be operated.",
      "Japan\u2019s government in 2022 adopted a plan to maximize the use of nuclear energy, pushing to accelerate reactor restarts to secure a stable energy supply and meet its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that safety is the prerequisite for nuclear plant operation and that the government respects the scientific and highly technical decision by the watchdog. He said the government's position to promote nuclear energy is unchanged.",
      "Concern about the government\u2019s revived push for nuclear energy grew after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit Japan\u2019s Noto Peninsula on Jan. 1, 2024, killing more than 400 people and damaging more than 100,000 structures. The quake caused minor damage to two nearby nuclear facilities, and evacuation plans for the region were found to be inadequate.",
      "Building key nuclear facilities, such as reactors, directly above active fault lines is prohibited in earthquake-prone Japan.",
      "Yamanaka said the NRA is not immediately ordering a decommissioning because the reactor, which is offline and its spent fuel safely cooled, will not pose a major threat.",
      "If the utility decides to reapply, it must address not only the faults issue but it also must implement adequate safety measures for the entire plant, Yamanaka said. Providing scientific proof of the status of faults underneath key nuclear facilities is difficult, but other operators that obtained restart permits all cleared the requirement, he noted.",
      "The Tsuruga No. 2 reactor first started commercial operation in February 1987 and has been offline since May 2011. The operator rejected the NRA panel's 2013 on-site inspection results, which concluded that the faults under the No. 2 reactor were active, and applied for a restart in 2015.",
      "Of more than 50 commercial reactors, 27 have applied for restarts and 17 of them have been approved so far under the post-Fukushima safety standard."

    "story": [
      "Seven-year-old Halima Abou Yassine was brought to Lebanon from Gaza for treatment after an Israeli strike left her near death with a gaping wound in her skull",
      "BEIRUT -- When Zarifa Nawfal\u2019s family arrived in Beirut for her wounded daughter\u2019s surgery, one of the first things she wanted to do was go to the sea. The Mediterranean had been a constant companion at their home in Gaza before the war.",
      "\u201cThe moment I smelled the sea, I felt at peace inside \u2014 as if I were in Gaza,\u201d she said.",
      "But soon their place of refuge reminded her of home in far more distressing ways.",
      "Nawfal\u2019s 7-year-old daughter, Halima Abou Yassine, is one of a dozen severely wounded Palestinian children brought to Lebanon this year for treatment through a program launched by a British-Palestinian surgeon, Dr. Ghassan Abu Sitta.",
      "But months after their arrival, Lebanon is itself embroiled in a war some fear will end in Gaza-like destruction.",
      "In February, Nawfal was staying with her five children and her mother in an apartment in central Gaza. They had been displaced from their home in the north and Nawfal\u2019s husband was missing, likely dead.",
      "The children were filling water containers outside when two missiles struck, Nawfal said. She rushed outside and found Halima, the youngest, lying in the street, her skull cracked open, her brain exposed.",
      "Through her shock, Nawfal said, \u201cI was relieved that her body was in one piece.\u201d In Gaza, blasts often ripped people apart, leaving their loved ones without even a body to bury.",
      "Halima\u2019s brother was unconscious next to her. He was quickly revived at the hospital. But staff at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital confirmed Nawfal\u2019s fears, she said: Halima was dead. Her small body was placed in the morgue.",
      "But as the family was preparing to bury her, the little girl\u2019s uncle noticed faint signs of life, the family said.",
      "Officials at Al-Aqsa hospital could not be reached to confirm the account. But Abu Sitta, who has worked in several Gaza hospitals during the war, said in the chaotic situation it was not uncommon for patients to be misidentified as dead because normal protocols for emergency room examinations were often abandoned.",
      "\u201cBecause of the sheer number of cases that would come in with each air raid ... the ambulance staff would take to the morgue immediately those who they thought were dead,\" he said.",
      "In the days after her daughter was determined to be alive, Nawfal stayed with her, manually pumping oxygen into her lungs. After a week, the little girl began to breathe on her own. Finally, she woke up.",
      "\u201cSome of the doctors cried and said this is a miracle,\u201d Nawfal said.",
      "But they were unable to do more than keep the little girl alive. Her skull was still gaping open, a shard of bone missing. Her brain was beset by infection.",
      "The family was evacuated to Egypt in May. In July, they boarded a plane for Lebanon.",
      "The first of the wounded Palestinian children arrived in Lebanon in May. Five-year-old Adam Afana had nearly lost his left arm in a blast that killed his father and sister. His arm was paralyzed and he needed a complex surgery to correct the nerve damage.",
      "At the time, Lebanon was already embroiled in a low-simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "The Lebanese militant group began firing rockets across the border into Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Palestinian militants staged the deadly surprise incursion into southern Israel that sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes.",
      "For months, the conflict in Lebanon was mainly confined to the border area, far from Beirut.",
      "Abu Sitta said he chose Lebanon for the wounded children's treatment because the Mediterranean country has specialists with wide experience treating war injuries.",
      "Lebanon has been through its share of conflicts, including a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990 and a brutal monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, as well as spillover effects from other regional conflicts.",
      "\u201cEven after the end of the wars (in Lebanon), the wounded from Iraq and Syria would come here for that kind of complex and multistage treatment,\u201d Abu Sitta said.",
      "In July, Halima underwent successful surgery to repair her skull at the American University of Beirut Medical Center.",
      "Nawfal said her daughter has lingering memory problems but is improving with therapy. A chipper, happy-go-lucky child, Halima thrived in Beirut. She swam in the hotel pool, loved to color and played with the other children from Gaza. She walked with her siblings to pick out fruit at the neighborhood produce stand, a straw hat covering the scar on the back of her head.",
      "In mid-September, Israel launched an offensive against Hezbollah. It pummeled wide swathes of Lebanon with airstrikes, including Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs and some sites within the city center.",
      "The children quickly snapped back into wartime habits. They cracked open the balcony's sliding glass doors to prevent the glass shattering from the pressure of a blast and began sleeping in the central sitting room in the family\u2019s hotel suite, away from windows.",
      "Nawfal said some organizations offered to evacuate the family from Lebanon to continue treatment elsewhere, but she \u201ccompletely refused.\u201d",
      "\u201cLebanon isn\u2019t just another Arab country or a country we came to for treatment \u2014 Lebanon is a sister to Gaza,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are like two souls in one body. ... We live or die together.\u201d",
      "Adam Afana's uncle, Eid Afana, said the escalation in Lebanon \u201creminds us of the beginning of the war in Gaza.\u201d Afana said the sound of airstrikes frightened Adam, who felt the war was pursuing them.",
      "\u201cWhat we hope for Lebanon is that what happened in Gaza won\u2019t happen here \u2014 that the beginning and the ending won\u2019t both be the same,\u201d Afana said.",
      "The Ghassan Abu Sitta Fund halted bringing wounded Palestinian children to Lebanon but continues to treat the existing patients \u2014 with some challenges.",
      "Since arriving in Beirut, Adam has undergone a procedure to clear infection from his bones, a neurosurgery and regular physiotherapy sessions. With effort, he can now slightly clench his hand.",
      "But the final operation \u2014 a muscle transfer and surgery to repair the damaged nerves to his arm \u2014 is on hold.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just a handful of people who specialize in this globally, and we were expecting one of them to come to Lebanon,\u201d Abu Sitta said. The trip has been delayed by the escalation in Lebanon.",
      "When he first launched the program, Abu Sitta hoped to treat 50 Palestinian children from Gaza at any given time. Unable to bring more patients in, the team is turning its resources to treating Lebanese children.",
      "The numbers of wounded Lebanese children are still far lower than in Gaza. As of last week, Lebanon\u2019s Ministry of Public Health said 192 children had been killed and at least 1,255 wounded since October 2023. In Gaza, more than 13,000 children have been killed and thousands more have been wounded, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "Abu Sitta said the wounds of children in Lebanon are \u201cidentical to the injuries of Palestinian children from Gaza.\u201d Most were wounded while at home. They suffered \u201ccrush injuries to the limbs, blast injuries to the face\u201d and often \u201cmultiple members of the family killed at the same time,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAs in Gaza, this war takes its toll on children,\u201d he said. \u201cAll wars are waged on children.\u201d"

      "A hacking group that is believed to be Chinese state-sponsored has compromised two websites with ties to the Tibetan community in an attack meant to install malware on users\u2019 computers",
      "BANGKOK -- A hacking group that is believed to be Chinese state-sponsored has compromised two websites with ties to the Tibetan community in an attack meant to install malware on users' computers, according to findings released Wednesday by a private cybersecurity firm.",
      "The hack of the Tibet Post and Gyudmed Tantric University websites appears geared toward obtaining access to the computers of people visiting to obtain information on them and their activities, according to the analysis by the Insikt Group, the threat research division of the Massachusetts-based cybersecurity consultancy Recorded Future.",
      "The hackers, known in the report as TAG-112, compromised the websites so that visitors are prompted to download a malicious executable file disguised as a security certificate, Insikt Group said. Once opened, the file loads Cobalt Strike Beacon malware on the user's computer that can be used for key logging, file transferring and other purposes, including deploying additional malware.",
      "\u201cWhile we do not have visibility into the activity that TAG-112 conducted on compromised devices in this campaign, given their likely cyber espionage remit and the targeting of the Tibetan community, it is almost certain that they were engaged in information collection and/or surveillance rather than destructive attacks,\u201d Insikt Group senior director Jon Condra told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThis behavior aligns with historical targeting of the Tibetan community,\u201d he said.",
      "Chinese authorities have consistently denied any form of state-sponsored hacking, saying China itself is a major target of cyberattacks.",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was not aware of the hacking of the two websites reported by the Insikt Group.",
      "\u201cChina's stance on the issue of cybersecurity is consistent and clear,\u201d the ministry said in a faxed reply to a request for comment without elaborating.",
      "According to the Insikt group research, the sites were first compromised in late May and the attacks bear many overlaps with a previously tracked hacker group known as TAG-102, leading analysts to conclude it is a subgroup of the already known group \u201cworking toward the same or similar intelligence requirements,\u201d Insikt Group said.",
      "Overlaps include reuse of specific tactics, techniques and procedures and going after identical targets, Condra said.",
      "\u201cThese two threat clusters are almost certainly interrelated,\u201d he said.",
      "TAG-102, known by multiple names such as Evasive Panda and StormBamboo, has been in operation since as early as 2012, and is widely thought to be a Chinese-sponsored advanced persistent threat, or APT, group, Insikt Group said.",
      "Among other things, it uses custom malware frameworks used by other Chinese APT groups and its targeting \u201caligns with likely Chinese intelligence requirements,\u201d Condra said.",
      "\u201cThe group has engaged in a wide variety of campaigns over the years, with an emphasis on targeting individuals and organizations in opposition to the Chinese government, such as human rights organizations, religious organizations, ethnic minority groups, academic institutions, and supporters of democracy or independence movements in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and even in mainland China,\u201d Insikt Group said.",
      "The university and the news website, which are both located in India, have been informed by Insikt Group of the hack. As of this week, it appears the Gyudmed Tantric University, which is a place of learning about Tibetan Buddhism, language, history and culture, has remediated the problem while the news website remained compromised, Condra said.",
      "The Tibet Post is known for promoting democracy, freedom of speech and for advocating Tibetan independence from China, he said.",
      "China claims Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, although it only established firm control over the Himalayan region after the Communist Party swept to power during a civil war in 1949.",
      "Many Tibetans' loyalties still lie with the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader who has lived in exile in India since a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959.",
      "China has been regularly accused of human rights abuses in Tibet, including earlier this year over its efforts to forcibly urbanize villagers and herders as part of a drive to assimilate rural Tibetans through control over their language and traditional Buddhist culture."

      "\u201cWith this port, we\u2019re looking at the entire Pacific coast, from the United States and Canada all the way to Chile,\u201d Peruvian Foreign Minister Elmer Schialer told The Associated Press in his office on Monday. \u201cThe shipping business is being transformed.\u201d",
      "Peruvian Economy Minister Jos\u00e9 Arista said in June during a visit to China that the country\u2019s neighbors \u2014 Brazil, Colombia, Chile \u2014 are \u201cmaking constant trips to and from to see how they can modify their supply chain to use this port,\u201d which will cut shipping time to Beijing by 10 days.",
      "China\u2019s trade with the region ballooned 35-fold from 2000 to 2022, reaching nearly $500 billion, according to data from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. Most of the region's exports came from South America and were concentrated in five products: soybeans, copper and iron ore, oil and copper cathodes.",
      "At the same time, China\u2019s diplomatic engagement in the region has become more effective, with Xi visiting 11 Latin American countries since becoming president, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s main state news agency. Brazil, host of the G20 summit, and Peru will bestow the rare honor of a full state visit to Xi this month, but not to Biden.",
      "The misguided notion that Latin America must choose between its two largest trading partners is \u201ca strategic defeat\u201d for the U.S., said Eric Farnsworth, vice president at the Washington-based Council of the Americas.",
      "\u201cThe idea that China is somehow a better partner is increasingly being heard around the region and I think Xi wants to solidify that and amplify that,\u201d Farnsworth said.",
      "Roughly a decade after China poured billions of dollars into building power plants, roads, airports and other infrastructure that saddled some developing countries with unserviceable debt, few expect Beijing to direct more massive loans to Latin America through its Belt and Road Initiative. But deeper cooperation on other infrastructure is possible, particularly renewable energy and telecommunications, said the Boston University Bulletin.",
      "The U.S. has appealed to Latin American governments to reject telecoms investment, particularly opposing Huawei, the Chinese tech giant that it argues could open the door to Chinese government spying. Similarly, U.S. officials have raised concerns over the Chancay port\u2019s possible dual-use by Beijing\u2019s navy in the Pacific \u2014 a prospect dismissed by Chinese officials.",
      "China \u201cis working to exploit insecurity in our hemisphere,\u201d said U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Southern Command headquarters in Florida this week, adding that the Asian giant is leveraging the need for investment in the Americas to advance its \u201cmalign agenda.\u201d",
      "Despite its objections to Chinese influence, the U.S. hasn\u2019t shown the ability or willingness to build infrastructure like Chancay's megaport, experts note.",
      "Even when the U.S. government has worked to ensure competitive bidding in Latin American massive public works projects, American companies have refrained from participating, said Benjamin Gedan, director of the Wilson Center\u2019s Latin America Program.",
      "A Kamala Harris administration wouldn\u2019t have changed that, but a Democratic victory would have enabled Biden to speak in Lima with authority about U.S. collaboration to come, such as building regional supply chains, Gedan said.",
      "In sharp contrast to Biden\u2019s alliance-building approach, Trump has vowed to protect American interests and promised more of the same unilateralist action the world saw in his first term when he staked out a combative stance against foreign competitors and deepened the U.S. trade war with China.",
      "In 2022, Biden launched the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework to help integrate the economies of the region and enable the U.S. to counterbalance China. But last year, on the campaign trail, Trump said he would kill the trade pact if he were to win the 2024 election and return to the White House \u2014 in the same way, he pulled the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership immediately after taking office in 2017.",
      "In the years since, U.S. clout in South America has diminished while China\u2019s has grown, said Farnsworth, recalling how the last time Lima hosted APEC in 2016, the shock of Trump\u2019s victory sucked the energy out of then-President Barack Obama\u2019s delegation.",
      "Peru\u2019s top diplomat insists that the U.S. hasn\u2019t ceded its dominant voice guiding discussions about trade at gatherings such as APEC \u2014 and doubted that it will, even under Trump.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that Trump will go against these types of multilateral contexts just because he is worried about the American people,\u201d Schialer said. \u201cHe knows that the U.S. is too important for the world. We have to sit down and have a nice dialogue and see how we can face these challenges together.\u201d",
      "Biden will hold talks Saturday with Xi on the sidelines of APEC, according to the U.S. president's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. The White House has been working for months to arrange a final meeting between Xi and Biden before the Democrat leaves office in January.",
      "Meantime, in the wake of Trump\u2019s win and China\u2019s port opening in Peru, analysts expect the hard-nosed competition between the U.S. and China to overshadow APEC.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese love the idea of outmaneuvering the U.S. in its near-abroad,\u201d Gedan said. \u201cXi will luxuriate in this dynamic of being able to arrive with a big delegation, (...) to inaugurate this transformational port and suck all the air out of the room when his American counterpart is very weak politically. That is significant to China.\u201d",

    "summary": "Italy's president has sharply rebuked Elon Musk",
    "story": [
      "Italy's president has sharply rebuked Elon Musk",
      "ROME -- Italian President Sergio Mattarella sharply rebuked Elon Musk on Wednesday for weighing in on Italian court rulings that have stymied the government\u2019s plans to process some asylum-seekers in Albania.",
      "Musk, who is expected to have a top advisory role in Donald Trump\u2019s new administration, wrote Tuesday on X that \u201cthese judges need to go.\u201d He was referring to the latest Italian court ruling against right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni\u2019s much-touted Albania immigration deal.",
      "\u201cThis is unacceptable. Do the people of Italy live in a democracy or does an unelected autocracy make the decisions?\u201d he wrote in a subsequent post Wednesday.",
      "The posts concerned a Rome court's refusal to rule on a formal request to detain seven migrants rescued at sea and transferred to Albania for processing. Monday's ruling resulted in the men being brought to Italy for processing.",
      "Mattarella didn\u2019t cite Musk by name but \u2014 in an unusually piqued statement \u2014 made clear on Wednesday that he was referring to him. Italy's head of state demanded respect for the country's sovereignty, especially from other soon-to-be public officials.",
      "\u201cItaly is a great democratic country and \u2026 knows how to take care of itself while respecting its Constitution,\u201d Mattarella said in a statement issued by his spokesman.",
      "\u201cAnyone, particularly if as announced is about to assume an important role of government in a friendly and allied country, must respect its sovereignty and cannot attribute to himself the task of imparting prescriptions,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Trump announced Tuesday that Musk, one of the most influential people around the U.S. president-elect, would help lead a Department of Government Efficiency, essentially an independent advisory panel to eliminate waste and fraud.",
      "Musk is a supporter of Meloni and has met with her in Rome on a few occasions, and in September joined her at an awards ceremony on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Photos of them together made such news that Musk seemingly felt the need to tamp down speculation by posting \u201cWe are not dating.\u201d",
      "Musk has a history of making provocative statements and sparring with leaders on X. Earlier this year, he posted messages insulting U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and saying the United Kingdom was headed for civil war. He has also clashed with a Brazilian supreme court justice over free speech, far-right accounts and purported misinformation on X, and also accused Venezuela\u2019s socialist president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, of \u201cmajor election fraud\u201d after that country\u2019s disputed election.",
      "Later Wednesday, an Italian representative of X, Andrea Stroppa, tweeted what appeared to be a statement from Musk that said he had spoken during the day with Meloni. According to Stroppa's tweet, Musk \u201cexpresses his respect\u201d for Mattarella and the Italian Constitution but insists on his right to freedom of expression.",
      "The courts\u2019 rulings have raised the ire of Meloni\u2019s far-right-led government, which has been seeking strategies to ease the strain on Italy of the arrival of migrants seeking a better life in Europe. The government had held up the opening of the Albanian centers as a centerpiece of its immigration crackdown, also as a means of deterrence, and said they could be a model for Europe.",
      "In both cases, Italian courts referred the cases to the EU court of justice in Luxembourg to rule if the countries of origin for the migrants are considered safe for repatriation. There is no word on when the European court might rule.",
      "But as a result of the Rome court decisions, no migrant has yet been processed in the Albanian centers, which are budgeted to cost Italy 670 million euros ($730 million) over five years to build and operate.",
      "Italy's opposition says the money could be much better spent on reinforcing Italian-operated migrant processing centers, while human rights groups say the outsourcing of asylum processing contravenes international law.",
      "The centers opened in October after a months-long delay, because crumbling soil at one of the facilities needed to be repaired. They are run by Italy and are under the country's jurisdiction, while Albanian guards provide external security."

    "story": [
      "Japan\u2019s nuclear watchdog has formally disqualified a reactor in the country\u2019s north-central region from starting",
      "TOKYO -- Japan's nuclear watchdog on Wednesday formally disqualified a reactor in the country's north-central region from restarting, the first rejection under safety standards that were reinforced after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The decision is a setback for Japan as it seeks to accelerate reactor restarts to maximize nuclear power.",
      "The Nuclear Regulation Authority said the Tsuruga No. 2 reactor is \u201cunfit\u201d as its operator failed to address safety risks stemming from the presence of possible active fault lines, which can potentially cause earthquakes, underneath it.",
      "Tsuruga No. 2, operated by the Japan Atomic Power Co., is the first reactor to be rejected under safety standards adopted in 2013 based on lessons from the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi meltdown disaster following a massive earthquake and tsunami.",
      "\u201cWe reached our conclusion based on a very strict examination,\u201d NRA chairperson Shinsuke Yamanaka told reporters.",
      "The verdict comes after more than eight years of safety reviews that were repeatedly disrupted by data coverups and mistakes by the operator, Yamanaka said. He called the case \u201cabnormal\u201d and urged the utility to take the result seriously.",
      "The decision is a blow to Japan Atomic Power because it virtually ends its hopes for a restart. The operator, which is decommissioning its other reactor, Tsuruga No. 1, had hoped to put No. 2 back online, but it would require an examination of dozens of faults around the reactor to prove their safety.",
      "\u201cThe decision is extremely regrettable,\" Japan Atomic Power said in a statement. It said it will continue efforts to restart.",
      "An NRA safety panel concluded three months ago it could not rule out the possibility of active fault lines about 300 meters (330 yards) north of the No. 2 reactor stretching to right underneath the facility, meaning the reactor cannot be operated.",
      "Japan\u2019s government in 2022 adopted a plan to maximize the use of nuclear energy, pushing to accelerate reactor restarts to secure a stable energy supply and meet its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that safety is the prerequisite for nuclear plant operation and that the government respects the scientific and highly technical decision by the watchdog. He said the government's position to promote nuclear energy is unchanged.",
      "Concern about the government\u2019s revived push for nuclear energy grew after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit Japan\u2019s Noto Peninsula on Jan. 1, 2024, killing more than 400 people and damaging more than 100,000 structures. The quake caused minor damage to two nearby nuclear facilities, and evacuation plans for the region were found to be inadequate.",
      "Building key nuclear facilities, such as reactors, directly above active fault lines is prohibited in earthquake-prone Japan.",
      "Yamanaka said the NRA is not immediately ordering a decommissioning because the reactor, which is offline and its spent fuel safely cooled, will not pose a major threat.",
      "If the utility decides to reapply, it must address not only the faults issue but it also must implement adequate safety measures for the entire plant, Yamanaka said. Providing scientific proof of the status of faults underneath key nuclear facilities is difficult, but other operators that obtained restart permits all cleared the requirement, he noted.",
      "The Tsuruga No. 2 reactor first started commercial operation in February 1987 and has been offline since May 2011. The operator rejected the NRA panel's 2013 on-site inspection results, which concluded that the faults under the No. 2 reactor were active, and applied for a restart in 2015.",
      "Of more than 50 commercial reactors, 27 have applied for restarts and 17 of them have been approved so far under the post-Fukushima safety standard."

      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- An insurance magnate who was once a big political donor in North Carolina is in federal custody after pleading guilty in connection to what prosecutors call a $2 billion scheme to defraud insurance regulators, policyholders and others through a myriad of companies from which he skimmed funds for personal benefit.",
      "Greg E. Lindberg, 54, of Tampa, Florida, entered the plea on Tuesday in Charlotte before U.S. Magistrate Judge David Keesler to one count of conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, according to legal documents.",
      "Lindberg, who had been indicted on 13 counts in February 2023, could face a maximum of 10 years in prison on the money laundering conspiracy count and five years on the other conspiracy count, a U.S. Department of Justice news release said.",
      "Lindberg, who lived previously in Durham, North Carolina, was already awaiting sentencing after he and an associate were convicted in May by a federal jury of attempting to bribe North Carolina's elected insurance commissioner to secure preferential regulatory treatment for his insurance business. The two had initially been convicted on two counts in 2020, but a federal appeals court vacated those convictions and ordered new trials.",
      "A document signed by Lindberg and government lawyers serving as the factual basis for Tuesday's plea said that from no later than 2016 through at least 2019 Lindberg and others conspired to engage in crimes associated with insurance business, wire fraud and investment adviser fraud. He and others also worked to deceive the state Insurance Department and other regulators by avoiding regulatory requirements, concealing the condition of his companies and using insurance company funds for himself, a news release said.",
      "It all resulted in companies that Lindberg controlled investing more than $2 billion in loans and other securities with his own affiliated companies, and Lindberg and co-conspirators laundering the scheme's proceeds, according to the government. The 2023 indictment alleged that Lindberg personally benefited by \u201cforgiving\u201d more than $125 million in loans to himself from the insurance companies that he controlled, the news release said.",
      "\u201cLindberg created a complex web of insurance companies, investment businesses, and other business entities and exploited them to engage in millions of dollars of circular transactions. Lindberg\u2019s actions harmed thousands of policyholders, deceived regulators, and caused tremendous risk for the insurance industry,\u201d U.S. Attorney Dena J. King for the Western District of North Carolina said. The FBI and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also were involved in the investigation.",
      "There was no immediate response to emails sent Wednesday about Tuesday's plea to a Lindberg attorney and a website associated with Lindberg's wellness and leadership activities.",
      "A sentencing date has not yet been set. Lindberg, who surrendered Tuesday to U.S. marshals, asked that he be held in a halfway house in Tampa before sentencing. Kessler scheduled another hearing on the matter for next week. After his initial conviction on bribery-related counts in 2020, a judge sentenced Lindberg to more than seven years in prison.",
      "Lindberg previously had given more than $5 million to state and federal candidates and committees since 2016, favoring Republicans but also giving to Democrats.",
      "The U.S. Justice Department said one of Lindberg\u2019s top executives still awaits sentencing after pleading guilty in late 2022 in a related case to conspiring with Lindberg and others to defraud the United States related to a scheme to move money between insurance companies and other businesses Lindberg owned.",
      "Some of Lindberg's insurance companies have been placed into liquidation and under a process to regain financial health, the Justice Department said.",
      "North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey said in a news release on Wednesday that he and his state agency would keep working with federal prosecutors to ensure that \u201cany money recovered through the restitution and forfeiture process will be used to repay the policyholder victims.\u201d",
      "Jurors determined that Lindberg and a former consultant attempted to bribe Causey in the late 2010s. Causey wasn\u2019t accused of wrongdoing \u2014 he alerted authorities and recorded conversations that served as the basis of 2019 indictments against Lindberg and three others."

      "Global sales of personal luxury goods are forecast to shrink next year for the first time since the Great Recession in 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic",
      "MILAN -- Global sales of personal luxury goods are forecast to shrink in 2025 for the first time since the Great Recession, according to a Bain consultancy study released Wednesday. The outlook could worsen if the sector is hit by tariffs promised by Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cThis could be a nightmare if implemented,\u2019\u2019 Claudia D\u2019Arpizio, co-author of the study for Italy\u2019s Altagamma association of luxury producers, told The Associated Press. \u201cEuropean brands could end up being super expensive in an already expensive environment.\u2019'",
      "Trump has pledged tariffs of up to 20% on imports, saying it would create factory jobs, shrink the federal deficit and lower food prices.",
      "While the study did not address the possible impact of tariffs, D\u2019Arpizio said the impact on European luxury producers would depend on how the tariffs are implemented on the category, if at all. She noted that a dearth of American luxury substitutes may lead to an exemption.",
      "Any negative impact could also be offset by moving production to the United States, or by higher sales to U.S. tourists in Europe.",
      "The United States is the second-largest luxury market, following Europe, worth about 100 billion euros ($106 billion), or nearly one-third of all global high-end sales of apparel, leather goods and footwear.",
      "Sales of luxury goods are forecast to drop by 2% to 363 billion euros ($385 billion) next year, from an expected 369 billion euros in 2024, due to steep price increases imposed by brands and global turmoil, Bain said.",
      "The sector made a speedy rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic, surpassing 2019 sales by 2022, largely thanks to pent-up spending that was delayed by lockdowns. Even next year's modest dip would leave the market 28% higher than it was in 2019, and two-and-a-half times larger than the Great Recession lows in 2008.",
      "Social and political turbulence, including wars and a slate of national elections, have eroded consumer confidence, D\u2019Arpizio said. In addition, brands\u2019 strategy to increase prices while focusing on more \u201csubtle luxury\u201d often lacking novelty has \u201cbrought a strong negative impact on the willingness to buy,\u2019\u2019 even among wealthy consumers, she said.",
      "The creativity crisis is also alienating Gen-Z shoppers, many now in their 20s, the study found.",
      "The result is the luxury market has shrunk by 50 million customers, to an estimated 250 million to 360 million, as the luxury base shrinks for the first time.",
      "\u201cWe have 50 million fewer customers either because they can\u2019t afford to shop, or they don\u2019t want to because they don\u2019t feel there is enough juice,\u2019\u2019 D\u2019Arpizio said."

      "The company introduced the two packaged meals \u2014 one starring pizza and the other a turkey, cheddar cheese and cracker plate \u2014 at the beginning of the 2023-2024 academic year. At the time, Kraft Heinz said the offerings were protein-enriched and contained reduced levels of saturated fat and sodium to meet the requirements of the national free and reduced-price school lunch program.",
      "Nutritionists and advocacy groups were not thrilled by the launch. The Center for Science in the Public Interest called having Lunchables in cafeterias \u201ca highly questionable move for school nutrition\u201d that might confuse families into thinking the versions sold at supermarkets were a healthy option.",
      "The drumbeat quickened in April, when Consumer Reports said its tests showed the school-approved Lunchables contained more sodium than the store varieties. The organization also reported that commercially available Lunchables had more lead compared to ready-made meals made several other companies.",
      "Consumer Reports petitioned the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ban Lunchables and similar processed meal kits from schools.",
      "In a statement, Pittsburgh-based Kraft Heinz attributed the decision to pull out of the market served by the National School Lunch Program to a lack of demand. The company described the business impact as \u201cnegligible,\u201d saying sales of the school-designed meals \u201cwere far less than 1% of overall Lunchables sales\u201d during the last academic year.",
      "\u201cLast year, we brought two NSLP compliant Lunchables options to schools that had increased protein. While many school administrators were excited to have these options, the demand did not meet our targets,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis happens occasionally across our broad portfolio, especially as we explore new sales channels. Lunchables products are not available in schools this year and we hope to revisit at a future date.\u201d",
      "The Kraft Heinz Co. produces a wide range of familiar products, including Capri Sun juice pouches, Oscar Meyer hot dogs, Grey Poupon mustard, Kool-Aid and Philadelphia Cream Cheese.",

      "U.S. stocks drifted to a mixed finish after the latest inflation update boosted hopes that more help for the economy will arrive next month from another cut to interest rates",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks drifted to a mixed finish Wednesday after the latest inflation update  boosted hopes that more help for the economy will arrive next month through a cut to interest rates.",
      "The S&P 500 was nearly unchanged and edged up by less than 0.1%, coming off its first loss  since a big rally erupted  after Election Day last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 47 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3%.",
      "The bond market was also mixed after a report said the inflation that U.S. consumers felt last month was exactly as economists expected. It accelerated to 2.6% from 2.4%, but an underlying measure called \u201ccore inflation\u201d did not accelerate. Such core inflation can be a better predictor of future trends, economists say, and the as-expected number boosted expectations for help coming from the Federal Reserve.",
      "\u201cBang in-line core inflation leaves the Fed on track to cut rates in December,\u201d according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "The Fed began cutting interest rates from their two-decade high in September to offer support for the job market, hoping to keep it humming  after bringing inflation nearly all the way down  to its target of 2%. It cut again earlier this month, and traders now see an improved probability of roughly 80% for a third cut at its meeting next month, according to data from CME Group.",
      "Those expectations sent the yield for the two-year Treasury down to 4.27% from 4.34% late Tuesday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which also takes future economic growth more into account, fell initially after the inflation report. But it pared its loss and eventually rose to 4.45%, up from 4.43% late Tuesday.",
      "The question is what will happen with rates in 2025. Prior forecasts published by the Fed implied it could keep cutting rates through next year. But Donald Trump\u2019s victory  in the presidential election may have scrambled such plans. Economists say his preferences for lower tax rates, higher tariffs and less regulation could ultimately lead to higher U.S. government debt and inflation, along with faster economic growth.",
      "While lower interest rates can give a boost to the economy and to prices for investments, they can also give inflation more fuel.",
      "Still, Wednesday\u2019s data was reassuring for the market following a run of stronger-than-expected data on the economy, which could have signaled upward pressures on inflation.",
      "\u201cThe market may be concerned that we are at an inflection point, with inflation potentially returning to an upward trajectory,\u201d said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \u201cWe see inflation modestly higher next year. We don\u2019t think today\u2019s CPI data will do much to the market.\u201d",
      "On Wall Street, Rivian Automotive jumped 13.7% after the electric-vehicle company gave more details about a joint venture it\u2019s entering with Volkswagen Group that they had previously announced. The deal\u2019s total size could be worth up to $5.8 billion, which is more than the $5 billion the companies had previously said.",
      "Spirit Airlines\u2019 stock lost 59.3%. The airline said in a regulatory filing  that it\u2019s still trying to work out a deal to renegotiate the repayment of its debt. If it can reach an agreement, the airline said it could wipe out the company\u2019s stockholders, but it could also protect employees and customers.",
      "All told, the S&P 500 rose 1.39 to 5,985.38. The Dow added 47.21 points to 43,958.19, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 50.66 to 19,230.74.",
      "In stock markets abroad, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell 1.7% after its wholesale inflation rate reached its highest level since July of last year. South Korea\u2019s Kospi sank 2.6% after Samsung Electronics shares fell to their lowest level in over four years.",
      "Indexes were modestly lower across much of the rest of Asia and Europe.",
      "In the crypto market, bitcoin crossed above $93,000 as cryptocurrencies generally soared, before pulling back below $90,000 in afternoon trading. Trump has embraced cryptocurrencies  and pledged to make his country the crypto capital of the world.",
      "Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that\u2019s been a favorite of Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk, also gave up some of its gain from earlier in the day. Trump named Musk as one of the heads of a \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency,\u201d  or DOGE for short.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 08:58:26 -0500",
    "summary": "James Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G",
    "story": [
      "James Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G",
      "For the late James Bond producer Albert \u201cCuddy\u201d Broccoli, receiving the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award was a true high point in his career. He said as much accepting the prize, a non-competitive honorary Oscar, at the Academy Awards in 1982.",
      "Roger Moore presented it to him that night while his family in the audience looked on, including his daughter, Barbara Broccoli, who was reduced to a puddle of tears, and her brother, Michael G. Wilson.",
      "\u201cHe always treasured it,\u201d Barbara Broccoli said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt was the most important physical possession he had.\u201d",
      "The award, then a bust of the inimitable \u201cboy wonder\u201d producer of Hollywood\u2019s early years, sat on his mantlepiece for many years. Now, Broccoli, 64, and Wilson, 82, are following in \u201cCubby\u2019s\u201d footsteps as the 40th recipients, collecting the Oscar statuette Sunday at the 15th Governors Awards in Hollywood.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a rare honor, and I think that makes it extra special,\u201d Wilson said.",
      "Since its inception in 1937, the award has only been given 39 times, celebrating creative producers for a lifetime of quality films. The roster of honorees is a who\u2019s-who of Hollywood legends from David O. Selznick and Walt Disney to Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. And only once before Broccoli has it gone to a woman, Kathleen Kennedy in 2018.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very humbling,\" Broccoli said. \u201cI think of so many people who have come before us, so many people I wish had been given the honor who aren\u2019t with us anymore.\u201d",
      "Though she is quick to point out all the others she thinks more deserving, the fact is that no one quite occupies the space that Broccoli and Wilson do as the guardians of the Bond franchise, one of the longest running film series in history.",
      "Since Cubby and Harry Saltzman purchased the rights to Ian Fleming\u2019s novels in 1961, the 25 films released by EON productions have grossed over $7.6 billion at the global box office. And despite all odds, the major creative decisions, including who gets to be Bond, have stayed in the family through massive changes in the business, including new corporate overlords.",
      "For many years, EON split profits with MGM, which financed and distributed the movies. But that got slightly more complicated in May 2021, several months before the last Daniel Craig Bond, \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d opened, when Amazon purchased MGM for $8.45 billion. The siblings continue to own 50% of Bond and maintain creative control over its future. They're also adamant about theatrical.",
      "\u201cPeople are playing it very safe. I think in times of crisis like this, you've got to be brave,\" Broccoli said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a new era in the movie business, so we\u2019re trying to figure it out.\"",
      "Broccoli has been entrenched in the world of Bond her entire life. She was only a year old when the deal was signed and spent much of her youth on sets around the world. One of her earliest memories was filming \u201cYou Only Live Twice\u201d in Japan. She was 6.",
      "Her father\u2019s passion for the films was infectious and she followed him into the business, learning the trade from the ground up. Though she didn\u2019t quite start without connections, as Cubby had when he came to Hollywood in 1934, she never shied away from doing \u201cthe dirty work.\u201d During one indie shoot, she remembers scrubbing toilets before the wrap party.",
      "Wilson came into the family when his mother married Cubby in 1959. With two actor parents, he didn\u2019t imagine a career in entertainment for himself. Instead, he pursued law. Then Cubby asked for his advice during a dispute, Wilson \u201ccaught the bug\u201d and never looked back.",
      "Cubby passed the torch to the kids in 1995; he died the next year. Since then, Wilson has operated as the business affairs person and Broccoli as more of a creative and practical producer. Their different skills and interests were compatible.",
      "\u201cI think it worked out pretty well,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe were a good team.\u201d",
      "During their tenure, they bid farewell to the Pierce Brosnan era and welcomed Daniel Craig as the seventh Bond; firm in their decision, despite the immense backlash. They also produced non-Bond films, like \u201cTill.\u201d",
      "But the spotlight on them has intensified as the world awaits official word on Bond No. 8. People are always playing the guessing game with the role, whether it was the long-running fan campaign for Idris Elba or any number of promising young actors who pop on the scene. The latest, stickiest rumor is Aaron Taylor-Johnson, but Broccoli and Wilson are staying tight-lipped on even a general timeline for when an announcement might come.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big decision,\u201d she said.",
      "They\u2019ve teased some things: It will be a man. He\u2019ll likely be in his 30s. Whiteness is not a given. And whoever says yes is doing so with the expectation of at least a decade\u2019s worth of films. One thing is certain: There's going to be a period of adjustment for audiences in the transition. Every Bond had its detractors, especially at the start. Broccoli saw firsthand the vitriol of the internet era when Craig was cast (\"anti-Daniel nonsense,\" she called it.)",
      "But when people finally saw \u201cCasino Royale,\u201d the sentiment shifted to love. The five Craig Bonds are the highest grossing in the series, not adjusting for inflation. It remains one of her proudest moments. And a new Bond means new opportunity.",
      "\u201cEvery time we cast a new actor, the films change. It\u2019s the excitement of a new Bond, a new direction,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cEvery one of these people who took on the role offered something new and different.\u201d",
      "Plus, they're playing the long game with Bond, producing and cinema in general. And not losing sight of the Cubby spirit.",
      "\u201cHe always said films were like the circus coming to town,\u201d Broccoli said. \u201cYou set up your tent, everybody comes and you create magic. It's all about pleasing the audience, making sure that people get their bang for their buck.\u201d"

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge ordered the Port of Oakland to stop using San Francisco Bay Oakland International Airport as its airport\u2019s new name while a lawsuit by the city of San Francisco is ongoing.",
      "San Francisco sued in April over what it says is a trademark violation and asked a federal judge to issue a preliminary injunction, arguing that the airport's new name is confusing people who want to fly to the San Francisco International Airport and violates copyright infringement.",
      "U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Hixson on Tuesday issued an order agreeing with the copyright violation argument, saying San Francisco spent millions to develop its brand. The judge also ordered Oakland's airport to remove any signs with the new name.",

      "Tenants searching for an apartment in New York City have long been forced to pay thousands of dollars to real estate brokers",
      "NEW YORK -- Mandatory broker fees, an unusual feature of New York City apartment hunting long reviled by renters, will be banned under legislation that passed Wednesday after overcoming fierce backlash from the city's real estate lobby.",
      "Under a system that exists in New York and almost nowhere else in the country, tenants are often forced to pay the commission of a real estate agent before moving into an apartment, even if that agent was hired by the landlord.",
      "The fees are steep, typically totaling as much as 15% of the annual rent, about $7,000 for the average-priced New York City apartment.",
      "The legislation passed by the City Council aims to stop landlords from saddling tenants with those payments \u2014 at least as an up-front fee. Though tenants may hire their own representatives, they will no longer be forced to pay for brokers that solely represent the interests of their landlords.",
      "In a city where two-thirds of households are renters, the bill is widely popular, a rare piece of municipal legislation championed by influencers on TikTok. It has also triggered opposition from brokers and their representatives, who warn it could send shockwaves through an industry that employs 25,000 agents.",
      "\u201cThey spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to lobby our politicians to try to kill this bill and try to force you to pay broker fees,\u201d Councilmember Chi Oss\u00e9, a Democrat who sponsored the the FARE Act, said at a rally Wednesday. \u201cBut you know what we did: We beat them.\u201d",
      "New York\u2019s broker fee arrangement dates back nearly a century to a time when agents played an active role in publishing listings in newspapers and working directly with would-be tenants. The commission structure is also found in Boston, but few other parts of the country.",
      "But with most listings now published online, and virtual or self-guided tours gaining popularity since the COVID-19 pandemic, many New Yorkers have grown increasingly frustrated by the fees.",
      "At a City Council hearing this summer, multiple speakers recalled shelling out thousands of dollars to a broker who seemed to do little more than open a door or text them the code to a lockbox.",
      "\u201cIn most businesses, the person who hires the person pays the person,\u201d Agustina Velez, a house cleaner from Queens, said at that hearing. She recalled paying $6,000 to switch apartments. \u201cEnough with these injustices. Landlords have to pay for the services they use.\u201d",
      "Brokers counter that they do much more than merely holding open doors: conducting background checks, juggling viewings and streamlining communication with landlords in a city where many tenants never meet the owners of their buildings.",
      "\u201cThis is the start of a top-down, government-controlled housing system,\u201d said Jordan Silver, a broker with the firm Brown Harris Stevens. \u201cThe language is so incredibly vague, we actually have no idea what this would look like in the world.\u201d",
      "Others opposed to the bill, including the Real Estate Board of New York, say landlords will bake the added costs into monthly rents.",
      "But some New Yorkers say that would be preferable to the current system of high up-front costs that make it hard to move.",
      "\u201cFrom the perspective of a tech investor and business owner in New York City, the more we can do to make it cheaper and easier for talented young people to come here and stay here, the better off we\u2019ll be,\u201d entrepreneur and bill supporter Bradley Tusk said in a statement. \u201cAnyone who has paid 15% of their annual rent in brokers fees for someone to let you in an apartment for 10 minutes knows the practice is nothing more than legalized theft.\u201d",
      "Mayor Eric Adams, himself a former real estate broker, has raised concerns about the legislation and possible unintended consequences.",

      "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka -- Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake is looking to consolidate his party's power in Thursday's parliamentary election to help him implement his election pledges to solve the country's economic woes and foster good governance.",
      "The Marxist-leaning Dissanayake won the presidential election on Sept. 21 in a victory that marked a rejection of the traditional political parties that have governed the island nation since its independence from British rule in 1948.",
      "However, Dissanayake's failure to secure more than 50% of the vote has fueled concerns over his party\u2019s outlook in the parliamentary election. His National People's Power party must increase its votes significantly \u2014 from the 42% it won in the presidential election \u2014 if it is to secure a minimum of 113 seats to take control of the 225-member Parliament.",
      "Dissanayake, while campaigning for his party's candidates, has called on voters to help elect them to Parliament so he won't need to rely on a coalition to enact the reforms he promised.",
      "\u201cA strong government should be formed to rebuild the country. A government that is unshakable in the Parliament should be established. And to do that, Parliament should be filled with elected members from our party,\" Dissanayake said to cheers at a rally on the final day of campaigning on Monday.",
      "The election comes at a decisive time for Sri Lankans, as the island nation emerges from its worst economic crisis, having declared bankruptcy after defaulting on its external debt in 2022.",
      "The country is now in the middle of a bailout program with the International Monetary Fund and debt restructuring with international creditors nearly complete.",
      "Dissanayake had said during the presidential campaign that he planned to propose significant changes to the targets set in the IMF deal, which his predecessor Ranil Wickremesinghe signed, saying it placed too much burden on the people. However, he has since changed his stance and says Sri Lanka will go along with the agreement and not seek to change it.",
      "He told his supporters on Monday that an IMF team would arrive in Sri Lanka two days after the election to complete a third review of the agreement.",
      "\u201cBy the end of January or the beginning of February, we will complete that task. By then, we will be able to secure considerable stability in the economy,\u201c he said.",
      "He said the government will present its first budget in February next year.",
      "The government expects the budget to include proposals to reduce taxes and increase salaries for government servants.",
      "Political analyst Jehan Perera said Dissanayake \u201chas been careful and played it safe by continuing with most of the policies set by his predecessor. He has been sensitive to the concerns of the business community that any deviation from the IMF agreement could cause the economy to unravel.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe president has been careful not to rock the boat or sink it, as the opposition warned,\u201d he added.",
      "Sri Lanka\u2019s crisis was largely the result of economic mismanagement combined with fallout from the pandemic, which along with 2019 terrorism attacks devastated its important tourism industry. The coronavirus crisis also disrupted the flow of remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad.",
      "The government also slashed taxes in 2019, depleting the treasury just as the virus hit. Foreign exchange reserves plummeted, leaving Sri Lanka unable to pay for imports or defend its currency, the rupee.",
      "Sri Lanka\u2019s economic upheaval led to a political crisis that forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resign in 2022. Parliament then elected Wickremesinghe to replace him.",
      "The economy was stabilized, inflation dropped, the local currency strengthened and foreign reserves increased under Wickremesinghe. Nonetheless, he lost the election as public dissatisfaction grew over the government\u2019s effort to increase revenue by raising electricity bills and imposing heavy new income taxes on professionals and businesses, as part of the government\u2019s efforts to meet the IMF conditions.",
      "Dissanayake\u2019s National Peoples' Power party has gained popularity since his election victory, while the opposition parties are divided.",
      "\u201cThose who have been reassured by the smooth transfer of power and the NPP\u2019s restraint in its first two months in power are likely to vote in his favor. This number is likely to see an increase over the number who voted in his favor at the presidential election,\u201d said Perera, the political analyst.",
      "Ruwan Sanjeewa, 36, who works as a laborer, joined one of the final rallies held by Dissanayake's party in the town of Gampaha, 34 kilometers (21 miles) north of Colombo and said he would vote for the NPP.",
      "\u201cSee the plight of the country today. Traditional political parties who ruled this country over the last few decades have failed to deliver what they promised. We are now in a very pathetic situation. So, I want to give a chance to NPP. Let's see what they will do. I am hopeful the NPP might do something good for this country,\u201d he said."

      "Musk is also more influential, having pumped an estimated $200 million through his political action committee to help elect Trump, made himself a fixture at Mar-a-Lago since the presidential election and is on regular speaking terms with like-minded political world leaders, from Argentina\u2019s President Javier Milei to Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.",
      "Trump has said Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a new \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency,\u201d or DOGE, \u2014 a joke name that references the cryptocurrency Dogecoin and appeals to Musk's sense of humor.",
      "\u201cWe finally have a mandate to delete the mountain of choking regulations that do not serve the greater good,\u201d Musk said Wednesday on X.",
      "Trump has said that Musk and Ramaswamy will work from outside the government to offer the White House \u201cadvice and guidance\u201d and will partner with the Office of Management and Budget to drive structural reform \u2014 some of which could only be done through Congress.",
      "\"If it\u2019s a commission, it\u2019s outside the government\u201d and Musk could not have a White House office or official government title, said Richard Painter, a White House ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration. \u201cThen, the president takes the advice or doesn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "If it were a true government agency, however, Musk would run afoul of federal conflict of interest laws unless he divested from his businesses or recused from government matters involving them, Painter said.",
      "Trump could grant a rare waiver exempting Musk from those laws, a move that has been politically unpopular in the past, Painter said.",
      "Tesla, SpaceX and X didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday about whether Musk would recuse himself. The Trump transition team also didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "However it is structured, Musk's ideas are expected to have an influence.",
      "Tesla, the electric vehicle company that made Musk the world\u2019s wealthiest person, has had repeated skirmishes with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates vehicle safety. So any cuts to NHTSA funding or staffing could help Tesla.",
      "The agency has forced Tesla to do recalls it didn\u2019t want, and it has opened investigations of Tesla vehicles, some of which raised questions about Musk\u2019s claims that Tesla is close to deploying autonomous vehicles without human drivers. The agency also is working on regulations that cover vehicle automation.",
      "Auto safety advocates are worried that a Department of Government Efficiency co-chaired by Musk could propose draconian cuts at NHTSA.",
      "\u201cThat could be incredibly problematic because that would impact every rule-making from all of the agencies that currently oversee companies that Musk owns,\u201d said Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, a watchdog group.",
      "If implemented, Musk\u2019s plan for efficiency at NHTSA could mirror what he did when he took over Twitter \u2014 draconian staff cuts, said Missy Cummings, director of the autonomy and robotics center at George Mason University and a former safety adviser to NHTSA.",
      "While Cummings concedes there is room for much of the federal government to become more efficient, she said that NHTSA is already understaffed and she predicted that Musk would try to slow or stop NHTSA investigations or handicap the agency so it would have trouble enforcing regulations.",
      "\u201cIt would just leave it as a shell of the agency that it was,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir whole job would be to put out commercials reminding people to just wear their seat belts.\u201d",

NASA has awarded more than $4 billion to SpaceX for the first two human moon landings coming up later this decade under the Artemis program. Musk has been at odds with the Federal Aviation Administration for slowing Starship over what he contends is excessive bureaucracy.",
      "SpaceX also has racked up multiple contracts with NASA over the past decade for launching supplies and astronauts to the International Space Station. The contracts for crew flights alone from 2020 through 2030 total $5 billion.",
      "More recently, in June, NASA awarded an $843 million contract to SpaceX to provide the vehicle for deorbiting the International Space Station at the end of its lifetime in early 2031, directing it to a fiery re-entry over the Pacific.",
      "SpaceX also has multiple contracts with the Defense Department, some classified and said to be worth billions. In addition, the Pentagon has purchased internet services in Ukraine from SpaceX\u2019s Starlink constellation. The militarized version of Starlink is called Starshield.",
      "The social media platform X is another Musk company that has drawn scrutiny from federal regulators. The Federal Trade Commission has probed Musk\u2019s handling of sensitive consumer data after he took control of the company in 2022 but has not brought enforcement action. The SEC has an ongoing investigation of Musk\u2019s purchase of the social media company.",
      "Musk has been forceful with his political views on the platform, changing its rules, content moderation systems and algorithms to conform with his world view.

      "Neighbors of a factory in Louisville, Kentucky, where two workers were killed in an explosion say they complained for years about odors coming from the plant",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- For years, neighbors who lived near a factory in Louisville, Kentucky, complained amongst themselves and to local officials about a variety of strange smells coming from the plant, which produces colorings for food and drinks.",
      "Some described it as an ammonia-like smell, while others said it was more like burnt sugar or burnt caramel. They worried a bit about living so close to the plant, but never expected what happened Tuesday, when an explosion killed two workers, and blew out windows and ripped pieces off the roofs of nearby homes..",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always thought about it, like this is unsafe \u2014 seems like \u2014 because there was always huge steam coming from the place at night. But I never really thought that this would happen,\" said Shelby Dix, 31, who lives in an apartment in a multifamily home that is separated from the plant property by an alley.",
      "The explosion injured 11 other employees at Givaudan Sense Colour, and caused a partial collapse of the building. Three remained hospitalized Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe are grieving with the families, friends, and loved ones of those that were lost and injured during this very difficult time,\u201d the Swiss-based company said in a statement.",
      "Amanda Strecker, who lived in a townhouse near the plant from 2018 to 2022, said she had long been concerned about the ammonia-like smell.",
      "\u201cWe felt when we lived there that something was going to happen. It was just a matter of time,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of problems with chemical smells in the air, reporting it locally to the environmental office, and them coming out and not finding anything.\u201d",
      "During the first few years Strecker lived in the neighborhood, the plant was owned by D.D. Williamson & Co. Givaudan acquired the plant in 2021.",
      "\u201cI had the plant manager\u2019s number at one point and I would call and let them know, \u2018Hey, something\u2019s not right.\u2019 They\u2019ve had a lot of issues there,\u201d Strecker said.",
      "In April 2003, while the plant was owned by D.D. Williamson, a tank exploded and killed a worker. Federal investigators determined the tank exploded because it was missing its pressure relief valve, which had been removed when it was moved to the Louisville plant in 1989.",
      "In 2009, D.D. Williamson paid a total of $600,000 in civil fines to the U.S. Department of Justice and the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District to resolve allegations of Clean Water Act violations at the Louisville plant.",
      "Officials said they have not yet determined what caused the explosion Tuesday. Louisville Fire Chief Brian O'Neill said the building housed hazardous chemicals \u2014 typical for factories of that kind \u2014 and firefighters did not immediately know if any had been compromised. He said monitoring of air and runoff found none.",
      "Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said employees initially told officials \u201ceverything was normal activity when the explosion occurred.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is an incredibly sad and tragic incident,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cI want the families of the two victims to know that the hearts of all Louisvillians are with them.\"",
      "As of February 2021, the factory made caramel colorings for the food industry by heating sugar and water and adding chemicals such as aqueous ammonia for some products, according to permitting documents filed with the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District.",
      "At the time of the permits, the plant was still owned by D.D. Williamson & Co., which was founded in 1865 and initially supplied malt to brewing companies, later developed colors for soft drinks and more recently produced natural colors for food and beverage companies.",
      "The Swiss flavor and fragrance company Givaudan acquired D.D. Williamson in 2021. Givaudan Sense Colour offers a range of \u201cnatural colours, caramel colours, burnt sugars, and fruit and vegetable-based browns\u201d for the beverage market, according to its website. Spokespersons for Givaudan did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment Wednesday.",
      "Last year, the air pollution control district cited the plant for failing to notify the district about unspecified excessive emissions. It also was cited for not submitting annual compliance certifications and reports in a timely manner, as well as not abiding by permit requirements concerning monitoring, recording and inspections. The company agreed to pay a $7,500 fine.",
      "Carly Johnson, her husband and their 4-year-old son were at home when they heard a \u201ccrazy loud boom,\u201d felt their house shake and heard things falling off the walls and shelves as if a bomb went off.",
      "During the 12 years the family has lived about a block from the plant, they've smelled what Johnson described as a \u201cweird, burnt sugar smell.\u201d She and her husband had worried about living so close to the plant, knowing about the explosion two decades ago. But she said she thought that since it there had already been such a traumatic event there, \"they would have done everything they could to prevent this from happening again.\u201d",
      "\u201cWindows and everything can be replaced. I\u2019m just mad about my son going through that. That\u2019s what makes me the most mad,\u201d she said.",
      "The Louisville Fire Department is leading the investigation with help from state and federal partners. A reconstruction team from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was headed to Louisville to help determine the cause of the explosion. Givaudan said in an earlier statement that it is cooperating with authorities.",

      "Social media platform Bluesky has gained 1 million new users in the week since the U.S. election",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Social media site Bluesky has gained 1 million new users in the week since the U.S. election, as some X users look for an alternative platform to post their thoughts and engage with others online.",
      "Bluesky said Wednesday that its total users surged to 15 million, up from roughly 13 million at the end of October.",
      "Championed by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Bluesky was an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That invite-only period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other features. The platform resembles Elon Musk's X, with a \u201cdiscover\u201d feed as well a chronological feed for accounts that users follow. Users can send direct messages and pin posts, as well as find \u201cstarter packs\u201d that provide a curated list of people and custom feeds to follow.",
      "The post-election uptick in users isn\u2019t the first time that Bluesky has benefitted from people leaving X. Bluesky gained 2.6 million users in the week after X was banned in Brazil in August \u2014 85% of them from Brazil, the company said. About 500,000 new users signed up in the span of one day last month, when X signaled that blocked accounts would be able to see a user's public posts.",
      "Despite Bluesky's growth, X posted last week that it had \u201cdominated the global conversation on the U.S. election\u201d and had set new records. The platform saw a 15.5% jump in new-user signups on Election Day, X said, with a record 942 million posts worldwide. Representatives for Bluesky and for X did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Bluesky has referenced its competitive relationship to X through tongue-in-cheeks comments, including an Election Day post on X referencing Musk watching voting results come in with President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cI can guarantee that no Bluesky team members will be sitting with a presidential candidate tonight and giving them direct access to control what you see online,\u201d Bluesky said.",
      "Across the platform, new users \u2014 among them journalists, left-leaning politicians and celebrities \u2014 have posted memes and shared that they were looking forward to using a space free from advertisements and hate speech. Some said it reminded them of the early days of X, when it was still Twitter.",
      "On Wednesday, The Guardian said it would no longer post on X, citing \u201cfar right conspiracy theories and racism\u201d on the site as a reason. At the same time, television journalist Don Lemon posted on X that he is leaving the platform but will continue to use other social media, including Bluesky.",
      "Lemon said he felt X was no longer a place for \u201chonest debate and discussion.\u201d He noted changes to the site's terms of service set to go into effect Friday that state lawsuits against X must be filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas rather than the Western District of Texas. Musk said in July that he was moving X's headquarters to Texas from San Francisco.",
      "\u201cAs the Washington Post recently reported on X\u2019s decision to change the terms, this 'ensures that such lawsuits will be heard in courthouses that are a hub for conservatives, which experts say could make it easier for X to shield itself from litigation and punish critics,\u2019\u201d Lemon wrote. \u201cI think that speaks for itself.\u201d",
      "Last year, advertisers such as IBM, NBCUniversal and its parent company Comcast fled X over concerns about their ads showing up next to pro-Nazi content and hate speech on the site in general, with Musk inflaming tensions with his own posts endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory."

Jeff Landry's sweeping tax reform package, the centerpiece of the state's third special legislative session of the year.",
      "The House voted 87-12 to flatten individual income tax to 3%, while increasing the standard deduction to $12,500 for individual taxpayers.",
      "Pushback came entirely from Democratic lawmakers, some of whom have argued that they consider the reforms to provide only token relief to lower-income households while leading to a $1 billion annual revenue hole.",
      "Republican Rep. Julie Emerson, the bill's sponsor, said the individual income tax cuts are necessary to spur economic growth, staunch outward migration and keep Louisiana competitive with nearby states like Florida and Texas which have no income tax.",
      "Other bills, set to be voted on by the House later this week, would attempt to offset the proposed individual income tax cuts by ending a range of tax exemptions and expanding sales taxes across dozens of services, from dog-grooming to lobbying, as well as digital goods like Netflix and other streaming platforms. It would also make permanent a 0.45% sales tax and 2% business utilities tax that had been set to expire.",
      "\u201cI think that we are allowing our citizens to make a choice as to how they pay their taxes by choosing the services and the goods that they purchase,\u201d Emerson told her colleagues on the House floor.",
      "The House also voted to repeal the 0.275% corporate franchise tax \u2014 essentially a levy on conducting business in the state \u2014 which Republican lawmakers have decried as dampening investment prospects.",
      "Democratic House Minority Leader Rep. Matthew Willard indicated the benefits of this tax cut, which would cost the state more than $500 million in annual revenue, would go to the shareholders of large corporations who are likely not based in the state.",
      "Emerson countered it will go to businesses that \u201ccreate jobs in Louisiana.\u201d Supporters have pointed out that the vast majority of revenue from the tax is not allocated to the state's general fund. They say abolishing it would not have a significant impact on budget decisions.",
      "The House voted favorably on another bill aimed to court businesses, passing legislation incentivizing local governments to exempt taxes on corporate assets in exchange for one-time payments from the state between $1 million and $15 million.",
      "Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, representing parishes heavily reliant on those taxes for funding schools and law enforcement, expressed skepticism that local governments would take the bait.",
      "\u201cWhy would they ever opt out of something like this, where they're going to give up a revenue stream that's existing in exchange for a one-time buyout,\u201d Republican Rep. Michael Robert Bayham said in an Oct. 10 committee hearing to discuss the bill.",
      "\u201cI think the inventory tax really punishes all the businesses that are there,\u201d Department of Revenue Secretary Richard Nelson said.",
      "The exemption would offer an incentive for businesses to locate in less economically developed parts of the state and would likely be a worthwhile tradeoff for parishes with small amounts of existing corporate asset revenue, he added.",
      "Along with advancing the tax cuts, the House voted in favor of a constitutional amendment intended to simplify the state's convoluted tax code.",

      "The end of the year is often the best time to buy a car",
      "The holidays are coming and so are the car deals. As the year draws to a close, many manufacturers will have end-of-year or holiday sales designed to bring shoppers into showrooms and move metal. In addition to checking out these promoted sales, it can also be helpful to know which outgoing model-year vehicles automakers and dealers are selling at a significantly discounted price.",
      "Edmunds collects data on tens of thousands of vehicle transactions every year. And analyzing those data gives insight into where the best deals may be, especially as a calendar year ends. Accordingly, Edmunds editors reviewed sales data from most manufacturers from September of this year to find the deepest discounts. The following five vehicles stood out as viable options for shoppers looking to get a deal. We didn\u2019t include electric vehicles for the purposes of this article but know that you can often get big discounts on them as well.",
      "We\u2019ve organized them by the biggest discount off the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price, or MSRP, and included a few notes from Edmunds about each:",
      "The Ascent is the biggest Subaru you can buy. It has three rows of seating and is better suited for bigger families than the smaller Forester. The Ascent doesn\u2019t top Edmunds\u2019 rankings for three-row SUVs, but it is a solid contender that\u2019s worth a look, especially at the right price.",
      "What Edmunds editors say about the Ascent: \u201cThe Ascent stands out with its standard all-wheel drive, useful technology features and solid build quality. A tight third-row seat and a loud cabin on the highway are its most significant drawbacks.\u201d",
      "Average MSRP $46,697; average price paid $43,355 (7.2% savings)",
      "Other light-duty full-size trucks except the Ford F-150 were selling at similar discounts to the Silverado in our pricing analysis. Better deals may be on the horizon soon.",
      "What Edmunds editors say about the Silverado: \u201cThe Silverado boasts four engine options, a massive cabin and helpful tech features. Its ride quality isn\u2019t as comfortable as that of some rival trucks, but we think the Silverado will work out well for most light-duty truck buyers.\u201d",
      "Average MSRP $59,233; average price paid $56,217 (5.1% savings)",
      "The Terrain is GMC\u2019s small SUV. There is a redesigned and improved model for 2025, but you could be satisfied with a 2024 model if you can get a good deal. The Terrain and its Chevy counterpart, the Equinox, were both selling at similar discounts in September.",
      "What Edmunds editors say about the Terrain: \u201cThe 2024 GMC Terrain has a comfortable interior and easy-to-use technology features. But a weak base engine and a lack of cargo space keep the Terrain from fully standing out in the small SUV class.",
      "Average MSRP $35,977; average price paid $34,167 (5% savings)",
      "Ford\u2019s Edge is likely at the end of its life cycle, and it might not return as a 2025 model. Still, the Edge is a likable midsize SUV that has more interior room than the smaller Ford Escape.",
      "What Edmunds editors say about the Edge: \u201cThe Edge comes standard with all-wheel drive, which is an option you\u2019ll not find at the base level in some competitors. It offers ample space and a comfortable seating relative to other two-row SUVs. It doesn\u2019t distinguish itself at being excellent in any one area but rather demonstrates broad competence across the board.\u201d",
      "Average MSRP $43,995; average price paid $41,941 (4.6% savings)",
      "Mazda\u2019s small and sporty crossover SUV, the CX-30, was leaving dealer lots at discounts in September. That\u2019s true for both the 2024 and 2025 models. Look for even better deals on the 2024 CX-30 as the end of the year nears.",
      "What Edmunds\u2019 editors say about the CX-30: \u201cThe CX-30 is a sophisticated and sporty entry in the extra-small SUV class. It has striking looks and plenty of standard features. Though it\u2019s priced higher than much of its competition, it offers a lot for your money.\u201d",
      "Average MSRP $30,237; average price paid $28,962 (4.2% savings)",
      "Don\u2019t rush to make a deal immediately. Instead look for opportunities to buy at the right price at the end of the month and especially at the end of the calendar year when dealers may be more motivated.",

      "Spirit Airlines says it won\u2019t announce its quarterly financial results on time because the company is focused on talks with bond holders to restructure its debt",
      "NEW YORK -- Shares of Spirit Airlines plunged Wednesday after the budget airline said that it won't announce quarterly financial results on time while it continues talks with bond holders to restructure its debt.",
      "Spirit said negotiations are progressing toward an agreement that would protect creditors and customers. However, the company said if such a deal is reached, it would be expected to wipe out existing shares.",
      "The stock was down 58% in afternoon trading Wednesday.",
      "The low-cost airline has been struggling to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel. A federal judge blocked an attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue after the Justice Department sued on antitrust grounds.",
      "Spirit disclosed after the market closed Tuesday that it had notified the Securities and Exchange Commission it would be late in filing its third-quarter financial report while it continued discussions with holders of debt that is due for repayment in 2025 and 2026.",
      "If it can reach a deal, Spirit said, it would go through \u201ca statutory restructuring\u201d that would protect creditors, employees, customers and companies that do business with the airline but \u201cis expected to lead to the cancellation of the company\u2019s existing equity.\u201d",
      "The Florida-based airline said it was also \u201cexploring strategic alternatives\" \u2014 often a euphemism for a sale, merger or restructuring. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, reported late Tuesday that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders after merger talks with Frontier Airlines broke down.",
      "The company also gave grim guidance about its third-quarter performance. Spirit said its operating margin would be 12 percentage points worse than last year's third quarter, when it was a negative 15%. Revenue will be down and expenses up compared with a year earlier.",
      "TD Cowen analyst Tom Fitzgerald said Spirit\u2019s announcement creates the risk that customers will book on other airlines instead, putting even more pressure on Spirit's liquidity.",
      "Spirit, the nation\u2019s biggest budget airline, has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion.",
      "People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They just are not paying as much.",
      "In the first six months of the year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they were paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares was down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit\u2019s red ink.",
      "It\u2019s not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded. There are several reasons behind the slump.",
      "Spirit\u2019s costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit\u2019s budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit\u2019s core business \u2014 sagged most of this year because of a glut of seats on domestic flights.",
      "Peter McNally, an analyst at investment-research firm Third Bridge, said Spirit used debt to grow aggressively coming out of the pandemic to increase its market share. But its costs rose and pricing power was damaged when other airlines also added flights, he said.",
      "Frontier Airlines tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. The Justice Department sued JetBlue and Spirit, saying a merger would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.",
      "Spirit and Frontier, based in Denver, declined to comment on possible merger discussions. Savanthi Syth, an airlines analyst for Raymond James, said she still believes that a merger of the two is likely once Spirit restructures to reduce its costs.",
      "U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. While some airlines survived the turbulence and a wave of mergers, Pan Am, TWA, Northwest, Continental and US Airways all disappeared.",
      "The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013."

      "The Atlantic Coast Conference finds itself fighting for respect from the College Football Playoff selection committee",
      "Rhett Lashlee has done the math. It rolls around in the SMU coach's head every week. The more he thinks about it, the more it doesn't add up.",
      "Why, Lashlee wonders, is the Atlantic Coast Conference fighting what seems to be an uphill battle for respect from the College Football Playoff committee?",
      "\u201cTo look at our league and say, \u2018Well we may be a one-bid league,\u2019 but you look at another league (the Big Ten) that we have a winning record against, and say \u2018Oh they\u2019re going to get four in,\u2019\u201d Lashlee said Tuesday, a few hours before the latest CFP rankings had the Mustangs (8-1 overall, 5-0 ACC) as the second team out of the coveted top 12. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d",
      "Over the summer, the college football paradigm shifted following the latest round of realignment, with the Big Ten and Southeastern Conference adding bluebloods like USC, Oregon and Texas and the ACC welcoming less-revered programs SMU, Cal and Stanford. What ACC officials and Lashlee\u2019s coaching brethren feared seems to be playing out.",
      "\u201cThe disrespect (was) there preseason,\u201d Pittsburgh coach Narduzzi said. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s there midseason.\u201d",
      "Narduzzi, whose team is at 7-2 overall and 3-2 in the league with nonconference wins over Big 12 members Cincinnati and West Virginia, believes the ACC is the best league in the country, pointing to parity as proof of its competitiveness. Shouldn't Georgia Tech toppling Miami and Louisville taking down Clemson in Death Valley be proof of the depth of the league as a whole?",
      "Apparently not.",
      "\u201cIt hurts when you\u2019re beating each other up, no question about it,\u201d Narduzzi said.",
      "If you play in the ACC anyway.",
      "It doesn't appear to be much of an issue in the SEC, where Alabama and Ole Miss find themselves inside the projected CFP field in mid-November despite having multiple conference losses, with another two-loss team (Georgia) right above SMU at No. 13 in the current bracket.",
      "The road for the ACC to get multiple teams into the CFP is narrowing by the week. The best case would seem to be for SMU and Miami to win out followed by a well-played and tightly contested ACC championship game.",
      "Warde Manuel, the CFP Selection Committee chair, said the Mustangs and Hurricanes have been impressive. What he didn't have to say is that only one of them has been impressive enough to merit a spot in the top 12 when the second, third and fourth-place teams in the SEC and Big Ten are both comfortably in the field for now.",
      "The irony is that the fourth-place team in the ACC (Louisville) may be the second-hottest team in the conference behind SMU. Clemson is currently in third and could keep its hopes of an ACC title game berth alive with a victory at Pitt on Saturday, with a shot to further bolster its CFP at-large hopes by downing rival South Carolina the weekend after Thanksgiving.",
      "Swinney struggles to understand how some narratives shift and others don't. Virginia Tech began its season with an overtime loss on the road at Vanderbilt. It looked like a red flag at the time. Now \u2014 with the Commodores in the midst of a renaissance \u2014 not so much.",
      "\u201cEverybody is like, \u2018Oh, the league stinks, you lost to Vanderbilt,'\u201d Swinney said. \"Well, I think Vanderbilt beat Alabama and Auburn. I think they're pretty good. And that was a touchdown game in Nashville with Virginia Tech.\u201d",
      "The same Virginia Tech team that took Miami to the last play in September and handled Georgia Tech in October, two weeks before the Yellow Jackets handed Heisman Trophy candidate Cam Ward and the Hurricanes their first loss.",
      "In the SEC, that sort of \u201cAny Given Saturday\u201d approach is celebrated. The ACC does not seem to be getting the same benefit of the doubt.",
      "\u201cWhen other leagues beat each other up internally, they\u2019re considered a deep, solid league,\u201d Lashlee said. \u201cWhen we beat up (each other) internally, we\u2019re considered a weak league.\u201d",
      "The Big 12 could feel the same way, since the CFP rankings suggest the league is looking a lot like a one-bid pony \u2014 BYU? Colorado? \u2014 despite a tight race for the championship.",
      "The ACC put up 43 nonconference wins, including eight victories over other Power Four schools. It currently has eight teams bowl eligible and nearly half its conference games have been decided by a touchdown or less, which the ACC considers proof of its depth.",
      "Throw in a little star power \u2014 Ward has been in the Heisman Trophy conversation all season, with Clemson quarterback Cade Klubnik on the fringe \u2014 and the league believes it checks all the same boxes the Big Ten and SEC do.",
      "Well, except for one: brand recognition. SMU is in its first season in the league after coming over from the American Athletic Conference. Miami is still Miami, but the Hurricanes haven't ended the season ranked in the top 10 in over two decades. Clemson remains among the ACC's elite, but the Tigers have taken a step back toward the rest of the field in recent seasons.",
      "It doesn't help that defending league champion Florida State \u2014 the same program that has sued the ACC in search of an escape plan \u2014 has nose-dived from preseason top 10 to the school's worst season in 50 years.",
      "While Lashlee admits he can get caught up thinking about the \u2018what ifs\u2019 he can take solace in knowing SMU controls its destiny.",
      "If the Mustangs keep winning, they're in. If do anything other than claim the conference title, they leave themselves at the mercy of a committee that doesn't seem \u2014 at the moment anyway \u2014 to consider the ACC an equal to its brethren.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what can be done,\u201d he said. \u201cI think some of that stuff is predetermined a little bit, and that\u2019s the bias we\u2019re talking about. ... I think we\u2019ve got four big-time leagues in college football. There needs to be quality representation from all from all four.\u201d",

      "Chelsea stayed three points clear of Real Madrid, which was inspired by playmaker Caroline Weir who had two assists before curling in an elegant free kick to score herself in a 7-0 rout of Twente.",
      "Wolfsburg forward Rebecka Blomqvist struck a second-half hat trick in a 5-0 win at Galatasaray to earn the two-time European champion its first points in the group led by Lyon.",
      "Return games are played next Wednesday.",
      "At the midway point of the group stage, all the leaders have three straight wins: Lyon, Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Manchester City, which opened last month by beating defending champion Barcelona.",
      "Dumornay was the competition's young player of the year last season, and her vision and smarts were evident in the 42nd when the ball was diverted to her by teammate Lindsey Horan, the United States captain, who intercepted a pass at the halfway line.",
      "Dumornay took one touch then chipped the ball high in the air. It landed just over the goal line and bounced up into the net.",
      "Canada international Vanessa Gilles sealed the win in the 52nd, pouncing on another loose ball in the goalmouth after a corner.",
      "Celtic's women rose to playing their first European game in the club's storied stadium at Parkhead and shocked Chelsea by taking a 22nd-minute lead with its first counterattack. Murphy Agnew ran clear to reach a long pass from Shannon McGregor and beat goalkeeper Zecira Musovic.",
      "Chelsea leveled six minutes later when Japan international Maika Hamano finished a pass from Aggie Beever-Jones. It was 2-1 after a slick passing move in the 32nd, though it took a third shooting chance before Ashley Lawrence scored.",
      "Beever-Jones was sent off in the last minute of stoppage time for a second yellow card.",

      "Right-back Oihane Hernandez broke clear to finish a move she started by breaking up Twente\u2019s passing in midfield. Substitute Carla Camacho scored in stoppage time when the Dutch visitors could not clear yet another corner.",
      "In a meeting of two teams with zero points at kickoff, Wolfsburg dominated Champions League newcomer Galatasaray in Istanbul. Defender Marie Joelle Wedemeyer was unmarked at the far post to score with a header from a corner in the 24th.",
      "Sweden forward Blomqvist scored with shots in the 63rd, 77th and in stoppage time. Later in added time Vivien Endemann completed the scoring. Wolfsburg ended the game with 33 goal attempts, 14 on target, compared to two for Galatasaray.",

      "Defending World Cup champion Argentina will once again count on goalkeeper Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, who was suspended for two international matches in October. Brazil will bring back winger Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, who missed the last two qualifiers through injury but has recovered.",

      "Brazil once again will not have Neymar, who picked up a muscular injury earlier this month. There's no big name as a center forward because Rodrygo is injured, too, and Endrick was not chosen. Vin\u00edcius will likely have to link up effectively with Raphinha and Luiz Henrique.",

      "Two wins for Brazil won't secure the team a spot at the next World Cup just yet, but they will give fans and players some reassurance after a turbulent year.",
      "Colombia is hardly expecting a friendly reception in Montevideo on Friday. After all, there's unfinished business with Uruguay since their turbulent semifinal encounter at the Copa Am\u00e9rica in the United States in July.",

      "Uruguay's Bielsa will be without two key midfielders, Nicol\u00e1s de la Cruz and Giorgian de Arrascaeta, both injured. Uruguay has not won since its third-place match at the Copa America.",

    "story": [
      "The signs of success can be found all around Indiana\u2019s campus these days",
      "Ed Miller has attended Indiana football and basketball games since the early 1970s, and he's never seen a fall quite like this.",
      "As the leaves change colors and flutter to the ground, and the action ramps up for one of college basketball's true blueblood programs, everyone around Bloomington is focused on what's happening inside the football stadium.",
      "Here, the 70-year-old Miller has been part of three straight home sellouts, seen the spinning towels and decibel levels attain new heights while the favored candy-striped basketball pants have been replaced by the increasingly fashionable candy-striped overalls. Yes, even the start of basketball season cannot tarnish this season's most unthinkable story in college football \u2014 the rise of the Hoosiers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard this time of year usually to keep going to football games, but that has totally flipped,\u201d Miller said. \"And now, honestly, I\u2019m a little disappointed in basketball. I\u2019m more excited about football than basketball, and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever say that.\u201d",
      "For decades, Indiana football was mired in mediocrity or worse \u2014 irrelevance.",
      "Indiana has the most losses (713) and the 10th-lowest winning percentage (.422) in FBS history. The Hoosiers three bowl wins are the fewest of any Power 4 team and the 33-year run between postseason victories still is the second-longest active drought among teams with multiple bowl bids.",
      "How bad had things gotten? When ESPN broadcaster Joe Buck identified an Indiana alum during a Monday Night Football telecast a couple years back, Buck's broadcast partner, Troy Aikman, jokingly asked if the Hoosiers still played football.",
      "Curt Cignetti took the Indiana job to change that image and while fans liked his passion, they were skeptical of his bold, brash promise of immediate success.",
      "\u201cHey, look I'm super fired up about this opportunity,\u201d he shouted at a December basketball game. \u201cI've never taken a backseat to anybody and don't plan on starting now. Purdue sucks. But so does Michigan and Ohio State.\u201d",
      "Nobody's questioning Cignetti now.",
      "Nick Saban's first recruiting coordinator at Alabama is a frontrunner to be this year's national coach of the year, especially after Saturday's 20-15 victory over the defending national champion Wolverines.",
      "Indiana earned just its second series win since 1988 while sealing the first 10-win season in school history, perhaps fittingly, against college football's winningest program.",
      "No. 5 Indiana (10-0, 7-0 Big Ten, No. 5 CFP) now has one more win than its combined total over the previous three seasons and finds itself ditching the half-full stadiums that had become the norm in Octobers and Novembers of seasons past.",
      "\u201cWe were excited to get a new coach. We knew there was going to be a lot of turnover with the football guys, but we never could have imagined 10-0,\u201d said 47-year-old Jennifer Worman, who lives in an Indianapolis suburb. \u201dIt is unreal for IU football.\"",
      "There have been no shortage of milestone moments in 2024.",
      "\u2014 Indiana's 77-3 victory over Western Illinois in Week 2 was the most lopsided in school history and its 56-7 win over Nebraska six weeks later matched the school record for margin of victory in league play.",
      "\u2014 The Hoosiers 42-13 victory over UCLA was their first ever at the Rose Bowl.",
      "\u2014 Indiana became the first bowl eligible in the team with a 41-24 victory at Northwestern.",
      "\u2014 They've scored at least 40 points, seven times, won nine times by 14 or more points and have trailed only twice briefly all season.",
      "\u2014 And if the Hoosiers win at No. 2 Ohio State, something they haven't done since 1987, a win over rival Purdue (1-8, 0-6) could send them to their first Big Ten title game.",
      "It's a season on the brink only this locker room thought possible.",
      "\"We have playmakers all across the board,\u201d sixth-year quarterback Kurtis Rourke said earlier this season. \u201cIt makes my job a lot easier. The O-line is playing great so we can run and pass. We\u2019re just clicking right now.\u201d",
      "Naturally, all these wins have put players such as Rourke, the 2022 Mid-American Conference MVP, in the postseason award debate. Some think Rourke even belongs in the Heisman Trophy race.",
      "He's hardly alone.",
      "Defensive end Mikail Kamara, a transfer from James Madison, leads the conference in sacks (9 1/2) and earned two national defensive player of the week awards following a 2 1/2-sack, 4 1/2-tackle for loss performance as Indiana reclaimed the Old Brass Spittoon at Michigan State.",
      "Elijah Sarratt also played previously for Cignetti at James Madison and now ranks fifth in the Big Ten in catches (38), yards (685) and yards per catch (18.0). He's tied for sixth with six TD receptions.",
      "And while some contend a soft schedule has helped the Hoosiers, it didn't in other years.",
      "Indiana may in fact be the most balanced team in the nation. It's ranked second in scoring offense (43.9 points), seventh in scoring defense (13.8) and among the top 25 nationally in passing offense (23rd, 276.5 yards), run defense (first, 72.7), pass defense (22nd, 183.3), turnover margin (tied for 12th, 1.0 per game) and takeaways (20th, 17).",
      "It's enough to convince Indiana fans the Hoosiers should make the expanded 12-team playoff field \u2014 win or lose at Ohio State. And it's rekindled memories of Bob Knight's three national championship runs and has done what nobody thought possible \u2014 temporarily overshadowed basketball at Indiana while the victory flag at Memorial Stadium flies for a 12th consecutive week.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m checking some boxes off, football-wise, that I never thought I\u2019d be able to see,\u201d said 58-year-old Randy Pruitt of Columbus, Indiana, who has seen the Hoosiers exceed his wildest expectations. \u201cMake a bowl, that\u2019s probably what we thought. No way would we be mentioned in the top 12 teams and the playoffs. Maybe we still get overlooked, I don\u2019t know. But this wasn\u2019t on the radar.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Seventy years since the last professional women\u2019s baseball league, another one hopes to give women a chance to shine in baseball",
      "For nearly every highlight of Julie Croteau's trailblazing baseball career \u2014 all except her time as a double in \u201cA League of Their Own,\u201d really \u2014 she shared the field with men. Frequently as teammates. Always as foes. That's mostly how it's been for generations of female players.",
      "So when she recently heard about plans to give today's players the chance to shine against other women in baseball, Croteau had one thought.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d she said with a chuckle.",
      "The Women's Professional Baseball League (WPBL) announced plans last month to launch in 2026 as a six-team circuit for female players. If and when it debuts, it will be the first pro league for women since the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League \u2014 the one immortalized in \u201cA League of Their Own\u201d \u2014 dissolved in 1954.",
      "Heightened interest in women's sports in recent years made this an ideal time to launch a women's baseball league, said co-founder Justine Siegal, the first woman to coach for an MLB team with the Oakland Athletics in 2015.",
      "The consulting firm Deloitte estimated that women's sports will generate a billion dollars in global revenue in 2024 for the first time because of skyrocketing popularity and marketing deals. The WNBA had its most watched regular season in 24 years thanks largely to its star rookie class led by Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. The inaugural season of the Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League brought in record crowds.",
      "\u201cCertainly we\u2019re standing on the shoulders of the success of the other pro leagues,\u201d Siegal said.",
      "Siegal has sought advice from women leading other professional leagues and is studying what made them successful. That includes catering to the specific needs of female athletes \u2014 who often face a different set of responsibilities than their male counterparts.",
      "Siegal was the first woman to coach for a professional baseball team with the independent league Brockton Rox in 2009, and the first woman to throw batting practice to an MLB team with Cleveland during spring training in 2001.",
      "Back then, Siegal remembers scrambling to find babysitters for her daughter while she coached, and pulling her daughter out of school and bringing her along to the field in some cases.",
      "\u201cI had to do many things to make my dream come true,\u201d Siegal said. \u201cAnd so I am particularly keen on making sure that we don\u2019t overlook mothers who can compete and deserve a place in the league.\u201d",
      "When she was 13, a coach told Siegal she shouldn't play baseball because she was a girl. She was told to play softball, which is a reality many girls in the sport face.",
      "Around 1,300 high school girls played baseball on boys teams across the United States during the 2023-24 school year, according to a survey done by the National Federation of State High School Associations.",
      "\u201cWhen I see that number, I think that there\u2019s 1,300 people who had to sort of basically buck the system to keep playing the sport that they love,\u201d said Croteau, who made headlines in the 1980s by suing her high school for the right to play on the boys varsity team. She lost.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve had to stare down an athletic director or approach a baseball coach, and they\u2019ve had to make it happen.\u201d",
      "More than 471,000 high school boys played baseball, while 473,000 girls played softball. The NCAA doesn't offer women's baseball, but nine women played on men's baseball teams in 2024, according to the NCAA's demographics database. Around 21,000 women played college softball.",
      "Keith Stein, a lawyer and businessman who co-founded the WPBL with Siegal, said the hope is to help establish a solid women's baseball culture in the U.S. to create more playing opportunities for girls in the future.",
      "Both Stein and Siegal pointed to early interest from women's baseball players as clues to the hunger for a venue for women to compete against women at the highest level. While there hasn't been a pro league for women's ballplayers, they still play. The Women's Baseball World Cup debuted in 2004 to showcase women's talent.",
      "More than 400 athletes registered to try out within 24 hours of the league launching its player portal, Siegal said.",
      "\u201cThese were largely elite players,\u201d Stein added. \u201cSome of the best players in the world \u2014 from the United States, of course, but there were players from Japan, Canada, Great Britain.\u201d",
      "The league will hold a scouting camp in spring 2025, with a draft happening in the last quarter of the year. The WPBL will initially launch with six teams, though Stein estimated that number could later increase to eight. They'll compete in the northeast in 2026 so that they can travel by bus to compete.",
      "While Stein expects the WPBL to become one of the major women's sports leagues in the near future, it won't get there without facing some of the same barriers as the women's leagues that preceded them.",
      "Women athletes have long fought to be paid as much as their male counterparts, perhaps most prominently displayed through the U.S. women's national soccer team's fight for equal pay that ended in the U.S. House passing an equal pay bill in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t gloss over a certain reality,\" Stein said. \"And that reality is that women baseball players, they probably are not being paid what they deserve.\"",
      "Stein said he believes compensation will be suitable for players hoping to participate in the league, including those who have to relocate from different countries or leave their current jobs.",
      "\u201cBut it will pale compared to if you\u2019re thinking of what major league athletes in some of the other leagues are making,\u201d he added. \"That\u2019s not what\u2019s in place right now.",
      "\u201cWe will get there because of what we do. We will raise the bar for pro women baseball players. But it will be gradual over several years.\u201d",
      "Croteau, who isn't connected to the WPBL, praised the league for trying to bridge the gap that has existed since long before she and teammate Beanie Ketcham were believed to be the first women to play in an MLB affiliated minor league in the now defunct Hawaiian Winter League 30 years ago.",
      "\u201cThe girls who are out there playing on their own,\u201d Croteau said, \u201cthose 1,300 girls that we\u2019re talking about now, who we knew were good enough because they\u2019re making the team. We also know they\u2019re strong willed. They\u2019re willing to buck the system and make it happen.",
      "\"This helps them get seen.\u201d",

      "It's auction day for Alex Jones' Infowars",
      "Conspiracy theory purveyor Infowars and most of its assets went on the auction block Wednesday, with Alex Jones waiting to see if he will be allowed to stay or if he will get kicked off its online platforms.",
      "The private auction was being held as part of Jones' personal bankruptcy, which resulted from the nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuit judgments a judge and jurors ordered the bombastic internet show and radio host to pay to families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for repeatedly telling his audience that the Connecticut massacre of 20 children and six adults was a hoax staged by crisis actors. Jones, who has since acknowledged that the shooting did happen, is appealing the defamation verdicts.",
      "The bankruptcy trustee was scheduled to open sealed bids at 10:30 a.m. CST and choose the winning bidder or bidders. There was no immediate announcement of the results.",
      "Jones appeared to be getting impatient on his show as hours passed without any word on the auction.",
      "\u201cI just want to know: Is this our last day here or not?\" he said.",
      "Both Jones' supporters and detractors expressed interest in submitting bids. They included Roger Stone, an ally of Jones and President-elect Donald Trump, and progressive media groups that have been critical of Jones. He said he could be allowed to stay and keep using Infowars' platforms if allies won the bidding but that he could be kicked out and Infowars shut down if opponents bought it.",
      "Jones, based in Austin, Texas, said he set up a new studio, websites and social media accounts just in case. His personal social media in his name \u2014 including his account on X, with more than 3 million followers \u2014 were not up for sale. Court proceedings on whether they should be auctioned are pending.",
      "Jones revealed Wednesday that he worked with a group that put in a bid, but did not provide any details.",
      "\u201cThe folks I\u2019m working with, who put in (a) substantive bid to try to save Infowars and continue it in the future, have been given no information on the other bidders. That\u2019s all secret,\" he said in a video posted on X.",
      "Everything from Jones\u2019 studio desk to Infowars\u2019 name, video archive, social media accounts, and product trademarks and inventory were up for sale. Buyers could even purchase an armored truck and video cameras. . Any unsold items will be auctioned off next month.",
      "Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, including real estate as well as guns and other personal belongings, also are being sold as part of the bankruptcy.",
      "Prospective buyers submitted sealed bids and confidentiality agreements by last Friday. The bankruptcy trustee, attorney Christopher Murray, appointed by the Justice Department, could have held new rounds of bidding Wednesday to boost prices above the sealed bids.",
      "Jones said Murray decided to choose from among the sealed bids. Jones said he was frustrated with that decision and learned about changes to the auction process only on Monday. A judge's order in September gave the trustee wide authority and said new bidding rounds on Wednesday were optional.",
      "Murray also could reject bids, even the highest ones, if he deemed them \u201ccontrary to the best interests of the Debtor\u2019s estate, FSS (Infowars parent company Free Speech Systems) and their creditors.\u201d",
      "Families sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress for repeatedly saying on his show that the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 conspiracies and threats by his followers."

    "story": [
      "Japan\u2019s nuclear watchdog has formally disqualified a reactor in the country\u2019s north-central region from starting",
      "TOKYO -- Japan's nuclear watchdog on Wednesday formally disqualified a reactor in the country's north-central region from restarting, the first rejection under safety standards that were reinforced after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The decision is a setback for Japan as it seeks to accelerate reactor restarts to maximize nuclear power.",
      "The Nuclear Regulation Authority said the Tsuruga No. 2 reactor is \u201cunfit\u201d as its operator failed to address safety risks stemming from the presence of possible active fault lines, which can potentially cause earthquakes, underneath it.",
      "Tsuruga No. 2, operated by the Japan Atomic Power Co., is the first reactor to be rejected under safety standards adopted in 2013 based on lessons from the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi meltdown disaster following a massive earthquake and tsunami.",
      "\u201cWe reached our conclusion based on a very strict examination,\u201d NRA chairperson Shinsuke Yamanaka told reporters.",
      "The verdict comes after more than eight years of safety reviews that were repeatedly disrupted by data coverups and mistakes by the operator, Yamanaka said. He called the case \u201cabnormal\u201d and urged the utility to take the result seriously.",
      "The decision is a blow to Japan Atomic Power because it virtually ends its hopes for a restart. The operator, which is decommissioning its other reactor, Tsuruga No. 1, had hoped to put No. 2 back online, but it would require an examination of dozens of faults around the reactor to prove their safety.",
      "\u201cThe decision is extremely regrettable,\" Japan Atomic Power said in a statement. It said it will continue efforts to restart.",
      "An NRA safety panel concluded three months ago it could not rule out the possibility of active fault lines about 300 meters (330 yards) north of the No. 2 reactor stretching to right underneath the facility, meaning the reactor cannot be operated.",
      "Japan\u2019s government in 2022 adopted a plan to maximize the use of nuclear energy, pushing to accelerate reactor restarts to secure a stable energy supply and meet its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that safety is the prerequisite for nuclear plant operation and that the government respects the scientific and highly technical decision by the watchdog. He said the government's position to promote nuclear energy is unchanged.",
      "Concern about the government\u2019s revived push for nuclear energy grew after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit Japan\u2019s Noto Peninsula on Jan. 1, 2024, killing more than 400 people and damaging more than 100,000 structures. The quake caused minor damage to two nearby nuclear facilities, and evacuation plans for the region were found to be inadequate.",
      "Building key nuclear facilities, such as reactors, directly above active fault lines is prohibited in earthquake-prone Japan.",
      "Yamanaka said the NRA is not immediately ordering a decommissioning because the reactor, which is offline and its spent fuel safely cooled, will not pose a major threat.",
      "If the utility decides to reapply, it must address not only the faults issue but it also must implement adequate safety measures for the entire plant, Yamanaka said. Providing scientific proof of the status of faults underneath key nuclear facilities is difficult, but other operators that obtained restart permits all cleared the requirement, he noted.",
      "The Tsuruga No. 2 reactor first started commercial operation in February 1987 and has been offline since May 2011. The operator rejected the NRA panel's 2013 on-site inspection results, which concluded that the faults under the No. 2 reactor were active, and applied for a restart in 2015.",
      "Of more than 50 commercial reactors, 27 have applied for restarts and 17 of them have been approved so far under the post-Fukushima safety standard."

Amazon plans to ship the products to U.S. customers from a warehouse it operates in China, according to documentation the company provided to sellers. Amazon said Haul orders could arrive within one to two weeks.",

      "To be sure, importing goods out of China could soon become more expensive for Amazon. In September, the Biden administration said it was cracking down on cheap products sold out of China, a move designed to reduce U.S. dependence on Beijing but could also trigger higher prices for the U.S. consumers who have flocked to Shein and Temu. President-elect Donald Trump has also proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China.",
      "Amazon announced other news this week.",
      "The company said it was shutting down its free, ad-supported streaming service Freevee and consolidating the content under Prime Video, which now also features ads for Prime members who refuse to pay extra to avoid them.",
      "The Seattle-based tech company confirmed Wednesday that it will phase out Freevee in the coming weeks, a move that it says is intended to \u201cdeliver a simpler viewing experience for customers.\u201d All Freevee content that\u2019s currently streaming on Prime Video will be labeled \u201cWatch for Free\u201d so both Prime and non-Prime members can easily see what\u2019s available for free, the company said.",
      "\u201cThere will be no change to the content available for Prime members, and a vast offering of free streaming content will still be accessible for non-Prime members,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement."

      "ROME -- Italian President Sergio Mattarella sharply rebuked Elon Musk on Wednesday for weighing in on Italian court rulings that have stymied the government\u2019s plans to process some asylum-seekers in Albania.",
      "Musk, who is expected to have a top advisory role in Donald Trump\u2019s new administration, wrote Tuesday on X that \u201cthese judges need to go.\u201d He was referring to the latest Italian court ruling against right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni\u2019s much-touted Albania immigration deal.",
      "\u201cThis is unacceptable. Do the people of Italy live in a democracy or does an unelected autocracy make the decisions?\u201d he wrote in a subsequent post Wednesday.",
      "The posts concerned a Rome court's refusal to rule on a formal request to detain seven migrants rescued at sea and transferred to Albania for processing. Monday's ruling resulted in the men being brought to Italy for processing.",
      "Mattarella didn\u2019t cite Musk by name but \u2014 in an unusually piqued statement \u2014 made clear on Wednesday that he was referring to him. Italy's head of state demanded respect for the country's sovereignty, especially from other soon-to-be public officials.",
      "\u201cItaly is a great democratic country and \u2026 knows how to take care of itself while respecting its Constitution,\u201d Mattarella said in a statement issued by his spokesman.",
      "\u201cAnyone, particularly if as announced is about to assume an important role of government in a friendly and allied country, must respect its sovereignty and cannot attribute to himself the task of imparting prescriptions,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Trump announced Tuesday that Musk, one of the most influential people around the U.S. president-elect, would help lead a Department of Government Efficiency, essentially an independent advisory panel to eliminate waste and fraud.",
      "Musk is a supporter of Meloni and has met with her in Rome on a few occasions, and in September joined her at an awards ceremony on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Photos of them together made such news that Musk seemingly felt the need to tamp down speculation by posting \u201cWe are not dating.\u201d",
      "Musk has a history of making provocative statements and sparring with leaders on X. Earlier this year, he posted messages insulting U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and saying the United Kingdom was headed for civil war. He has also clashed with a Brazilian supreme court justice over free speech, far-right accounts and purported misinformation on X, and also accused Venezuela\u2019s socialist president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, of \u201cmajor election fraud\u201d after that country\u2019s disputed election.",
      "Later Wednesday, an Italian representative of X, Andrea Stroppa, tweeted what appeared to be a statement from Musk that said he had spoken during the day with Meloni. According to Stroppa's tweet, Musk \u201cexpresses his respect\u201d for Mattarella and the Italian Constitution but insists on his right to freedom of expression.",
      "The courts\u2019 rulings have raised the ire of Meloni\u2019s far-right-led government, which has been seeking strategies to ease the strain on Italy of the arrival of migrants seeking a better life in Europe. The government had held up the opening of the Albanian centers as a centerpiece of its immigration crackdown, also as a means of deterrence, and said they could be a model for Europe.",
      "In both cases, Italian courts referred the cases to the EU court of justice in Luxembourg to rule if the countries of origin for the migrants are considered safe for repatriation. There is no word on when the European court might rule.",
      "But as a result of the Rome court decisions, no migrant has yet been processed in the Albanian centers, which are budgeted to cost Italy 670 million euros ($730 million) over five years to build and operate.",
      "Italy's opposition says the money could be much better spent on reinforcing Italian-operated migrant processing centers, while human rights groups say the outsourcing of asylum processing contravenes international law.",
      "The centers opened in October after a months-long delay, because crumbling soil at one of the facilities needed to be repaired. They are run by Italy and are under the country's jurisdiction, while Albanian guards provide external security."

      "\u201cChina's stance on the issue of cybersecurity is consistent and clear,\u201d the ministry said in a faxed reply to a request for comment without elaborating.",
      "According to the Insikt group research, the sites were first compromised in late May and the attacks bear many overlaps with a previously tracked hacker group known as TAG-102, leading analysts to conclude it is a subgroup of the already known group \u201cworking toward the same or similar intelligence requirements,\u201d Insikt Group said.",
      "Overlaps include reuse of specific tactics, techniques and procedures and going after identical targets, Condra said.",
      "\u201cThese two threat clusters are almost certainly interrelated,\u201d he said.",
      "TAG-102, known by multiple names such as Evasive Panda and StormBamboo, has been in operation since as early as 2012, and is widely thought to be a Chinese-sponsored advanced persistent threat, or APT, group, Insikt Group said.",
      "Among other things, it uses custom malware frameworks used by other Chinese APT groups and its targeting \u201caligns with likely Chinese intelligence requirements,\u201d Condra said.",
      "\u201cThe group has engaged in a wide variety of campaigns over the years, with an emphasis on targeting individuals and organizations in opposition to the Chinese government, such as human rights organizations, religious organizations, ethnic minority groups, academic institutions, and supporters of democracy or independence movements in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and even in mainland China,\u201d Insikt Group said.",
      "The university and the news website, which are both located in India, have been informed by Insikt Group of the hack. As of this week, it appears the Gyudmed Tantric University, which is a place of learning about Tibetan Buddhism, language, history and culture, has remediated the problem while the news website remained compromised, Condra said.",
      "The Tibet Post is known for promoting democracy, freedom of speech and for advocating Tibetan independence from China, he said.",
      "China claims Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, although it only established firm control over the Himalayan region after the Communist Party swept to power during a civil war in 1949.",
      "Many Tibetans' loyalties still lie with the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader who has lived in exile in India since a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959.",
      "China has been regularly accused of human rights abuses in Tibet, including earlier this year over its efforts to forcibly urbanize villagers and herders as part of a drive to assimilate rural Tibetans through control over their language and traditional Buddhist culture."

      "Social media platform Bluesky has gained 1 million new users in the week since the U.S. election",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Social media site Bluesky has gained 1 million new users in the week since the U.S. election, as some X users look for an alternative platform to post their thoughts and engage with others online.",
      "Bluesky said Wednesday that its total users surged to 15 million, up from roughly 13 million at the end of October.",
      "Championed by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Bluesky was an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That invite-only period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other features. The platform resembles Elon Musk's X, with a \u201cdiscover\u201d feed as well a chronological feed for accounts that users follow. Users can send direct messages and pin posts, as well as find \u201cstarter packs\u201d that provide a curated list of people and custom feeds to follow.",
      "The post-election uptick in users isn\u2019t the first time that Bluesky has benefitted from people leaving X. Bluesky gained 2.6 million users in the week after X was banned in Brazil in August \u2014 85% of them from Brazil, the company said. About 500,000 new users signed up in the span of one day last month, when X signaled that blocked accounts would be able to see a user's public posts.",
      "Despite Bluesky's growth, X posted last week that it had \u201cdominated the global conversation on the U.S. election\u201d and had set new records. The platform saw a 15.5% jump in new-user signups on Election Day, X said, with a record 942 million posts worldwide. Representatives for Bluesky and for X did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Bluesky has referenced its competitive relationship to X through tongue-in-cheeks comments, including an Election Day post on X referencing Musk watching voting results come in with President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cI can guarantee that no Bluesky team members will be sitting with a presidential candidate tonight and giving them direct access to control what you see online,\u201d Bluesky said.",
      "Across the platform, new users \u2014 among them journalists, left-leaning politicians and celebrities \u2014 have posted memes and shared that they were looking forward to using a space free from advertisements and hate speech. Some said it reminded them of the early days of X, when it was still Twitter.",
      "On Wednesday, The Guardian said it would no longer post on X, citing \u201cfar right conspiracy theories and racism\u201d on the site as a reason. At the same time, television journalist Don Lemon posted on X that he is leaving the platform but will continue to use other social media, including Bluesky.",
      "Lemon said he felt X was no longer a place for \u201chonest debate and discussion.\u201d He noted changes to the site's terms of service set to go into effect Friday that state lawsuits against X must be filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas rather than the Western District of Texas. Musk said in July that he was moving X's headquarters to Texas from San Francisco.",
      "\u201cAs the Washington Post recently reported on X\u2019s decision to change the terms, this 'ensures that such lawsuits will be heard in courthouses that are a hub for conservatives, which experts say could make it easier for X to shield itself from litigation and punish critics,\u2019\u201d Lemon wrote. \u201cI think that speaks for itself.\u201d",
      "Last year, advertisers such as IBM, NBCUniversal and its parent company Comcast fled X over concerns about their ads showing up next to pro-Nazi content and hate speech on the site in general, with Musk inflaming tensions with his own posts endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory."

      "In picking billionaire Elon Musk to be \u201cour cost cutter\u201d for the U.S. government, President-elect Donald Trump won't be the first American president to empower a business tycoon to look for ways to dramatically cut federal regulations.",
      "President Ronald Reagan tapped J. Peter Grace to lead a bureaucratic cost-cutting commission in 1982. Still, the chemical business magnate had fewer conflicts of interest than the world's richest man does today.",
      "Musk's SpaceX holds billions of dollars in NASA contracts. He's CEO of Tesla, an electric car business that benefits from government tax incentives and is subject to auto safety rules. His social media platform X, artificial intelligence startup xAI, brain implant maker Neuralink and tunnel-building Boring company all intersect with the federal government in various ways.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s direct conflicts between his businesses and government\u2019s interest,\u201d said Ann Skeet, director of leadership ethics at Santa Clara University's Markkula Center. \u201cHe\u2019s now in a position to try and curry favor for those enterprises.\u201d",
      "Musk is also more influential, having pumped an estimated $200 million through his political action committee to help elect Trump, made himself a fixture at Mar-a-Lago since the presidential election and is on regular speaking terms with like-minded political world leaders, from Argentina\u2019s President Javier Milei to Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.",
      "Trump has said Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a new \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency,\u201d or DOGE, \u2014 a joke name that references the cryptocurrency Dogecoin and appeals to Musk's sense of humor.",
      "\u201cWe finally have a mandate to delete the mountain of choking regulations that do not serve the greater good,\u201d Musk said Wednesday on X.",
      "Trump has said that Musk and Ramaswamy will work from outside the government to offer the White House \u201cadvice and guidance\u201d and will partner with the Office of Management and Budget to drive structural reform \u2014 some of which could only be done through Congress.",
      "\"If it\u2019s a commission, it\u2019s outside the government\u201d and Musk could not have a White House office or official government title, said Richard Painter, a White House ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration. \u201cThen, the president takes the advice or doesn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "If it were a true government agency, however, Musk would run afoul of federal conflict of interest laws unless he divested from his businesses or recused from government matters involving them, Painter said.",
      "Trump could grant a rare waiver exempting Musk from those laws, a move that has been politically unpopular in the past, Painter said.",
      "Tesla, SpaceX and X didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday about whether Musk would recuse himself. The Trump transition team also didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "However it is structured, Musk's ideas are expected to have an influence.",
      "Tesla, the electric vehicle company that made Musk the world\u2019s wealthiest person, has had repeated skirmishes with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates vehicle safety. So any cuts to NHTSA funding or staffing could help Tesla.",
      "The agency has forced Tesla to do recalls it didn\u2019t want, and it has opened investigations of Tesla vehicles, some of which raised questions about Musk\u2019s claims that Tesla is close to deploying autonomous vehicles without human drivers. The agency also is working on regulations that cover vehicle automation.",
      "Auto safety advocates are worried that a Department of Government Efficiency co-chaired by Musk could propose draconian cuts at NHTSA.",
      "\u201cThat could be incredibly problematic because that would impact every rule-making from all of the agencies that currently oversee companies that Musk owns,\u201d said Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, a watchdog group.",
      "If implemented, Musk\u2019s plan for efficiency at NHTSA could mirror what he did when he took over Twitter \u2014 draconian staff cuts, said Missy Cummings, director of the autonomy and robotics center at George Mason University and a former safety adviser to NHTSA.",
      "While Cummings concedes there is room for much of the federal government to become more efficient, she said that NHTSA is already understaffed and she predicted that Musk would try to slow or stop NHTSA investigations or handicap the agency so it would have trouble enforcing regulations.",
      "\u201cIt would just leave it as a shell of the agency that it was,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir whole job would be to put out commercials reminding people to just wear their seat belts.\u201d",
      "Launching test flights out of South Texas, SpaceX\u2019s mega rocket Starship is how NASA intends to land astronauts on the moon for the first time in more than a half-century. NASA has awarded more than $4 billion to SpaceX for the first two human moon landings coming up later this decade under the Artemis program. Musk has been at odds with the Federal Aviation Administration for slowing Starship over what he contends is excessive bureaucracy.",
      "SpaceX also has racked up multiple contracts with NASA over the past decade for launching supplies and astronauts to the International Space Station. The contracts for crew flights alone from 2020 through 2030 total $5 billion.",
      "More recently, in June, NASA awarded an $843 million contract to SpaceX to provide the vehicle for deorbiting the International Space Station at the end of its lifetime in early 2031, directing it to a fiery re-entry over the Pacific.",
      "SpaceX also has multiple contracts with the Defense Department, some classified and said to be worth billions. In addition, the Pentagon has purchased internet services in Ukraine from SpaceX\u2019s Starlink constellation. The militarized version of Starlink is called Starshield.",
      "The social media platform X is another Musk company that has drawn scrutiny from federal regulators. The Federal Trade Commission has probed Musk\u2019s handling of sensitive consumer data after he took control of the company in 2022 but has not brought enforcement action. The SEC has an ongoing investigation of Musk\u2019s purchase of the social media company.",
      "Musk has been forceful with his political views on the platform, changing its rules, content moderation systems and algorithms to conform with his world view. After Musk endorsed Trump following an attempt on the former president\u2019s life last summer, the platform has transformed into a megaphone for Trump\u2019s campaign, offering an unprecedented level of free advertising that is all but impossible to calculate the value of.",
      "Musk's strong interest in AI is also likely to play a role. He's in the process of building an AI supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, for his AI startup xAI.",
      "But environmental groups have raised concerns about pollution generated by the facility's gas turbines and its strain on the local power grid, prompting attention from the Environmental Protection Agency.",

    "story": [
      "Even as Earth sets new heat records, humanity this year is pumping 330 million tons (300 million metric tons) more carbon dioxide into the air by burning fossil fuels than it did last year",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Even as Earth sets new heat records, humanity this year is pumping 330 million tons (300 million metric tons) more carbon dioxide into the air by burning fossil fuels than it did last year.",
      "This year the world is on track to put 41.2 billion tons (37.4 billion metric tons) of the main heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere. It\u2019s a 0.8% increase from 2023, according to Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists who track emissions. Several United Nations reports say the globe must cut emissions by 42% by 2030 to possibly limit warming to an internationally agreed-upon threshold.",
      "This year's pollution increase isn't quite as large as last year's 1.4% jump, scientists said while presenting the data at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan.",
      "If the world continues burning fossil fuels at today's level, it has six years before passing 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, the limit agreed to at the 2015 climate talks in Paris, said study co-author Stephen Sitch. The Earth is already at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit), according to the United Nations.",
      "\u201cWe clearly are not doing enough on a global scale to reduce emissions. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said study co-author Mike O'Sullivan, a University of Exeter climate scientist. \"We need to massively increase ambition and actually just think outside the box of how we can change things, not be so tied to fossil fuel interests.''",
      "Scientists used reported emissions from rich countries and oil industry data, O\u2019Sullivan said. The 2024 figure includes projections for the last couple months or so. The Global Carbon Project team released figures for the four biggest carbon emitters \u2014 China, the United States, India and Europe. It also produced more detailed and final figures for about 200 countries for 2023.",
      "The continued rise in carbon emissions is mostly from the developing world and China. Many analysts had been hoping that China \u2014 by far the world's biggest annual carbon polluting nation with 32% of the emissions \u2014 would have peaked its carbon dioxide emissions by now. Instead China's emissions rose 0.2% from 2023, with coal pollution up 0.3%, Global Carbon Project calculated. But it could drop to zero in the next two months and is \u201cbasically flat,\u201d O'Sullivan said.",
      "That's nothing close to the increase in India, which at 8% of the globe's carbon pollution is third-largest carbon emitter. India's carbon pollution jumped 4.6% in 2024, the scientists said.",
      "Carbon emissions dropped in both the United States and the European Union. They fell 0.6% in the U.S. mostly from reduced coal, oil and cement use. The U.S. was responsible for 13% of the globe's carbon dioxide in 2024. Historically, it's responsible for 21% of the world's emissions since 1950, a figure that matters since the gas persists in the atmosphere for centuries.",
      "Twenty-two nations have shown steady decreases in emissions, O'Sullivan said, singling out the United States as one of those. The biggest emission drops from 2014 to 2023 were in the United States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.",
      "Europe, which accounts for 7% of the world's carbon pollution, saw its carbon dioxide output drop 3.8% from last year \u2014 driven by a big cut in coal emissions.",
      "Global carbon emissions are well more than double what they were 50 years ago and 50% than they were in 1999. Emissions have gone up about 6% in the past decade.",
      "\u201cThis is a needed reminder of the urgency with which we need to address the cause of the climate crisis,\" said PowerShift Africa founder Mohamed Adow, who wasn't part of the study. \u201cThe problem is the fossil fuel industry is kicking and screaming for us to slow down and to keep them in business for longer. That\u2019s why they poured money into Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign.\u201d",
      "Carbon dioxide from humanity's burning of coal, oil and natural gas amounts to 2.6 million pounds (nearly 1.2 million kilograms) of the heat-trapping gas every second.",
      "Total carbon emissions \u2014 which include fossil fuel pollution and land use changes such as deforestation \u2014 are basically flat because land emissions are declining, the scientists said. That\u2019s an important and encouraging milestone amid bad news, said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann",

      "Waymo on Tuesday opened its robotaxi service to anyone who wants a ride around Los Angeles, marking another milestone in the evolution of self-driving car technology since the company began as a secret project at Google 15 years ago.",
      "The expansion comes eight months after Waymo began offering rides in Los Angeles to a limited group of passengers chosen from a waiting list that had ballooned to more than 300,000 people. Now, anyone with the Waymo One smartphone app will be able to request a ride around an 80-square-mile (129-square-kilometer) territory spanning the second largest U.S. city.",
      "After Waymo received approval from California regulators to charge for rides 15 months ago, the company initially chose to launch its operations in San Francisco before offering a limited service in Los Angeles.",
      "Before deciding to compete against conventional ride-hailing pioneers Uber and Lyft in California, Waymo unleashed its robotaxis in Phoenix in 2020 and has been steadily extending the reach of its service in that Arizona city ever since.",
      "Driverless rides are proving to be more than just a novelty. Waymo says it now transports more than 150,000 weekly trips in its robotaxis, a volume of business numbers that helped the company recently raise $5.6 billion from its corporate parent Alphabet and a list of other investors that included venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and financial management firm T. Rowe Price.",
      "\u201cOur service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving,\" Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a blog post.",
      "Despite its inroads, Waymo is still believed to be losing money. Although Alphabet doesn't disclose Waymo's financial results, the robotaxi is a major part of an \u201cOther Bets\u201d division that had suffered an operating loss of $3.3 billion through the first nine months of this year, down from a setback of $4.2 billion at the same time last year.",
      "But Waymo has come a long way since Google began working on self-driving cars in 2009 as part of project \u201cChauffeur.\u201d Since its 2016 spinoff from Google, Waymo has established itself as the clear leader in a robotaxi industry that's getting more congested.",
      "Electric auto pioneer Tesla is aiming to launch a rival \u201cCybercab\u201d service by 2026, although its CEO Elon Musk said he hopes the company can get the required regulatory clearances to operate in Texas and California by next year.",
      "Tesla's projected timeline for competing against Waymo has been met with skepticism because Musk has made unfulfilled promises about the company's self-driving car technology for nearly a decade.",
      "Meanwhile, Waymo's robotaxis have driven more than 20 million fully autonomous miles and provided more than 2 million rides to passengers without encountering a serious accident that resulted in its operations being sidelined.",
      "That safety record is a stark contrast to one of its early rivals, Cruise, a robotaxi service owned by General Motors. Cruise's California license was suspended last year after one of its driverless cars in San Francisco dragged a jaywalking pedestrian who had been struck by a different car driven by a human.",
      "Cruise is now trying to rebound by joining forces with Uber to make some of its services available next year in U.S. cities that still haven't been announced. But Waymo also has forged a similar alliance with Uber to dispatch its robotaxi in Atlanta and Austin, Texas next year.",
      "Another robotaxi service, Amazon's Zoox, is hoping to begin offering driverless rides to the general public in Las Vegas at some point next year before also launching in San Francisco."

      "After a tumultuous year filled with anxiety and a legal battle about its future in the U.S., TikTok may have just been thrown a lifeline by the man who was once its biggest foe: Donald Trump.",
      "President-elect Trump, who tried to ban the social media platform the last time he was in the White House, has repeatedly pledged during his most recent campaign to oppose a ban on the short-form video app, which could happen as soon as mid-January if the company loses a court case that\u2019s currently underway in Washington.",
      "For months, TikTok, and its China-based parent company ByteDance, have been embroiled in a legal battle with the U.S. over a federal law that forces them to cut ties for national security reasons or stop operating in one of their biggest markets in the world. The measure, signed by President Joe Biden in April, gives ByteDance nine months to divest its stakes, with a possible three-month extension if a sale was in progress. If that happens, the deadline could be extended into the first 100 days of Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "The companies have claimed that divestiture is not possible, and the law, if upheld, would force them to shut down by Jan. 19, just a day before Trump\u2019s second inauguration. Attorneys for both sides have asked a federal appeals court reviewing the case to issue a ruling by Dec. 6. The losing side is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority and could decide to take up the case, potentially dragging out the process even longer.",
      "When reached for comment, the Trump transition team did not offer details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to \u201csave TikTok,\u201d as he said on a Truth Social post in September while encouraging people who care about the platform to vote for him. But Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the transition team, indicated in a statement that he plans to see it through.",
      "\ufeff\u201cThe American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cHe will deliver.\u201d",
      "During a March interview with CNBC, Trump said he still believed TikTok posed a national security risk but opposed banning it because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he has continued to lambast over his 2020 election loss. He also denied changing his mind on the issue because of Republican megadonor Jeff Yass, a ByteDance investor that Trump, at the time, said that he had only met \u201cvery briefly.\u201d He said Yass \u201cnever mentioned TikTok\u201d during their meeting.",
      "Still, ByteDance \u2013 and groups connected to Yass \u2013 have been attempting to exert their influence. Lobbying disclosure reports show that this year, ByteDance paid veteran lobbyist and former Trump campaign aide David Urban $150,000 to lobby lawmakers in Washington in favor of TikTok. The company has also spent more than $8 million on in-house lobbyists and another $1.4 million on other lobbying firms, according to Open Secrets.",
      "Meanwhile, in March, Politico reported Kellyanne Conway, a former senior Trump aide, was being paid by the Yass-funded conservative group Club for Growth to advocate for TikTok in Congress. A spokesperson for the organization said Conway was hired as a consultant to conduct polling. Conway and Urban did not respond to requests for comment. TikTok, which has long denied it\u2019s a national security risk, declined to comment.",
      "If the courts uphold the law, it would fall on Trump\u2019s Justice Department to enforce it and punish any potential violations with fines. The fines would apply to app stores that would be prohibited from offering TikTok, and internet hosting services who would be barred from supporting it. Leah Plunkett, a lecturer at Harvard Law School, said from her reading of the statute, the attorney general has to investigate violations but can decide whether or not to drag such companies to court and force them to comply.",
      "Trump could do other things to prevent TikTok from disappearing.",
      "He could issue an executive order to nullify the ban \u2014 which Plunkett believes would not be lawful \u2014 or urge Congress to repeal the law. That would require support from Congressional Republicans who have aligned themselves with Trump but have also supported the prospects of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company.",
      "In a statement sent to the AP after the election, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said Trump\u2019s \u201clong-standing concerns\u201d about TikTok align with the law\u2019s requirement for divestment.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration will have a unique opportunity to broker an American takeover of the platform,\u201d he said.",
      "ByteDance, though, has previously said it has no intention to sell the platform despite interest from some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Analysts say the company is even less likely to sell the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app. That means even if TikTok is sold to a qualified buyer, it is likely to be a shell of its current self and would need to be rebuilt with new technology.",
      "Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute, said it\u2019s also possible that Trump could take the issue back to the drawing board and direct his administration to negotiate a new deal with TikTok.",
      "TikTok said in 2022, it presented the Biden administration with a draft agreement that would bolster protections for users and provide it more oversight over the company\u2019s U.S. operations. But the administration has argued in court documents in recent months that it would be challenging to enforce the agreement due to the size and the technical complexity of the platform.",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t been privy to new intelligence material on the matter for a few years and it's possible he could change his mind - and abandon his campaign promise - once he does, Kreps said.",
      "Plunkett, the Harvard Law faculty and author of \u201cSharenthood: Why We Should Think before We Talk about Our Kids Online,\u201d said if she were counseling TikTok, she would advise them to come up with a divesture plan that is compliant with the law and as favorable to them as possible.",
      "\u201cThere is too much uncertainty about what a Trump administration is likely to do,\u201d she said."

      "The draft bill, published Monday, proposes allowing terminally ill adults expected to have less than six months to live to ask for and be provided with help to end their own life, subject to safeguards and protections.",
      "Opponents have voiced concerns that the bill would mean people could become pressured to end their lives.",
      "But Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater, who proposed the bill, said the law has robust safeguards built into it and contains \u201cthree layers of scrutiny\" \u2014 two doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision.",
      "A debate and first vote on the bill is expected to take place on Nov. 29.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday he will study the details of the bill and \u201cwill not be putting pressure on any MP (Member of Parliament) to vote one way or the other.\u201d",
      "Here's a look at what's in the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill and the next steps:",
      "Under the draft legislation, only those over 18-years-old in England and Wales and who are expected to die within six months can request assisted dying.",
      "They must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and will be required to make two separate declarations about their wish to die. Two independent doctors have to be satisfied the person is eligible and a High Court judge will need to approve the decision.",
      "Anyone found guilty of pressuring, coercing or dishonestly getting someone to make a declaration that they wish to die will face up to 14 years in prison.",
      "Assisted suicide is currently banned in most parts of the U.K. It is not a specific criminal offense in Scotland, but assisting the death of someone can result in a criminal charge.",
      "The patient must self-administer the life-ending medication themselves. No doctor or anyone else can give the medication.",
      "No health professional is under any obligation to provide assistance to the patient.",
      "Doctors who do take part would have to be satisfied the person making their declaration to die has made it voluntarily. They also must ensure the person is making an informed choice.",
      "The bill will be debated in Parliament and lawmakers will be able to vote on it according to their conscience, rather than along party lines.",
      "Opinion among lawmakers appears to be divided, though some senior ministers including Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he intended to vote against the bill. Starmer has previously supported assisted dying, but the government says it will remain neutral on the issue.",
      "If the bill passes the first stage in the House of Commons, it will face further scrutiny and votes in both Houses of Parliament. Leadbeater suggested that any new law is unlikely to come into effect within the next two to three years.",
      "One argument supporting the bill is that wealthy individuals can travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to go there to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones to die.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different to euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves healthcare practitioners killing patients with a lethal injection at their request and in specific circumstances."

    "story": [
      "For the first time, a group of U.S. researchers has concluded that China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor to power future aircraft carriers",
      "BANGKOK -- China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing its first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press.",
      "China\u2019s navy is already the world\u2019s largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true \"blue-water\u201d force capable of operating in seas far from China in a growing global challenge to the United States.",
      "\u201cNuclear-powered carriers would place China in the exclusive ranks of first-class naval powers, a group currently limited to the United States and France,\u201d said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. \u201cFor China\u2019s leadership, such a development would symbolize national prestige, fueling domestic nationalism and elevating the country\u2019s global image as a leading power.\u201d",
      "Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California said they made the finding while investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan, where they suspected China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons.",
      "Instead they concluded that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship. The project at Leshan is dubbed the Longwei, or Dragon Might, Project and is also referred to as the Nuclear Power Development Project in documents.",
      "Neither China\u2019s Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "\u201cThe reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. \"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.\u201d",
      "Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies \u2014 and even a citizen\u2019s complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust \u2014 they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles (112 kilometers) southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu.",
      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \u201cintended for installation on a large surface warship\u201d under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project\u2019s \u201cnational defense designation\u201d helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \u201cnational defense-related construction project\u201d that is classified \u201csecret.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\u201d researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \u201cconvincing argument.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\u201d she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \u201ccarefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\u201d",
      "\u201cGiven the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\u201d said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury\u2019s research.",
      "China\u2019s first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \u201cski-jump\u201d type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \u201csoon be announced,\u201d but so far it has not been.",
      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once \u2014 one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 \u2014 something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \u201cincremental improvements.\u201d",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \u201chave taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\u201d",
      "Eventually, however, \u201clarger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\u201d Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\u201cAs well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\u201d Childs said.",
      "\u201cMuch will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China\u2019s carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy\u2019s carriers.\u201d",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \u201cwith greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\u201d said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\u201cThese carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military\u2019s ability to \u2018intervene\u2019 in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\u201d Zhao said.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \u201cfirst-class\u201d navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \u201cspeeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\u201d",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world\u2019s largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China\u2019s shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "That aligns with China's \u201cgrowing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\" for its navy \"to operate at greater distances from mainland China,\u201d the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military.",
      "And China's \u201cgrowing force of aircraft carriers extend air defense coverage of deployed task groups beyond the range of land-based defenses, enabling operations farther from China\u2019s shore,\u201d the report said.",

      "LONDON -- Facebook and Instagram users in Europe will get the option to see less personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription, social media company Meta said Tuesday, bowing to pressure from Brussels over privacy and digital competition concerns.",
      "Meta Platforms has been offering European Union an ad-free subscription option for about a year to comply with the continent's strict data privacy rules, but regulators had accused the company of giving people a false choice.",
      "The company said in a blog post that while people will still be able to choose between the subscription and existing free versions, it would also start giving free users an extra option over the coming weeks to see digital ads that are less personalized.",
      "This means ads will be targeted at users based only on what they see during their current session on Facebook or Instagram going back no more than two hours, plus minimal personal information such as age, location, gender as well as how they engage with ads.",
      "Data from all of a user's previous time spent on Facebook or Instagram, which is typically combined to precisely target an individual with tailored ads, won't be used.",
      "\u201cWhile this new choice is designed to give people an additional control over their data and ad experience, it may result in ads that are less relevant to a person\u2019s interests,\u201d Meta said in a blog post. \u201cThat means people will see ads that they don\u2019t find as interesting. This drop in relevance is inevitable given that drastically reduced data is being used to show these less personalized ads to people.\u201d",
      "People who choose the new option will see ad breaks that can't be skipped for a few seconds, Meta said.",
      "European Union regulators had accused Meta of breaching the 27-nation bloc's digital rules when it gave user the option to pay a monthly fee to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data.",
      "The U.S. tech giant had rolled out the option after the European Union\u2019s top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users\u2019 online interests and digital activity.",
      "The company also said Tuesday it's slashing monthly subscription prices for the ad-free option. Web users will pay 5.99 euros ($6.36), down from 9.99 euros previously, while iPhone and Android users will be charged 7.99 euros instead of 12.99 euros, which includes commissions charged by the Apple and Google mobile app stores.",
      "Meta's new subscription model could hit the company's lucrative digital ad business in one of its biggest markets. The company said it has already factored the new offering into its most recent business outlook and financial guidance.",
      "The options are available to users 18 and older in the EU\u2019s 27 member countries, plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein."

      "U.S. researchers have concluded that China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor to power future aircraft carriers",
      "BANGKOK -- China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing the country\u2019s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press.",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California is the first to confirm it is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "China\u2019s navy is already the world\u2019s largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true \u201cblue-water\u201d force capable of operating around the globe in a growing challenge to the United States.",
      "Nuclear carriers take longer to build than conventional carriers, but once in operation they are able to stay at sea for much longer because they do not need to refuel, and there is more room on board for fuel and weapons for aircraft, thus extending their capabilities. They are also able to produce more power to run advanced systems.",
      "Right now, only the United States and France have nuclear-powered carriers. The U.S. has 11 in total, which allows it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "China currently has three carriers, including the new Type 003 Fujian, which was the first both designed and built by China. It has said work is already underway on a fourth, but it has not announced whether that will be nuclear or conventionally powered.",
      "The modernization aligns with China\u2019s \u201cgrowing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\u201d for its navy \u201cto operate at greater distances from mainland China,\u201d the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China\u2019s military.",
      "Middlebury researchers were initially investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan over suspicions that China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons. Instead they said they determined that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship.",
      "The conclusion was based upon a wide variety of sources, including satellite images, project tenders, personnel files, and environmental impact studies.",
      "The reactor is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \u201cintended for installation on a large surface warship.\u201d as well as the project\u2019s \u201cnational defense designation\u201d helped lead to the conclusion the sizeable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \u201cfirst-class\u201d navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s great rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \u201cspeeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\u201d",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the new Fujian aircraft carrier in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \u201csoon be announced,\u201d but so far it has not been.",
      "Neither China's Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "Even if the carrier that has been started will likely be another conventionally-powered Type 003 ship, experts say Chinese shipyards have the capability to work on more than one carrier at a time, and that they could produce a new nuclear-powered vessel concurrently.",

      "Scientists can\u2019t know precisely when a volcano is about to erupt, but they can sometimes pick up telltale warning signs",
      "WASHINGTON -- Scientists can't know precisely when a volcano is about to erupt, but they can sometimes pick up telltale signs.",
      "That happened two years ago with the world's largest active volcano. About two months before Mauna Loa spewed rivers of glowing orange molten lava, geologists detected small earthquakes nearby and other signs, and they warned residents on Hawaii's Big Island.",
      "Now a study of the volcano's lava confirms their timeline for when the molten rock below was on the move.",
      "\u201cVolcanoes are tricky because we don\u2019t get to watch directly what\u2019s happening inside \u2013 we have to look for other signs,\" said Erik Klemetti Gonzalez, a volcano expert at Denison University, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Upswelling ground and increased earthquake activity near the volcano resulted from magma rising from lower levels of Earth\u2019s crust to fill chambers beneath the volcano, said Kendra Lynn, a research geologist at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory and co-author of a new study in Nature Communications.",
      "When pressure was high enough, the magma broke through brittle surface rock and became lava \u2013 and the eruption began in late November 2022. Later, researchers collected samples of volcanic rock for analysis.",
      "The chemical makeup of certain crystals within the lava indicated that around 70 days before the eruption, large quantities of molten rock had moved from around 1.9 miles (3 kilometers) to 3 miles (5 kilometers) under the summit to a mile (2 kilometers) or less beneath, the study found. This matched the timeline the geologists had observed with other signs.",
      "The last time Mauna Loa erupted was in 1984. Most of the U.S. volcanoes that scientists consider to be active are found in Hawaii, Alaska and the West Coast.",
      "Worldwide, around 585 volcanoes are considered active.",
      "Scientists can't predict eruptions, but they can make a \u201cforecast,\u201d said Ben Andrews, who heads the global volcano program at the Smithsonian Institution and who was not involved in the study.",
      "Andrews compared volcano forecasts to weather forecasts \u2013 informed \u201cprobabilities\u201d that an event will occur. And better data about the past behavior of specific volcanos can help researchers finetune forecasts of future activity, experts say.",
      "(asterisk)We can look for similar patterns in the future and expect that there\u2019s a higher probability of conditions for an eruption happening,\u201d said Klemetti Gonzalez.",

      "False posts circulating on social media claim that billionaire Elon Musk facilitated alleged election fraud through his internet service provider Starlink, manipulating the vote count, particularly in swing states, through election equipment such as ba...",
      "As President-elect Donald Trump begins filling key posts in his second administration, social media users are pushing false claims that the 2024 election was rigged in his favor.",
      "One such narrative claims that billionaire Elon Musk facilitated the alleged fraud with his internet service provider Starlink, manipulating the vote count through election equipment such as ballot tabulators. Starlink, a subsidiary of Musk's SpaceX company, uses satellites to offer high-speed internet, even in remote areas.",
      "Some rural counties used the technology during the 2024 race to access their electronic poll books.",
      "Here's a closer look at the facts.",
      "CLAIM: Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk used his internet provider Starlink to steal the 2024 election for President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "THE FACTS: These claims are unfounded. Election officials, including from multiple swing states, told The Associated Press that their voting equipment doesn\u2019t use Starlink and is not even connected to the internet. States have additional security measures to ensure that the count is accurate, according to experts. Election officials and security agencies have reported no significant issues with the 2024 race.",
      "\u201cIt is not possible that Starlink was used to hack or change the outcome of the US presidential election,\u201d David Becker, founder and executive director of The Center for Election Innovation and Research, wrote in an email. \u201cThis, quite simply, did not happen, and could not happen, thanks to the security measures we have in place, and these conspiracy theories echo other disinformation we\u2019ve heard over the past several years.\u201d",
      "Becker further explained that the country's nearly 10,000 election jurisdictions use a wide range of voting machines that are not connected to the internet while voting occurs and that nearly all votes are recorded on paper ballots, which are audited by hand to confirm the results of electronic tabulators.",
      "\u201cIf anyone tried to interfere with the machines to rig the election, it would be discovered through multiple means, including reconciling the registered voters who cast ballots with the number of votes, as well as the audits,\u201d he added.",
      "Certain jurisdictions in a few states allow for ballot scanners in polling locations to transmit unofficial results, using a mobile private network, after voting has ended on Election Day and the memory cards containing the vote tallies have been removed.",
      "Election officials who allow this say it provides for faster reporting of unofficial election results on election night. They say the paper records of the ballots cast are used to authenticate the results during postelection reviews, and that those records would be crucial to a recount if one was needed. Computer security experts have said this is an unnecessary risk and should be prohibited.",
      "Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly said in a statement on Nov. 6 that CISA has \u201cno evidence of any malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of our election infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Despite a lack of evidence, many on social media suggested that Starlink could indeed have been used to steal the election.",
      "\u201cIf Trump & Elon's \u2018little secret\u2019 was to use Starlink in swing states to tally the votes & rig the election \u2014 an investigation & hand recount is crucial. Now,\u201d reads one X post that had been liked and shared approximately 41,700 times as of Tuesday.",
      "Another widely shared X post states: \u201cElon Musk used Starlink to hack our elections so he can have nice things while inflicting pain on Americans. Are we really going to turn a blind eye to what happened and let the worst people among us run the country.\u201d",
      "Election officials in North Carolina, Georgia and Pennsylvania \u2014 three of the seven swing states Trump won \u2014 told the AP that their voting equipment is never connected to the internet. In some cases, this is mandated by state law.",
      "\u201cSatellite-based internet devices were not used to tabulate or upload vote counts in North Carolina,\u201d said Patrick Gannon, a spokesperson for the North Carolina State Board of Elections. \u201cIn addition, our tabulated results are encrypted from source to destination preventing results being modified in transit. And no, tabulators and ballot-marking devices are never connected to the internet in North Carolina.\"",
      "The Tar Heel State prohibits its voting systems from being \u201cconnected to a network\u201d and requires any feature that allows such a connection to be disabled. This includes the internet, as well as any other wired or wireless connections.",
      "Gannon added that North Carolina has \u201cno evidence of any alteration of votes by anyone\u201d and requested that people stop spreading misinformation about elections.",
      "Mike Hassinger, a spokesperson for the Georgia secretary of state's office, called the claims spreading online \u201cabsolutely conspiratorial nonsense.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don't use Starlink equipment for any part of our elections, and never have,\u201d he said. \u201cOur election equipment is 100% air-gapped and never connected to the internet.\u201d",
      "The term \u201cair-gapped\u201d refers to a security measure that isolates a secured computer network from those that are unsecured. This means it is impossible to use the internet to manipulate the software that tallies Georgia's votes or the memory cards on which they're recorded, according to Hassinger. He explained that memory cards are transported by hand in secure bags with tamper-evident ties to a central elections office where votes are tabulated. There is also a chain of custody protocol in place so that their movement is well documented.",
      "Matt Heckel, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of State, wrote in an email: \u201cCounties do not use Starlink to transmit unofficial or official election results. No voting system in Pennsylvania is ever connected to the internet.\u201d",
      "A pilot program in Arizona's Coconino, Apache and Navajo counties intended to \u201cenhance connectivity in underserved areas\" uses Starlink systems for electronic poll book synchronization, according to JP Martin, a spokesperson for the Arizona secretary of state's office. The state's election equipment is air-gapped, one of many security measures.",
      "Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin also employ stringent precautions to protect the integrity of their voting equipment.",
      "Some posts spreading online pointed to a local news segment in which the registrar of voters in Tulare County, California, noted that internet connectivity at the county's poll sites was improved this year thanks to Starlink. Stephanie Hill, a systems and procedures analyst for the agency, wrote in an email that \u201cthis connection is strictly for voter check-in purposes only and in no way a part of our voting system.\u201d California is among the states that prohibit their voting equipment from being connected to the internet.",
      "Trump is currently beating Vice President Kamala Harris in Tulare County with 60% of the vote.",
      "Pamela Smith, president and CEO of Verified Voting, agreed that the idea that Starlink was used to rig the election is absurd.",
      "\u201cWhile Starlink provided connectivity in a number of jurisdictions for electronic poll books (EPBs) in this election, neither Starlink nor other types of communication networks play any role in counting votes,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cOur elections produce huge quantities of physical evidence. A satellite system like Starlink cannot steal that.\u201d",

      "As money continues to pour into crypto following Donald Trump\u2019s reelection, bitcoin has climbed to yet another record high",
      "NEW YORK -- As money continues to pour into crypto following Donald Trump's reelection last week, bitcoin has climbed to yet another record high.",
      "The world's largest cryptocurrency topped $89,000 for the first time, briefly peaking at $89,995 early Tuesday, according to CoinDesk. Bitcoin's price oscillated throughout the day, but is still up more than 27% over the last week \u2014 standing at about $88,288 as of 5 p.m. ET.",
      "That's part of a rally across cryptocurrencies and crypto-related investments since Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Analysts credit much of the recent gains to an anticipated \u201ccrypto-friendly\u201d nature of the incoming administration, which could translate into more regulatory clarity but also leeway.",
      "Still, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is hard to predict. And while some are bullish, others continue to warn of investment risks.",
      "Here's what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now, but has come under the spotlight in recent years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \u201cdigital alternative\u201d to traditional money \u2014 but it can be very volatile, and reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of last week's election.",
      "Trump was previously a crypto skeptic, but changed his mind and embraced cryptocurrencies during this year's presidential race. He has pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump\u2019s victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for. And Trump had previously promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government\u2019s crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",
      "\u201cCrypto rallied as Election Day progressed into the night and as it became increasingly clear that Trump would emerge victorious,\u201d Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a Friday research note, pointing to larger industry sentiment around Trump being \u201ccrypto-friendly\" and a potential shift in regulatory backing.",
      "But even before the post-election rally, assets like bitcoin posted notable gains over the past year or so. Much of the credit goes to early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.",
      "Inflows into spot ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, \"have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,\u201d Glass and Saunders noted. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.",
      "In April, bitcoin also saw its fourth \u201chalving\u201d \u2014 a preprogrammed event that impacts production by cutting the reward for mining, or the creation of new bitcoin, in half. When that reward falls, so does the number of new bitcoins entering the market. And, if demand remains strong, some analysts say this \u201csupply shock\u201d can also help propel the price long term.",
      "Crypto assets like bitcoin have a history of drastic swings in value \u2014 which can come suddenly and happen over the weekend or overnight in trading that continues at all hours, every day.",
      "In short, history shows you can lose money as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. Then came the 2022 collapse of FTX, which significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall.",
      "At the start of last year, a single bitcoin could be had for less than $17,000. Investors, however, began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. While some crypto supporters see the potential for more record-breaking days, experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.",
      "\u201cInvestors should only dabble in crypto with money that they can be prepared to lose,\u201d Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said last week. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve seen these wild swings in the past.\u201d",
      "Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called \u201cmining,\" which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.",
      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth\u2019s Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin\u2019s electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",
      "In the U.S., the Energy Information Administration notes that crypto mining across the country has \u201cgrown very rapidly over the last several years,\" adding that grid planners have begun to express concern over increases in related electricity demand. Preliminary estimates released by the EIA in February suggest that annual electricity use from crypto mining probably represents between 0.6% to 2.3% of U.S. electricity consumption.",
      "Environmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that clean energy has increased in use in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections from regulators around the world.",

      "The Florida congressman has resigned from the House effective immediately.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he has chosen Rep. Matt Gaetz as his pick for attorney general, a move that, if he's confirmed by the Senate, would place a firebrand and one of Trump's most loyal allies at the head of the Justice Department.",
      "\"Matt is a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney, trained at the William & Mary College of Law, who has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice,\" Trump said in his social media post.",
      "Gaetz is an explosive selection by Trump to be the chief law enforcement officer of the federal government, leading the very same executive branch of government that spent years investigating allegations regarding the Florida congressman. Gaetz was informed that the Justice Department would not seek changes just last year. He has long denied any wrongdoing.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson announced later Wednesday that Gaetz offered his resignation from Congress effective immediately.",
      "Johnson said the resignation took him by \u201csurprise\u201d but that the Florida congressman did so to \u201cstart the clock\u201d on the process for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to call a special election to fill the vacancy.",
      "\u201cSo Matt would have done us a great service by making that decision, as he did, on a fly. And so we're grateful for that so we move forward,\u201d Johnson added.",
      "Gaetz's resignation will narrow the slim majority that Republicans will have in the new Congress in January, but he represents a reliably Republican district in the Florida Panhandle.",
      "Gaetz has been a member of Congress since winning in 2017, riding the MAGA wave that brought Trump to Washington eight years ago. Over the years, Gaetz has become one of Trump's most ardent, and according to some allies, effective, defenders in Washington while also growing close to Trump.",
      "Gaetz has been down at Trump's residence in Mar-a-Lago almost every day since Election Day, helping make suggestions and input on other administration selections, sources tell ABC News. Gaetz was also seen traveling with Trump in his motorcade during his visit to Washington on Wednesday.",
      "Notably, Gaetz is very close with Trump's newly selected chief of staff, Susie Wiles, who also has deep and storied roots in Florida politics.",
      "Beginning in 2019, Gaetz faced a yearslong Justice Department investigation into allegations related to sex trafficking and obstruction of justice. Gaetz has long denied any wrongdoing, and the Justice Department informed Gaetz in 2023 that it was declining to bring charges against him after its investigation.",
      "The investigation into Gaetz stemmed from a probe into the Florida congressman's one-time friend, former Seminole County Tax Collector Joel Greenberg, who was sentenced in 2022 to 11 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to multiple charges, including sex trafficking a minor and introducing the minor to other \"adult men.\"",
      "Since the Justice Department declined to charge Gaetz following its investigation, the Florida congressman has faced an ongoing probe by the House Ethics Committee regarding the same allegations.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump was elected with a mandate last week. He's now using it to challenge Republican senators to confirm his Cabinet picks.",
    "story": [
      "Rep. Matt Gaetz's pick as attorney general raised major concerns in Congress.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump was elected with a mandate last week. He's now using it to challenge Republican senators to confirm his Cabinet picks, who range from the predictable to outright unconventional.",
      "Trump started off by fleshing out his incoming administration with conventional figures. Susie Wiles, a respected GOP strategist who helmed his successful campaign, would make sure the rains run on time as his chief of staff. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, an institutionalist who has hewed to Trump's \"America First\" agenda, would handle diplomacy as secretary of state. Former Immigration and Custom Enforcement head Tim Homan would return to a border enforcement role.",
      "Then, he announced nominees who caught lawmakers off guard. Fox News host and U.S. Army veteran Pete Hegseth was tapped to lead the Pentagon. Former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat-turned-Trump ally who previously met with Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad, would be the director of national intelligence.",
      "And to top it off, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz would lead the Justice Department despite a House Ethics Committee investigation into allegations of sex trafficking a 17-year-old girl. He's denied the claims, and the Justice Department -- the agency he'd run if confirmed -- declined to bring charges after a similar inquiry.",
      "Now, as a new Senate majority prepares to take control in January and work with the president-elect, Trump is flexing, betting that Republicans on Capitol Hill will go along after touting the need for unity.",
      "\"He's appointing the exact people he wants, knowing that he can get him confirmed if he has enough Republicans,\" said former Senate GOP aide Brian Darling. \"And I have a feeling that they'll get confirmed by virtue of the fact that Trump's threats to primary Republicans in the past have really scared a lot of never Trump Republicans into retirement and led to a lot of them losing primaries.\"",
      "\"He's challenging them,\" Darling said. \"I think they all get confirmed. Not without controversy, but I think they get confirmed.\"",
      "The recent nominations of Hegseth, Gabbard and Gaetz were not on Washington's radar prior to their announcements, with Gaetz in particular raising eyebrows shortly after Trump rolled that pick out.",
      "Hegseth and Gabbard \"probably\" get confirmed, one current Republican Senate aide predicted, while Gaetz is \"on the bubble.\"",
      "\"I don't think it's a serious nomination for the attorney general. We need to have a serious attorney general and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to consider somebody that is serious. This one was not on my bingo card,\" Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a key GOP Swing vote, told reporters after Gaetz's nomination was announced.",
      "\"This is why the Senate's advise and consent process is so important. I'm sure that there will be many, many questions raised at Mr. Gaetz's hearing,\" added Maine Sen. Susan Collins, another moderate Republican.",
      "The reality of the upcoming confirmation battles is hitting Republicans who just wrapped up the contentious and high-profile process of minting a new Senate leadership team.",
      "\"Ninety-nine percent of the discussion has been, who's going to be the new leader, what are the rules going to be, how do we work with the transition team. Getting down into the weeds on specific nominees, I've heard no talk about that,\" the current Republican Senate aide said.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, the new Senate GOP heads were projecting the need for unity and cooperation with Trump.",
      "\"What we are going to do is make sure that we are processing his nominees in a way that gets him [Trump] into a position so he can implement his agenda,\" South Dakota Sen. John Thune, Senate Republicans' leader starting next year, said Wednesday before Gaetz's nomination was announced. \"Obviously we are going to look at, explore all options to make sure that they get moved and that they get moved quickly.\"",
      "Nevertheless, the more controversial picks stand out from some of the more conventional Cabinet options like Rubio and could spark some friction between at least some Republican senators and a president-elect who is undoubtedly his party's leader.",
      "\"When you've got nominees like Marco Rubio who's gonna fly through the Senate with more than 90 votes, and then you get some of these other folks who are likely staring down party-line votes, it's hard to say,\" one outside adviser to a member of the new Senate leadership team said when asked if some of the more controversial picks could get confirmed. \"Some of these nominees definitely have more work cut out for them than others.\"",
      "\"I think [Trump] feels empowered, for sure, to seek out and govern the way he ran, and in many ways, like these picks reflect that,\" the person added. \"As a body, I believe they will be working closely together. They got a lot they gotta get done in the next two years, hopefully four years.\"",
      "Some operatives downplayed the idea that Trump was challenging Senate Republicans, arguing that Trump was merely pushing for his administration to be staffed after he was elected by voters hungry for change.",
      "\"He does not look at this like, 'I need to find common ground with these guys.' It's that 'these are my picks. This is how it works. I want my people.' It's not like he's daring them. It's not like he thinks, 'I'm going to push the envelope and tout somebody.' He's saying, 'these are who I want. The people told me to come in and make changes, and I'm going to do it,'\" said Sean Spicer, Trump's first White House press secretary.",
      "Trump could also go around the Senate -- before leadership elections were held, he insisted that Republicans should grant him the ability to make temporary appointments while Congress is out of session, a demand that most of the Senate GOP quickly got on board with.",
      "But should Trump submit his nominees through the typical confirmation process, he would be putting up his dominance within the Republican Party and desire overall for GOP unity against some lawmakers' consternation with some of his more contentious picks.",
      "\"He is certainly saying, 'I am in charge. I won the popular vote. I won the Electoral College, and we need to be united,'\" said Martha Zoller, a conservative radio host who was a Republican Senate aide during Trump's first term.",
      "Still, Zoller said, \"I think there will be more than one of these nominees that we might go to the No. 2 choice.\"",

      "The Fox News host criticized Trump before he was elected in 2016.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump this week tapped Pete Hegseth to be his secretary of defense -- despite the Fox News host having previously criticized Trump on his foreign policy and military stances before Trump was elected to his first term.",
      "During Trump's 2016 campaign, Hegseth, appearing on Fox News as a political commentator, slammed what he characterized as Trump's \"shallowness\" on foreign policy.",
      "\"As far as Donald Trump, he is just flat out changing his position, and I think, frankly, falling into the narrative of the left. And he's done this time and time again.\" Hegseth said. \"He's going back and forth. He's been good on a lot of domestic stuff. But internationally, I don't know where Donald Trump is.\"",
      "The comments came as Hegseth was pressed during an interview by then-Fox News host Megyn Kelly -- who would later, after leaving Fox News, endorse Trump's 2024 candidacy -- about Trump's \"obvious reversal\" of his position on the war in Afghanistan.",
      "\"It's unacceptable. It shows, I think, a shallowness in his understanding of that region,\" Hegseth said, pointing to Trump's comments that the U.S. could remain in the region endlessly. \"That's not clarity, that's not leadership -- that's waffling back and forth on really critical issues.\"",
      "A former Army major who served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and as a guard at Guantanamo Bay, Hegseth has since emerged as one of Trump's most vocal allies in cable news. He previously led two veterans' organizations before transitioning fulltime to his position at Fox News.",
      "After his initial criticism, Hegseth fell in line with Trump during the 2016 general election and has continued to be one of his most enthusiastic boosters on television.",
      "Trump and Hegseth have brokered a close relationship in recent years, with Hegseth interviewing Trump multiple times and reportedly engaging with Trump during commercial breaks on the program he anchors, Fox & Friends Weekends.",
      "In an ironic twist, Hegseth in 2015 criticized Trump for saying during an interview that he gets some of his military advice from watching television news.",
      "\"You wouldn't want a top-tier presidential candidate getting all their military advice from watching 'Meet the Press,'\" Hegseth said during a Fox News interview. \"There's a lot more nuance and there's a lot more detail ... at the end of the day, foreign policy and national security is not about TV shows. It's a complex web of relationships and I think [his campaign] is going to want him briefed on that kind of stuff.\"",
      "While appearing on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" in August 2015, Trump was asked by moderator Chuck Todd who he talks to for military advice.",
      "\"Well, I watch the shows. I mean, I really see a lot of great -- you know, when you watch your show and all of the other shows and you have the generals and ... you have certain people that you like,\" Trump responded, according to a transcript.",
      "Hegseth has since taken a sharp turn to become a fierce ally and defender of Trump.",
      "\"People outside these walls ... they don't understand the attachment that conservatives and freedom lovers have to Donald Trump,\" Hegseth said in a clip he posted of himself speaking in 2023 at the Conservative Political Action Conference.",
      "Previously, Hegseth had said he supported other candidates for president early on in the 2016 race.",
      "\"I had different candidates I believed in early on in the process, and was critical of the early things [Trump] had to say,\" Hegseth told a Jewish newspaper in 2016. \"I still don't like some of his rhetoric.\"",

      "In doing so, they decided against choosing Trump ally Sen. Rick. Scott.",
      "With McConnell announcing his intent to step aside earlier this year, Thune, the current Republican whip, was running against Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas senator and former Republican whip, and Scott, a Florida Republican who just won reelection to his second term.",
      "In a statement, Thune said he was \"extremely honored\" and that the \"Republican team was united behind President Trump's agenda.\"",
      "\"It's a new day in the United States Senate and it is a new day in America,\" Thune said at a press conference after the vote.",
      "Thune introduced the new Senate GOP leadership team: Sen. John Barrasso as the majority whip, the No. 2 spot in leadership; Sen. Tom Cotton as Republican conference chair; Sen. Shelley Moore Capito as Republican policy committee chair; Sen. James Lankford as the Republican conference vice chair; and Sen. Tim Scott as the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.",
      "ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott asked about whether he would move forward with Trump's demands for recess appointments for his Cabinet picks -- without Senate confirmation.",
      "\"Well, what we are going to do is make sure that we are processing his nominees in a way that gets them into those positions so they can implement his agenda. How that happens remains to be seen. Obviously, we want to make sure our committees have confirmation hearings like they typically do and these nominees reported out to the floor. But I've said this and I mean it, we expect a level of cooperation from the Democrat to work with us to get these folks installed.\"",
      "\"We're going to look at, explore all options to make sure that they get moved and they get moved quickly,\" Thune said.",
      "Asked if the legislative filibuster would remain unchanged during his tenure, Thune replied \"yes.\" The 60-vote threshold is a procedural rule requiring a supermajority to start or end debate on most legislation before a final vote.",
      "Sen. Scott was eliminated after the first round of voting by secret ballot before the final round to elect Thune by a 29-24 vote.",
      "Scott made appearances on cable news outlets in recent days and touted his endorsements from a number of Trump-aligned outside influencers, including Elon Musk and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He tried to position himself as the most Trump-aligned candidate.",
      "But Trump did not endorse Scott or any candidate in the leadership race, opting instead to insist that whoever was elected will support his use of recess appointments, which would allow him to temporarily fill federal vacancies without Senate approval.",
      "All three candidates signaled their willingness to use that strategy to quickly fill out Trump's Cabinet.",
      "ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl reported that sources said Trump did not endorse Scott because he didn't think he could win.",
      "Ahead of the vote, Republicans gathered behind closed doors for over two hours Tuesday evening to hear arguments from Thune, Cornyn and Scott, as well as other senators who are running for down-ballot leadership positions. Any other candidate who might wish to throw their name in the running for party leadership would have been permitted to do so during the meeting.",
      "It was described by senators in the room as \"energetic,\" but not a debate.",
      "When the meeting was over, Thune told reporters that Tuesday night was an opportunity for the conference to hear from the candidates.",
      "When asked specifically about the whip count, Thune remained vague.",
      "\"You never know until the voters vote,\" Thune said.",
      "Cornyn kept quiet leaving the room, \"I'll make my pitch to my colleagues, not to you.\"",
      "Even before the Tuesday meeting, the candidates were beginning to make their closing arguments and working to assert their loyalty to Trump, whose influence could certainly sway the outcome of the race.",
      "Cornyn wrote a letter to colleagues Tuesday, obtained by ABC News, in which he repeatedly touted his commitment to Trump's agenda and confirmation of his Cabinet selections.",
      "\"It's imperative that Republicans hit the ground running to implement President Donald Trump's agenda for the American people,\" Cornyn wrote in the letter, citing GOP success across the House, Senate, an White House.",
      "And Thune, who perhaps has had the iciest relationship with Trump among the contenders, also made clear he's been in regular contact with Trump's team, and he's made public statements supporting Trump proposals, including potential changes to Senate operating procedure."

    "summary": "President-elect Trump plans to nominate GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida for secretary of state, according to sources.",
    "story": [
      "The one-time Trump rival is positioned to become the top U.S. diplomat.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday officially shared his intention to nominate Republican Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state.",
      "Rubio, 53, has served in the Senate since 2011. The Florida Senator is currently the vice-chair of the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Intelligence and also sits on the chamber's Committee on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"Marco is a Highly Respected Leader, and a very powerful Voice for Freedom. He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries,\" Trump said in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "Several long-serving State Department officials told ABC News they respect Rubio's extensive foreign policy experience and view him as unlikely to overly politicize the secretary of state role.",
      "Rubio was also said to be favored for the role by Trump's chief of staff and veteran Florida political operative Susie Wiles, potentially helping the lawmaker edge out loyalists from the first Trump administration like former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell and former National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien.",
      "In an interview following Trump's election victory, Rubio told CNN that the U.S. was entering \"an era of pragmatic foreign policy.\"",
      "\"The world is rapidly changing. You know, adversaries are uniting -- in North Korea, Iran, China, Russia -- increasing coordinating,\" Rubio said. \"It is going to require us to be very pragmatic and wise in how we invest overseas and what we do.\"",
      "Rubio has consistently held many hawkish and traditionally Republican positions on international concerns, including Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, but has bent to align with Trump\u2019s agenda -- including his skeptical view of sustained support for Kyiv\u2019s war effort.",
      "While Rubio was initially a leading advocate for Ukraine, he voted against a supplemental funding bill passed in April that allocated about $61 billion dollars for the country, explaining at the time that he rejected the legislation because he did not believe it adequately addressed immigration concerns.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not on Russia\u2019s side -- but unfortunately the reality of it is that the way the war in Ukraine is going to end is with a negotiated settlement,\u201d Rubio said during an interview in late September.",
      "\u201cAnd I want, and we want, and, I believe Donald Trump wants, for Ukraine to have more leverage in that negotiation,\u201d he added.",
      "Because of Rubio's stature in the Senate and long tenure in Washington, his Senate confirmation process is broadly expected to run smoothly.",
      "Rubio's appointment is not anticipated to create problems for Republicans in the Senate. Florida law authorizes the state's governor, Republican Ron DeSantis, to fill the empty seat by appointment until the next scheduled general election, when Floridians would vote for candidates to serve out the remainder of Rubio's term.",
      "Republicans see Trump's double-digit win over Vice President Kamala Harris in Florida, the highest margin of victory for a presidential candidate in the state for 36 years, as a sign that the former battleground is now a firmly cemented as a GOP stronghold.",
      "Rubio has also dramatically shifted toward the president-elect in recent years, transforming from a rival Trump once dubbed \"Lil Marco\" to a contender for a top Cabinet post in his second administration",
      "During the 2016 presidential election, Rubio ran against Trump for the Republican nomination -- slamming him as a \"con artist\" on the campaign trail before dropping out after losing to Trump in the Florida primary.",
      "Rubio eventually endorsed Trump's bid for the White House and was widely supportive of his policies during his first term, during which Rubio served as an unofficial adviser on strategy for Latin America and was described by the New York Times as a \"virtual secretary of state\" for the administration.",
      "In 2024, Rubio again endorsed Trump for president and was on the shortlist of potential running mates before Trump ultimately selected Ohio Senator JD Vance.",

      "As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to move back into the White House, gun violence prevention advocates are bracing for him to keep his campaign promise to sign a nationwide \"concealed carry reciprocity\" law.",
      "The move would allow gun owners with concealed carry permits to travel with their weapons to all 50 states, even those that do not honor out-of-state permit holders from doing so.",
      "Twenty-nine states already allow some form of concealed carry reciprocity, including some that only honor concealed carry permits from out-of-state gun owners if their state reciprocates. Nine states -- including California, Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey and New York -- and Washington D.C. do not honor concealed carry permits from other states.",
      "Trump's promise of nationwide reciprocity",
      "The issue resurfaced over the weekend, when Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., posted a 2023 video on Instagram of his father vowing to sign legislation allowing concealed carry permit reciprocity nationwide.",
      "\"BOOM! My father just announced full concealed carry reciprocity! The 2nd Amendment will stay and remain protected,\" Donald Trump Jr. wrote.",
      "In the February 2023 video, President-elect Trump outlined a seven-point plan to \"end crime and restore law and order,\" including enacting nationwide concealed carry reciprocity.",
      "\"I will protect the right of self-defense everywhere it is under siege,\" Trump said. \"And I will sign concealed carry reciprocity. Your Second Amendment does not end at the state line.\"",
      "'Law enforcement won't know who has firearms'",
      "Gun violence prevention groups are already gearing up for a new reciprocity battle.",
      "\"The biggest threat here is carrying a firearm across state lines without a permit. A piece that I really want to underscore is that law enforcement won't know who has firearms,\" Monisha Henley, senior vice president of government affairs for Everytown for Gun Safety, told ABC News.",
      "At least 26 states, including Florida, Alabama, Kentucky, Louisiana and Georgia, have adopted permitless carry rules, meaning no gun permits are necessary to carry concealed weapons if the gun owner meets age requirements and is not prohibited from possessing firearms.",
      "\"Gutting state gun laws just makes it easier for dangerous people to carry a hidden weapon with no training, with no questions asked,\" Henley said.",
      "Henley noted that gun violence prevention groups successfully fought Trump's efforts to loosen gun control laws during his first term in office.",
      "Some gun violence prevention groups said they fear the potential passage of nationwide concealed carry reciprocity is just the first step the incoming Trump administration will take to roll back policies established by President Joe Biden to curb the national plague of gun violence.",
      "During his victorious campaign, Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, voiced opposition to most of Biden's executive orders to combat the scourge that the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions found to be the leading cause of death in the United States for adolescents under the age of 19 for three straight years.",
      "In May, Trump spoke at the NRA convention in Dallas and outlined some of the actions he intends to take in his second term.",
      "\"In my second term, we will roll back every Biden attack on the Second Amendment -- the attacks are fast and furious -- starting the minute that Crooked Joe shuffles his way out of the White House,\u201d Trump said in the speech.",
      "A day after the election, Kris Brown, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said her group planning on \"doubling down\" in the fight to strengthen gun control laws.",
      "\"The movement to prevent gun violence has always been larger than one office, and we'll continue to work with activists, survivors, community leaders and elected officials in states across the country to fight for progress that makes the whole country safer from gun violence,\" Brown said in a statement.",
      "During Trump's first term in the Oval Office, the Republican-controlled House passed the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act with a vote of 231 to 198. However, the Democrat-controlled Senate killed the legislation.",
      "In his second term, Trump will have a Republican-controlled Senate. ABC News reported Wednesday that Republicans are projected to also retain control of the U.S. House of Representatives.",
      "In January 2023, Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., reintroduced concealed carry reciprocity legislation, saying, \"The Second Amendment does not disappear when crossing an invisible state line.\" The bill remains stalled in the House Committee on the Judiciary.",
      "\"The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act protects law-abiding citizens' right to conceal carry and travel freely between states without worrying about conflicting state codes or onerous civil suits,\" Hudson said at the time he introduced the legislation. \"I am especially proud to have such widespread and bipartisan support for this measure as I continue working to get this legislation over the finish line.\"",
      "Pat Harrigan, an Army veteran and Republican who won election last week to represent North Carolina's 10th Congressional District, took to Instagram on Monday to voice support for nationwide reciprocity.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is right: Just because we cross state lines does not mean that we should lose our Second Amendment rights,\" Harrigan said in a video statement on Instagram. \"If we want safer communities, we should pass national, 50-state concealed carry reciprocity and I\u2019ll be right there next to President Trump.\""

    "story": [
      "One Texas county, 98% Hispanic, flipped red for the first time since 1892.",
      "Republican Rep. Monica De La Cruz from Texas said in an interview with ABC News Tuesday that she believes Donald Trump\u2019s border policies influenced voters in the 2024 election, and that securing the U.S. border must be a priority.",
      "De La Cruz has won a second term in the historically blue Rio Grande Valley and, similar to President-elect Donald Trump, she campaigned on a platform focused on securing the border.",
      "She says the current policy from the Biden-Harris administration is ineffective, leading to chaos at the borders and increased insecurity in U.S. neighborhoods.",
      "ABC News spoke with De La Cruz about protecting the border for the next four years.",
      "ABC NEWS: Want to get insight from a lawmaker who knows the issues along the border very well. Representative Monica De La Cruz represents a South Texas district along the U.S.-Mexico border. She's a Republican and just secured a second term in the historically blue Rio Grande Valley. Congresswoman, thank you so much for talking with us. What's your reaction to the appointments that we've learned about so far?",
      "MONICA DE LA CRUZ: Well, the appointments are exciting and Trump is hitting the ground running, wasting no more time. The first 100 days in Congress and in his presidency, he expects us to get to work and so do the American people. And that is why we were planning so quickly right now so that we have a quick, fast 100 days where the American people see results from their votes.",
      "ABC NEWS: And you campaigned on a platform focused on securing the border. What would you like to see specifically from a Trump administration?",
      "DE LA CRUZ: Well, earlier this year, we passed HR2, the Secure the Border Act, the most comprehensive and conservative legislation ever passed by the House of Representatives. We want to see that come into law.",
      "Coming in the 119th Congress, we're going to have the Senate, the White House and the House. Thus, I believe that we will finally be able to do what the American people want us to do, which is to secure the border and to reform legal immigration.",
      "ABC NEWS: Is there anything in the current border policy that you think is working that you might want to see continue?",
      "DE LA CRUZ: The current policy from the Biden-Harris administration is a joke. It is reckless. It is open borders. It has caused chaos at the borders and made our neighborhoods unsafe. This is why Hispanics made a loud message last week. They said, not in my name. No more open policies, no more reckless, open border policies by the Biden administration.",
      "It's time that these D.C. elites stop that reckless, open border policy just to make themselves feel good at the D.C. cocktail parties. Hispanics don't want it. They want a secure border. They want safe neighborhoods and a safe nation.",
      "That's why they overwhelmingly chose President Trump as their 47th president.",
      "ABC NEWS: And so you don't think that the Biden administration has done anything that should be continued at the border?",
      "DE LA CRUZ: What the Biden administration has done is they've led criminals through our border. We have seen women raped. We have seen children like Jocelyn [Nungaray], like Laken Riley, who were murdered by illegal immigrants.",
      "So what we need is a safe and secure border. That's what Americans want. They want national security. That's why they overwhelmingly chose President Trump.",
      "But in my part of the district, which is Deep South Texas, the Rio Grande Valley, we had every single county turn from blue to red, overwhelmingly choosing President Trump, choosing myself.",
      "In fact, in Stark County, where it is 98% Hispanic, they flipped red for the first time since 1892. That's telling you that Biden and Harris did not secure a border. They did not like the chaos under their failed leadership. And that's why they flipped red for the first time in over 100 years.",
      "ABC NEWS: Really, you would attribute that to that shift? And it was a major shift in particular among Latino voters. You think that's entirely because of the border?",
      "DE LA CRUZ: I think there were three issues. It was the border, first and foremost, which we talked about. It was the economy. Hispanics tend to have larger families. That means more mouths to feed.",
      "Under the Biden-Harris administration, we've seen the cost of living increase exponentially. And what that means is they struggle to live from paycheck to paycheck and put the basics of eggs and milk on the table.",
      "The third thing is culturally.Culturally, Republicans were talking about prosperity. They were talking about hope for the future, prosperity. Meanwhile, the Democrats were talking about pronouns. They were completely disconnected from the Hispanic population and, quite frankly, from the American people.",

      "For the first time in four years, Democrats are leaderless. But chaos is a ladder, as the saying goes, and the party is packed with climbers.",
      "Democrats are still sifting through the rubble of last week's election results, and many said that a period of grieving and soul-searching is due after Vice President Kamala Harris' loss. But over a dozen operatives said that the leadership vacuum fueled by her defeat will attract members of the party's deep bench who likely won't wait long to cast themselves as the messenger Democrats need to bounce back ahead of the 2028 election.",
      "\"I have not seen any outreach from the national party to folks for 2028. I think they're too busy playing the blame game, they're too busy knifing each other,\" said one person who has spoken to multiple potential 2028 candidates. \"In terms of donors reaching out to their candidate of choice, that has been never ending over the course of the last four or five days. And then there's a lot of local outreach to people.\"",
      "Democrats boast several governors, senators, House members and more rumored to have national ambitions.",
      "Among them are California Gov. Gavin Newsom; Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker; Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear; Maryland Gov. Wes Moore; Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper; Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro; Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock; New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker; Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman; California Rep. Ro Khanna; and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.",
      "Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, her running mate, could also play some role in guiding the party, though it's unclear how much of an appetite there is in the party to allow the bench to take on a supporting role to members of the losing ticket.",
      "Already, the jockeying is underway, albeit not yet in full force.",
      "Shapiro has received calls from Democrats in his state, a source familiar with the matter confirmed, as has Beshear, who also wrote a New York Times op-ed examining his party's woes. Newsom held a call with his grassroots donor network and is set to be a top Trump antagonist, and Khanna is mulling a media blitz and listening tour to areas that have borne the brunt of deindustrialization, sources familiar with their thinking said.",
      "Buttigieg has traversed the country touting the administration's infrastructure achievements, often goes behind enemy lines to appear on Fox News and moved his residency to Michigan, which has an open gubernatorial race in two years. Fetterman has been vocal about what he calls his party's disconnect from working-class voters.",
      "All have some kind of argument, whether it's a blue-collar appeal the party has been missing, proven electoral experience in red or purple areas, or something else, and most hit the campaign trail for Harris this year. More maneuvering is expected to come, especially once Trump takes office and his policies go into effect, likely galvanizing Democrats' base.",
      "\"I think that what you'll probably see beginning in January, is people who are at least considering being candidates come out with really detailed, expansive programs. Some may be about jobs, some may be about education, some may be about who knows what else. But it will probably be policy-based,\" said Dan Fee, a Democratic strategist and donor adviser based in Pennsylvania.",
      "\"I think you're going to see a lot of a lot of governors and a lot of other folks do the speaking circuit thing, be going to events, certainly heading into '26, you're going to see a lot of people endorsing folks,\" added one senior Democratic strategist, referencing the 2026 midterms.",
      "There is no clear frontrunner in the beefy field, but some did see their personal stock rise during the Biden administration or as the result of the election.",
      "Newsom, in particular, could benefit, given that his California roots and political base overlapped significantly with Harris'. But Buttigieg also boasts a beefier resume after four years in President Joe Biden's Cabinet, Shapiro and Beshear were vetted as part of Harris' veepstakes, and many hit the trail -- especially to the early primary state of New Hampshire -- throughout the year, helping them building relationships with local groups and voters.",
      "Still, anything can happen in four years.",
      "Republicans, not too long ago, were walking in the political wilderness themselves after President Barack Obama won reelection in 2012, sparking a famed autopsy. Four years later, now-President-elect Donald Trump won his first term, ushering in two years of unified Republican control but a series of fits ever since over the identity of the party and how much it should hew to his brand.",
      "Democrats too were on a high after Biden's win in 2020, a euphoria reinforced after the party defied the odds in the 2022 midterms to expand its Senate majority and limit its House losses. Now, they're conducting a postmortem of their own.",
      "What's more, positioning oneself for higher office is more art than science. Appearing too eager risks turning off voters, while not stepping on the gas hard enough risks ceding ground to other aspirants.",
      "But promoting oneself isn't the only way to improve one's standing amid the jockeying, and operatives predicted that the knives will be out.",
      "\"I think the [opposition research] books are probably already being built,\" said the operative who has spoken to multiple potential 2028 candidates.",
      "For all the preparation, though, would-be party leaders can't make themselves so just by themselves. And party donors may not quite be ready to indulge a 2028 free-for-all as it analyzes its 2024 loss, especially after Harris' team boasted of smashing several fundraising records only to get swept in all seven swing states.",
      "\"People were being told this is a toss-up, and so, their biggest problem is going to be getting fundraising,\" said John Morgan, a prominent donor to Democratic candidates and causes. Donors \"do not trust people with the money. Nobody does.\"",

    "summary": "A Secret Service agent assigned to Barack Obama was breaching security while leading a double life, according to a memoir by the agent's former girlfriend.",
    "story": [
      "After a \"full investigation\" the agent was fired, a spokesperson said.",
      "A Secret Service agent tasked with protecting former President Barack Obama knowingly and repeatedly breached his duties while trying to woo a love interest \u2014 and living a double life, according to a new memoir by the agent\u2019s former girlfriend.",
      "In \u201cUndercover Heartbreak: a Memoir of Trust and Trauma,\u201d Koryeah Dwanyen describes a series of potential security lapses, including a time when she said she was invited to join the senior agent at the Obamas\u2019 beachfront property in Hawaii in 2022 while they were away.",
      "He had already sent her \"several photos\" of the house a week earlier, and suggested a tour, according to the book.",
      "\u201cNo one will know. If anything, I\u2019m the one who could get in trouble,\u201d says the agent in the memoir, where he is given the pseudonym \u201cDale.\u201d",
      "He then tried to get her to fool around in the first lady\u2019s bathroom, according to Dwanyen.",
      "\u201cWe should have sex in Michelle [Obama]\u2019s bathroom, like a mile-high club,\u201d Dwanyen claims he said.",
      "The senior agent's alleged violations of fundamental regulations prompted an internal investigation by the Secret Service.",
      "The self-published memoir was released on Oct. 28, adding another reputational shiner to the agency after a major security lapse in the summer led to calls for operational reform.",
      "The Secret Service had faced intense scrutiny since a gunman attempted to assassinate Donald Trump, the former president who has since been reelected, while he campaigned at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. That incident, which prompted the ouster of the agency\u2019s director, was called a \u201chistoric security failure by the Secret Service\" in an independent review by the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. Secret Service\u2019s top priority is ensuring the safety and security of our protectees, and any actions that compromise this commitment are addressed with the utmost seriousness,\u201d Anthony Guglielmi, the agency's chief of communications, told ABC News.",
      "Guglielmi confirmed that an incident matching the book's Hawaii anecdote had occurred \u2013 and that upon finding out, a probe was launched and the agent involved was ultimately fired.",
      "\u201cOn Nov. 6, 2022, a Secret Service agent involved in protective functions brought an individual who did not have authorized access into a protectee\u2019s residence without permission,\" Guglielmi said. \"As soon as the Secret Service became aware of the incident, the agent involved was immediately suspended and after a full investigation, terminated.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlthough the protectees were not present at the time of the incident, these actions were an unacceptable violation of our protocols, our protectees\u2019 trust and everything we stand for,\u201d he continued.",
      "The former agent and prominent character in the book did not respond to requests for comment from ABC News.",
      "According to her memoir, Dwanyen first met the Secret Service agent while he was assigned to the security detail of the Obama family and while she was vacationing in Martha\u2019s Vineyard in 2022.",
      "He said that he was divorced and had been for nearly a decade, Dwanyen said.",
      "As their relationship developed, the author said, so did her concerns about the man that she had fallen for. She would later come to find out that the agent was still married, according to the book.",
      "\u201cThere were major red flags -- breaches of trust and of his job,\u201d the author said in a phone interview with ABC News. \u201cOne of my friends has joked, \u2018You were a walking national security risk.\u2019\u201d",
      "Finally, Dwanyen said, she sent an email to his boss outlining her fears related to the agent's safety -- as well as his family\u2019s and her own.",
      "She wrote that, by then, she had met the agent's boss \"several times\" in Hawaii, and she explained that she had his \"direct contact information\" from emails that the agent had shared with her.",
      "The agent\u2019s boss immediately set up an exhaustive interview with agents in the Inspection Division of the Secret Service\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility, Dwanyen told ABC. The meeting would last \u201cnearly four hours,\u201d she wrote in her book.",
      "\u201cThey realized that not only had \u2018Dale\u2019 shared photos of the Obamas\u2019 house, but he had also brought me there,\u201d Dwanyen wrote. She \u201cshowed them photos on my phone to corroborate what I was saying,\u201d scrolling through \u201cpictures of Alicia Keys\u2019 house, Steven Spielberg\u2019s boats, Melinda Gates, Tyler Perry and Amal Clooney.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was really oversharing,\u201d Dwanyen recalled one of the agents saying.",
      "The agent told her \u201cpersonal tidbits he should not have,\u201d Dwanyen said on the phone with ABC News. Those \"tidbits\" he shared spanned across protectees, she said: ranging from information about background on Mike Pence \u2014 whom the agent had been assigned to during his vice presidency under Trump \u2014 to details about the Obamas.",
      "\"I knew their code names. I knew what day Orange Theory was, what day [Michelle Obama] had private tennis lessons and when her personal trainer came,\" Dwanyen said. \"Things that I should not have been privy to as a civilian.\"",

      "The city of Florence is taking new measures to crack down on overtourism",
      "ROME -- The city of Florence took new measures Tuesday to crack down on overtourism, just as the Italian government hosts the Group of Seven tourism ministers in the Renaissance city and seeks to significantly boost the country\u2019s place as a top visitor destination.",
      "Mayor Sara Funaro\u2019s Cabinet approved a 10-point plan that, among other things, would ban key boxes on buildings in Florence\u2019s historic center as well as the use there of loudspeakers by tour guides, a statement from City Hall said.",
      "The keyboxes \u2014 small boxes with a digital pad that are used by owners of short-term rental apartments to easily leave keys for visitors \u2014 have become something of the symbol of local Florentine anger at tourists, whose numbers have rebounded after COVID-19.",
      "In a recent protest, Florentines taped red Xs over the keyboxes, outraged at the transformation of the city center and its magnificent palazzi and narrow streets into a collection of short-term vacation rentals that have displaced local residents and the long-standing businesses that served them.",
      "According to national statistics bureau ISTAT, 2023 saw the most visitors ever in Italy with 134 million arrivals and 451 million people staying in hotels or other registered lodgings. The number of visitors opting for non-hotel lodging grew nearly 17% compared to 2022, ISTAT said in a June report.",
      "Italy ranks fourth on the U.N. World Tourism Barometer of international tourist destinations, after France, Spain and the United States. The tourism industry contributed some 10.5% of Italy\u2019s gross domestic product in 2023, according to Statista research.",
      "Florence, long run by the center-left, last year announced a ban on new short-term private rentals in the center in hopes of stemming the exodus of locals. It has repeatedly pressed for a special regulation from the national government, currently headed by right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni, to cap the number of days a property can be rented out at 120.",
      "To date, only Venice has been permitted to limit short-term rentals. The lagoon city has been drowning under overtourism for years and this year began imposing a day-tripper tax to try to regulate tourist flows.",
      "The right-left political divide over Florence and its tourism woes could come to a head precisely as Italy hosts the G7 tourism ministers starting Wednesday in Florence.",
      "At a warm-up event this weekend, Tourism Minister Daniela Santanche acknowledged some art cities were suffering from too many visitors. But she said that overall Italy is hardly taking advantage of its tourism potential and needed 50 million visitors more a year.",
      "Lamenting Italy\u2019s fourth-place position on the list of the world's top destinations, she said Italy needed to sustainably grow its tourism potential with quality offerings.",
      "\u201cWe can grow much more, we can develop much more and the industry of tourism can truly become the leading industry of our nation,\u201d she said.",

      "ROME -- The Pompeii archaeological park plans to limit visitor numbers to 20,000 a day and introduce personalized tickets starting next week in a bid to cope with over-tourism and protect the world heritage site, officials said Friday.",
      "The move comes after what authorities called a record summer that saw over 4 million people visiting the world-famous remains of the ancient Roman city, buried under ash and rock following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D.",
      "The park's director Gabriel Zuchtriegel said visitors to the main archaeological site now exceed an average of 15,000 to 20,000 every day, and the new daily cap will prevent the numbers from surging further.",
      "\u201cWe are working on a series of projects to lift the human pressure on the site, which could pose risks both for visitors and the heritage (that is) so unique and fragile,\u201d Zuchtriegel said.",
      "Starting Nov. 15 tickets to access the park will be personalized to include the full names of visitors. A maximum of 20,000 tickets will be released each day, with different time slots during the peak summer season.",
      "The park\u2019s management is also trying to attract more tourists to visit other ancient sites connected to Pompeii by a free shuttle bus under the \u201cGreater Pompeii\u201d project, including Stabia, Torre Annunziata and Boscoreale sites.",
      "\u201cThe measures to manage flows and safety and the personalization of the visits are part of this strategy,\u201d Zuchtriegel said.",
      "\u201cWe are aiming for slow, sustainable, pleasant and non-mass tourism and above all widespread throughout the territory around the UNESCO site, which is full of cultural jewels to discover,\u201d he added."

      "Vice President Kamala Harris didn\u2019t just call special counsel Robert K. Hur\u2019s report \u201cgratuitous, inaccurate and inappropriate\u201d when it came out in February. She claimed he was \u201cclearly politically motivated\u201d and impugned his integrity. Mr. Hur, appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate President Joe Biden\u2019s mishandling of classified material, recommended that the 81-year-old not face charges, partly because a jury could reasonably conclude that he\u2019s \u201ca sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d That assessment was based on Mr. Biden\u2019s frequent forgetfulness and hazy answers during five hours of interviews with prosecutors. Speaking to reporters, Ms. Harris reacted furiously: \u201cThe way that the president\u2019s demeanor in that report was characterized could not be more wrong.\u201d",
      "Mr. Hur has been repeatedly vindicated during the intervening nine months. The interview transcripts, when they came out, bolstered his conclusions. If anything, the truth was worse than what Mr. Hur described.",
      "It\u2019s now acknowledged almost universally that Mr. Biden should not have sought a second term, but the Democratic establishment denied the obvious and propped him up politically, even as evidence of his decline mounted. Prominent Democratic politicians changed their tune only after a disastrous debate performance in June made it impossible to conceal Mr. Biden\u2019s frailty from the public any longer \u2014 and forced them to confront the possibility of electoral disaster in November.",
      "The credibility problems that Ms. Harris\u2019s repeated defense of Mr. Biden\u2019s sharpness illustrated were part of the reason Democrats met defeat.",
      "Make no mistake: As dissemblers go, President-elect Donald Trump has no equal, and his dishonesty is a continual disgrace. Even his strongest supporters acknowledge he exaggerates for effect and plays fast and loose with facts. But voters obviously see other qualities in him that offset his dishonesty, perhaps drawn from rosy recollections of living under the first Trump presidency.",
      "Democrats tried to make fidelity to science, facts and truth their distinguishing characteristic as a party. The White House\u2019s aggressive coverup of Mr. Biden\u2019s decline undermined that claim. Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minnesota) was the only lawmaker willing to challenge Mr. Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination. He was ostracized and lost his spot in House leadership. Mr. Biden\u2019s allies concocted terms such as \u201ccheap fakes\u201d to dismiss embarrassing video clips in which Mr. Biden appeared dazed, confused, tired and inaudible. Allies of the president frequently labeled content they didn\u2019t approve of as \u201c disinformation,\u201d cheapening the term. When a few journalists reported accurately on Mr. Biden\u2019s decline, the White House fed critical talking points about their stories to others in the media.",
      "The harder they spun, the less believable they became. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said days after the June 27 debate that Mr. Biden was \u201c as sharp as ever.\u201d Eventually, Mr. Biden bowed to reality and stepped aside. But Ms. Harris struggled whenever she was asked to explain her defenses of Mr. Biden. On Oct. 22, NBC\u2019s Hallie Jackson pressed Ms. Harris five times on this topic. The vice president dodged when asked whether she ever saw anything like what happened during the debate behind closed doors. \u201cIt\u2019s a judgment question, that\u2019s why I ask,\u201d Ms. Jackson responded. \u201cCan the American people trust you in these moments, even when it\u2019s maybe uncomfortable?\u201d Ms. Harris did not answer directly.",
      "To the bitter end, Mr. Biden\u2019s team has covered for him. In the last week of the campaign, White House press staff altered the official transcript of a public appearance in which Mr. Biden described Trump supporters as \u201cgarbage.\u201d The Associated Press reported that an apostrophe was added to the initial version prepared by the official White House stenographers so it would appear that he was referring only to a single supporter: the comedian who had joked that Puerto Rico is a \u201c floating island of garbage.\u201d",
      "All of this took a toll on believability. Polls showed more voters believed that Mr. Trump would actually implement his campaign promises than Ms. Harris would hers.",
      "This is not to say that Ms. Harris\u2019s defense of Mr. Biden, or its effect on her credibility, was the decisive factor in this week\u2019s election. Any accounting must include the fact that incumbent parties across the world are losing in a tough post-covid-19 political environment, along with the damage the Democratic Party\u2019s leftward lurch, led by Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), did to the Democratic label, particularly during the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries.",
      "But the record does highlight one of the things Democrats must do to resuscitate their brand: live up to their billing as truth-tellers.",

      "News of Donald Trump \u2019s victory sent the rial, Iran\u2019s currency, to an all-time low this week. The party may be over for the Iranian regime, which took in more than $40 billion in extra oil revenue during the Biden years owing to nonenforcement of U.S. sanctions. The rolling bribe bought America nothing and gave China cheap oil.",
      "Shock waves from the U.S. election are felt throughout the Mideast, which noticed Wednesday\u2019s CNN report that Brian Hook is expected to lead the State Department transition team. Mr. Hook led the first Trump Administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d sanctions campaign against Iran, and he has been living under Iranian threats on his life. His presence is a signal that America means business again.",
      "As Iran weighs striking Israel a third time, it must know that its defenses are down after Israel\u2019s recent retaliation\u2014and not only the Russian equipment. The Biden Administration can no longer protect the Iranian regime. President Biden\u2019s leverage over Israel has largely collapsed, thanks to U.S. voters.",
      "When Mr. Biden deemed Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities off-limits to Israeli retaliation, Mr. Trump disagreed. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing you want to hit, right?\u201d he said Oct. 4. \u201cThe answer should have been: Hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later.\u201d You can bet that one landed on Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei\u2019s desk.",
      "The election also sends a warning to the International Criminal Court, which is abusing its powers to bring up Israel\u2019s leaders on politicized charges. America is next on the ICC\u2019s target list. Tough U.S. sanctions against the ICC are all but guaranteed after Republicans take control of Congress.",
      "President Biden and Sen. Chuck Schumer could stop blocking bipartisan sanctions on the ICC right now. Freed from pandering to voters in Dearborn, Mich., they can head off those ICC arrest warrants, which may be issued shortly. If Democrats don\u2019t, and the court acts first, it will be too late to save the court from the consequences of its overreach.",
      "The Middle East awaited Nov. 5 to determine the conclusion of the war. The election of Mr. Trump\u2014who wants Israel to finish up and win, as opposed to handcuffing it and pressuring it to lose\u2014improves Israel\u2019s bargaining position with Hezbollah and Hamas.",
      "The pressure is on them to succumb to Israel\u2019s terms. In one of Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest applause lines at the Republican convention, he warned, \u201cWe want our hostages back, and they better be back before I assume office or you will be paying a very big price.\u201d That threat is now operative, and the clock is ticking.",

      "The Los Angeles Times on abortion rights on ballots across the country",
      "Ever since the Supreme Court took away the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, the people have been taking it back state by state.",
      "Before last week\u2019s election, voters in six states had either enshrined abortion rights in their state constitutions or defeated ballot measures that would have restricted them.",
      "On Tuesday, that number more than doubled. In seven of the 10 states where abortion rights measures were on the ballot, they prevailed. From the most liberal of those states (New York) to the most conservative (Missouri), and regardless of how they voted in the presidential race, voters asserted the right to control their own bodies. Even in Florida, where an abortion rights measure failed, it won a more decisive majority than Donald Trump. (More about that later.)",
      "Ballot measures in New York, Maryland, Colorado and Montana enshrined abortion rights (and, in New York, other equal rights protections) in the constitutions of states where they are already substantially protected by law. Abortion is legal to the point of fetal viability in Montana, for example, but lawmakers there have repeatedly tried to restrict it.",
      "These measures may be unnecessary in liberal states where abortion remains legal \u2014 and let\u2019s hope they are. But every state that codifies abortion rights in its constitution reinforces them against the whims of elected officials. California voters passed a constitutional amendment bolstering the state\u2019s already strong abortion protections in 2022.",
      "The most important victories Tuesday were for measures in Arizona, which outlawed abortion after 15 weeks, and Missouri, where abortion was illegal with no exceptions for incest or rape. Missouri legislators have hardly missed an opportunity to attack abortion rights: One legislator floated a measure to make it illegal to help someone leave the state for an abortion.",
      "Both of those states now have constitutionally guaranteed rights to abortion up to the point of viability. Although legal or legislative efforts will be necessary to lift their now unconstitutional bans, it\u2019s astonishing progress for those states and the people who live in them.",
      "These election results should send a powerful message to state and federal elected officials and the incoming Trump administration: Americans will not tolerate the trampling of their reproductive rights in blue, purple or red states. Federal officials should keep that in mind as conservative state attorneys general consider trying to block abortion medication from being provided by mail.",
      "Three abortion rights measures did fail last week, all of them in states that could have desperately used constitutional amendments to ensure abortion access.",
      "In Florida, which bans abortion beyond six weeks \u2014 a point when most women don\u2019t even know they\u2019re pregnant \u2014 Amendment 4 would have constitutionally guaranteed a right to an abortion up to the point of fetal viability, which is roughly 24 weeks. The initiative earned a healthy majority of 57.2% but fell 3 points short of the state\u2019s undemocratic 60% threshold for approval of constitutional amendments. Trump carried the state with a smaller majority, 56.1%.",
      "A failed measure in South Dakota, where abortion is banned, would have allowed the procedure up to 12 weeks, which is considered restrictive in other states. Major reproductive rights groups such as the regional Planned Parenthood organization did not believe the measure would adequately restore abortion rights and refused to support it.",
      "And in Nebraska, where abortion is banned after 12 weeks with some exceptions, the presence of two measures on the ballot made for some confusion. The one that failed, Initiative 439, would have guaranteed a right to abortion up to viability and was supported by advocates of abortion access. The one that passed, Initiative 434, bans most abortions after 12 weeks. Under this measure, abortion could remain legal up to 12 weeks, but the Legislature has leeway to further restrict abortion rights, up to a complete ban.",
      "Advocates have more work to do to convince voters in states with abortion bans and restrictions that there is an electoral path to restore reproductive rights. \u201cEvery state that has a citizens\u2019 initiative constitutional process and restrictions on abortion is a place where we will be looking,\u201d said Kelly Hall, the executive director of the Fairness Project, which worked on the ballot measures in Missouri and elsewhere this election season.",
      "In states that don\u2019t allow citizens\u2019 initiatives, progress will be more challenging. But people in all kinds of states, liberal and conservative, have shown that they want to protect their right to control their own bodies.",

      "The Boston Herald on the next step from Democrats and Republicans",
      "The voters have spoken. Former president Donald Trump has not only won a solid majority in the Electoral College, he seems destined to win the popular vote, and by a substantial margin \u2014 the first time he will have accomplished that feat in his three presidential campaigns. Bitterness among Democrats will now confront triumphalism among Republicans, as the country struggles to pick up the pieces after a campaign harshly colored by apocalyptic warnings on both sides.",
      "Once again Trump has proven his political resilience and defied predictions on the left that he could never win a majority of the American electorate. Pundits and historians will wrestle with the forces that led to his victory, but in the broadest of terms, it seems clearly rooted in a post-pandemic unease about the state of the world, the economy, and the nation\u2019s very character.",
      "Despite his strongman bluster and bullying nature, a stubborn majority of voters \u2014 fairly or not \u2014 associated Trump with economic prosperity and global stability. What Democrats viewed as a threat to the nation\u2019s democratic character, Republicans embraced as an unwavering leadership to guide the nation out of chaos and decline.",
      "It will be easy to criticize Vice President Kamala Harris for running a button-downed, cramped campaign that failed to answer voters\u2019 concerns about her abilities and policies. And indeed, perhaps she could have spoken more forcefully about stemming the migrant crisis, about resolving the Middle East war, about acknowledging the shortcomings of the Biden administration, and about the ways she might have done things differently. But it is impossible to know whether any of that would have made a difference.",
      "It seems equally fair to credit her with running a vigorous and mostly uplifting campaign amid the disinformation, bigotry, and character assassination she endured daily. She faced extraordinary headwinds that even the most flawless campaign would have struggled to overcome: a deeply unpopular and visibly frail President Biden who declined to get out of the race until too late, leaving Harris too little time to help Americans know her better; inflation driven mainly by pandemic shutdowns, supply chain bottlenecks, and the war in Ukraine; a broad loss of faith in the assumption that the United States was the dominant power in the world.",
      "For Republicans, this will inevitably be a time of feeling vindication and jubilation against a Democratic Party they have come to view as arrogant, entitled elitists. But they would do well to not overplay their hand. They, as much or more than Democrats, should also be prepared to insist loudly that the president-elect set aside the warlike rhetoric aimed at their fellow Americans, resist calls for political persecution of his enemies, and oppose his gleeful pledges to disregard the law. Whatever deportation policies Trump puts into place, his victory should not open the door to extramural intimidation or even violence against law-abiding immigrants, legal or not.",
      "Urging Republicans to oppose violence against their neighbors and support the Constitution does not seem an unreasonable ask. Neither does holding Trump to his late-campaign pledges to leave abortion to the states and to protect women. Meanwhile, the independent institutions of American democracy \u2014 Congress, the judiciary, the press \u2014 need to be ready to stand up for democratic norms if Trump attacks them, as seems likely.",
      "It would also not be unreasonable for Republicans to insist that Trump start rebuilding faith in the American electoral system that he did so much to undermine. The very same system that he claims was rigged against him when he lost in 2020 this time around elected him with a relative lack of disruption. He should begin telling his supporters that the system worked and resist his party\u2019s temptation to disenfranchise the urban and minority voters who opposed him.",
      "For their part, Democrats should think hard about the substantive reasons Trump prevailed. Filter out, if you can, the bluster and bigotry, and it is possible to discern Trumpian notes that clearly resonated with many voters. The decline in American manufacturing. The need to forcefully counter an assertive China. The frustration of communities struggling with the cost of uncontrolled migration. The futility of trying to exert American military power everywhere in the world. The dismay with a reflexive progressiveness so dominant in American universities and cultural institutions. The feeling that they have been left behind.",
      "This will not be easy to do after an election result that, for many Democrats, seemed a rejection of all that they hold dear about their country: its democratic institutions; its commitment to civil rights; its legacy as a haven for striving immigrants. Overcoming their bitterness in order to see the legitimate hopes, aspirations, and humanity of their Trumpian neighbors is going to be difficult. But they should also recognize that the surest way back to power will be to win over some of those neighbors, not to shun them.",
      "At some point, when both the grieving and elation die down, Americans on both sides will need to decide that they are ready to come together again as a single nation. They will need to relinquish the instinct to retreat into perpetually warring fiefdoms. The genius of the founders was that they created a system meant to accommodate conflicting factions and to bend in the winds of history without snapping. But nothing made by man is unbreakable. The time to prevent the breaking has arrived.",

      "The Guardian on Trump's tariff promises, global fair trade",
      "\u201cTo me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff,\u201d Donald Trump told business leaders in October. \u201cIt\u2019s my favourite word. It needs a public relations firm.\u201d Now, with his election victory, Mr Trump\u2019s words send a shiver through global capitals. Many fear he may pull a curtain across the US economy, locking them out of the world\u2019s largest market and cutting off access to US technology. These fears are amplified by last year\u2019s contraction in merchandise trade \u2013 which was the first such shrinkage at a time when the global economy was growing.",
      "However, it\u2019s wise to take Mr Trump seriously, not literally. During his last term, he imposed tariffs on more than $400bn in US-China trade and renegotiated the North American free trade agreement (Nafta) in a push to reshore blue-collar jobs. In many ways, Joe Biden continued \u2013 and even accelerated \u2013 these trends. Mr Trump averaged 144,000 reshored jobs a year; in 2022, Mr Biden reached 364,000.",
      "As a self-styled deal-maker, Mr Trump will probably push for better terms for the US economy. German carmakers are concerned; South Korea expects  its companies would need to boost US investments if Mr Trump raises tariffs. The EU, China and Japan watch warily. The difference this time is that Mr Trump\u2019s unpredictable approach seems more erratic and his rightwing rhetoric even more deranged. It could be a bumpy ride.",
      "Britain is in poor shape to deal with global trade wars. The UN points out that its export revenues were down by 4% year-on-year. This is in part due to subdued demand from key partners, such as China. But no one should underestimate the continuing fallout from a disastrous Brexit.",
      "Importantly, a protectionist stance from richer nations isn\u2019t new. In 2022, the EU became the first major economy to legislate a \u201cgreen tariff\u201d on imports. A year later, the UK announced plans to follow suit. By 2027, both will levy charges on goods based on the carbon emitted during production \u2013 a move aimed at preventing \u201cpollution havens\u201d, where emissions are simply offshored to regions with weaker regulations.",
      "This may sound like a positive move, but it disrupts \u201cfree trade\u201d enough that some developing nations have labelled it discriminatory and pledged retaliation. Studies indicate that Africa, home to 33 of the world\u2019s 46 least-developed countries, could lose $25bn annually, at 2021 prices, from green levies. This impact is partly due to the fact that key exports such as fertiliser, cement, iron and steel are more carbon-intensive to produce in Africa than elsewhere.",
      "Stifling the progress of developing nations seems not only unfair but also shortsighted. What\u2019s needed isn\u2019t \u201cfree trade\u201d but fair trade. Perhaps that\u2019s not a phrase that Mr Trump favours, but it should be. African countries must be empowered to develop on terms that suit their needs, enabling them to earn the foreign exchange essential for a green transition. Otherwise, the rich world risks undermining African growth. This would be a loss not only for Africa but for the world.",
      "Wealthy countries didn\u2019t grow using the policies they now push on poorer nations. Almost all relied on tariffs and subsidies to build their industries \u2013 even Britain, despite claims of virtually no state intervention. As global competition intensifies for green tech, AI and robotics, trade policies should be crafted more fairly than they are today.",

      "New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver shared her concerns as she briefed a legislative panel about administration of the general election and progress toward certifying the vote tally amid a surge in same-day voter registration. She said she plans to contact law enforcement about the threats.",
      "\u201cI am currently experiencing threats, harassment \u2014 from even some members of this committee \u2014 online,\" said Toulouse Oliver, a Democrat who has been subject repeatedly to threats in the past. \u201cAnd I want to say that thankfully we have a law in place that protects me from this behavior.\u201d",
      "A 2023 state law made it a fourth-degree felony to intimidate a state or local election official.",
      "After the hearing, Toulouse Oliver said she attempted to \u201cnip some emerging conspiracy theories in the bud\" with a post on the social platform X that stated Trump had won outright while acknowledging that some states were still counting votes and fewer voters showed up to the polls this year. In response, she said she was accused of committing treason and told she was \"in the crosshairs.\"",
      "Toulouse Oliver later switched off public access to that X account \u2014 used for political and private conversations \u2014 and said she was gathering information to refer the matter to state police and the state attorney general. An official X account for the secretary of state's office remains public.",

      "PHOENIX -- A judge recused himself Tuesday from presiding over Arizona\u2019s fake electors case after an email surfaced in which he told fellow judges to speak out against attacks on Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign for the presidency.",
      "In the Aug. 29 email, Maricopa County Judge Bruce Cohen lamented that he didn\u2019t speak out when Harris was called a \u201cDEI hire,\u201d believes that white men must speak out against unfair treatment of women, and raised a historical lesson from the Holocaust about the need to speak up when people are attacked. Cohen didn\u2019t specify who made the comment regarding Harris.",

      "Cohen later wrote another email telling his fellow judges that he let his passion cloud his views and apologized to anyone affected by his lapse in judgment in using an email forum for judges that was not appropriate for unsolicited comments.",
      "Lawyers for Republican state Sen. Jake Hoffman, who faces nine felony charges in the case, sought the judge\u2019s removal, arguing Cohen \u201cbears a deep-seated personal political bias that overcame his professional judgment\u201d and that their client has lost confidence in the judge\u2019s impartiality.",
      "Hoffman is one of 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that then-President Donald Trump won Arizona in the 2020 election. They include the former state party chair, a 2022 U.S. Senate candidate and two sitting state lawmakers. Two former Trump aides and five lawyers connected to Trump, including Rudy Giuliani, also were charged in the case. All 18 people were charged with charged with forgery, fraud and conspiracy.",
      "\u201cGiven the statements the judge made, I think it\u2019s appropriate that he recuse himself,\u201d Arizona attorney Mark L. Williams, who is representing Giuliani, said after Cohen\u2019s decision. \u201cThe way I see it, the case against Mr. Giuliani and the other defendants is falling apart and I think the attorney general should just wind down the case and dismiss it.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes declined to comment on the judge\u2019s recusal.",
      "In a court record, Cohen said the original email was a stand for decency and didn\u2019t reflect a personal bias, but he recognized that others may view it differently than he intended.",
      "Cohen, who was appointed to the bench by Democratic Gov. Janet Napolitano in 2005, was scheduled to retire in January.",
      "Most of the defendants had asked Cohen to throw out the charges under an Arizona law that bars using baseless legal actions in a bid to silence critics. The law had long offered protections in civil cases but was amended in 2022 by the Republican-led Legislature to cover people facing most criminal charges.",
      "Cohen recused himself before deciding whether to dismiss the case, which will be assigned to another judge.",
      "The defendants argued that Mayes tried to use the charges to silence them for their constitutionally protected speech about the 2020 election and actions taken in response to the race\u2019s outcome. They say Mayes campaigned on investigating the fake elector case and had shown a bias against Trump and his supporters.",
      "Prosecutors said the defendants didn\u2019t have evidence to back up their retaliation claim and that they had crossed the line from protected speech to fraud. Mayes\u2019 office also has said the grand jury that brought the indictment wanted to consider charging Trump, but prosecutors urged them not to.",
      "Two defendants have already resolved their cases.",
      "Former Trump campaign attorney Jenna Ellis, who worked closely with Giuliani, signed a cooperation agreement with prosecutors that led to the dismissal of her charges. Republican activist Loraine Pellegrino also became the first person to be convicted in the Arizona case when she pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was sentenced to probation.",
      "The remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty to the charges. Trump wasn\u2019t charged in Arizona, but the indictment refers to him as an unindicted coconspirator.",
      "Prosecutors in Michigan, Nevada, Georgia and Wisconsin also filed criminal charges related to the fake electors scheme.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump made a victor\u2019s return to Washington on Wednesday, visiting the White House for a nearly two-hour meeting with President Joe Biden and committing to a straightforward transition of power despite actively working to disrupt the same process four years ago.",
      "Sitting in the Oval Office, in front of a strong fire in the fireplace, the former rivals shook hands before Biden called Trump \"Mr. President-elect and former president\u201d and then settled simply on \u201cDonald.\u201d",
      "\u201cCongratulations,\u201d the Democrat told the Republican. \u201cI look forward to having, like they said, a smooth transition. Welcome. Welcome back.\u201d",
      "Trump replied, \u201cThank you very much,\" saying that \u201cpolitics is tough. And it\u2019s, in many cases, not a very nice world. But it is a nice world today, and I appreciate it very much.\u201d",
      "Except for the opening moments, the meeting was private, with Biden and Trump joined by their chiefs of staff. Trump said the transition between the outgoing and incoming administrations \"will be as smooth as it can get and I very much appreciate that, Joe.\u201d",
      "Trump, the winner this time, says he's ready to ensure that there is a seamless move between administrations. But when he lost four years ago, it was a very different story: Trump filed scores of lawsuits falsely claiming widespread voter fraud, refused to actively participate in transition work, denied the election results and helped incite a mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol, trying to stop the certification of Biden\u2019s victory.",
      "He also didn\u2019t invite Biden to the White House, and he refused to attend the inauguration \u2014 the first time that had happened since Andrew Johnson skipped Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s swearing-in 155 years ago.",
      "The new, all-smiles scene at the White House \u2014 despite what occurred four years ago \u2014 put in stark relief the remarkable political rebound for Trump, who departed Washington in 2021 as a diminished, politically defeated leader. Today he's preparing to come back to power with the Republicans having taken back the Senate, on the cusp of clinching a House majority and with what he and his GOP allies see as a mandate for governance.",
      "Neither the president-elect nor Biden answered questions shouted by reporters after their brief remarks. At one point, Biden looked at Trump, who moved his head to the side and gave a small shrug, but did not respond.",
      "Trump later told The New York Post that he and Biden discussed two issues on which they have differed sharply, the war in Ukraine and Israel's ongoing war with Hamas in Gaza.",
      "\u201cI asked for his views and he gave them to me,\u201d Trump told the paper. \u201cAlso, we talked very much about the Middle East, likewise. I wanted to know his views on where we are and what what he thinks. And he gave them to me, he was very gracious.\u201d",
      "It was unclear how long the president-elect's mild attitude toward Biden, set to be both his successor and predecessor at the White House, might last. After his 2016 election win, Trump met with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office and called it \u201ca great honor.\u201d But he soon was back to heaping insults on Obama.",
      "Trump looked at ease in the Oval Office in Wednesday, unlike eight years ago, when he appeared nervous and subdued when meeting with Obama. The president-elect left the White House after his session with Biden without addressing the large contingent of reporters on the driveway, waiting in case he made an appearance.",
      "First lady Jill Biden greeted Trump upon his arrival and gave him a handwritten letter of congratulations for his wife, Melania, who did not make the trip to Washington. The letter also expressed the first lady's team\u2019s readiness to assist with the transition.",
      "As he met with Biden, Trump sent out a fundraising email to supporters saying that he \"is inside the White House right now conducting a very important meeting.\u201d",
      "Trump had flown from Florida in the morning, joining up with billionaire Elon Musk for a morning session with House Republicans, telling them, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to win.\u201d",
      "He received a standing ovation from GOP lawmakers, many of whom took cellphone videos of Trump, as he ran through their party's victories up and down the ballot.",
      "\u201cI suspect I won\u2019t be running again unless you say he\u2019s good, we got to figure something else,\u201d Trump said to laughter from the lawmakers. The Constitution's 22nd Amendment prevents presidents from running for a third term.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said of Trump's arrival, \u201cHe is the comeback king.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe owe him a great debt of gratitude,\" Johnson said.",
      "Trump's reemergence comes amid Republican congressional leadership elections. He's endorsed Johnson's return to the speaker's office, with the president-elect saying he is with Johnson all the way, according to a person familiar with the remarks but not authorized to publicly discuss the private meeting.",
      "Musk joining Trump on the Washington trip came after the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has been spending much of his time at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Florida estate, and participating in discussions as the incoming Trump administration prepares to transition from Biden's. Trump has named Musk to a government efficiency advisory role in his incoming administration. Some close to the president-elect and his team now see Musk as the second most influential figure in Trump\u2019s immediate orbit, after Susie Wiles, the campaign manager who is Trump's incoming chief of staff.",
      "Biden insists that he'll do everything he can to make the transition to the next Trump administration go smoothly. That's despite having spent more than a year campaigning for reelection and decrying Trump as a threat to democracy and the nation\u2019s core values. Biden then bowed out of the race in July and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him.",
      "Traditionally, as the outgoing and incoming presidents meet in the West Wing, the first lady hosts her successor upstairs in the residence, But her office said Melania Trump wasn't attending, saying in a statement that \u201cher husband\u2019s return to the Oval Office to commence the transition process is encouraging, and she wishes him great success.\u201d",

      "An insurance magnate who was once a big political donor in North Carolina has pleaded guilty related to what prosecutors call a $2 billion scheme to defraud insurance regulators, policyholders and others",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- An insurance magnate who was once a big political donor in North Carolina is in federal custody after pleading guilty in connection to what prosecutors call a $2 billion scheme to defraud insurance regulators, policyholders and others through a myriad of companies from which he skimmed funds for personal benefit.",
      "Greg E. Lindberg, 54, of Tampa, Florida, entered the plea on Tuesday in Charlotte before U.S. Magistrate Judge David Keesler to one count of conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, according to legal documents.",
      "Lindberg, who had been indicted on 13 counts in February 2023, could face a maximum of 10 years in prison on the money laundering conspiracy count and five years on the other conspiracy count, a U.S. Department of Justice news release said.",
      "Lindberg, who lived previously in Durham, North Carolina, was already awaiting sentencing after he and an associate were convicted in May by a federal jury of attempting to bribe North Carolina's elected insurance commissioner to secure preferential regulatory treatment for his insurance business. The two had initially been convicted on two counts in 2020, but a federal appeals court vacated those convictions and ordered new trials.",
      "A document signed by Lindberg and government lawyers serving as the factual basis for Tuesday's plea said that from no later than 2016 through at least 2019 Lindberg and others conspired to engage in crimes associated with insurance business, wire fraud and investment adviser fraud. He and others also worked to deceive the state Insurance Department and other regulators by avoiding regulatory requirements, concealing the condition of his companies and using insurance company funds for himself, a news release said.",
      "It all resulted in companies that Lindberg controlled investing more than $2 billion in loans and other securities with his own affiliated companies, and Lindberg and co-conspirators laundering the scheme's proceeds, according to the government. The 2023 indictment alleged that Lindberg personally benefited by \u201cforgiving\u201d more than $125 million in loans to himself from the insurance companies that he controlled, the news release said.",
      "\u201cLindberg created a complex web of insurance companies, investment businesses, and other business entities and exploited them to engage in millions of dollars of circular transactions. Lindberg\u2019s actions harmed thousands of policyholders, deceived regulators, and caused tremendous risk for the insurance industry,\u201d U.S. Attorney Dena J. King for the Western District of North Carolina said. The FBI and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also were involved in the investigation.",
      "There was no immediate response to emails sent Wednesday about Tuesday's plea to a Lindberg attorney and a website associated with Lindberg's wellness and leadership activities.",
      "A sentencing date has not yet been set. Lindberg, who surrendered Tuesday to U.S. marshals, asked that he be held in a halfway house in Tampa before sentencing. Kessler scheduled another hearing on the matter for next week. After his initial conviction on bribery-related counts in 2020, a judge sentenced Lindberg to more than seven years in prison.",
      "Lindberg previously had given more than $5 million to state and federal candidates and committees since 2016, favoring Republicans but also giving to Democrats.",
      "The U.S. Justice Department said one of Lindberg\u2019s top executives still awaits sentencing after pleading guilty in late 2022 in a related case to conspiring with Lindberg and others to defraud the United States related to a scheme to move money between insurance companies and other businesses Lindberg owned.",
      "Some of Lindberg's insurance companies have been placed into liquidation and under a process to regain financial health, the Justice Department said.",
      "North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey said in a news release on Wednesday that he and his state agency would keep working with federal prosecutors to ensure that \u201cany money recovered through the restitution and forfeiture process will be used to repay the policyholder victims.\u201d",
      "Jurors determined that Lindberg and a former consultant attempted to bribe Causey in the late 2010s. Causey wasn\u2019t accused of wrongdoing \u2014 he alerted authorities and recorded conversations that served as the basis of 2019 indictments against Lindberg and three others."

      "A federal inspector general has exonerated two U.S. Park Police officers who fatally shot a Virginia man after a highway chase seven years ago",
      "McLEAN, Va. -- A federal inspector general has exonerated two U.S. Park Police officers who fatally shot a Virginia man after a stop-and-go chase on a highway seven years ago.",
      "A report issued Tuesday by the Department of Interior's inspector general found that the officers, Lucas Vinyard and Alejandro Amaya, did not violate procedures when they fatally shot Bijan Ghaisar, 25, of McLean, in November 2017 after a chase on the George Washington Memorial Parkway. It also concluded that they were justified in chasing Ghaisar after receiving a report that he fled the scene of an accident in which his sport utility vehicle had been rear-ended.",
      "The report said the shooting was within police policy because the officers reasonably feared that Amaya's life was in danger when he stood in front of Ghaisar's stopped vehicle and it began to roll forward.",
      "The only policy violation that did occur, according to the report, was when one of the officers used his gun to strike a window on Ghaisar's SUV.",
      "Ghaisar's death and the shooting was the subject of years of legal wrangling, though neither officer was ever convicted of a crime. Ghaisar's family did receive a $5 million settlement from the government last year in a civil lawsuit alleging wrongful death.",
      "On Wednesday, in a written statement, Ghaisar's mother, Kelly Ghaisar, disputed the inspector general's findings.",
      "\u201cThese officers should have never pursued Bijan,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough they saw Bijan was in distress - probably frightened to death - they did not communicate that with their superior. They pulled Bijan over and drew a weapon, banged on his window, and kicked his tire. They then hunted him and pulled him over and shot him multiple times.\u201d",
      "Federal authorities declined to prosecute the officers after a two-year FBI investigation. At that point, Fairfax County Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Steve Descano filed manslaughter charges against the officers in state court. That set off a tug-of-war between state and federal officials over who had jurisdiction to prosecute the case.",
      "In October 2021, a federal judge tossed out the manslaughter charges brought by Descano\u2019s office. The judge ruled that the officers were entitled to immunity and that their actions were proper under the circumstances.",
      "The Ghaisar family said the officers violated their own policies by chasing Ghaisar, who was unarmed when officers opened fire.",
      "Dashcam video of the shooting shows the pursuit starting on the parkway, then continuing into a residential neighborhood. It shows the car driven by Ghaisar stopping twice during the chase, and officers approaching the car with guns drawn. In both cases, Ghaisar drives off.",
      "At the third and final stop, the officers again approach with guns drawn, and Amaya stands in front of the driver\u2019s door. When the car starts to move, Amaya opens fire. Seconds later, when the car begins moving again, both Amaya and Vinyard fire multiple shots."

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The U.S. Senate election in Pennsylvania between Democratic incumbent Sen. Bob Casey and Republican David McCormick is headed for a statewide recount, as counties continued Wednesday to sort through outstanding ballots and the campaigns jousted over which ones should count.",
      "The Associated Press called the race for McCormick last week, concluding that not enough ballots remained to be counted in areas Casey was winning for him to take the lead.",
      "A noon deadline passed Wednesday for Casey to waive his right to a statewide recount and Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro\u2019s top election official, Secretary of State Al Schmidt, a Republican, announced that preliminary results had triggered a legally required statewide recount.",
      "As of Wednesday, McCormick led by about 28,000 votes out of more than 6.9 million ballots counted \u2014 inside the 0.5% margin threshold to trigger an automatic statewide recount under Pennsylvania law.",
      "Counties must begin the recount no later than Nov. 20 and must finish by noon on Nov. 26. It largely involves running paper ballots through high-speed scanners, a process that former election officials say might not change the outcome by more than a few hundred votes.",
      "\u201dIt is an infinitesimal number, compared to the overall vote totals,\" said Jeff Greenberg, a former Mercer County elections director.",
      "Meanwhile, McCormick was in Washington this week, attending Senate orientation and caucus meetings to pick a new leader after Republicans won control of the U.S. Senate in last week's election that saw Donald Trump win the White House.",
      "Casey hasn't conceded and, while Republicans pressure him on social media, his campaign manager said in a statement Wednesday that \u201cMcCormick and his allies are trying to disenfranchise Pennsylvania voters.\u201d",
      "Adam Bonin, a lawyer representing the Casey campaign in Philadelphia, said Republicans were aggressively and systematically challenging the provisional ballots of registered Democrats, delaying the vote counting process.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing this year is more organized, more disciplined, more directed and more comprehensive than what we saw in 2020,\u201d Bonin said.",
      "McCormick's campaign consultant, Mark Harris, said large Democratic-controlled counties were dragging out the process by not adding the results of processed ballots to vote totals.",
      "The McCormick campaign was challenging provisional ballots that it is allowed to challenge under the law, Harris said.",
      "\u201cThis is clearly an effort to use lawfare to chip away at our lead,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThis is not going to work. Dave McCormick is the senator-elect and will be the senator.\u201d",
      "Counties, meanwhile, were busy Wednesday processing tens of thousands of provisional ballots and hearing challenges to some of them by lawyers for Casey, McCormick and the state parties. A provisional ballot is typically cast at a polling place on Election Day and is separated from regular ballots in cases when elections workers need more time to determine a voter\u2019s eligibility to vote.",
      "Litigation is possible. For instance, Bucks County's Democratic-majority election board voted to count more than 400 mail-in ballots that lack a correct handwritten date on the outer envelope \u2014 something that Republicans are challenging and have opposed repeatedly in court.",
      "Bucks County's decision is in line with various decisions in state and federal courts that have deemed it unconstitutional or illegal to throw out such ballots. But higher courts \u2014 including the state Supreme Court most recently on Nov. 1 \u2014 have blocked those decisions, with litigation still pending.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, was once embroiled in a sex trafficking investigation by the Justice Department he\u2019s been tapped to lead",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, was once embroiled in a sex trafficking investigation by the Justice Department he's been tapped to lead, and remains under scrutiny by the House Ethics Committee over allegations including sexual misconduct.",
      "Gaetz, a staunch Trump defender, has spent years enmeshed in scandals that threaten to derail his confirmation as the nation's top federal law enforcement officer by the Republican-led Senate.",
      "Gaetz has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and said last year that the Justice Department's investigation into sex trafficking allegations involving underage girls had ended with no federal charges against him.",
      "Trump's attorney general is expected to oversee radical changes to the Justice Department, which has been the target of Trump's ire over two criminal cases it brought accusing him of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election and hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Trump, who cast himself as the victim of politically motivated prosecutions, vowed repeatedly on the campaign trail to carry out retribution against his political enemies if returned to the White House.",
      "It\u2019s unlikely Gaetz would be confirmed in time to oversee special counsel Jack Smith, who brought two federal indictments against Trump that are both expected to wind down before the incoming president takes office. Smith is expected to leave his post before Trump takes office, but special counsels are expected to produce reports on their work that historically are made public, and it remains unclear when such a document might be released.",
      "In a statement Wednesday announcing his pick, Trump said Gaetz would root out \u201csystemic corruption\" at the Justice Department and return the department \"to its true mission of fighting crime and upholding our democracy and constitution.\"",
      "In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Gaetz wrote, \u201cIt will be an honor to serve as President Trump\u2019s Attorney General!\u201d",
      "Hours before the announcement, Gaetz said in a social media post that there needs to be a \u201cfull court press against this WEAPONIZED government.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd if that means ABOLISHING every one of the three letter agencies, from the FBI to the ATF, I\u2019m ready to get going!\u201d If confirmed as attorney general, he would oversee both the FBI and the ATF, formally known as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
      "Inside a private meeting of House Republicans, the news that Trump had chosen Gaetz to lead the Justice Department sent a shock. Republican Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho said he has a hard time believing Gaetz will be able to get through the Senate confirmation process. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she didn't believe Gaetz was a serious candidate.",
      "Some of Gaetz\u2019 allies in the House defended him as Trump\u2019s pick, pointing to his experience as a member on the House Judiciary Committee. Asked Wednesday whether she thinks Gaetz could be confirmed, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a fellow Florida Republican, told reporters that many will try to \u201csmear him,\u201d but \u201cthe evidence will speak for itself.\u201d",
      "The federal sex trafficking investigation that began under Attorney General Bill Barr during Trump's first term focused on allegations that Gaetz and onetime political ally Joel Greenberg paid underage girls and escorts or offered them gifts in exchange for sex.",
      "Greenberg, a fellow Republican who served as the tax collector in Florida\u2019s Seminole County, admitted as part of a plea deal with prosecutors in 2021 that he paid women and an underage girl to have sex with him and other men. The men were not identified in court documents when he pleaded guilty. Greenberg was sentenced in late 2022 to 11 years in prison.",
      "Federal investigators scrutinized a trip that Gaetz took to the Bahamas with a group of women and a doctor who donated to his campaign, and whether the women were paid or received gifts to have sex with the men, according to people familiar with the matter who were not allowed to publicly discuss the investigation. Prosecutors also investigated whether Gaetz and his associates tried to secure government jobs for some of the women, and scrutinized Gaetz\u2019s connections to the medical marijuana sector, including whether his associates sought to influence legislation Gaetz sponsored, the people have said.",
      "Gaetz remains under investigation by the House Ethics Committee over allegations that he was part of a scheme that led to the sex trafficking of a 17-year-old girl.",
      "The committee began its review of Gaetz in April 2021, deferred its work in response to a Justice Department request, and renewed its work shortly after Gaetz announced that the Justice Department had ended a sex trafficking investigation.",
      "Over the summer, the committee provided an unusual public update into its long-running investigation, saying its review now includes whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct. Gaetz has categorically denied all the allegations before the committee.",
      "Rep. Michael Guest, the Republican chair of the House Ethics Committee, told The Associated Press that Gaetz's nomination does not change the panel\u2019s ongoing probe. But if Gaetz is confirmed for the cabinet position, the committee will no longer have jurisdiction to continue its probe or release its report, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to rush this investigation because of the appointment,\" Guest said. \"And so we\u2019re going to again follow the rules and the procedures that we set in place.\u201d",

      "In a press conference, Salazar launched his harshest criticism yet of rampant violence, police corruption and the Mexican government\u2019s mistaken attitude that \u201cthere is no problem.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen they just say \u2018there is no problem, we have these statistics to show people there is no problem,\u2019 that is not based on reality,\u201d\u201c Salazar said. \u201cThere is a very big problem.\u201d",
      "Mexico's foreign relations ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the statements by Salazar.",
      "Salazar cited violence in recent days in the northern state of Sinaloa as an example. Sinaloa state police chief Gerardo M\u00e9rida said Wednesday authorities found a pile of between five and seven bodies on a roadside there, but were still counting body parts to see how many there were.",
      "\u201cThere is a pile of various bodies, with what we have found we have identified five bodies, but some are in pieces, they have been dismembered, there are mentions of seven,\u201d said M\u00e9rida.",

      "Salazar countered that in Sinaloa \u201cthe dead can be seen everywhere.\u201d",

      "Mexico later blamed the United States for detaining the capos, saying that had caused the outbreak of violence. Salazar said Mexico also shut down anti-drug cooperation after that.",
      "\u201cIt totally accelerated from there, the Mexican government closed its doors,\u201d Salazar said. The ambassador also criticized efforts by both L\u00f3pez Obrador and Sheinbaum to downplay the problem of crime and violence, claiming the problem was being exaggerated and crime statistics were dropping.",
      "Salazar did not clarify why he thought the Mexican government's numbers were untrustworthy, but in recent days the government appears to have changed the way it reports homicide figures.",
      "\u201cThe reality for the Mexican people, and that is for businesspeople, members of the press like you who work on the streets, those who have ranches, like the cattleman killed in Sinaloa over the weekend because he was a leader, they don't live with security,\u201d Salazar said.",
      "The continuing violence \u201cis a very serious problem in Mexico and saying there is no problem, blaming someone else, blaming the United States, obviously is not (the solution)\", he continued.",

      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- For years, neighbors who lived near a factory in Louisville, Kentucky, complained amongst themselves and to local officials about a variety of strange smells coming from the plant, which produces colorings for food and drinks.",
      "Some described it as an ammonia-like smell, while others said it was more like burnt sugar or burnt caramel. They worried a bit about living so close to the plant, but never expected what happened Tuesday, when an explosion killed two workers, and blew out windows and ripped pieces off the roofs of nearby homes..",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always thought about it, like this is unsafe \u2014 seems like \u2014 because there was always huge steam coming from the place at night. But I never really thought that this would happen,\" said Shelby Dix, 31, who lives in an apartment in a multifamily home that is separated from the plant property by an alley.",
      "The explosion injured 11 other employees at Givaudan Sense Colour, and caused a partial collapse of the building. Three remained hospitalized Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe are grieving with the families, friends, and loved ones of those that were lost and injured during this very difficult time,\u201d the Swiss-based company said in a statement.",
      "Amanda Strecker, who lived in a townhouse near the plant from 2018 to 2022, said she had long been concerned about the ammonia-like smell.",
      "\u201cWe felt when we lived there that something was going to happen. It was just a matter of time,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of problems with chemical smells in the air, reporting it locally to the environmental office, and them coming out and not finding anything.\u201d",

      "In April 2003, while the plant was owned by D.D. Williamson, a tank exploded and killed a worker. Federal investigators determined the tank exploded because it was missing its pressure relief valve, which had been removed when it was moved to the Louisville plant in 1989.",
      "In 2009, D.D. Williamson paid a total of $600,000 in civil fines to the U.S. Department of Justice and the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District to resolve allegations of Clean Water Act violations at the Louisville plant.",
      "Officials said they have not yet determined what caused the explosion Tuesday. Louisville Fire Chief Brian O'Neill said the building housed hazardous chemicals \u2014 typical for factories of that kind \u2014 and firefighters did not immediately know if any had been compromised. He said monitoring of air and runoff found none.",
      "Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said employees initially told officials \u201ceverything was normal activity when the explosion occurred.\u201d",

      "As of February 2021, the factory made caramel colorings for the food industry by heating sugar and water and adding chemicals such as aqueous ammonia for some products, according to permitting documents filed with the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District.",
      "At the time of the permits, the plant was still owned by D.D. Williamson & Co., which was founded in 1865 and initially supplied malt to brewing companies, later developed colors for soft drinks and more recently produced natural colors for food and beverage companies.",
      "The Swiss flavor and fragrance company Givaudan acquired D.D. Williamson in 2021. Givaudan Sense Colour offers a range of \u201cnatural colours, caramel colours, burnt sugars, and fruit and vegetable-based browns\u201d for the beverage market, according to its website. Spokespersons for Givaudan did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment Wednesday.",
      "Last year, the air pollution control district cited the plant for failing to notify the district about unspecified excessive emissions. It also was cited for not submitting annual compliance certifications and reports in a timely manner, as well as not abiding by permit requirements concerning monitoring, recording and inspections. The company agreed to pay a $7,500 fine.",
      "Carly Johnson, her husband and their 4-year-old son were at home when they heard a \u201ccrazy loud boom,\u201d felt their house shake and heard things falling off the walls and shelves as if a bomb went off.",
      "During the 12 years the family has lived about a block from the plant, they've smelled what Johnson described as a \u201cweird, burnt sugar smell.\u201d She and her husband had worried about living so close to the plant, knowing about the explosion two decades ago. But she said she thought that since it there had already been such a traumatic event there, \"they would have done everything they could to prevent this from happening again.\u201d",
      "\u201cWindows and everything can be replaced. I\u2019m just mad about my son going through that. That\u2019s what makes me the most mad,\u201d she said.",
      "The Louisville Fire Department is leading the investigation with help from state and federal partners. A reconstruction team from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was headed to Louisville to help determine the cause of the explosion. Givaudan said in an earlier statement that it is cooperating with authorities.",

      "It was the first seriously contested Senate Republican leadership election in decades",
      "WASHINGTON -- It was the first seriously contested Senate Republican leadership election in decades.",
      "Three senators were competing to succeed longtime GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, when he steps down from the post at the beginning of next year and Republicans take back the Senate majority.",
      "Sen. John Thune of South Dakota was elected Wednesday by fellow Republicans in a secret ballot vote.",
      "Thune, along with Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida, had campaigned furiously for the job. They also tried to differentiate themselves from McConnell, saying they would give rank-and-file senators more power and be more communicative.",
      "Each tried to make the case that he would be the best person to implement President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "A look at those three senators:",
      "Thune, 63, defeated then-Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle in 2004 after arguing during the campaign that Daschle had lost his South Dakota roots during his years in Democratic leadership.",
      "Well liked and a respected communicator, Thune had been seen as a front-runner for much of the year. He was the No. 2 Republican in the Senate and took over for McConnell for a few weeks last year when McConnell was on a medical leave. Thune is a former chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.",
      "As he geared up to run for leader, Thune spent much of the year campaigning for his colleagues. According to his aides, he raised more than $31 million to elect Senate Republicans this cycle, including a $4 million transfer from his own campaign accounts to the Senate\u2019s main campaign arm.",
      "One potential liability for Thune had been his previously rocky relationship with Trump. Thune was highly critical of the then-president as Trump tried to overturn his election defeat in 2020 and after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by Trump\u2019s supporters. Thune said at that time that Trump\u2019s efforts to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power were \u201cinexcusable.\u201d",
      "This year, though, Thune and Trump talked frequently on the phone and Thune visited the then-GOP candidate at his home in Florida. Thune told The Associated Press over the summer that he viewed their potential relationship as a professional one.",
      "Cornyn is a popular and respected member of the Senate GOP conference. A former Texas attorney general and member of the state Supreme Court, much of his work has been on the Senate Judiciary Committee. He was also McConnell\u2019s No. 2, the job Thune now holds, for six years before he was term-limited out of the job.",
      "Cornyn, 72, had also spent much of the year courting his colleagues and fundraising for them around the country. He has long been one of the best fundraisers in the Senate, and his aides say he has raised more than $400 million for party candidates during his 22 years in office.",
      "In 2022, after a gunman stormed a Texas elementary school and killed 19 children and two teachers, Cornyn was tapped by McConnell to lead the GOP in negotiating gun legislation with Democrats. The bill, passed that summer, stepped up background checks for buyers under 21, increased prosecutions for unlicensed gun sellers and put millions of dollars into youth mental health services. While Cornyn has promoted his work on the gun bill, it could cost him some votes with the conference\u2019s most conservative members.",
      "Cornyn also had some past tensions with Trump, including his early suggestions that Trump might not be the best GOP candidate to run in 2024. But the senator, too, has smoothed relations with the incoming president, meeting him when he was in Texas to campaign and visiting him in Florida.",
      "While Thune and Cornyn both have leadership experience and have spent the better part of the year methodically trying to woo individual senators, Scott ran a different kind of campaign. And he believed he had a distinct advantage: his relationship with Trump.",
      "Scott, a former two-term governor of Florida and a successful businessman, was reelected to a second term in the Senate last week, beating Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell by more than 10 percentage points. He is a longtime booster of the incoming president, and positioned himself as a strong ally. Scott traveled to New York to support Trump during Trump\u2019s hush money trial earlier this year, and had said he wanted Trump to endorse him.",
      "Scott won a rush of support on social media over the weekend when he was endorsed by people close to Trump, including Elon Musk.",
      "Scott won 10 votes when he challenged McConnell for the post in 2022.",
      "Scott, 71, is part of a growing group of far-right senators who have criticized McConnell\u2019s tenure and advocated for more power for individual members. Several senators in that group, including Utah Sen. Mike Lee and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, endorsed him, citing his business experience and relationship with Trump."

      "U.S. and Polish officials have opened a new NATO missile defense base in northen Poland",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- U.S. and Polish officials inaugurated a NATO missile defense base in northern Poland on Wednesday, with Polish officials welcoming it as a significant step in securing the country and the NATO alliance at a time of war in neighboring Ukraine.",
      "The U.S. missile defense base, which is being integrated into NATO's defenses, was originally planned under U.S. President George W. Bush as a way to protect Europe from ballistic threats from Iran. Poland, however, has always seen it as a form of U.S. protection in case of Russia aggression, fears that have grown since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The Kremlin protested the plan from the start, and on Wednesday denounced the base as a challenge to its own military potential that would require measures \u201cto ensure parity.\u201d",
      "Polish officials, who gathered with the U.S. ambassador and other officials, welcomed it as historic step that increases the U.S. commitment to the security of Europe at a time of uncertainty due to the war in Ukraine. There are also concerns about whether Donald Trump will remain as committed to Europe's security when he returns to the White House in January.",
      "\u201cThe whole world will see clearly that this is not Russia's sphere of interest anymore,\u201d Polish President Andrzej Duda said at the ceremony in Redzikowo. \u201cFrom the Polish point of view, this is strategically the most important thing.\u201d",
      "Poland\u2019s Defense Minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz called the opening of the base with its hundreds of U.S. Navy personnel \u201can extraordinary event in the history of the security of Poland, the U.S. and NATO.\u201d He said the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are showing the importance of air defenses.",
      "\u201cThe base in Redzikowo means the eternal presence of American and allied troops on the territory of the Republic of Poland and, strategically for Poland, it is one of the most important events in history after 1989,\" he said.",
      "The facility is equipped with the U.S. Navy's modern Aegis Ashore system, which can detect, track and destroy ballistic missiles in the initial phase of their flight. It is the second land element of Aegis Ashore in Europe after the first such installation went into operation in Romania in 2016.",
      "Asked about the base during a news briefing Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin had expressed his concerns about the U.S. plans even during the Bush administration.",
      "\u201cWe then insisted that the Americans saying all these plans are aimed against the ephemeral Iranian threat are in fact a lie, that all these plans were drawn up from the very beginning as an attempt to militarily contain our potential,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThis is the advancement of American military infrastructure on European territory towards our borders. This is nothing other than an attempt to contain our potential. And, of course, this leads to the adoption of appropriate measures to ensure parity,\u201d Peskov added.",
      "Later in the day, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte visited Warsaw for meetings with Duda and Prime Minister Donald Tusk, another gesture of NATO unity. He praised Poland for its contributions to the alliance, including its high level of defense spending.",
      "\u201cWith this, you are building one of the biggest armies in NATO,\u201d Rutte said at a joint news conference with Tusk.",
      "Tusk, who is preparing for Poland to take over the rotating leadership of the European Union on Jan. 1, said he has been speaking with other European leaders to make sure they remain committed to Ukraine being involved in any future negotiations about its fate.",
      "\u201cThis means that EU member states should ensure that future decisions regarding, God willing, ending the war or freezing the conflict, are made in full agreement and with the participation of the interested states, those from the eastern flank, but above all Ukraine itself,\" Tusk said."

      "Sen. John Thune has won an internal election among Republican senators to become the chamber\u2019s next majority leader",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans have elected South Dakota Sen. John Thune as the next Senate majority leader, completing a momentous shift in their leadership that elevates a top deputy of Mitch McConnell into a key position as President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House.",
      "Thune, 63, is in his fourth Senate term and has promised to work closely with Trump, despite differences the two have had over the years, and will be a crucial part of the incoming president\u2019s efforts to push through his policy agenda. The two spoke on the phone shortly after Thune was elected, the senator posted on X Wednesday afternoon, adding that \u201cSenate Republicans are excited and ready to get to work\u201d with the incoming president.",
      "Trump later congratulated Thune on his social media platform, Truth Social. \u201cHe moves quickly, and will do an outstanding job,\" Trump wrote. \"I look forward to working with him.\u201d",
      "Thune beat out two other competitors, Sens. John Cornyn and Rick Scott, by gaining majority support from GOP senators in two rounds of secret ballots behind closed doors. Scott was eliminated on the first round and the final vote between Thune and Cornyn was 29-24, according to several people who requested anonymity to discuss the private meeting.",
      "Republicans are replacing McConnell, the longest serving Senate party leader, as they prepare to take majority control of the Senate with the 53 seats they won in last week\u2019s elections. It was the first competitive election for Republican leader in three decades and Senate Republicans' first regime change since McConnell became GOP leader in 2007.",
      "Thune's election represents a major shift in the upper chamber's GOP conference as many senators have been eager to move on from McConnell's long and powerful reign. But it will also be a complicated test for Thune as he will have to manage a conference that is often divided over policy, navigate Trump's demands of the legislative branch and secure policy wins for the president as he begins his second term.",
      "\u201cIt is a new day in the United States Senate,\u201d Thune told reporters immediately after he was elected. He said his majority will work to toughen border security laws, lower energy costs and overturn regulations they see as burdensome.",
      "\u201cWe are excited to reclaim the majority and to get to work with our colleagues in the House to enact President Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d Thune said.",
      "As the candidates tried to win over individual senators, all of their pitches centered around how close they would be to Trump. That was a more difficult task for Cornyn and Thune, who broke publicly with the former president over his effort to overturn his defeat in the 2020 presidential election and the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. At the time, Thune called Trump's actions \u201cinexcusable.\u201d",
      "In recent months, though, Thune has worked to smooth over that relationship, visiting Trump at his Florida home and consulting with him on how to implement the incoming president\u2019s agenda. Thune told The Associated Press over the summer that he views their potential relationship as a professional one. If they both won their elections, Thune said then, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a job to do.\u201d",
      "As he made his case, Thune has made clear that he will listen to Trump's demands. When Trump posted on X Sunday that the new leader \u201cmust agree\u201d to allow him to appoint Cabinet members and others when the Senate is on recess, avoiding confirmation votes, Thune quickly responded in a statement that the Senate must \u201cquickly and decisively\u201d act to get nominees in place and that \u201call options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments.\u201d",
      "Speaking to reporters after he was elected, Thune noted that \u201cthe Senate has an advise and consent rule in the Constitution\" but that they will do everything they can to get his nominees in place.",
      "\u201cHow that happens remains to be seen,\u201d Thune said.",
      "Thune\u2019s win is all the more extraordinary because of his 2004 election to the Senate \u2013 defeating then-Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle after arguing during the campaign that Daschle had lost his South Dakota roots during his years in Democratic leadership. Twenty years later, Thune will become majority leader himself.",
      "Well liked and a respected communicator, Thune has been perceived as a front-runner for much of the year. Like McConnell, he hails from the Republican Party\u2019s more traditional wing.",
      "He is a former chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee and has held the Republican whip position \u2014 no. 2 in party leadership \u2014 since 2019. He took over for McConnell for several weeks last year when he was on a medical leave, a move that was widely seen as an audition of sorts as speculation surrounded McConnell's future.",
      "As he geared up to run for leader, Thune spent much of the year campaigning for his colleagues. According to his aides, he raised more than $31 million to elect Senate Republicans this cycle, including a $4 million transfer from his own campaign accounts to the Senate\u2019s main campaign arm.",
      "The election was difficult for many in the conference who saw Thune and Cornyn as similar choices. They are alike on policy, voting generally in step with the conference but working with Democrats at times. Cornyn is a longtime member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who took a leading role on bipartisan gun legislation two years ago.",
      "But the two differed on whether the leader should be term limited \u2014 a key demand from some in the conservative wing. Cornyn pushed for limits, while Thune did not.",
      "Scott, the former governor of Florida, was elected to the Senate in 2018 and quickly positioned himself as a foil to McConnell, running against him for leader in 2022 and aligning with Utah Sen. Mike Lee and others who have been highly critical of the current leadership.",
      "As Thune and Cornyn wooed their colleagues one by one all year, Scott was tied up in his own reelection race. He handily defeated Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell by more than 10 points.",
      "In the week since the election, Scott aggressively stepped up his campaign for GOP leader, campaigning publicly as the candidate closest to Trump and winning endorsements from people who are close to the former and future president, such as billionaire Elon Musk. But some questioned whether that strategy might backfire.",
      "South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, Thune's home state colleague, said that he prefers the way that Thune and Cornyn have \u201chandled it one-on-one with everybody,\u201d but that he had talked to Scott as well. \u201cWe\u2019ve got three qualified individuals,\u201d he said ahead of the race.",
      "Still, both Thune and Cornyn adopted some of Scott's ideas as they worked to win over voters. Thune told the conference in a candidate forum Tuesday evening that he would allow more amendments on the floor and improve communication from McConnell's regime, addressing frequent complaints from that wing of the conference.",
      "McConnell did not say who he was supporting, but said after the vote that Thune\u2019s victory was a \u201cclear endorsement of a consummate leader.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe American people elected Republicans to restore stability and order after four years of Washington Democrats\u2019 failure,\" McConnell said. \"John Thune will take the reins with a tremendous opportunity to lead this transformation, and Senate Republicans stand behind him, ready to get to work.\u201d"

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 16:50:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Tenants searching for an apartment in New York City have long been forced to pay thousands of dollars to real estate brokers",

      "Tenants searching for an apartment in New York City have long been forced to pay thousands of dollars to real estate brokers",
      "NEW YORK -- Mandatory broker fees, an unusual feature of New York City apartment hunting long reviled by renters, will be banned under legislation that passed Wednesday after overcoming fierce backlash from the city's real estate lobby.",
      "Under a system that exists in New York and almost nowhere else in the country, tenants are often forced to pay the commission of a real estate agent before moving into an apartment, even if that agent was hired by the landlord.",
      "The fees are steep, typically totaling as much as 15% of the annual rent, about $7,000 for the average-priced New York City apartment.",
      "The legislation passed by the City Council aims to stop landlords from saddling tenants with those payments \u2014 at least as an up-front fee. Though tenants may hire their own representatives, they will no longer be forced to pay for brokers that solely represent the interests of their landlords.",
      "In a city where two-thirds of households are renters, the bill is widely popular, a rare piece of municipal legislation championed by influencers on TikTok. It has also triggered opposition from brokers and their representatives, who warn it could send shockwaves through an industry that employs 25,000 agents.",
      "\u201cThey spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to lobby our politicians to try to kill this bill and try to force you to pay broker fees,\u201d Councilmember Chi Oss\u00e9, a Democrat who sponsored the the FARE Act, said at a rally Wednesday. \u201cBut you know what we did: We beat them.\u201d",
      "New York\u2019s broker fee arrangement dates back nearly a century to a time when agents played an active role in publishing listings in newspapers and working directly with would-be tenants. The commission structure is also found in Boston, but few other parts of the country.",
      "But with most listings now published online, and virtual or self-guided tours gaining popularity since the COVID-19 pandemic, many New Yorkers have grown increasingly frustrated by the fees.",
      "At a City Council hearing this summer, multiple speakers recalled shelling out thousands of dollars to a broker who seemed to do little more than open a door or text them the code to a lockbox.",
      "\u201cIn most businesses, the person who hires the person pays the person,\u201d Agustina Velez, a house cleaner from Queens, said at that hearing. She recalled paying $6,000 to switch apartments. \u201cEnough with these injustices. Landlords have to pay for the services they use.\u201d",
      "Brokers counter that they do much more than merely holding open doors: conducting background checks, juggling viewings and streamlining communication with landlords in a city where many tenants never meet the owners of their buildings.",
      "\u201cThis is the start of a top-down, government-controlled housing system,\u201d said Jordan Silver, a broker with the firm Brown Harris Stevens. \u201cThe language is so incredibly vague, we actually have no idea what this would look like in the world.\u201d",
      "Others opposed to the bill, including the Real Estate Board of New York, say landlords will bake the added costs into monthly rents.",
      "But some New Yorkers say that would be preferable to the current system of high up-front costs that make it hard to move.",
      "\u201cFrom the perspective of a tech investor and business owner in New York City, the more we can do to make it cheaper and easier for talented young people to come here and stay here, the better off we\u2019ll be,\u201d entrepreneur and bill supporter Bradley Tusk said in a statement. \u201cAnyone who has paid 15% of their annual rent in brokers fees for someone to let you in an apartment for 10 minutes knows the practice is nothing more than legalized theft.\u201d",
      "Mayor Eric Adams, himself a former real estate broker, has raised concerns about the legislation and possible unintended consequences.",
      "\u201cSometimes our ideas are not fleshed out enough to know what are the full long-term ramifications,\u201d he said this week, adding that he would work \u201cto find some middle ground.\u201d",
      "But he will have limited leverage in doing so: The legislation passed by a vote of 42 to 8, a veto-proof margin. It takes effect in six months."

    "story": [
      "Maine\u2019s ranked choice tabulation is taking place in public, narrated play-by-play by the state\u2019s elections chief",
      "AUGUSTA, Maine -- Maine\u2019s elections chief, a former civil liberties advocate who sparred with President-elect Donald Trump over ballot access, is acting like a play-by-play sports announcer as she describes the state\u2019s process of determining a congressional winner through ranked choice voting.",
      "Shenna Bellows is spending the week streaming the effort live on YouTube and answering questions in real time.",
      "\u201cWe hope that when people see it for themselves, they will believe that our elections do have integrity, that they\u2019re free and fair. And then maybe they\u2019ll have a little more trust in the election officials who are working so hard to make these elections happen,\u201d Secretary of State Shenna Bellows told The Associated Press.",
      "Democratic Rep. Jared Golden led Republican challenger Austin Theriault by about 2,000 first-place votes after nearly 400,000 ballots were cast in Maine's 2nd Congressional District, but neither got more than 49%, so the ranked choice process will reallocate other votes to determine a majority, her office announced.",
      "The race between Golden and Theriault has played out as both parties struggle to control the U.S. House of Representatives. The Associated Press has not declared a winner.",
      "Bellows, who took office in 2021, is a former director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine who drew the ire of Republicans when she ruled that Donald Trump\u2019s role in the Jan. 6 insurrection made him ineligible to appear on the state\u2019s GOP primary ballot. Trump did appear, and won, after the U.S. Supreme Court intervened. Bellows was doxed and swatted after that \u2014 her address and other personal data were posted online, and a fake emergency call sent officers to her home.",
      "Lawyers for both candidates, campaign officials, journalists and police looked on Tuesday as election workers opened ballot boxes inside the building that houses the Maine State Police headquarters. Viewers could watch from two different angles, and Bellows occasionally aimed an iPad camera at the observers or her staff to explain what was happening.",
      "Bellows described the chain of custody \u2014 election workers in each municipality secured the ballots in padlocked blue boxes sealed with secret codes, secured by padlocks and escorted by law enforcement to an \u201cundisclosed location\u201d that\u2019s monitored constantly by officers and security cameras.",
      "She also talked about digital security \u2014 describing the make, model and purpose of each machine and explaining steps to prevent tampering by cybercriminals or other malicious actors. None of the machines are connected to the internet, so there\u2019s no way they could be hacked, and logic testing would catch any data mismatch, she said.",
      "After the locked blue ballot boxes were wheeled into the room by a team including an armed detective, she invited lawyers for both campaigns to handle the tapes and confirm that voting machine printouts matched election night tallies.",
      "Theriault\u2019s campaign manager gave his seal of approval after consulting several times with Bellows on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThey let the lawyers from both sides look at the rooms where the ballots were stored. I think it\u2019s a very open process,\u201d Shawn Roderick told reporters in the hallway outside.",
      "Elections officials across the country have been vexed by efforts to challenge results, many of them ill-informed and fueled by deliberate attempts to undermine America\u2019s democracy.",
      "The mundane process of tabulating votes became a spectacle when Florida\u2019s hanging chads controversy led to the \u201cBrooks Brothers Riot\u201d of GOP staffers who tried to shut down the count in 2000. Scratchy CCTV videos in Atlanta fueled an insatiable interest in the 2020 count after Trump ally Rudy Giuliani falsely accused Fulton County election workers of stuffing ballot boxes.",
      "Those doubts persist even though Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, gave news conferences afterward insisting that the results, confirmed by multiple recounts, were valid.",
      "In contrast, Bellows is anticipating and answering questions in real time. Promoting transparency is a wise response to mistrust in institutions and Republican criticism of ranked voting, particularly because of her Trump ballot decision, said Mark Brewer, a political science professor at the University of Maine.",
      "\u201cI think it is a smart move on her part,\u201d Brewer said.",
      "Ranked choice voting, which Maine voters adopted in 2016, is used in local races in many places but few states have accepted it.",
      "This race had just one valid alternative to the top two \u2014 Diana Merenda, a retiree who formally declared her write-in candidacy to show opposition to the war in Gaza. She collected 400 votes. More than 12,000 other ballots had no first choices and need to be checked for second choices before being discarded.",
      "\u201cKeep in mind what we are doing first is verifying those initial totals and then running the ranked choice voting tabulation so that second choices for people who did not choose Golden or Theriault are folding up into the count, and as a result we\u2019ll know, between those two, who has 50%,\u201d Bellows said during the livestream.",
      "There have been hiccups \u2014 they needed bolt cutters to open one padlock whose key was misplaced. Bellows announced this with a wide grin, as if to celebrate how each voter's choices have been protected. Then she turned to an extended explanation of how memory sticks work.",
      "After this week's final tabulation, election workers will begin the formal recount Theriault requested, aiming to deliver final results before a Nov. 25 certification deadline.",

      "Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be ambassador to Israel, has long rejected a Palestinian state in territory previously seized by Israel and has repeatedly signaled his staunch support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "Huckabee, a former TV host and Baptist preacher, frequently visits Israel and once said he wanted to buy a holiday home there. He has maintained throughout the years that the West Bank belongs to Israel, and recently said \u201cthe title deed was given by God to Abraham and to his heirs.\u201d",
      "His argument for a so-called \u201cone-state solution\u201d contradicts longstanding official U.S. support for the eventual establishment of a Palestinian state.",
      "He has described the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas as \u201chorrific\" and \" beyond anything I\u2019ve ever witnessed in my lifetime\u201d and argued that the U.S. needs to stand firmly behind Israel.",
      "Here are some things Huckabee has said over the years about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.",
      "Huckabee has never supported a two-state compromise even when Netanyahu endorsed the idea in 2009.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. Palestinians want those territories for a future state and view them as parts of a single country now under military occupation.",
      "The U.S., along with most of the international community, has supported the establishment of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 lines as the cornerstone of a peace agreement. Even Israel\u2019s hardline prime minister once endorsed a two-state solution while rejecting a return to Israel\u2019s pre-1967 lines. Netanyahu now rejects the creation of a Palestinian state.",
      "Huckabee has never supported any solution that would require Israeli settlers to be uprooted.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press in 2015, Huckabee, then running for the GOP presidential nomination, said recognizing the West Bank as Israeli would be the \u201cformal position\u201d of his administration. He criticized Israel's 2005 withdrawal from Gaza and described settlers evacuated by Israeli forces as having been \u201cmarched at gunpoint.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel that we have a responsibility to respect that this is land that has historically belonged to the Jews,\u201d he said.",
      "In 2015, Huckabee likened the Iran nuclear deal to marching Israelis \u201cto the door of the oven,\u201d a reference to the crematorium in a Nazi concentration camp during the Holocaust.",
      "Huckabee was criticizing then-President Barack Obama for his role in the agreement the U.S. and other world powers reached with Tehran. Republicans back then were united in their opposition to the deal, arguing it didn\u2019t address Iran's support for terrorism. Trump during his first administration withdrew from the deal, in which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.",
      "The comment was denounced by Democrats, but Huckabee stood by it.",
      "In a recent interview with a podcaster, Huckabee said he did not believe in referring to the Arab descendants of people who lived in British-controlled Palestine as \u201cPalestinians.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere really isn\u2019t such a thing,\u201d he said earlier this year on \u201cThink Twice\u201d with Jonathan Tobin. \u201cIt\u2019s a term that was co-opted by Yasser Arafat in 1962,\u201d referring to one of the early leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization.",
      "During the same podcast, Huckabee described himself as an \u201cunapologetic, unreformed Zionist.\u201d",
      "In defending Israel, Huckabee said he wished people understood that \u201cthis is an extraordinary oasis in a land of totalitarianism surrounded by tyranny.\u201d",
      "The former governor also said many \u201cradical Muslims want to take us back to the seventh century.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't want to go back there,\u201d he said. \u201cI like modernity.\u201d",
      "Huckabee has described the attack on Oct. 7, 2023, as \u201chorrific\u201d and \u201cbeyond anything I\u2019ve ever witnessed in my lifetime.\" He was outraged by how Hamas spread images of the killings on social media.",
      "\u201cAs horrible as the Nazis were, they weren\u2019t posting their atrocities on social media and trying to trumpet what they were doing to the world,\u201d he said in an appearance with the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews. \u201cWhich is what makes this horrendous thing Hamas has done so much, to me, worse, because they want everyone to see what they\u2019ve done.\u201d",
      "Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 250 people hostage. Israel responded with one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history, killing more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say."

      "The pension reform plans are the cornerstone of the address, which comes after many businesses have criticised the rise in employer National Insurance contributions in the Budget.",
      "She told the BBC that she is \"not immune to those criticisms, but it was necessary to increase taxes\u201d to get the public finances in to shape and \u201cproperly fund\u201d public services.",

    "story": [
      "People who were mis-sold finance agreements when buying cars could face a delay to potential compensation payouts.",
      "A decision by judges at the Court of Appeal has blown open an ongoing saga into hidden commission payments, with buyers possibly in line for payouts totalling billions of pounds.",
      "Now the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is consulting on giving dealers extra time to deal with complaints.",

      "About two million are sold this way each year, with customers paying an initial deposit, then a monthly fee with interest for the vehicle.",
      "In a complicated, and long-running, series of developments, many of these agreements have come under scrutiny.",
      "In 2021, the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher than necessary interest rate.",
      "Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.",
      "That has created the prospect of banks and other lenders having to make payouts totalling millions of pounds.",
      "Last month, a decision at the Court of Appeal broadened the net of those who could receive compensation, potentially increasing the lenders' final bill to billions of pounds.",
      "Why was the judges' decision so important?",
      "While the initial investigations surrounded discretionary commission arrangements, which were banned in 2021, the Court of Appeal decision widened the scope to any car finance commissions.",
      "The three judges unanimously agreed that it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the informed consent of the buyer.",
      "In other words, customers should be clearly told how much commission would be paid, and agree to it, without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",
      "The hearing included the test case of Marcus Johnson, 34, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, who bought his first car - a Suzuki Swift - in 2017.",

      "It's thought the cost of compensation could reach \u00a316bn, according to analysts.",
      "How has the regulator responded?",
      "The FCA said that the decision could lead to dealers receiving a deluge of new complaints.",
      "Some could come from people previously told they had no claim for compensation because they did not have a discretionary commission arrangement.",
      "The regulator is consulting on extending the time car dealers will have to respond to complaints.",
      "It also wants the Supreme Court to make a quick decision on whether it will reconsider the Court of Appeal's ruling.",
      "It wants an orderly compensation system, if it comes to that.",
      "The Finance and Leasing Association, the trade body for motor finance providers, described the FCA's plan as a \"sensible move\".",

    "story": [
      "Uranium is making a comeback thanks to a renewed focus on nuclear energy as a climate crisis solution. Canada, rich with high-grade deposits, could become a nuclear \u201csuperpower\u201d. But can its potential be realised?",
      "Leigh Curyer had been working in uranium mining for nearly two decades when he noticed a striking shift.",
      "In 2011, the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan badly damaged the world's view of nuclear power, and the price for the heavy metal - a critical component for nuclear fuel - cratered.",
      "But the last five years has seen a reversal, with the global price of uranium spiking by more than 200%one of this year's top-performing commodities.",
      "Mr Curyer, an Australian-born businessman, credits this to a changing attitude that began soon after Microsoft founder Bill Gates touted nuclear energy as \u201cideal for dealing with climate change\u201d in 2018.",
      "Four years later, then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson pushed forward a policy of generating at least 25% of the country\u2019s energy from nuclear.",
      "Shortly after, the European Union voted to declare nuclear energy climate-friendly.",
      "These events were \u201ccatalytic\u201d for the uranium industry and a turning point for Mr Curyer's company NexGen, which is behind the largest in-development uranium mine in Canada.",
      "His phone began to ring with calls from investors worldwide - something that \u201chad never happened in my previous 17 years in the industry\u201d, he said.",
      "NexGen, whose project is located in Canada's remote, uranium-rich Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan, is now worth nearly $4bn (\u00a32.98bn), despite the fact that the mine won\u2019t be commercially operational until at least 2028.",
      "If fully cleared by regulators, NexGen\u2019s project alone could push Canada to become the world\u2019s largest producer of uranium over the coming decade, knocking Kazakhstan out of the number one spot.",
      "Other companies have also rushed to Saskatchewan to capitalise on the boom, starting their own exploration projects in the region, while existing players re-opened dormant mines.",
      "With its rich resources, Canada\u2019s mining companies see the country playing a major role in the future of nuclear energy, meeting a demand for uranium that is poised to rise after nearly two dozen countries committed in COP28 climate conference to tripling their nuclear energy output by 2050.",
      "Nuclear energy is often hailed for its low carbon emissions compared to other sources like natural gas or coal.",
      "The World Nuclear Association estimates that 10% of power generated worldwide comes from nuclear sources, while more than 50% is still generated by gas or coal.",
      "At this year's COP29, the focus has been on ramping up funding for nuclear projects in the wake of a recent UN report indicating that current policies and investments fall short of what is needed to slow global temperature rise.",
      "Canada\u2019s role in supplying the commodity is made more urgent by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, particularly for the US, which had relied heavily on Russian-supplied enriched uranium to fire up its commercial nuclear reactors.",
      "Mr Curyer believes his mine could prove to be \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d to America\u2019s nuclear energy future, as the US is now hunting for alternatives to Russia, including by ramping up exploration on its own soil.",
      "Uranium can be found around the world, though it is heavily present in Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan.",
      "But what makes Canada\u2019s Athabasca Region unique is that its uranium is especially high grade, said Markus Piro, a professor of nuclear engineering at McMaster University.",
      "Canada has set strict rules for the sale of its uranium to other countries, Prof Piro said, and mandates it only be used for nuclear power generation.",
      "The country is also referred to as a \u201ctier-one nuclear nation\u201d, he said, due to its capability to produce nuclear fuel from the mining to the manufacturing stage.",
      "Once mined, uranium is milled to produce what is called calcined yellowcake, and then enriched, either at facilities in Canada or overseas, to create fuel for nuclear reactors.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a one-stop shop here in Canada, not every nation\u2019s like that,\u201d Prof Piro said.",
      "Canada is currently the world\u2019s second largest producer of uranium, accounting for roughly 13% of the total global output, according to the Canadian government. NexGen anticipates that once its mine is operational, it will boost that to 25%.",
      "Meanwhile, Cameco, which has been mining uranium in Saskatchewan since 1988 that supplies 30 nuclear reactors around the world, re-opened two of its mines in late 2022 to increase output.",
      "CEO Tim Gitzel told the BBC that he believes \u201cCanada could be a nuclear superpower around the world\u201d.",
      "But enthusiasm around nuclear energy is not without its critics.",
      "Some environmental groups worry nuclear projects are too costly and come with timelines that do not meet the urgency of the climate crisis.",
      "Data from the UK-based World Nuclear Association shows that 60 nuclear reactors are under construction across 16 countries, most of them in China, and a further 110 are in the planning stages.",
      "Some are expected to come online this year - others won\u2019t be ready until at least the end of the decade.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 100 nuclear plants have been closed in the last two decades around the world, including New York State\u2019s sole nuclear power plant, which was retired in 2021 due to high operating costs and environmental and safety concerns.",
      "Plants were also shuttered in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Quebec, Canada.",
      "And not all of Canada is on board with the country\u2019s uranium industry.",
      "British Columbia sits on its own supply of uranium but has not allowed any nuclear plants or uranium mines to operate in the province since 1980.",
      "Critics have also expressed concern about radioactive waste nuclear reactors leave behind for future generations.",
      "Others fear another Fukushima-scale disaster, where a tsunami disabled three reactors, causing the release of highly radioactive materials and forcing mass evacuations.",
      "\u201cThe risk is not zero, that is for sure\u201d though t can be reduced, said Prof Piro.",
      "\u201cEven though amongst the general public there are mixed feelings about it, the reality is that it has produced very safe, very reliable and affordable electricity worldwide.\u201d",
      "The industry maintains the technology is both promising and viable.",
      "Mr Gitzel of Cameco said the industry has learned from past safety errors.",
      "\u201cAnd the public is buying on,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you that we have in Canada great public support for nuclear power.\u201d",
      "A 2023 Ipsos poll indicates that 55% of Canadians support nuclear energy.",
      "Still, past uranium booms in Canada have turned into dramatic busts.",
      "North of NexGen\u2019s proposed mine stands Uranium City, once home to 2,500 residents in its mid-20th Century heyday. In 1982, a major local mining firm shuttered operations over high costs and a soft market for uranium.",
      "Now, Uranium City\u2019s population is 91 people.",
      "But investors argue that there is a true global burgeoning demand for the commodity that poses a golden opportunity for Canada.",
      "NexGen anticipates that construction on its mine - which is awaiting clearance from Canada\u2019s federal nuclear regulator - will begin early next year.",
      "Mr Gitzel says around 100 other companies are now actively exploring Saskatchewan for deposits.",
      "As to when it will be on the market remains unclear.",
      "Mr Gitzel cautioned that some companies have started explorations in the past that never reached production stage. The timeline to get mining projects approved in Canada can also be lengthy.",

      "The former boss of Camelot, Mr Railton, told sub-postmasters on Wednesday that the Post Office \"urgently\" needed \"a fresh start\", with a \"new deal\" putting them at the \"heart of this business\".",
      "It has become increasingly reliant on government subsidy and the retail side of its business, reporting pre-tax losses of \u00a381m in 2022-23.",
      "Today, nearly half of its branches are not profitable or only make a small profit from the Post Office element of the business.",
      "It has faced a \"tough\" time in the last 10 years, Mr Railton acknowledged, which meant that sub-postmasters' remuneration has \"lagged behind\".",
      "He said that the plans set out would provide more than \u00a3250m each year to postmasters by 2030, although this would be subject to government funding.",
      "It also aims to improve branches\u2019 banking offer for customers, and will see a \"lower-risk, better value\" IT system introduced for sub-postmasters.",
      "On Monday, the European boss of Fujitsu, the company which developed the faulty Horizon system, admitted he \"does not know\" if the software is currently reliable.",
      "A survey in September revealed almost seven in 10 sub-postmasters have experienced an \"unexplained discrepancy\" on the Horizon system since January 2020.",
      "'Learned no lessons'",
      "Dave Ward, general secretary of the CWU, said it appeared the Post Office had \"learned no lessons from its chaotic and uncoordinated mistakes from the past\".",
      "\"CWU members are victims of the Horizon scandal \u2013 and for them to now fear for their jobs ahead of Christmas is yet another cruel attack,\" he added.",
      "Earlier this month, Post Office minister Gareth Thomas said the organisation was at a critical juncture and the government had already commissioned its own review into what the Post Office should look like in the future.",
      "As part of the overhaul, hundreds of jobs at its head office are also under threat, with Mr Railton saying it was necessary to \"right-size\" the organisation.",
      "Mr Railton said that conversations with the government on the proposed changes, and funding required, had been \"positive\" so far.",
      "Speaking in front of the inquiry on Monday, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds hinted that Post Office branches could fill a gap left on British High Streets by sweeping bank closures.",
      "But with the rise of mobile banking and contactless payments, there is a question mark over whether this would be a sustainable strategy.",
      "Fujitsu boss 'does not know' if Horizon is reliable",
      "New Lord vows to fight for Post Office justice",
      "Separately, ministers have been exploring plans to hand ownership of the Post Office to sub-postmasters.",
      "Reynolds told the inquiry there was still \"tremendous affection\" for the Post Office among the UK public and a \"desire for it to have a strong future.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: \"The government is in active discussion with Nigel Railton on his plans to put postmasters at the centre of the organisation and strengthen the post office network for its long-term future.\"",

      "Inflation in the US picked up last month, as progress toward stabilising prices appeared to stall.",
      "Consumer prices rose 2.6% over the 12 months to October, driven by higher housing and food costs, the Labor Department said.",
      "That marked a slight uptick from 2.4% the month before.",

      "The Federal Reserve wants to see inflation, the rate at which prices rise, fall back to about 2%.",
      "It started cutting interest rates in September, noting the significant improvement since June 2022, when prices were surging at a rate of more than 9%.",
      "But analysts are warning of new risks, as President-elect Donald Trump promises a mix of tax cuts, tariffs and migrant deportations that some say are likely to keep pressure mounting on businesses and consumers.",

      "Price increases in recent years have caused significant public concern, helping Trump to victory in the presidential election this month.",
      "Over the last 12 months, housing costs, including rents, rose 4.9%, the Labor Department said. In part because housing is heavily weighted in the US price index, that accounted for the majority of inflation over the past year.",

      "Train operators have a number of tools to deal with passengers who have underpaid or not bought a ticket at all.",
      "It is understood the government is not seeking to strip firms of powers to prosecute criminals who deliberately avoid paying. But there has been growing concern over action taken against people who misunderstand the ticketing system.",
      "The independent review the government has announced will examine how clear ticketing terms and conditions are and how they are communicated to train users.",
      "The most serious sanction is prosecution for fare evasion, which can land passengers with a magistrates court appearance and a serious criminal record.",
      "A key question for the Office for Rail and Road will be when prosecution is the right step.",

      "Mr Williamson faced prosecution for paying \u00a31.90 less than he should have done despite admitting his error and offering to pay a fine or a new fare, prompting widespread criticism of Northern.",

      "Northern responded by withdrawing all live prosecutions against those pursued in similar circumstances and promised to review historical cases.",
      "The terms and conditions of Mr Williamson's railcard specified the discount was only valid for on-peak services where the original fare was \u00a312 or more. However, despite the small-print, he was able to buy a ticket that informed him he could travel at \"anytime\".",
      "Stephanie Tobyn, ORR director of strategy, policy and reform, welcomed the review.",
      "\"It is important passengers are treated fairly and dealt with consistently and proportionately when ticketing issues arise, whilst also balancing the legitimate revenue protection interests of operators and taxpayers,\" she added.",

    "story": [
      "Oil giant Shell has won a landmark case in the Dutch courts, overturning an earlier ruling requiring it to cut its carbon emissions by 45%.",
      "The Hague court of appeal said it could not establish that Shell had a \"social standard of care\" to reduce its emissions by 45% or any other amount, even though it agreed the company had an obligation to citizens to limit emissions.",
      "Three years ago, a court in The Hague backed a case by Friends of the Earth and 17,000 Dutch citizens requiring Shell to reduce its CO2 emissions significantly, in line with the Paris climate accords.",
      "The ruling came as climate talks involving some 200 countries got under way in Azerbaijan.",
      "Shell said it was pleased with the court's decision, but Friends of the Earth Netherlands said the ruling was a setback that affected them deeply.",

      "Donald Pols from the group said \"it's a marathon, not a sprint and the race isn't yet over\".",
      "At the time, the 2021 ruling marked the first time a court had ordered a private company to align its workings with the Paris climate agreement, meaning that it was not sufficient for a company simply to comply with the law - it had to comply with global climate policy too.",
      "Under the terms of the Paris Agreement on climate change, nearly 200 nations agreed to keep global temperatures \"well below\" 2C above pre-industrial levels.",
      "The appeals court judge said that companies such as Shell were obliged to contribute to combating climate change based on the human right to protection against dangerous climate change.",
      "However, the court said Shell was already working to reduce its emissions and the court could not establish whether it should make a 45% cut or another percentage, as there was no current accepted agreement in climate science on the required amount.",
      "Shell has argued that it is already taking \"serious steps to reduce emissions\". It complained the original ruling was unfair as it singled out one company for a global issue, and said it was unrealistic to try to hold Shell accountable for its customers' choices.",
      "Shell said if people considered progress was too slow towards cutting emissions then they should lobby governments rather than Shell to change policies and bring about a green transition.",
      "The oil firm says its aim is to reduce the carbon intensity of products it sells by 15-20% by 2030 from a 2016 baseline. Shell also aims to become a \"net zero\" emissions company by 2050.",

    "story": [
      "A legal challenge over the decision to give consent to the UK\u2019s largest untapped oil field is taking place in Edinburgh.",
      "A judicial review brought jointly by the environment groups Greenpeace and Uplift is being heard at the Court of Session.",
      "The campaigners want to stop the development of Rosebank oil field, which is off Shetland, and the Jackdaw gas field, off Aberdeen. But oil companies say the projects are vital.",
      "If the challenge is successful, operators would have to resubmit environmental impact assessments for approval before drilling can begin.",
      "Campaigners calling for the projects to be halted held a protest outside the court on Tuesday morning.",
      "What is the judicial review about?",
      "Consent for drilling in the Rosebank field was granted by the regulator, the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA), in September last year.",
      "Shell\u2019s proposals to develop the Jackdaw field were approved by the NSTA in 2022, after initially being rejected on environmental grounds.",
      "The environment groups say that when consent was granted for the fields, the impact of emissions caused by burning extracted oil and gas was \u201cunlawfully ignored\u201d by regulators.",
      "Uplift accused regulators of \"failing to be transparent\" in granting the consents and said Rosebank would damage marine life in the North Sea.",
      "The UK government said in August that it would not fight any cases over Rosebank and Jackdaw.",
      "It effectively accepted the original decisions were unlawful.",
      "This came after the Supreme Court ruled in June that regulators must consider the total environmental impact of new projects - including the way fossil fuels are used by end consumers.",
      "It is understood that the oil companies will accept that the decisions to give the go-ahead for Rosebank and Jackdaw were unlawful because the emissions they would create were not properly assessed.",
      "They are expected to focus instead on how to move forward with the projects, given that work is already under way.",
      "What do the campaigners say?",
      "Ruth Crawford KC, who is acting for Greenpeace during the case, told the court that the greenhouse gas emissions from Rosebank and Jackdaw would be \u201csizeable and significant\u201d and would have a \u201csubstantial impact\u201d on the environment and human health.",
      "She said the UK government had admitted that it was an \u201cerror of law\u201d to have failed to have taken into account greenhouse gas emissions from the eventual burning of oil and gas extracted from Rosebank and Jackdaw (known as Scope 3 emissions).",
      "Ms Crawford said granting a licence was ultimately a political decision but it must be done only after a lawful consenting process which included an environmental impact assessment taking into account Scope 3 emissions.",
      "She said politicians must not simply consider short-term issues when considering oil and gas projects but also the long-term effect on the climate.",
      "In this case, she argued, they failed to do so (because information about Scope 3 emissions was not available).",
      "To allow these two fields to proceed without a new environmental impact assessment taking into account Scope 3 emissions \u201cwould be to completely ignore that a crucial part of the decision making has not happened and will never happen.\u201d",
      "Greenpeace, she said, was not asking for oil rigs and drilling equipment to be removed. It was only asking that the oil and gas companies involved \u201cdo no further work to get petroleum from the fields.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe work must stop. No more. No less,\u201d she concluded.",
      "Alastair Duncan KC, for Uplift, echoed or endorsed many of the submissions made on behalf of Greenpeace.",
      "He also addressed written submissions made on behalf of oil and gas companies, whose lawyers are expected to address the court later this week.",
      "These, he said, amounted to the companies arguing that they were \u201can innocent third party\u201d who had reasonably relied on what appeared to be a \u201cstable legal landscape\u201d when making multi-million pound investment decisions.",
      "On the contrary, argued Mr Duncan, the legal landscape had been far from stable and Rosebank\u2019s developers Equinor and Ithaca were now \u201cthe beneficiaries of an unlawful decision,\u201d who wanted the court \u201cto allow them to continue to be the beneficiaries of an unlawful decision.\u201d",
      "Mr Duncan went on to outline another objection to the granting of consent for Rosebank.",
      "He argued that, in approving the field, the Oil and Gas Authority (now known as the North Sea Transition Authority) had unlawfully and irrationally failed to give reasons for its decision.",
      "Uplift has a third objection to the decision, claiming that the previous government and the regulator failed to adequately assess the marine impacts of Rosebank.",
      "What do the oil companies say?",
      "Norwegian energy giant Equinor and British firm Ithaca Energy jointly own the Rosebank field.",
      "They have said it would create about 1,600 jobs during its construction and support about 450 UK-based jobs during its lifetime.",
      "Equinor declined to comment while the court challenge was ongoing, but said it was continuing to \"work closely with all relevant parties to progress the project\".",
      "It added: \"It is vital for the UK and will bring benefits in terms of local investment, jobs and energy security.\"",
      "A Shell spokesman said the Jackdaw development had been developed in line with all relevant consents and permits.",
      "He added: \"Jackdaw is a vital project for UK energy security and the project is already well advanced.",
      "\"Stopping the work is a highly complex process, with significant technical and operational issues now that infrastructure is in place and drilling has started in the North Sea.",
      "\"Jackdaw will provide enough fuel to heat 1.4m UK homes as older gas fields reach the end of production.\"",
      "The UK government has previously pledged that oil and gas would play an important role in the economy \"for decades to come\" as the UK transitions to clean energy.",

      "1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin",
      "Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.",
      "They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.",
      "Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.",

      "In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be false lead caused by some mistranslated information.",
      "Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.",
      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",
      "2. Making history with pizza",
      "Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.",

      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",

      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",

      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",
      "It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value.",
      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",
      "Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.",

      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",

      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",

      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",

      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",

      "Fujitsu Europe's boss has admitted he \"does not know\" if the Post Office Horizon IT system at the heart of hundreds of sub-postmasters' wrongful convictions is reliable.",
      "Paul Patterson told the inquiry into the scandal there \"have been bugs errors and defects\" in the accountancy system and it is clear \"that there is a level of unreliability\".",
      "He agreed that this would be an issue for sub-postmasters currently using Horizon.",
      "In his second appearance in front of the inquiry, Patterson also admitted that he did not know whether Fujitsu had done an independent report into the software system.",
      "Though he added that he would welcome a third-party investigation.",
      "Between 1999 and 2015, hundreds of sub-postmasters and postmistresses were wrongly prosecuted after Horizon made it look like money was missing from their branches.",
      "Fujitsu's Horizon contract is up for renewal early next year and could be extended for a further five years.",
      "Patterson said he was \"very worried\" about what might happen if this happens because of how unreliable Horizon is.",
      "\"In my experience... if you don\u2019t keep [IT systems] upgraded, I cannot determine what will or will not happen, which is part of my nervousness of it being extended,\" he said.",
      "Monday marked the start of the final week of evidence at the inquiry, more than two and a half years since it started hearing evidence in public.",
      "Mr Patterson said Fujitsu was committed to paying out compensation to the victims of the scandal, calling it a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d, but said the firm was waiting until the end of the inquiry before actually doing so.",
      "In a heated exchange with Sam Stein KC, who represented some of the victims, Mr Patterson was pushed on why this was.",
      "\u201cYou already accept that there is a need for Fujitsu to put its money where its mouth is,\u201d said Mr Stein.",
      "Mr Patterson said the company wanted to hear all the evidence before going ahead. \u201cThese are complex matters and we need to understand all the components,\u201d he said.",
      "Earlier in the day, Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch gave evidence - as the former business secretary, the government-owned Post Office came under her remit.",
      "Mr Bates v The Post Office",
      "She said that the airing of the TV drama into the Post Office scandal \"brought the urgency\" to speed up compensation pay outs for sub-postmasters.",
      "The government needed to be \"seen to be doing the right thing\", said Badenoch.",
      "She accepted at the inquiry into the scandal that it was \"extremely disappointing\" that it took the ITV drama to escalate the issue.",
      "But she said her row with the Treasury over the time it was taking to issue compensation last August was not just a case of her \"posturing\".",
      "Badenoch said Mr Bates vs The Post Office, which was broadcast in January, raised awareness of the issue, turning compensation from \"a value for money perception to a public perception question\".",
      "She insisted work was being done on the issue by the previous government, but admitted it was \"too slow\" and criticised the whole \"government machine\" for slowing down compensation.",
      "The inquiry heard how Badenoch told the Treasury she wanted to give \u00a3100,000 \"flat offers\" to all sub-postmasters with a claim, with the inquiry to the counsel Jason Beer KC describing her mention of \"ministerial direction\" as a threat.",
      "He said this could be seen as \"soft power\" or \"posturing\".",
      "But Badenoch denied the claim, saying: \"It was signalling the direction I wanted the department to take to make it very clear.\"",
      "She said she believed speed should triumph over accuracy, and admitted that this might not have represented value for money from a taxpayer point of view.",
      "'Vanilla updates'",
      "Badenoch was also questioned over her sacking of former Post Office chairman Henry Staunton.",
      "She said she was not aware of how serious concerns were about him because of \"vanilla updates\" from civil servants.",
      "Her evidence statement provided her reasons for Staunton's dismissal, which included the former chairman attempting to shut down a whistleblowing probe into his conduct, behaving in an aggressive, intimidating and disrespectful manner, and having a poor understanding of Post Office's work.",
      "Staunton has previously defended himself after a report found he used derogatory language during a meeting about recruiting a board member. He has also refuted Badenoch's claim that he was under a \"formal investigation\" for \"serious matters such as bullying\".",
      "'Nothing should be off the table'",
      "Earlier on Monday, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said ownership of the Post Office could be handed over to its thousands of sub-postmasters across the UK.",
      "\"Nothing should be off the table for the future of the Post Office,\" he said, adding that the organisation's future will be set out in the first half of next year.",
      "He said Post Office's corporate culture was \"at the root of this scandal\" and that some sub-postmasters had \"lost all faith in the justice system\" because of it.",

      "Motorists who bought a car on finance could share in billions of pounds in compensation following a landmark test case.",
      "When Marcus Johnson, 34, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, bought his first car - a Suzuki Swift - in 2017, he was not informed the car dealership was being paid 25% commission, which was added on to what he had to pay back.",
      "In a landmark case with two other claimants, the Court of Appeal ruled in October that the finance company should pay the hidden commission plus interest back to Mr Johnson, and he is now due to receive just over \u00a33,200.",

      "Mr Johnson said he was \u201cfurious\u201d when he found out what had happened, adding: \u201cI paid \u00a31,650 for what I can only describe as showing me around the showroom for 10 minutes and then printing off a bit of paper.",
      "\"I signed a few documents and then drove away in the car.\"",
      "He said he had no option but to use finance when he bought the car, describing it as \"heartbreaking\" to find out so much extra money had been taken.",
      "\"Someone in my situation at that time, not being able to buy that kind of age car with cash, you would use finance,\" he added.",
      "\"And for companies to be able to be allowed to charge these ridiculous amounts of commission without disclosing it, without me being made aware of it at all, myself and thousands of other people.\"",
      "Mr Johnson bought the car from dealership Trade Centre Wales for \u00a34,600, and the company arranged finance with Cardiff-based MotoNovo Finance.",
      "He was not informed that the dealership was receiving commission of \u00a31,650, which amounted to about 25% of the total he borrowed.",
      "The car finance industry is now setting aside huge amounts of money to settle similar possible claims in the future.",
      "How can you claim?",
      "It is important to log your claim as soon as possible, according to Martin Lewis of Money Saving Expert.",
      "He said claimants did not necessarily need to go via a claims management firm, which would take a cut of any payout.",
      "Mr Lewis advised people first determine whether their finance agreements included a discretionary commission arrangement and, if it did, lodge a time-stamped complaint to the company.",
      "This was echoed by Rip-Off Britain's legal expert Gary Rycroft, who told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast the legal precedent set by the Court of Appeal ruling meant \"secret commission\" was deemed unlawful.",
      "He said it was important to check your contracts and ask your car finance company whether it had been disclosed if unsure.",
      "He said non-disclosure made for a clearer case but arrangements \"buried in the small print\" could still be worth making a claim against.",
      "But he added that, while getting your ducks in a row early was a good thing, there was a good chance lenders would be lodging a Supreme Court appeal, so claims may not be able to be acted upon for some time yet.",
      "Mr Johnson sold his Suzuki Swift in 2020, but after three years of regular payments, he still owed \u00a33,500 which he assumed then was due to the interest on the loan for the car.",
      "\u201cWith paying off the agreement for three years, I had only scratched the surface,\" he said.",
      "Dealerships were not acting outside of the rules and regulations of the industry by taking this sort of commission at that time, but they had a duty to inform their clients.",
      "The court of appeal said \u201cburying such a statement in the small print which the lender knows the borrower is highly unlikely to read will not suffice\u201d.",
      "There have been changes in the rules governing commission since 2021, when the Financial Conduct Authority banned discretionary commission arrangements.",
      "Kevin Durkin, from HD Law, who represented Mr Johnson in the test case, said: \u201cAs a financial reward for them being chosen, FirstRand Bank paid Trade Centre Wales a commission which Marcus knew nothing about.",
      "\"There was only a vague reference to this arrangement in the paperwork which the court of appeal found was buried.",
      "\"As such it meant that Marcus paid more than he necessarily needed to.\u201d",
      "He added it was far from being an isolated case, with many car dealerships and finance companies having operated in this way.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s completely widespread,\" he added.",
      "\"Almost all cars that are purchased on finance through a dealer or credit broker are sold in this way.",
      "\"I\u2019ve yet to see any terms and conditions in a case involving my clients where the terms and conditions reference is either absolute in terms of \u2018we will receive a commission\u2019 or alternatively is made prominent in the paperwork that is being signed.\u201d",
      "Mr Johnson said he would never use a finance agreement again, but was delighted when the Court of Appeal found in his favour.",
      "\u201cIt was a big moment of relief and excitement and obviously  happiness all at the same time \u2013 especially with how tough things are at the moment,\" he said.",
      "He said he hoped others would also get money back, adding: \u201cI\u2019m so happy that my case and the decision that was made could potentially help thousands of other families, to me that\u2019s worth more than the money that I reclaimed in a way.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 06:00:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Technology differences mean meters in northern England and Scotland may not work properly, energy firm body admits.",
    "story": [
      "The way smart energy meters work in northern England and Scotland is causing issues for customers, BBC Panorama has been told.",
      "The body that represents energy companies, Energy UK, has confirmed for the first time there is a regional divide - because of the way meters send usage data back to suppliers.",
      "The technology used in the north of Great Britain can affect whether smart meters work properly - and could leave customers having to submit manual readings and receiving estimated bills.",
      "The issues have also been confirmed by meter engineers who have spoken to the BBC.",
      "In the Midlands, Wales and southern England, all meters use cellular technology - similar to mobile phones - to send data to energy providers.",
      "But in northern England and Scotland, meters instead rely on longer-range radio frequencies.",
      "It is a legal requirement, the government says, for suppliers to make sure smart meters are working and it expects suppliers to \u201cresolve all issues at a much faster pace\u201d.",
      "The mass roll-out of smart meters began 12 years ago, with the goal of helping people save money on their bills, while lowering carbon emissions as part of the government\u2019s net zero plan.",
      "By showing how much energy households are using, and how much it is costing, meters are intended to encourage people to use more energy at times of day when it is cheaper - because there is a surplus while most are in bed and factories are closed.",
      "As more energy comes from renewable sources, smart meters will form a vital part of a \u201csmart grid\u201d, allowing consumers\u2019 demand for energy to match the available supply, minute-by-minute.",
      "The cost of installing smart meters across Great Britain is estimated to be \u00a313.5bn, according to the government. There are 36 million such devices in England, Wales and Scotland - but recent government figures show 3.5 million of them are not working properly.",
      "As a rule of thumb, smart meters in the northern region designed to connect to the radio signal have two small indicator lights on the communications hub, fitted to the top of the smart meter. The hubs fitted to smart meters in central and southern regions, receiving the cellular signal, usually have five of these indicator lights.",
      "Northern Ireland\u2019s energy market is separate with its own rules and regulator - and a consultation on a proposed smart meter roll-out is taking place.",
      "Hartesh Battu, a doctor from Glasgow, has had six different smart meters, fitted by two energy suppliers, none of which have worked. \u201cI just think it\u2019s astonishingly bad in terms of the technology,\u201d he told us. \u201cI do feel like, \u2018how could billions of pounds be spent on something so bad?\u2019\u201d",
      "He told the BBC he had wanted a smart meter so he could save energy on his bills and take advantage of a night-time rate that would make it cheaper to charge his electric car.",
      "His current energy supplier, Octopus Energy, told him the problem was down to signal issues in the area and may be because he lived \u201cfar up north\u201d - reasoning that left him feeling deeply unimpressed. \u201cI just thought that was a bit bonkers because I live in Glasgow, I\u2019m hardly up in Shetland, I\u2019m not rural at all.\u201d",
      "When the mass roll-out started, the decision to use radio signals across northern England and Scotland - rather than the mobile technology further south - was because it was thought the signals would be able to travel far across the hills and mountains, reaching more rural communities more easily.",
      "But Energy UK admits there are problems regarding how the radio signals transmit. \u201cThere are issues in the north,\u201d chief executive Dhara Vyas told us.",
      "She said there were \u201clive conversations\u201d within the industry about increasing the network range in the north of England and Scotland.",
      "This technological divide has been experienced by smart meter engineers who have spoken anonymously to Panorama.",
      "One engineer, \u201cAhmed\u201d told us there were more problems in northern England and Scotland on average, adding that the technology further south was more up to date.",
      "\u201cYou can end up going to someone\u2019s house at the bottom of a mountain in the north and the radio frequency can\u2019t get through. But there could be a good 3G signal nearby and that could get through - the customer doesn\u2019t know that,\u201d he said.",
      "Another engineer, \u201cSteve\u201d working for a major energy supplier in Merseyside, who has experience of installing meters in homes on both sides of the regional divide, told us it was \u201cfar easier to complete a successful installation\u201d in the south and Midlands where he could use the cellular network.",
      "The truth about smart meters",
      "Smart meters are supposed to make paying our energy bills easier and cheaper. But is that the whole story?",
      "Watch now on BBC iPlayer - or on BBC One on Monday 11 November at 20:00 (20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland).",
      "Energy suppliers do not have direct control over the communication network - in both the north and south. Instead it is run by an organisation known as the Data Communications Company (DCC) and is operated by outsourcing company, Capita.",
      "Panorama contacted Dr Battu\u2019s energy supplier, Octopus Energy, about the problems he was having with his meter. The company said the situation was \u201cfrustrating\u201d because government regulations dictated it must use the radio-wave technology to provide a signal to Dr Battu\u2019s meter - and that it was not permitted to access the local 3G signal instead.",
      "However, in what they described as \u201ca highly unusual move\u201d, Octopus told us that it had in fact decided to break the rules and fix his meter by connecting it to the mobile network. It added that \u201cregulation has not moved with technology\u201d.",
      "Capita told the BBC it advised energy suppliers against using alternative technological solutions, because that would mean there was no contractual or consumer protection for the meter user to ensure service was maintained or problems addressed.",
      "It said the network it runs provides 99.3% coverage across Great Britain, adding that it was \u201cfully committed to resolving connection issues\u201d.",
      "In a statement it added: \u201cThe DCC is actively working with government to provide a future-proof 4G technology solution for the whole of Britain.\u201d",
      "Most energy users pay a little bit extra on their bills towards the cost of installing and fixing smart meters. That is supposed to be offset by the savings they could make and the environmental benefits.",
      "Energy suppliers are primarily responsible for funding the communications infrastructure - and, according to the National Audit Office, some or all of these costs are passed on to consumers in bills.",
      "The latest figures show that nine in 10 smart meters are working fine. But a recent survey by Citizens\u2019 Advice suggests one in five households have had to regularly send manual meter readings because their smart meters haven\u2019t worked properly.",
      "The government told Panorama that \u201cwhile over 90% of smart meters are operating normally\u2019\u2019 the number not working properly was \u201cstill too high\u201d and, as a result, \u201cmany households are missing out on cheaper, flexible tariffs\u201d.",
      "It also said that a recent customer experience survey by Ofgem \u201cfound no statistically significant differences\u201d in the proportion of customers reporting that their meter was not sending readings to their suppliers for areas in, or predominantly\u202fin, the north.",
      "Most experts agree smart meters can help to deliver lower bills and lower carbon emissions. But if the tech problems continue, that could put people off having them and undermine the government\u2019s goal of getting them into every home."

      "Janine Maclean, from the Environment Agency, said: \u201cThese cases are further examples of a water company breaking the law and causing serious pollution.\"",
      "It is the second-highest fine in the company's history. A Wessex Water spokesperson apologised and said the incidents \u201cshouldn't have happened\".",
      "Clackers Brook is a small river in Wiltshire. It rises near Bromham and runs just five miles into Melksham, where it joins the River Avon.",
      "But in that first five miles, it passes the Wessex Water sewage pumping station at Bowerhill Lodge.",
      "In April 2018 the company allowed storm water with untreated sewage to flow into the river for 54 hours.",
      "Later the same year, there was a mechanical and electrical failure which led to more sewage flowing into Clackers Brook.",
      "The Environment Agency found that 2,100 fish died, including eels and lampreys  both endangered and protected species.",
      "Investigators reported that all fish within 1km of the spill were killed.",
      "Senior officer Janine Maclean said it was \"very sad the pollutions had such serious impacts - killing fish and other aquatic life\".",
      "The agency took Wessex Water to court for breaching their licence, and the company admitted the offences.",
      "Company was 'negligent'",
      "Meanwhile in North Somerset, near Weston-super-Mare, another sewage pipe burst in August 2018. Again, untreated effluent polluted the rivers and the local marsh rhyne drainage system.",
      "This led to more fish dying, including spined stickleback and eels.",
      "The sewage pipe in question was a so-called \"rising main\", a pipe through which sewage is pumped under pressure.",
      "The rising main had already been identified by Wessex Water prior to the incident, as a critical one that needed to be monitored, but the monitoring was not put in place until after the incident.",
      "District Judge Joanna Dickens, sitting at Swindon Magistrates Court, ruled the company was negligent, because \"of the failure to install monitoring equipment at an earlier time\".",
      "The Environment Agency said that Wessex Water's rising mains are \"ageing\" and account for many of the company's pollution incidents.",
      "Janine Maclean, of the Environment Agency, said: \"We recognise the company is increasing its monitoring of rising mains, but monitoring is still reliant on failure, and we would like to see the company significantly increase the level of investment it makes to proactively replace rising mains before they fail.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 15:45:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Hospitality bosses are calling for changes to what they describe as \"unsustainable\" tax rises.",
    "story": [
      "Top pub and restaurant bosses have warned the chancellor that tax rises in last month's Budget will \"unquestionably\" cause closures and job losses.",
      "In a letter, more than 200 signatories have said the hospitality industry is disproportionately impacted by an \"unsustainable\" hike in the amount employers pay in National Insurance contributions (NICs).",
      "It adds that businesses have \"no capacity to pass the costs onto customers\", which would instead lead to job cuts and closures of smaller firms.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said that her National Insurance changes for businesses will generate \u00a325bn, which would aid funding of public services, such as the NHS.",
      "From April, the rate employers pay in National Insurance will rise from 13.8% to 15%, and the threshold at which they start paying the tax on each employee's salary will be reduced from \u00a39,100 per year to \u00a35,000.",
      "Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the changes had been designed in a way \"that tried to limit the extra cost on small business\".",
      "Signatories of the letter include Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, the bosses of pub firms Fuller's and Stonegate Group, and Premier Inn's owner, Whitbread.",
      "They are supported by a further 209 businesses, together employing tens of thousands of people across the UK.",
      "According to the letter, the cost increases will cause jobs to be \"drastically\" cut and hours to be reduced for workers.",
      "Ms Nicholls told the BBC that firms in the industry facing these \"tough decisions\" may also reconsider investing.",
      "\"We understand that the government has a tough job to do,\" she said, but urged politicians to \"have a rethink\".",
      "Jones said that the government would not reassess the plan, and that many employers would pay the same in NI contributions as they do now, or less.",
      "\"I think the public would recognise that bigger businesses are able to burden some of the contributions that we need to make to the state.",
      "\"Getting the NHS back on its feet so workers who are off sick can get back to work is probably something that we'd say we'd all benefit from,\" he added.",
      "Impact on lower earners",
      "The letter from industry bosses suggests that changes in the NICs threshold are \"regressive in their impact on lower earners and will impact flexible working practices which many older workers and parents rely upon\".",
      "The signatories are calling for the government to consider one of two measures to \"protect businesses who employ low earners\"  to mitigate the impact.",
      "Suggested measures are a new employer NICs band which would apply between \u00a35,000 and \u00a39,100 at a lower rate of 5%, or implementing an exemption for taxpayers working fewer than 20 hours per week.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has calculated that three quarters of the impact of the NI changes will be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",
      "During a select committee hearing on Tuesday, the OBR's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "The changes set out in the Budget are, however, predicted to raise some \u00a325bn a year, making it one of the biggest single tax-raising measures in history.",
      "The chancellor has previously said that she was not immune to \"criticism\" over the move, but has argued that it will put public finances on a \"firm footing\".",
      "The hospitality industry's letter follows on from big British supermarkets such as M&S and Sainsbury's hinting that they may put up prices in a bid to offset higher wage bills.",
      "Sainsbury's chief executive Simon Roberts said on Thursday that the NI changes would cost the business around \u00a3140m - a sum which does not include the increases to minimum wage.",
      "The boss of Wetherspoons also said earlier this week that following the Budget, taxes and business costs were \"expected to increase by approximately \u00a360m\".",
      "Its chairman said that he believed many food and drink businesses planned to pass costs on to customers.",
      "Amid criticism from the hospitality sector, Rachel Reeves is expected to unveil pension reforms this week which are intended to channel money into private businesses and infrastructure.",

      "Mr Duffy lives in a traditional stone-walled detached house in Sheffield. He estimates that he spends \u00a33,100 every year on heating and electricity.",
      "Despite being someone who cares about climate change, and keen to retrofit his property to make it more efficient, there\u2019s a problem.",
      "\u201cThe whole question of how to better insulate the house is a real mystery to me,\u201d says Mr Duffy, a director of sustainability think-tank Citizen Network. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the expertise for that is.\u201d He also adds that he\u2019s also not sure whether he could install solar panels, given that he lives in a conservation area.",
      "Millions of homeowners across the country could be facing the same dilemma.",
      "Around 29 million British homes require retrofitting by 2050, according to the UK Green Building Council, an industry body.",
      "Retrofitting might involve measures such as improving your home\u2019s insulation, upgrading the heating system, or installing energy-generating devices such as solar panels, or even a private wind turbine.",
      "These adjustments can cost thousands of pounds up front, but, if properly executed, they could improve comfort and reduce people\u2019s bills in the long-run.",
      "Plus, increased energy efficiency ought to cut carbon emissions from homes, especially if property owners switch away from gas or oil-fired boilers, for example.",
      "Roughly one fifth of the UK\u2019s total emissions comes from residential buildings.",
      "Amy Peace and her husband live in the northwest of England, near Warrington. The pair both work in sustainability, advising businesses on their path to net zero.",
      "They were keen to improve the quality of their home and apply the principles they promote at work to their own lives \u2013 but they too faced challenges when deciding on how to go about it.",
      "\u201cEven though we\u2019ve got this background, and we\u2019re engineers as well, what we weren\u2019t entirely clear on was where was best to spend the money,\u201d says Mrs Peace.",
      "The couple spoke to multiple consultants, but Mrs Peace found the advice they received was often geared towards meeting Passivhaus standards \u2013 an ultra-energy efficient type of building.",
      "\u201cThere weren\u2019t many in that pragmatic middle space where you are literally saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got this much money, where would we be best putting it?\u2019,\u201d Mrs Peace adds.",
      "Perseverance during the past three years paid off, however, and the couple\u2019s 1930\u2019s detached house now has improved insulation, a heat pump, and an electric car charging point. Solar panels and battery will follow shortly, if all goes to plan.",
      "Conscious of the confusion around approaches to retrofit, some organisations are moving to improve the advice available to homeowners. Among them is Ecofurb.",
      "\u201cWe can model all the different options that are available, suitable for your home and your budget, and identify a package of measures,\u201d says Liz Lain\u00e9, of Parity Projects, a housing data analysis company, which runs Ecofurb.",
      "The firm offers this initial consultation for free, but full plans, with personalised input from a retrofit coordinator, start at \u00a3470. Ecofurb can also oversee any works as they are carried out by contractors to avoid \u201chorror stories\u201d, says Ms Lain\u00e9.",
      "There are many other organisations that offer to help homeowners plan a retrofit.",
      "The work often involves carrying out a heat-loss survey, to spot cold areas that require insulation, and to better understand a property\u2019s heating demand. Experts might also advise on the suitability of solar panels for your home, for example.",
      "There\u2019s the Get a Heat Pump website, launched by the charities Nesta and The MCS Foundation, which explains what heat pumps are and how they might fit into a home renovation plan.",
      "RICS, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, has also just launched a new retrofit standard for its members \u2013 essentially, it encourages surveyors with the appropriate training to offer their services to homeowners planning or undergoing a retrofit.",
      "The RICS website will soon include a range of retrofit advice and a tool to help homeowners find a suitable surveyor in their local area, says Steve Lees, from the RICS retrofit project team.",
      "Improving the energy efficiency of homes is \u201cessential\u201d for decarbonisation, says Gerald Charles, head of housing retrofit at the Centre for Sustainable Energy, but he adds that the current lack of good advice remains a genuine problem.",
      "\u201cThe industry as a whole don\u2019t appreciate the importance of good retrofit advice,\u201d he says.",
      "One entrepreneur who has noticed a knowledge gap in the market is James Major, founder and chief executive of HubbPro, which helps architects plan energy efficient buildings. Architects don\u2019t always have the latest information about how to incorporate energy-saving technologies into their designs, notes Mr Major.",
      "\u201cClean tech isn\u2019t part of what they do or what they should know \u2013 that\u2019s an engineering function,\u201d he says. And yet architects\u2019 clients increasingly ask about such tech when planning a new home or an extension.",
      "Through an initiative called MyHubb, Mr Major is now offering architects detailed reports that estimate the carbon reduction potential and payback period on retrofitted measures - such as heat pump-based heating systems or solar panels, for instance.",
      "He says these reports cost around \u00a31,000, though he adds that this price is not yet finalised.",
      "Mr Duffy says he will keep looking for solutions to his own retrofit conundrum. But he makes another point. So much of the currently available technology and advice is tailored to individual homeowners.",
      "He suggests that neighbourhood-scale schemes, for example to provide solar power to a whole street, might make more sense and could include more people in one go.",

      "Yes, says TikToker Cissy Jones from Manchester.",
      "We\u2019re just over a week into November and the 27-year-old, who is a social media manager at fashion brand PrettyLittleThing but also makes TikToks on her personal account, has already posted a dozen advent calendar videos. Everything from chocolate, to beauty products and wine, and even a Pets At Home calendar for her dog.",
      "\"There\u2019s one - the Harrods 12-day one \u2013 where every product in it is something that I would buy,\" she says. \"So I\u2019m saving money.\"",
      "That idea of saving money is something that brands latch on to with their marketing. A calendar may cost \u00a3250 but it\u2019s actually \"worth \u00a31,000\", they say, if you add up all the individual items.",
      "\"But you do have to want the actual products,\" says Cissy. \"Otherwise, it\u2019s a bit of a waste of money.\"",
      "Retailers can afford to make such seemingly good offers because there\u2019s a lot of margin built into beauty products, analysts say.",
      "And rather than aiming to make a big profit on them, they view advent calendars as a marketing tool to get you to buy more products afterwards.",
      "\"A lot of retailers recognise advent calendars are a great way of getting new products to the consumer and a way to get them to convert,\" says Natalie Berg from NBK Retail.",
      "However, Sarah Johnson from Flourish Retail says that while there are many lovely bespoke calendars out there, \"a lot [of companies] just use advent calendars to shift stock that may not be popular, rather than having to discount it\".",
      "Shoppers warned over luxury advent calendar scams",
      "The size of the items in advent calendars can vary \u2013 with some offering full-sized bottles, some smaller versions, and some a mix of the two.",
      "But smaller sizes may be what people want, says Ms Berg, as it's common to want to try something out before fully committing.",
      "Holly May Arnott agrees. \"They\u2019re a fantastic way to try new and trending products that I might have seen previously on social media,\" she says.",

      "But she says while beauty calendars \"can feel like a bit of an investment, they\u2019re worth it for us\".",
      "With so many products out there, Cissy Jones\u2019s advice is to look for a brand you like and to look for value for money, in terms of the total cost of all the items individually versus the price of the calendar.",
      "However, even if a product may seem like good value for money, for some, spending more than \u00a3200 on an advent calendar is simply a luxury they cannot afford.",
      "As a result, many scam websites have sprung up, trying to take advantage of people looking for a good deal on an expensive item.",
      "Emma Jones and Nihal, who did not want us to use her last name, got in touch with the BBC after falling for fake adverts claiming to sell the Space NK \u00a3250 advent calendar for \u00a328.99. Both women were attracted by the apparent discount, and say they would not pay full price.",

      "But part of the reason beauty advent calendars are so popular is because shoppers still want to treat themselves, says Natalie Berg.",
      "And many are willing to pay full price \u2013 and beyond.",
      "The likes of Space NK, Harrods and Sephora have all sold out of their main calendars already.",
      "The Harrods beauty calendar was priced at \u00a3250 but claimed to include items worth \u00a31,600, while Sephora\u2019s \u00a3199 calendar said it included items worth \u00a31,000.",

      "It might make sense to buy it even at an overinflated price, she says, if the retailer is sold out and you can\u2019t get it anywhere else, especially if you perceive it as still making a saving on the total value of all the items.",
      "This begs the question though of why firms don't just make more.",

    "story": [
      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

      "The film was given a U \"universal\" rating by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) when it was released in 1983.",
      "But it has now been reappraised, with the ratings body ruling that \"the detail and overall intensity\" of violence in the film mean it should be a PG, which stands for parental guidance.",
      "The BBFC's latest annual report said the rating was changed because of \"violence and threat\" in the film, despite this being \"offset by humour and an emphasis on loyalty in adversity\".",
      "The U rating means a film is suitable for all audiences above the age of four.",
      "A PG suggests some content may not be suitable for children, and parents or guardians are advised to show discretion and be present while children are watching.",

      "In its 2023 annual report, the BBFC said: \"This sci-fi adventure sequel concerns rebel heroes who must rescue their friends before facing an intimidating enemy army.",
      "\"As well as laser gun fights, aerial dogfights, and fight scenes which include the occasional use of improvised weapons, a person falls to a presumed but unseen death, a villain tortures a character by repeated electrocution, and a hero severs a villain's hand at the wrist in a scene featuring limited detail.",
      "\"A captor attempts to feed his prisoner to a monster, and there are other scenes of threat involving bombs, hostages and a hero being frozen alive.\"",
      "The film sees Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford, imprisoned in the carbon chamber after he was frozen by Darth Vader in 1980's prequel The Empire Strikes Back, which is classified as PG, to test whether the process will safely capture Jedi Luke Skywalker, played by Mark Hamill.",
      "Return of the Jedi was not the only film reclassified in the latest changes.",
      "Abba - The Movie, released in 1978, was also upgraded from U to PG because of \"mild sex references and language\" in a \"suggestive\" song title and lyrics, discussion of a \"sexual term\", and band members talking about one of them being given the title of \"sexiest bottom\".",
      "The BBFC also noted that the film features \"mild bad language\".",
      "It said the sequences were \"no longer within our standards at U\" despite upholding the initial rating for video and theatrical releases in 1987 and 2008.",
      "Other films to be reclassified were 1947's Black Narcissus, which went from U to PG due to \"mild threat, violence, brief bloody images and discrimination\", and 1995's Higher Learning, which went from 15 to 18 for \"sexual violence\".",
      "In the report, the BBFC also announced plans to strengthen its partnership with Amazon's Prime Video as part of its collaboration with streaming platforms in the UK.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 03:55:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Before Tupac's murder, producer Quincy Jones brought stars together to try to end violence in hip-hop.",
    "story": [
      "Before the east and west coast rap beef of the 1990s boiled over with the murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG, legendary producer Quincy Jones called a secret meeting at which he appealed for an end to the violence.",
      "As hip-hop rose from the streets to the mainstream in the 90s, the rappers and hustlers that broke through had few role models who had trodden that path before them.",
      "There was one man, though, who had been there, and done pretty much everything.",
      "Quincy Jones had been in gangs and had been stabbed at the age of seven in 1930s Chicago, before becoming a major force in American music thanks to his work with legends like Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson.",
      "He was at the heart of revolutions in jazz, swing, soul, funk, disco and pop - but one aspect of his career that got less attention when he died last week at the age of 91 was his place in hip-hop.",
      "Jones was revered in all corners of music, including rap. Unlike most in the old guard and the media, he immediately realised the scene's artistic and cultural importance.",
      "Hip-hop reminded him of the bebop jazz of his youth. \"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "\"Quincy understood it and got it right away,\" says pioneering artist, rapper and presenter Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "Jones worked with leading rappers in the 80s, and in the 90s he recognised risks including a volatile rivalry that had begun to erupt between competing labels and stars.",
      "So he brought artists, executives and elder black American statesmen together for a secret summit in 1995, hoping it would be a turning point.",
      "The east coast was hip-hop's spiritual home. In 1992, Sean Combs - then known as Puffy and later as P Diddy - launched his Bad Boy record label in New York with artists including Notorious BIG, aka Biggie Smalls.",
      "Meanwhile, across America, Los Angeles was coming into its own as the capital of gangsta rap, led by menacing mogul Suge Knight's Death Row Records, which had Dr Dre and Tupac.",
      "In 1994, Tupac was shot and injured during a robbery in the lobby of a studio. He later implied that his former friend Biggie may have known about the attack in advance. Biggie then released the track Who Shot Ya?, which Tupac thought was about him.",
      "The beef continued at the Source magazine awards on 3 August 1995, when Knight goaded Combs and Bad Boy Records from the stage.",
      "Jones, who had his own magazine, Vibe, held his summit three weeks later.",
      "Quincy Jones: From 'street rat' to music mastermind",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "'He changed my life': Stars remember Quincy Jones",
      "The brewing east-west beef wasn't the only reason Jones called it - it was mainly intended to discuss the state of hip-hop and let the new generation hear life and business advice from a group of highly successful black executives.",
      "But rap's negative image and the burgeoning tensions were a big talking point.",
      "\"He knew this was a bubbling issue, and so his idea was to bring together a symposium,\" says Fab 5 Freddy, who was hosting Yo! MTV Raps at the time and was the event's moderator.",
      "Jones told the summit: \"The thing that really provoked me to say it's time to pay attention now is Tupac.\"",
      "Tupac was missing, however - he was in jail for sexual assault at the time. Suge and Dre were there, as were Combs and Biggie.",
      "Jones had already experienced his own beef with Tupac - the rapper criticised the producer in a 1993 edition of Source for marrying white women.",
      "\"We finally hooked up, even though it was tension conditions in the beginning,\" Jones said at the event.",
      "\"We finally talked to each other, and he said nobody had talked to him like that before.",
      "\"And I said, I can't take it any more. Because we can no longer afford to be non-political, and I'm talking to the hip-hop nation now.\"",
      "About 50 influential artists and executives were in the room, including Public Enemy's Chuck D, members of A Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri and Boyz n the Hood film-maker John Singleton.",
      "Jones wrote in his now-out-of-print 2001 autobiography: \"I had been concerned about the potentially volatile diversity of a group who'd never been in the same room together.\"",
      "They were joined by veteran executives Clarence Avant and Ahmet Ertegun, plus Colin Powell, the former national security adviser and head of the US military who would go on to become the first African-American secretary of state.",
      "Powell had presidential ambitions - that was why the summit was held in secret. Jones wanted to save Powell from being associated with the negative publicity that surrounded rap music.",
      "He switched venues at the last minute to throw press off the scent, and confiscated the recordings.",
      "\"Rest assured that my discretion is based on a deep respect for you and a valued friendship,\" Jones wrote to Powell in an unpublished letter held at Indianapolis University Library.",
      "\"I know that we are going to make a difference at this conference. Thanks for the way you handled the situation. Maybe we can turn the battleship an inch or two.\"",
      "Jones later wrote in his book: \"Some of the younger rappers didn't even know who he was. When addressing some of the more confrontational comments from the floor, Powell maintained his South Bronx demeanour and authoritative cool throughout.\"",
      "Fab 5 Freddy remembers one exchange between Powell and Knight. \"There was an encounter where he [Knight] had something to say, and Colin Powell responded.",
      "\"Here you have this guy who was a four-star general talking to Suge Knight, and he pretty much put Suge in his place.\"",
      "Jones finally released a clip of the event for a 2018 Netflix documentary about his life.",
      "\"We've got to seriously talk about what you are going to deal with,\" he is seen telling the assembled attendees.",
      "\"They are not playing, there's real bullets out there, believe me. Maybe literally and figuratively.",
      "\"It's a very emotional thing,\" he added, his voice cracking. \"I want to see you guys live to at least my age.\"",
      "\"Quincy did get emotional,\" Fab 5 Freddy recalls, \"because he sensed what could happen.",
      "\"And the worst, unfortunately, did happen.\"",
      "Who was Tupac Shakur?",
      "Ex-gang leader pleads not guilty to Tupac murder",
      "Diddy accused of 'revenge' rape over Tupac claims",
      "Jones had ended up reconciling with Tupac. After Tupac's 1993 comments, Jones's 17-year-old daughter Rashida - who would go on to star in US sitcom The Office - wrote an irate letter to Source attacking the rapper.",
      "When Tupac bumped into one of Jones's other daughters, Kidada, he apologised, thinking she was Rashida. But Tupac and Kidada hit it off and began a relationship.",
      "\"Though we got off to a rocky start, as I came to know and feel him I saw his enormous potential and sensitivity as an artist and as a human being,\" Quincy Jones wrote.",
      "There have also been claims that Tupac was planning to leave Death Row for Jones's record label.",
      "But in September 1996, a year after the summit, Tupac was shot and killed.",
      "A former gang leader, Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis, was charged with his murder last year. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Then in 1997, Notorious BIG was shot dead outside a party thrown by Jones's record label and magazine. No-one has ever been charged.",
      "Meanwhile, today Knight is in prison for a hit-and-run, while Combs is awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which he denies.",
      "The violence in the 90s \"wasn't necessary\" and was caused by \"wannabes and gang-related troublemakers\" on the edges of the music industry, according to Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "\"Also, the east/west coast beef was mainly ignited by jealousy. It was an ashtray fire fanned into a big deal by media outlets that led to Biggie and Tupac getting killed.\"",
      "Despite his stature, not even Jones could alter the forces of power and pride that were at work and prevent the bloodshed.",
      "Freddy believes some lessons were learned at the summit, however, and that it deserves a place in hip-hop history.",
      "\"It was incredible and electric to be in that room.",
      "\"It was a thrilling moment. And then it became even more legendary because it was never released, so the only people that really knew about it were the people that were there.\""

    "summary": "The singer and actress stars in Emilia P\u00e9rez, a new Netflix musical which has been tipped for awards.",
    "story": [
      "When Emilia P\u00e9rez premiered earlier this year, it became one of the breakout hits of the Cannes Film Festival, where its four lead stars jointly won best actress.",
      "On Wednesday, the Spanish-language musical is released worldwide on Netflix as the film awards race continues to heat up ahead of the Oscars in March.",
      "Selena Gomez, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n and Adriana Paz launched the movie at the London Film Festival last month, where it continued to build its momentum.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez follows a dangerous Mexican Cartel leader (played by Gasc\u00f3n), who asks a high-powered lawyer named Rita (Salda\u00f1a) to help him fake his own death.",
      "But the reason he wants to retire and disappear from the world of crime isn't what you might expect - the drug baron wants to change gender and live a new life as a woman.",
      "The rest of the film focuses on four women, including the newly-transitioned Emilia P\u00e9rez, as they each pursue their own version of happiness in modern-day Mexico.",
      "P\u00e9rez is portrayed by Spanish trans actress Gasc\u00f3n, who has been tipped as a possible best actress contender in the forthcoming awards race.",
      "French director Jacques Audiard came up with the idea for the film after reading a chapter in Boris Razon's 2018 novel \u00c9coute about a drug lord who changes identity.",
      "Audiard went one step further for the film, and made it a story of changing gender.",
      "\"I was less interested in a change of identity to evade competitor drug barons, and more interested in the change of identity for the sake of the person she was and is,\u201d the director tells BBC News. \"I was more interested in the past and what led to that transition.\"",
      "The role required someone very specific \u2013 a trans actress, who was a Spanish speaker, who could also sing and dance.",
      "Recalling the casting process, Gasc\u00f3n explains: \u201cI was contacted when I was in Mexico by a production team, and was told 'We need an actress as crazy as you - you're the only one who can do this role, but you need to learn five songs for tomorrow!'",
      "\u201cAnd I was like 'OK, let's record the whole album and we'll go on tour as soon as you want!\u2019\" she jokes. \u201cBut I did say, \u2018this is going to be difficult, I'm not a singer'. But the team in the film, they worked with me incredibly, they really helped me with all the songs and made it so that we could do the best work possible.\u201d",
      "Asked about Gasc\u00f3n's casting, Audiard adds simply: \u201cWithout her, there would be no film.\u201d",
      "Interestingly, Gasc\u00f3n campaigned to play both the male and female roles \u2013 in other words, the character both before and after transition.",
      "Audiard had originally intended for a different actor to play the male drug lord Manitas, because, the director explains, he was \"uncomfortable asking [Gasc\u00f3n] to revisit something she was moving away from\".",
      "But, Gasc\u00f3n recalled: \u201cI said to Jacques, I want to play this role in the complete arc, because for me it is important to do the full part. It wouldn't be the same film if another actor played [Manitas].\"",
      "That meant using effects and make-up such as a fake beard, so she could play the drug baron in the first section of the musical.",
      "\"This film is this film because the same actress played the complete performance,\" Gasc\u00f3n continues. \"It's that kind of role you have once in your life and I didn't want to lose the opportunity to play this.\u201d",
      "The ongoing debate about whether actors should have lived experience of characters they play is complex, and Gasc\u00f3n herself says: \"I prefer that all actors have the full opportunities. When you chose this career, it's because you want to express another life that's not like your life.",
      "\"But,\" she continues, \"obviously when you are closer to the role of the character, it's better. In this case, I think it's beautiful, because I give all of myself to this role.\"",
      "Gasc\u00f3n has been described as a \"wonderful discovery\" by the Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney, who said she gives \"a magnificent performance\".",
      "\"The warmth, the joyous self-realisation, the complexity and authenticity... that illuminate her characterisation no doubt owe much to the parallels in the Spanish star\u2019s life - in her own words, she was an actor before becoming an actress, a father before becoming a mother.\"",
      "Gomez plays the drug lord's wife, who is kept in the dark about her former lover's new identity, while Paz portrays Emilia's new romantic interest after transitioning.",
      "Reviews of Emilia P\u00e9rez, which is released on Netflix next month, have been generally positive so far.",
      "\"It's a wild, gritty, glitter-soaked ride that defies convention and classification,\" said Entertainment Weekly's Maureen Lee Lenker.",
      "She praised the film's performances, commenting: \"Selena Gomez is a welcome surprise, shedding any remaining hints of her Disney Channel origins in her portrayal of a hard-loving wife of a narco.",
      "\"The film's climax in particular allows Gomez to shine as a dramatic actress in new ways. She conveys heartache and anguish through a tortured physicality that propels her into the unpredictable state of a woman on the verge of something dangerous.\"",
      "Asked by the BBC's Graham Norton if it was comfortable going back to the world of singing and dancing for the musical, Gomez said: \"No, because this was completely different.",
      "\"It was intricate dance moves I never knew my body could do, and it was also me playing a character so if anything I tried to avoid what I was comfortable with.\"",
      "The Telegraph's Tim Robey described the film as \"amazingly confident \u2013 it\u2019s clever, earnest, ridiculous, knowing, forceful and absolutely bonkers\", while Hoai-Tran Bui of Inverse said it was \"an emotionally fulfilling triumph\".",
      "Not all critics were as enthusiastic about the film, however.",
      "\"Emilia P\u00e9rez was originally intended to be an opera, which perhaps partly explains its saccharine sentimentality, repetitive lyrics, and diverging story branches. But that doesn\u2019t excuse its almost random, whiplash-inducing tonal pivots,\" said Slant's Kyle Turner.",
      "However, Lauren Bradshaw of Fangirl Freakout said: \"Emilia P\u00e9rez is a magnificent, genre-bending thrill ride that transcends the typical movie construct, breathing a fresh burst of excitement into the way we think about film.\"",
      "As an actress, Gomez is best known for starring in Only Murders in the Building, but also has a successful singing career with hits including Back To You, Wolves and Love You Like a Love Song.",
      "Her co-star Salda\u00f1a, meanwhile, has starred in a large number of blockbusters in the last two decades, with roles in the Avatar and Guardians of the Galaxy franchises.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Emilia P\u00e9rez could be a big awards player, but Academy voters may see an opportunity to recognise Salda\u00f1a's box office success via this more critically acclaimed work.",
      "Their co-star Adriana Paz is a Mexican actress whose credits include Not Forgotten, Hilda and La Caridad, while Gasc\u00f3n also had a successful acting career before transitioning in 2018.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez has already been selected as France's entry for the best international feature category at the Oscars, which take place in March.",
      "But despite the film's awards traction, Paz tells BBC News: \u201cI never think about that, really. I get into a project because I'm interested in the topic, character, director or actors, you do it because it really matters to you.\u201d",
      "She adds that the attention in recent months is unlike anything she's experienced in her career. \"It's been a lot,\" she says, \"because I've been working in Spain and have a long career in Mexico, and people have a recognition of my work, but not like [it's been] since Cannes.",
      "\"In my country they feel very proud of me, and there was a lot of people that didn't know about my work, and now thanks to Emilia they are getting to know my work... and they see 'we feel so proud as Mexicans that you won this award.'\"",
      "After the success of Emilia Perez, Paz says she would \"love to\" appear in more musicals in future, and loves singing.",
      "But Gasc\u00f3n has a slightly different take. \"I don't like musicals!\" she laughs, adding that she hopes casting directors aren't too enthusiastic about her performance.",
      "\"I don't like to sing, I don't want to be compared to Shakira or something like that, and I don't like dancing, so please don't call me!\"",

      "So, who are the potential star signings that could fill the vacant hot seat to become the show's sixth main presenter in its 60-year history?",
      "Mark Chapman",
      "A familiar face to football fans, Mark 'Chappers' Chapman is considered by many to be a front-runner with his warm presenting style.",
      "He brings a wealth of experience, having regularly stood in to present Match of the Day and fronted its sister programme, Match of the Day 2, for over a decade.",
      "Chapman has also recently begun hosting the BBC's new mid-week Champions League highlights show, secured under a three-year deal with Uefa.",
      "Outside television, the broadcaster presents a number of shows on BBC Radio 5 Live, including its football-orientated Monday Night Club.",
      "Gabby Logan",
      "Gabby Logan is one of the UK's most well-known sports presenters, with 20 years' experience hosting major football coverage across various networks.",
      "After starting her broadcasting career at Sky, she moved to ITV, deputising for Des Lynam on The Premiership, the channel's highlights show launched after they won the rights from the BBC between 2001 and 2004.",
      "Logan later succeeded Lynam to front Champions League coverage on the station, before departing under what she described as a \"cloud\" when her job as a World Cup anchor was given to a male presenter instead.",
      "She swiftly joined the BBC in 2007 and has stood in for Lineker on Match of the Day, alongside covering the biggest sporting events, including the Six Nations, the Olympics, the men's and women's football World Cup and this summer's Euros.",
      "Logan has recently begun hosting live games shown on streaming service Amazon Prime, further boosting her Premier League credentials.",
      "Gary Lineker to leave BBC's Match of the Day",
      "How Gary Lineker went from football sensation to BBC star",
      "Alex Scott",
      "Scott, another regular Match of the Day stand-in, broke through as one of the first mainstream female football pundits after retiring from the game in 2017.",
      "The former England and Arsenal midfielder became the first female analyst to be taken to a men's World Cup by the BBC when Russia hosted the tournament in 2018.",
      "Later that summer, she also debuted as Sky Sports' first woman football pundit.",
      "In 2021, she took over hosting duties for the BBC's Football Focus - replacing the departing Dan Walker on the weekend preview show.",
      "An ever-present broadcaster at men\u2019s and women\u2019s tournaments since, Scott wore a rainbow armband during England\u2019s first match of the Qatar World Cup - showing support for the LGBT community in a country where homosexuality remains illegal.",
      "The recipient of an MBE, she defended her London accent after ex-House of Lords member Digby Jones criticised her pronunciation.",
      "Kate Scott",
      "Following a stint at TNT Sport, Kate Scott has found her career transformed at the helm of CBS' Champions League coverage.",
      "She previously told GQ that the show's success relies on its uninhibited feel, calling it the \"locker room environment translated onto television\" - mirroring the personality-driven tone younger audiences are used to from online sports content.",
      "One of its pundits, Micah Richards (see below), has separately described Scott as the \"glue\" that keeps the controlled chaos of the show together; balancing frolics (such as being teased into revealing her first kiss) with genuine analysis from the panel.",
      "As young audiences increasingly turn their back on terrestrial TV, the BBC is under pressure to adapt - particularly as individual match highlights now appear on YouTube long before Match of the Day's 10:30pm time slot.",
      "There's no doubt the new-age formula has worked for CBS, but it is a far cry from the traditions of Match of the Day. Could it work on the BBC? And would Scott want to risk jeopardising CBS' popular dynamic?",
      "Alan Shearer",
      "Alan Shearer, alongside Lineker, is one of England's all-time great goal-scorers. Despite retiring in 2006, he still holds the Premier League goal record and remains top scorer for Newcastle United.",
      "This pedigree helped him become a mainstay pundit on the BBC and Match of the Day. He also formed a strong trio with Lineker and Richards, first on the BBC's Match of the Day podcast and latterly The Rest is Football - produced independently on Lineker's hugely successful Goalhanger podcast company. These have allowed him to show off more of his personality.",
      "Now almost 20 years into his media career, Shearer is however yet to host a show - could that step up to becoming Match of the day anchor finally be on the horizon?",
      "Micah Richards",
      "The ex-Manchester City and England defender burst onto the footballing scene as a teenager, but, after an on-pitch career curtailed by a knee injury, Richards has blossomed as the ever-animated pundit with a mega-watt personality to boot.",
      "He embodies the modern take on the role, engaging viewers not only with analysis but also fun-loving camaraderie shared between analysts and presenter.",
      "His media career blossomed as a jovial foil to the tough-talking, former Manchester United captain Roy Keane on Sky Sports' Super Sunday.",
      "Similar roles have followed on Match of the Day and for CBS' Champions League coverage - where humorous off-script moments between presenter Abdo, Richards himself and Premier League legends Jamie Carragher and Thierry Henry regularly trend on social media.",
      "Asking Richards to make the step up to presenting duties on a show as prestigious as Match of the Day would represent a risk from bosses, but certainly mark a fresh start and shift in tone.",
      "He also has the backing of Lineker, who, when discussing the speculation over his future on The Rest is Football, told Richards: \"I'd love to see you take over. I think you'd be brilliant in the chair.\"",
      "Colin Murray",
      "Beginning his career in music as a fun-loving, noughties upstart on BBC Radio 1, Colin Murray soon moved into sport broadcasting.",
      "The Northern Irishman balanced hosting BBC Radio 5 Live's raucous sport comedy panel show Fighting Talk with anchoring European football on Channel 5, before moving to precede Mark Chapman in the hot seat on Match of the Day 2.",
      "But Murray chose to leave that role in 2013, as he had an offer to join TalkSport radio. He has continued to work at the BBC however, presenting  various shows on 5 Live, along with becoming host of Channel 4's long-running word show, Countdown.",
      "Murray is certainly a tried, tested and trusted football anchor with appeal spanning all age groups.",
      "Dan Walker",
      "Prior to quitting the BBC for Channel 5 in 2022, Dan Walker shared his high-profile  BBC Breakfast presenting role with 12 years as the host of Football Focus.",
      "Walker would offer bosses a clean cut image and a safe pair of hands were he to take the role, having previously also covered Olympics and football World Cups for the BBC. He has also recently covered games for Amazon Prime.",
      "But questions remain over Walker's own interest - he is on a bumper contract at Channel 5 and has persistently batted away suggestions of a return to the BBC.",
      "Laura Woods",
      "Laura Woods made her name on TalkSport, receiving plaudits for her relatable style as a host and interviewer.",
      "She has since stepped up to become lead presenter for TNT Sports' Champions League coverage, replacing Jake Humphrey when the channel rebranded from BT Sport last year.",
      "Woods also presents football on Amazon Prime and ITV - joining the latter for coverage of this summer's Euros.",
      "Earlier this summer she spoke of receiving \"numerous death threats\" online after commenting on an article questioning the eligibility of Olympic champion boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting.",
      "Woods fits the mould of Scott and Richards in bringing a more personality-led style to her broadcasting.",
      "Jake Humphrey",
      "Humphrey is a vastly experienced sports broadcaster, with a catalogue of BBC experience to draw upon prior to his later career exploits.",
      "After an early career on BBC children's TV, by 2006 he had started working with BBC Sport, presenting Formula 1, Football Focus, Final Score and becoming the youngest ever host in Match of the Day's history.",
      "Since stepping back from BT Sport, Humphrey has focused on his successful High-Performance podcast, exploring the lives of high-achieving individuals. However, Humphrey remains a fan of Match of the Day, previously telling The Express he would \"never say never\" to hosting the \"legendary show\".",
      "Kelly Cates",
      "An experienced anchor across radio and TV, football is Cates' life-blood, quite literally - she is the daughter of Liverpool and Scotland legend Kenny Dalglish.",
      "The broadcaster has hosted BBC Radio 5 Live's 606 football phone-in and, more recently, the station's Football Daily podcast, in amongst numerous other roles at major tournaments.",
      "But she is best-known in front of the camera as part of the presenting roster for Sky Sports' Premier League coverage - including its flagship Super Sunday programme.",
      "Cates, like Logan, brings both pedigree and gender diversity - but it remains to be seen if she could be tempted away from Sky.",
      "Correction 12 November 2024: An earlier version of this article incorrectly suggested that Colin Murray left the BBC over a controversy on Fighting Talk. It has been amended to make clear he left to take a presenting job at Talk Sport Radio."

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 00:17:43 GMT",
    "summary": "The South Korean hit drama returns for a second season in December.",
    "story": [
      "When I ask the creator of the hit Korean drama Squid Game about reports that he was so stressed while shooting the first series he lost six teeth, he quickly corrects me. \u201cIt was eight or nine,\u201d he laughs.",
      "Hwang Dong-hyuk is speaking to me on set as he films the second series of his dystopian Netflix thriller, which sees hundreds of debt-laden contestants fight it out for a whopping cash prize, by playing a string of life-or-death children\u2019s games.",
      "But another series was not always on the cards. At one point, he swore against making one.",
      "Given the stress it has caused him, I ask what changed his mind.",
      "\u201cMoney,\u201d he answers, without hesitation.",
      "\u201cEven though the first series was such a huge global success, honestly I didn\u2019t make much,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSo doing the second series will help compensate me for the success of the first one too.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t fully finish the story,\u201d he adds.",
      "The first series was Netflix\u2019s most successful show to date, thrusting South Korea and its home-grown television dramas into the spotlight. Its dark commentary on wealth inequality touched a nerve with audiences around the globe.",
      "But having killed off almost every character, Hwang has had to start from scratch, with a new cast and set of games, and this time audience expectations are sky high.",
      "\u201cThe stress I feel now is much greater,\u201d he says.",
      "Three years after the first series aired, Hwang is even more pessimistic about the state of the world.",
      "He points to current wars, climate change and a widening global wealth gap. Conflicts are no longer confined between the rich and poor, they are playing out intensely between different generations, genders and political camps, he says.",
      "\u201cNew lines are being drawn. We\u2019re in an era of us vs them. Who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong?\u201d",
      "As I toured the show\u2019s playful set, with its distinctive brightly-coloured staircase, I picked up a few clues as to how the director\u2019s despair will be reflected this time around.",
      "In this series, the previous winner, Gi-hun, re-enters the game on a quest to bring it down and save the latest round of contestants.",
      "According to Lee Jung-jae, who plays the leading character, he is \"more desperate and determined\u201d than before.",
      "The floor of the dormitory, where the contestants sleep at night, has been divided in two.",
      "One half is branded with a giant red neon X symbol, the other with a blue circle.",
      "Now, after every game, the players must pick a side, depending on whether they want to end the contest early and survive, or keep playing, in the knowledge all but one of them will die. The majority decision rules.",
      "This, I am told, will lead to more factionalism and fights.",
      "It is part of director Hwang\u2019s plan to expose the dangers of living in an increasingly tribal world. Forcing people to pick sides, he believes, is fuelling conflict.",
      "For all those who were captivated by the shocking storytelling of Squid Game, there were others who found it gratuitously violent and difficult to watch.",
      "But it is clear from talking to Hwang, that the violence is fully thought out. He is a man who thinks and cares deeply about the world and is motivated by a mounting unease.",
      "\u201cWhen making this series, I constantly asked myself \u2018do we humans have what it takes to steer the world off this downhill path?\u2019. Honestly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says.",
      "While viewers of the second series might not get the answers to these big life questions, they can at least be comforted that some plot holes will be filled in \u2013 like why the game exists, and what is motivating the masked Front Man running it.",
      "\u201cPeople will see more of the Front Man\u2019s past, his story and his emotions,\u201d reveals the actor Lee Byung-hun, who plays the mysterious role.",
      "\u201cI don't think this will make viewers warm to him, but it may help them better understand his choices.\u201d",
      "As one of South Korea\u2019s most famous actors, Lee admits that having his face and eyes covered and his voice distorted throughout the first series, was \u201ca little bit dissatisfying\u201d.",
      "This series he has relished having scenes without a mask, in which he can fully express himself \u2013 a chance he nearly did not get.",
      "Hwang tried for 10 years to get Squid Game made, taking out large loans to support his family, before Netflix swooped in.",
      "They paid him a modest upfront amount, leaving him unable to cash in on the whopping \u00a3650m it is estimated to have made the platform.",
      "This explains the love-hate relationship South Korea\u2019s film and television creators currently have with international streaming platforms.",
      "Over the past few years, Netflix has stormed the Korean market with billions of dollars of investment, bringing the industry global recognition and love, but leaving creators feeling short-changed.",
      "They accuse the platform of forcing them to relinquish their copyright when they sign contracts \u2013 and with it, their claim to profit.",
      "This is a worldwide problem.",
      "In the past, creators could rely on getting a cut of box office sales or TV re-runs, but this model has not been adopted by streaming giants.",
      "The issue is compounded in South Korea, creators say, due to its outdated copyright law, which does not protect them.",
      "This summer, actors, writers, directors and producers teamed up to form a collective, to fight the system together.",
      "\u201cIn Korea, being a movie director is just a job title, it\u2019s not a way to earn a living,\u201d the vice-president of the Korean Film Directors Guild, Oh Ki-hwan, tells the audience at an event in Seoul.",
      "Some of his director friends, he says, work part-time in warehouses and as taxi drivers.",
      "Park Hae-young is a writer at the event. When Netflix bought her show, 'My Liberation Notes', it became a global hit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been writing my whole life. So, to get global recognition when competing with creators from across the world, has been a joyful experience,\u201d she tells me.",
      "But Park says the current streaming model has left her reluctant to \u201cpour her all\u201d into her next series.",
      "\u201cUsually, I\u2019ll spend four or five years making a drama in the belief that, if it's successful, it could somewhat secure my future, that I'll get my fair share of compensation. Without that, what's the point of working so hard?\u201d",
      "She and other creators are pushing the South Korean government to change its copyright law to force production companies to share their profits.",
      "In a statement, the South Korean government told the BBC that while it recognised the compensation system needed to change, it was up to the industry to resolve the issue. A spokesperson for Netflix told us it offers \u201ccompetitive\u201d compensation, and guarantees creators \u201csolid compensation, regardless of the success or failure of their shows\u201d.",
      "Squid Game\u2019s Hwang hopes his candor over his own pay struggles will initiate that change.",
      "He has certainly sparked the fair pay conversation, and this second series will surely give the industry another bump.",
      "But when we catch up after filming has wrapped, he tells me his teeth are aching again.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen my dentist yet, but I\u2019ll probably have to pull out a few more very soon.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:05:39 GMT",
    "summary": "Everything we learned on the red carpet and behind the scenes of the MTV Europe Music Awards.",
    "story": [
      "The MTV Awards came to Manchester for the first time in their 30-year history on Sunday night, but somehow didn't feel very Mancunian.",
      "There was no sign of Take That or Aitch, or Liam Gallagher - even though he won best rock star.",
      "Organisers made a few subtle nods to the city: The stage was framed in the black and yellow stripes of Factory Records, and New Order's Blue Monday pumped through the speakers every time nominees were announced.",
      "But the show took a more global perspective, highlighting acts from Mexico, South Korea, South Africa and America - including a predictable victory for Taylor Swift in the night's two biggest categories, best artist and video of the year.",
      "She only appeared by video, choosing instead to spend the night watching her boyfriend, American Football player Travis Kelce, lead the Kansas City Chiefs to victory against the Denver Broncos.",
      "But there were plenty of other stars at the show and on the red carpet. Here's some of the gossip we picked up along the way.",
      "1) Raye gave an update on her missing song books",
      "Two weeks ago, Raye told fans her second album had been delayed by thieves who stole her car and, with it, several notebooks full of lyrics and song ideas.",
      "On the red carpet, she confirmed the police hadn't been able to track them down, saying: \"I've just had to let it go.\"",
      "The singer said she couldn't recreate a lot of the ideas, because the act of writing them down freed her mind to work on other things.",
      "\"You let it go, because you think you can come back to it - and now there are so many ideas that are just gone. It's so sad.\"",
      "But the singer, who won best UK artist, maintained a positive outlook.",
      "\"Everything happens for a reason. I'll have to start again and maybe it's a blessing in disguise.\"",
      "2) Busta Rhymes revealed his unlikely comedy hero",
      "The decision to bring rap legend Busta Rhymes to Manchester to receive a global icon award wasn't as random as it sounded.",
      "Before he developed his rapid-fire rap delivery, an 11-year-old Rhymes spent two summers living with his Aunt Velma in Morecambe.",
      "\"I went to karate school, and we illegally went into nightclubs, to make a little money break-dancing,\" he told us.",
      "\"I remember Boy George was cool, Wham was cool,\" he continued.",
      "\"But our favourite was Benny Hill. Benny Hill is still our favourite to this day. I don't think anybody has as ever been as funny or as charismatic as Benny Hill.\"",
      "So, during those halcyon days of watching smutty comedy in Morecambe, did he ever think he'd be back, winning a lifetime achievement prize?",
      "\"You can never foresee something like that,\" he said. \"When we first got involved with hip-hop, we didn't do it for none of the accolades. We just did it because we loved it.",
      "\"But with that being said, tonight is a dream come true.\"",
      "To honour that moment, he gave a nine-minute acceptance speech thanking everyone from his mother to an art teacher he'd met backstage.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never got an award from MTV before. Thirty four years of professionally recording [and] this is the first time I\u2019m getting an award from MTV. It feels incredible.\"",
      "3) Olly Alexander had advice for next year's Eurovision contestant",
      "Olly Alexander played a pre-show party on Saturday night, and couldn't quite believe the reception for Dizzy - the song which earned him 18th place at this year's Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "\"That went down a lot better than it did in Eurovision,\" he laughed, shortly before Jedward invaded the stage and caused utter chaos.",
      "At the main ceremony, Alexander was there to award song of the year to Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso. But he also had a few words for anyone considering representing the UK at next year's contest.",
      "\"I would say to them, whoever it is, 'Call me, and we will have a serious conversation about it',\" he said with the haunted look of a man who has seen some things.",
      "4) Benson Boone has a new fan: Bez",
      "In addition to winning best new artist, US singer Benson Boone opened the ceremony with a spectacular performance that saw him suspended mid-air on a grand piano, before pulling off a spectacular front flip from a platform at the side of the stage.",
      "\"The insurance is always crazy,\" he laughed, \"but I love to perform.\"",
      "One person who couldn't believe his eyes was Happy Mondays star Bez, who accosted Boone during an interview with Rita Ora.",
      "\"I was so blown away by that performance, mate,\" he told the singer.",
      "\"When you came down on that shiny piano, I thought, 'Elton John is going to be so gutted.'\"",
      "5) Le Sserafim escaped to Manchester's Christmas market",
      "Manchester is home to the UK's biggest K-Pop shop and, on Sunday morning, the staff couldn't quite believe one of the genre's biggest girl bands had landed in their city.",
      "\"Le Sserafim were posting pictures from the Christmas market,\" one of them told me. \"That's only five minutes from here!\"",
      "The five-piece, who've been setting chart records over in the US, jetted in for their first-ever UK performance, a mash-up of Chasing Lightning and the 90s house banger Crazy.",
      "But they were more excited to be out on the town without being mobbed.",
      "\"It was so good, we had baklava!\" enthused singer Huh Yun-Jin; while her bandmate Sakura tucked into a portion of fish and chips.",
      "\"It was my first time,\" she said. \"I loved it.\"",
      "On stage at the EMAs, the band got one of the biggest screams of the night, despite being relatively unknown in the UK... for now.",
      "\"Coming to Europe is something that we've always dreamt of, so this is absolutely surreal,\" said Yun-Jin. \"We just want to make a good impression.\"",
      "Mission accomplished.",
      "6) Jedward spent two hours on the red carpet",
      "For absolutely no reason at all, Jedward went on a massive charm offensive for the international press.",
      "\"Oasis are back and Jedward are back!\" they declared, before racing over to baffled German and French journalists, while singing Stop Crying Your Heart Out.",
      "This went on for two deliriously brilliant hours, as the twins, who found fame on The X Factor 15 years ago, insisted that \"a lot of artists have been inspired by Jedward\".",
      "And, to be fair, they have proof. Mercury Prize nominee CMAT recently said the brothers had encouraged her to finish her second album, with a motivational voice message.",
      "\"You have to think about it, in life,\" explained John.",
      "\"Don't always think you're the main character. Reach out to other people. Serve that tennis ball and see what they do.\"",
      "\"It's always about keeping that spark alive,\" added Edward. \"We're like a support animal for all the artists.\"",
      "They were, to be honest, an absolute blast.",
      "7) The Liam Payne tribute was perfectly judged",
      "Liam Payne won 12 MTV EMAs during his time in One Direction, and later used the ceremony to launch his solo career, performing his global smash hit Strip That Down at the 2017 ceremony.",
      "It was only fitting that the event marked his death - but striking the right tone in the middle of a huge showbiz event is never easy.",
      "In the end, his friend and collaborator Rita Ora just spoke from the heart.",
      "\"There were so many ways that we were talking about honouring him,\" she said. \"But sometimes simply speaking is enough.\"",
      "Addressing the camera directly, she shared her memories of the 31-year-old, as her voice cracked.",
      "\"Liam Payne was one of the kindest people that I knew,\" she said. \"He brought so much joy to every room he walked into. And he left such a mark on this world.\"",
      "It was sombre and restrained, yet powerfully emotional. Ora wasn't the only one crying.",
      "8) Tyla paid tribute to Aaliyah",
      "South African star Tyla, best known for her viral hit Water, clinched both the best R&B and best Afrobeats awards.",
      "The awards marked her continued ascent, after being named one of the BBC's Sounds of 2024 - but she made sure to honour her inspirations.",
      "On the red carpet, she rocked a vintage Roberto Cavalli dress with a turquoise blue zebra print.",
      "The exact same dress had previously been worn by US rapper Eve at the 2000 Soul Train Awards.",
      "And R&B legend Aaliyah wore a canary yellow version at the 2000 MTV Awards, where she won best female video for Try Again.",
      "The ceremony took place in September 2000, less than a year before Aaliyah's tragic death in an plane accident.",
      "The singer was just 22 at the time - the same age that Tyla is now."

      "I can feel the anger rising. How am I facing this abuse again after 20 years?",
      "My name is Alex. But increasingly young people shout \u201cTimmy\u201d at me in the street. This isn\u2019t mistaken identity - it\u2018s mockery because I use a wheelchair.",
      "I should ignore it, but this time, I react. I turn to see a group of young teenage boys smirking in front of me. \u201cI heard you,\u201d I tell them. \u201cI know exactly who Timmy is.\u201d",
      "I know this because although we do not share a name, I have felt the shadow of Timmy since childhood - never through choice.",

      "Growing up at the show\u2019s initial peak during the turn of the millennium, Timmy followed me through school corridors, classrooms and playgrounds - no matter my friends, sociability or relatively good grades.",
      "Now, in my 30s, he\u2019s back. For the third time in a year, this time heading to my local train station in my wheelchair, I hear the familiar, brutish drawl: \u201cTimmaaah.\u201d",
      "A laugh. A snigger. An assumption I either won\u2019t hear or be unable to understand.",
      "When I confront the group of boys, one feigns innocence, claiming he\u2019d been speaking to his friend.",
      "\u201cYou weren\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cI was watching the show before you were born.\u201d",
      "Initially I was baffled as to how this phenomenon had returned to a new young generation, 24 years after the character first appeared.",
      "The answer lies in social media, particularly TikTok, where hundreds of short user-edited clips of Timmy and audio of him saying his name are sparking the revival.",
      "TikTok users often take part in trends by using the audio of popular videos and overlaying it with their own clips.",
      "That\u2019s what many have done with Timmy, where the name is used as a punchline, or played on top of unrelated clips of wheelchair users, reinforcing harmful and dehumanising stereotypes.",
      "The irony is that the character Timmy is presented with warmth in South Park and given character depth by co-creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker.",
      "An equal in the show\u2019s unflinching satire, his disability isn\u2019t necessarily the butt of the joke.",
      "Timmy is an accepted member of the class: he fails to complete homework, faces adversity and causes trouble with his disabled best friend Jimmy. His personality is conveyed through the different intonations in which he delivers his name.",
      "One episode, Timmy 2000, sees him win a battle of the bands as frontman for a metal group. The adult characters are shown to respond in an over-protective and condescending way - a striking criticism of the way society often treats disabled people.",
      "Nearly 20 years ago, a poll by Ouch! - the former name of the BBC\u2019s disability section - crowned Timmy as the most popular disabled TV character.",
      "Seattle Times\u2019 late disabled critic Jeff Shannon described Timmy as the most \u201cprogressive, provocative and socially relevant disability humour ever presented on American television\u201d.",
      "\u201cWithout telling viewers what to think, South Park challenges [the audience\u2019s] own fears and foibles regarding disability, and Timmy emerges triumphant,\u201d he wrote in 2005.",
      "In interviews Stone and Parker have spoken of how carefully and purposefully they integrated him into the show.",

      "None of this nuance is reflected in the TikTok trend, which reduces Timmy, and by extension wheelchair users and disability, to one-dimensional ridicule.",
      "This warped revival parallels the case of Joey Deacon, a man with cerebral palsy whose appearance on Blue Peter in the 1980s backfired to spark playground mockery, with kids shouting \u201cyou're a Joey!\u201d, and \u201cdo the Joey face\u201d.",
      "TikTok says its community guidelines strictly prohibit hate speech and content promoting discrimination, violence or harm based on disability.",

      "Even if a video with an \u201coriginal sound\u201d is removed by the platform, the audio usually isn\u2019t, he says.",
      "This makes it a common way of bypassing TikTok\u2019s content moderation guidelines - including for harassment and abuse.",
      "Bullying and trolling of disabled people is still common online. Three in 10 said they\u2019d experienced it in a survey of 4,000 disabled people carried out by charity Scope.",
      "My last experience of having the name hurled at me on the street shocked me not so much in the name-calling, but the absolute lack of contrition shown even when challenged.",
      "It mirrored an experience last year when teenagers, again taunting me, rode off shouting \u201cTimmy is going to run us over.\u201d",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s normally good and positive and funny \u2026 but when these dynamics are being used to demean, mock or stigmatise others, it does raise the question of whether TikTok should be doing more to inform or educate users.\u201d",
      "Alison Kerry, head of communications at Scope, told the BBC \"these kinds of ableist trends are deeply harmful. They don\u2019t exist in a vacuum, so a social media trend can quickly turn into someone facing abuse in their everyday life.\u201d",
      "The real-world impact is certainly becoming more noticeable.",
      "Disabled TikTokers have been posting about their experiences, and a teacher recently wrote a Reddit thread titled \u201cGetting real sick of this Timmy trend\u201d, expressing frustration at students' lack of awareness.",

      "Varenicline, a daily tablet given over a few months, is as effective as vapes and more effective than nicotine replacement gum or patches, NHS England says.",
      "The drug, which fights cravings, was available a few years ago on the NHS under the brand name Champix but was withdrawn due to some impurities. The new version has been approved as safe.",

      "Varenicline is a prescription only medicine, which means people cannot buy it over the counter at a pharmacy or supermarket and will instead need to see their GP or an NHS stop smoking service to get it.",
      "It works by reducing cravings for nicotine and blocking its effect on the brain, while also helping with withdrawal symptoms, such as feeling irritable or having difficulty sleeping.",
      "When used alongside behavioural support, such as counselling, it has been shown to help around one in four people to stop smoking for at least six months, said NHS England.",
      "That could help more than 85,000 people stop smoking each year, it said, and  might prevent around 9,500 smoking-related deaths over the next five years, according to research by University College London.",
      "Around one in eight adults\u00a0 - six million people in the UK\u00a0- are smokers.",
      "There were more than 400,000 hospital admissions in England linked to smoking last year.",
      "Each year the NHS spends around \u00a32.5bn on treating health issues caused by smoking \u2013 it is the leading cause of preventable illness and deaths.",
      "Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"The rollout of this pill can save the NHS millions of pounds, save appointments to help other patients be seen faster and save lives.\"",
      "Announcing the launch at the NHS Providers annual conference, NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the drug could be a \"game-changer\" for people who want to quit smoking.",
      "What about vapes?",
      "Since e-cigarettes are not licensed as medicines, GPs are unable to prescribe vapes to people trying to quit smoking unless there is a locally agreed NHS scheme to do so.",
      "Some local authorities do offer vapes to smokers who are looking to quit.",
      "Guidelines recommend people try a licensed stop smoking medicine first, though vapes are a recognised smoking cessation aid.",
      "Vaping is nowhere near as harmful as smoking cigarettes.",
      "However, it is not entirely risk free and health experts agree people should not start vaping other than to give up smoking.",
      "Hazel Cheeseman, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said access to services was variable.",
      "She said: \"Wherever a smoker lives, they should be able to access the most effective forms of treatment to help them stop.",
      "\u201cImproving access to varenicline will be a positive step forward to help prevent the tens of thousands of deaths caused by smoking. However, a drug alone will not transform smoking rates. Services are needed to support smokers and prescribe these products.",
      "\"The NHS has done a good job in setting up in-hospital support to help people quit smoking, which complements the services provided in the community.",
      "\"But gaps remain around the country, with services often in peril as local NHS organisations try to balance the books.\"",
      "Prof Nick Hopkinson, professor of respiratory medicine at Imperial College London, said varenicline was the \"most effective smoking cessation medication\".",
      "The fact it has not been available for the last few years has been a \"real problem\", he said, adding: \"We know that quitting smoking is the best thing anyone who smokes can do to improve their health and the health of people around them, especially children and young people.",
      "\u201cPeople are most likely to quit successfully if they have a combination of counselling support and medication to relieve cravings and help break their tobacco dependence.\"",

    "story": [
      "Boris Johnson\u2019s government blocked a request to fund another 10,000 hospital beds at the height of the Covid pandemic, the chief executive of NHS England has said.",
      "Amanda Pritchard told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry the decision, made by the Treasury in July 2020, had been \u201cvery disappointing\u201d.",
      "Extra beds and staff would have been used to cut waiting lists for planned care and \u201cbuild resilience\u201d going into a second winter wave of the pandemic, she said.",
      "The government has said it cannot comment while the inquiry is in progress.",
      "Health ministers from the time are expected to give evidence later this month, to the third section of the inquiry, looking at Covid's impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across the UK.",
      "Ms Pritchard served as NHS England\u2019s chief operating officer from 2019 until she was promoted to chief executive, in August 2021.",
      "In her evidence, she said a request had been made to the government, for 10,000 extra permanent, staffed hospital beds, in July 2020.",
      "\u2018Very disappointing\u2019",
      "The demand had been based on modelling the spread of the virus, along with the need to deal with other pressures that coming winter and resume more planned, or elective, surgery and other treatments for non-Covid patients.",
      "But the inquiry heard the Treasury and the prime minister\u2019s private office had refused the request, saying they wanted more use made of temporary Nightingale hospitals along with the private sector.",
      "And Ms Prichard had been told the decision would be looked at again as part of a wider spending review expected in the autumn of 2021.",
      "She called the decision \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in \u201cquite a different position\u201d today had the extra funding been agreed.",
      "\u201cIf we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients\u2026 as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally,\u201d Ms Prichard said.",
      "In the summer of 2020, the NHS in England had a total permanent bed capacity to treat about 95,000 patients in acute hospitals.",
      "That was increased by another 4,000 from winter 2023, under a recovery plan agreed by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.",
      "\u2018Completely overwhelming\u2019",
      "Later in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of \u201cextreme pressure\u201d in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country.",
      "By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers.",
      "But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed \u201cto the brink\u201d and were \u201cright on the edge\u201d of running out of bed space.",
      "Nationally, the health service had never had to \u201csystematically limit\u201d access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said.",
      "\u201cThat does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind of care that was being provided was anything like normal,\u201d she added.",
      "'Field hospitals'",
      "Ms Pritchard was also asked about the seven temporary Nightingale hospitals built quickly, in March and April 2020, across England to treat Covid patients.",
      "Data seen by the inquiry shows the total cost to the taxpayer, including setting up and decommissioning, is now estimated at \u00a3358.5m.",
      "The hospitals \u2013 in Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, London, Manchester and Sunderland \u2013 treated 141 Covid patients in the first wave of the virus and 1,097 Covid and other patients in the second wave.",
      "In total, \u00a350.4m was spent on one site, Birmingham, which was never used by patients in the pandemic.",
      "The site in Bristol also carried out 6,554 assessments for patients from the eye hospital in the city.",
      "Ms Pritchard told the inquiry the programme had still been \u201cuseful\u201d, as the sites had been envisaged as \u201cmilitary field hospitals\u201d at the time.",
      "\u201cWe thought we were doing it to avoid a northern Italy situation,\u201d she said, referring to scenes in Lombardy, where intensive-care units had been overwhelmed.",

      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has announced fresh climate change targets at a global summit, saying he wants the UK to lead on cutting emissions.",
      "The UK will now aim for an 81% cut in its emissions by 2035, he told the UN conference of parties (COP29) in Azerbaijan.",
      "The target updates a 78% pledge by 2035 under the previous Conservative government, although that also included international aviation and shipping emissions, and goes beyond another pledge of a 68% reduction by 2030.",
      "Sir Keir insisted the government would not \"tell people how to live their lives\" but the target was vital to the UK's future prosperity and energy security.",
      "Climate talks open in shadow of Trump victory",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "The prime minister said the new target was based on recommendations from the UK's independent climate change committee (CCC) aimed at limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to levels in 1990.",
      "He was one of only seven G20 leaders attending the summit, with 13 absentees including the premiers of the US, China, France and Germany.",
      "Sir Keir would not be drawn on his views about president-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to cut climate rules during his election campaign.",
      "He said: \"Make no mistake, the race is on for the clean energy jobs of the future, the economy of tomorrow, and I don't want to be in the middle of the pack - I want to get ahead of the game\".",
      "The target will be included in papers to go before Parliament before February and, although Sir Keir did not announce any new policies, he did commit to continuing to provide \u00a311.6bn of climate finance until March 2026, a pledge made under the previous government.",
      "Announcing a \u00a31bn investment in a wind turbine project in Hull, which he said would create 1,300 local jobs, Sir Keir said the world was standing at a \"critical juncture in the climate crisis\".",
      "The UK has called for other countries to match the new target, following stark warnings from the United Nations that the world is on course for a 3.1C rise without further cuts.",
      "The latest target is broadly in line with the UK\u2019s legally-binding carbon-cutting path towards net zero emissions by 2050, contained in the 2015 Paris Agreement.",
      "That international agreement ties the UK to ratcheting up new \"nationally determined contributions\" (NDCs) for carbon reduction every five years, which has seen the a 68% cut by 2030 increase to an 81% cut by 2035.",
      "The Climate Change Act 2008 also set legally-binding domestic agreements on carbon budgets in five year chunks until 2050, which unlike the NDC targets also include international aviation and shipping emissions.",
      "The latest of these is the sixth carbon budget, which runs between 2033-2037, and has already been set at 78%.",
      "Since taking power in July, Labour has ended an effective ban on new onshore wind projects and pledged not to issue any new oil and gas exploration licenses in the North Sea, as well as closing the UK's last coal power plant in September.",
      "The switch towards greener energy has already halved the UK's annual greenhouse gas emissions since 1990 - but the CCC has previously said further reductions will be difficult without lifestyle changes.",
      "The government advisers said taxes on meat and dairy might be needed if people do not voluntarily reduce their consumption of the products, and there should be moves to phase out the use of petrol cars.",
      "Speaking at the summit, Sir Keir said the new UK target would be \"difficult\" but \"achievable\", and he wanted government to \"tread lightly on people's lives\".",
      "\"It\u2019s not about telling people how to live their lives \u2013 I\u2019m not interested in that,\" he added.",
      "\"I am interested in making sure their energy bills are stable, that we\u2019ve got energy independence, and that we also along the way pick up the next generation of jobs.\"",
      "However, shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho claimed the new target would lead to \"hardship\" for the British people.",
      "During energy questions in the Commons, Coutinho said making \"already stringent carbon emission targets even higher\" would require a \"shift away from meat and dairy\" and \"less travel\".",
      "The Conservative MP claimed the approach would \"see our reliance on Chinese imports - a country which is 60% powered by coal - go through the roof\".",
      "In response, energy minister Kerry McCarthy said: \"It's really important that we are stepping up and showing global ambition.",
      "\"Reaching net zero in this country and getting to clean power by 2030 is a massive opportunity - it is not a cost.\"",
      "The interim chair of the CCC, Professor Piers Forster, welcomed the new target and said it was feasible based on the latest science, technological developments, and the UK\u2019s national circumstances.",
      "\"Our analysis shows that this is a feasible target that will support jobs and investment,\" he said, adding the UK was currently running behind schedule on delivering its 2030 target of 68% cuts.",
      "He added: \"A target is only as meaningful as the delivery against it.",
      "\"The UK needs to get back on track to deliver against our existing 2030 NDC commitment.",
      "\"We need to see further urgent action to speed up deployment of low-carbon solutions such as electric vehicles, heat pumps, and tree planting.\"",
      "All countries who have signed up to the Paris Agreement should submit their latest carbon reduction targets by a deadline of February next year and a copy of that memo, known as the Information to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and Understanding (ICTU), will be presented to MPs before then."

    "story": [
      "Financially troubled Thurrock Council is considering legal claims against more than 20 other local authorities.",

      "It received valuations for its solar investments from the Association for Public Service Excellence (APSE), which is owned by local councils.",
      "Thurrock \"believes that valuations of the solar assets undertaken by APSE, which they allowed the council to rely on, were negligent and overvalued those assets\". APSE said it \"entirely rejected\" Thurrock's statement that valuations \"led to significant financial losses to Thurrock with negative impact on taxpayers\".",
      "The councils that face being sued include Luton, Southampton, Cardiff, South Tyneside, Preston, Wolverhampton and Hertfordshire, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (full list at the bottom of this story).",
      "Mo Baines, chief executive of APSE, said this would lead to \"significant legal costs on other councils which we believe has no merit\".",
      "APSE provides advice to local authorities and warned if Thurrock proceeded it could end up affecting all 250 councils in the UK as co-defendants. Seeking independent legal advice could cost each council around \u00a325,000, according to APSE.",
      "Ms Baines said she \"remains hopeful there is a positive resolution\" but told the BBC that Thurrock's action would mean \"other councils become embroiled\" in paying for their financial failure.",

      "SNP MSP Emma Roddick said she hoped Flynn \"rethinks\" his ambition to hold two seats seats.",
      "She posted on X: \u201cParty members set this rule for good reasons. Rightly, Douglas Ross was criticised for holding two roles simultaneously.\"",
      "The Highlands and Islands representative said she could not imagine \"being a good MSP\" while spending \"half\" her time in London.",

      "The SNP is yet to decide what its rules will be for candidates at the next election.",
      "The change on dual mandates led to then-MP Joanna Cherry pulling out of the selection contest for the Edinburgh Central seat.",
      "Health Secretary Neil Gray also had to resign as an MP before being elected to Holyrood in 2021.",
      "Cherry - who lost her Westminster seat in July\u2019s general election and has ruled out a bid for election to Holyrood in 2026 - said the SNP rule was \u201cperson specific\u201d.",

      "Few who follow Scottish politics will be surprised by Stephen Flynn\u2019s decision.",
      "He\u2019s widely regarded as one of the SNP\u2019s most talented politicians. And Holyrood offers opportunities for him that Westminster never will (such as being a government minister or - one day perhaps - first minister).",
      "But this is a controversial move in a number of ways.",
      "Even though other SNP politicians have sat previously at Westminster and Holyrood simultaneously, party rhetoric on \"double jobbing\" has hardened in recent years.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 18:06:48 GMT",
    "summary": "NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard says the decision, in July 2020, was very disappointing.",
    "story": [
      "Boris Johnson\u2019s government blocked a request to fund another 10,000 hospital beds at the height of the Covid pandemic, the chief executive of NHS England has said.",
      "Amanda Pritchard told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry the decision, made by the Treasury in July 2020, had been \u201cvery disappointing\u201d.",
      "Extra beds and staff would have been used to cut waiting lists for planned care and \u201cbuild resilience\u201d going into a second winter wave of the pandemic, she said.",
      "The government has said it cannot comment while the inquiry is in progress.",
      "Health ministers from the time are expected to give evidence later this month, to the third section of the inquiry, looking at Covid's impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across the UK.",
      "Ms Pritchard served as NHS England\u2019s chief operating officer from 2019 until she was promoted to chief executive, in August 2021.",
      "In her evidence, she said a request had been made to the government, for 10,000 extra permanent, staffed hospital beds, in July 2020.",
      "\u2018Very disappointing\u2019",
      "The demand had been based on modelling the spread of the virus, along with the need to deal with other pressures that coming winter and resume more planned, or elective, surgery and other treatments for non-Covid patients.",
      "But the inquiry heard the Treasury and the prime minister\u2019s private office had refused the request, saying they wanted more use made of temporary Nightingale hospitals along with the private sector.",
      "And Ms Prichard had been told the decision would be looked at again as part of a wider spending review expected in the autumn of 2021.",
      "She called the decision \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in \u201cquite a different position\u201d today had the extra funding been agreed.",
      "\u201cIf we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients\u2026 as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally,\u201d Ms Prichard said.",
      "In the summer of 2020, the NHS in England had a total permanent bed capacity to treat about 95,000 patients in acute hospitals.",
      "That was increased by another 4,000 from winter 2023, under a recovery plan agreed by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.",
      "\u2018Completely overwhelming\u2019",
      "Later in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of \u201cextreme pressure\u201d in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country.",
      "By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers.",
      "But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed \u201cto the brink\u201d and were \u201cright on the edge\u201d of running out of bed space.",
      "Nationally, the health service had never had to \u201csystematically limit\u201d access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said.",
      "\u201cThat does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind of care that was being provided was anything like normal,\u201d she added.",
      "'Field hospitals'",
      "Ms Pritchard was also asked about the seven temporary Nightingale hospitals built quickly, in March and April 2020, across England to treat Covid patients.",
      "Data seen by the inquiry shows the total cost to the taxpayer, including setting up and decommissioning, is now estimated at \u00a3358.5m.",
      "The hospitals \u2013 in Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, London, Manchester and Sunderland \u2013 treated 141 Covid patients in the first wave of the virus and 1,097 Covid and other patients in the second wave.",
      "In total, \u00a350.4m was spent on one site, Birmingham, which was never used by patients in the pandemic.",
      "The site in Bristol also carried out 6,554 assessments for patients from the eye hospital in the city.",
      "Ms Pritchard told the inquiry the programme had still been \u201cuseful\u201d, as the sites had been envisaged as \u201cmilitary field hospitals\u201d at the time.",
      "\u201cWe thought we were doing it to avoid a northern Italy situation,\u201d she said, referring to scenes in Lombardy, where intensive-care units had been overwhelmed.",

      "Top pub and restaurant bosses have warned the chancellor that tax rises in last month's Budget will \"unquestionably\" cause closures and job losses.",
      "In a letter, more than 200 signatories have said the hospitality industry is disproportionately impacted by an \"unsustainable\" hike in the amount employers pay in National Insurance contributions (NICs).",
      "It adds that businesses have \"no capacity to pass the costs onto customers\", which would instead lead to job cuts and closures of smaller firms.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said that her National Insurance changes for businesses will generate \u00a325bn, which would aid funding of public services, such as the NHS.",
      "From April, the rate employers pay in National Insurance will rise from 13.8% to 15%, and the threshold at which they start paying the tax on each employee's salary will be reduced from \u00a39,100 per year to \u00a35,000.",
      "Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the changes had been designed in a way \"that tried to limit the extra cost on small business\".",
      "Signatories of the letter include Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, the bosses of pub firms Fuller's and Stonegate Group, and Premier Inn's owner, Whitbread.",
      "They are supported by a further 209 businesses, together employing tens of thousands of people across the UK.",
      "According to the letter, the cost increases will cause jobs to be \"drastically\" cut and hours to be reduced for workers.",
      "Ms Nicholls told the BBC that firms in the industry facing these \"tough decisions\" may also reconsider investing.",
      "\"We understand that the government has a tough job to do,\" she said, but urged politicians to \"have a rethink\".",
      "Jones said that the government would not reassess the plan, and that many employers would pay the same in NI contributions as they do now, or less.",
      "\"I think the public would recognise that bigger businesses are able to burden some of the contributions that we need to make to the state.",
      "\"Getting the NHS back on its feet so workers who are off sick can get back to work is probably something that we'd say we'd all benefit from,\" he added.",
      "Impact on lower earners",
      "The letter from industry bosses suggests that changes in the NICs threshold are \"regressive in their impact on lower earners and will impact flexible working practices which many older workers and parents rely upon\".",
      "The signatories are calling for the government to consider one of two measures to \"protect businesses who employ low earners\"  to mitigate the impact.",
      "Suggested measures are a new employer NICs band which would apply between \u00a35,000 and \u00a39,100 at a lower rate of 5%, or implementing an exemption for taxpayers working fewer than 20 hours per week.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has calculated that three quarters of the impact of the NI changes will be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",
      "During a select committee hearing on Tuesday, the OBR's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "The changes set out in the Budget are, however, predicted to raise some \u00a325bn a year, making it one of the biggest single tax-raising measures in history.",
      "The chancellor has previously said that she was not immune to \"criticism\" over the move, but has argued that it will put public finances on a \"firm footing\".",
      "The hospitality industry's letter follows on from big British supermarkets such as M&S and Sainsbury's hinting that they may put up prices in a bid to offset higher wage bills.",

      "Speaking on Times Radio, he said the UK should not be \"too worried\" about giving up the territory, adding it consisted of \"very tiny islands in the middle of the Indian Ocean where no one actually goes\".",

      "About two million council-built properties have been sold to their tenants at significantly discounted prices under the Right To Buy (RTB) scheme since it was introduced by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative government in the early 1980s.",
      "Michael Heseltine described the advent of RTB as \"laying the foundations of one of the most important social revolutions of the century\", but was selling off council houses more cheaply than new ones could be built simply laying the foundations of a housing crisis?",

      "While the \u00a3336,612,000 raised from those sales may sound a reasonable sum, it works out on average at about \u00a377,000 per house. And, generally, councils have not been allowed to keep the whole amount, instead having to hand a sizeable chunk back to the government.",
      "About 200,000 people are on waiting lists for social housing in the region.",
      "While housing associations may have built homes, and there may have been schemes funded by cash from other government pots, the fact that the money raised from selling off homes is nowhere near enough to rebuild or buy like-for-like has been a long-standing concern.",
      "And it would seem Labour deputy prime minister and minister for housing Angela Rayner \u2013 who famously bought her own council house in Stockport under RTB \u2013 has taken on board the views of RTB critics.",
      "Rayner has said recently she may impose restrictions so that people who move into newly built council houses will not be able to buy them in the future.",
      "It is a decision that is likely to be welcomed by Labour politicians in regions where the need for social housing is arguably as great as ever, but the amount of it available is very low.",
      "The Labour metro-mayors of both Liverpool and Manchester regions have both said they want to see more social housing built in their regions.",
      "In May, Andy Burnham, leader of Greater Manchester, called on the-then Conservative government to pause RTB on new builds after losing 500 social homes to the scheme in 2022.",
      "He argued that if planned homes could be bought by their tenants, it would be \"like trying to fill a bath without the plug in\".",
      "On Merseyside, virtually all former council housing stock was transferred to housing associations over the last two decades.",
      "But metro mayor Steve Rotheram says registered social landlords (RSLs) have inherited some of the problems that came with RTB.",
      "He says one Merseyside RSL had lost about a third of its homes through sales to tenants in the decade since the housing stock was transferred.",
      "People who are tenants of RSLs can buy their homes under \u201cpreserved\u201d RTB if they lived in their homes when the council owned them.",
      "And once someone has lived in an RSL property for three years, they can apply for the Right To Acquire.",
      "Rotheram says cheaper borrowing rates for RSLs and a moratorium on sales would help boost growth in social housing.",
      "\"You are not going to build a lot of houses for someone to come along in three or four years and buy it below market value,\" he says.",
      "\"How we deal with this is part of our growth plan going to the government, and we are now trying to see if we can work with [Rayner] to come up with proposals.\"",
      "Blackpool Council\u2019s cabinet member for economy and the built environment, Mark Smith, is clear that while the money generated from RTB sales is used to support various investments in housing, the RTB receipts his council receives are \"not sufficient to replace lost social rent housing\".",
      "And he says even with changes such as the government giving councils more flexibility to allow RTB receipts to be used alongside cash from other streams such as funds given by developers who get planning permission for private schemes, there is still some red tape in the way of using different types of funding together to build council housing.",
      "\"We do the best we can within the parameters of the policy as it exists currently but there is always room for improvement,\" he says.",
      "Under the new Labour government policies, councils and housing associations are being given \u201cmore freedom\u201d to decide how to use their RTB money.",
      "Previously, only 50% of the money a council received from a sale could go towards building or buying a new house.",
      "But in future councils will be able to use all that money, and put money received from private developers handed over as part of planning agreements into projects as well.",
      "These deals, known as Section 106 agreements, see developers give money to councils to mitigate any negative impacts their private schemes might have on local communities or housing markets.",
      "Sources within the social housing sector say that in the past the \"policy has never achieved anything like a one-for-one replacement ratio\".",
      "\"If it had then there would be a lot less concern about the policy,\" one says.",
      "\"Yes, a Right To Buy home continues to be a home after it\u2019s sold, but it contributes to a huge loss of social housing stock and contributes to housing waiting lists, or people having to live in unsuitable accommodation.\"",
      "'Serious shortage'",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, says there is a \"serious housing shortage in this country\" and \"record numbers of people living in temporary accommodation\".",
      "Adam Hug, the LGA\u2019s housing spokesman, says: \u201cWhile the Right To Buy can and has delivered home ownership for many the scheme in its current form does not work.",
      "\"Rising discounts, alongside other measures that restrict councils\u2019 use of Right To Buy receipts, mean that the money raised from the sale of property is usually not sufficient to cover the building costs of replacing the property.",
      "\"We have long called for the removal of rules and restrictions which disincentivise local authorities from building social homes, at risk of losing them.",
      "\"Councils must be given the control, power and flexibility to use receipt monies in a way that works best for their local areas, which includes retaining 100 per cent of the receipts permanently.\"",
      "'Scandal'",
      "In 2012, the Conservative-led government increased the discount a tenant could receive when buying their home.",
      "Since coming to power, Labour has said the discount will be reduced to between \u00a316,000 and \u00a338,000, depending on the location \u2013 a significant reduction from the \u00a3136,000 discount currently available in London and the discount of just over \u00a3100,000 elsewhere.",
      "Rayner, who bought her Stockport council house under a RTB discount in 2007 and sold it several years later for \u00a348,000 more than she paid for it, said she wanted to see a \u201cfairer\u201d system.",
      "Her department says it is a \"scandal\" that only about one third of homes lost to RTB have been replaced since 2012, and that it was \"working at pace to reverse the continued decline of social rented homes\".",
      "But while the government stresses there are \"no plans to abolish the RTB\", the \"social revolution\" Lord Heseltine heralded nearly 45 years ago is clearly facing a radical change to everything but its name.",

    "story": [
      "The mystery as to why a beluga whale appeared off the coast of Norway wearing a harness may finally have been solved.",
      "The tame white whale, which locals named Hvaldimir, made headlines five years ago amidst widespread speculation that it was a Russian spy.",
      "Now an expert in the species says she believes the whale did indeed belong to the military and escaped from a naval base in the Arctic Circle.",
      "But Dr Olga Shpak does not believe it was a spy. She believes the beluga was being trained to guard the base and fled because it was a \"hooligan\".",
      "Seeking sanctuary for whale dubbed a Russian spy",
      "Russia has always refused to confirm or deny that the beluga whale was trained by its military.",
      "But Dr Shpak, who worked in Russia researching marine mammals from the 1990s until she returned to her native Ukraine in 2022, told BBC News: \u201cFor me it\u2019s 100% (certain).\u201d",
      "Dr Shpak, whose account is based on conversations with friends and former colleagues in Russia, features in a BBC documentary, Secrets of the Spy Whale, which is now on BBC iPlayer and being shown on BBC Two on Wednesday at 21:00 GMT.",
      "Secrets of the Spy Whale",
      "The mysterious whale first came to public attention five years ago when it approached fishermen off the northern coast of Norway.",
      "\u201cThe whale starts rubbing against the boat,\u201d Joar Hesten, one of the fishermen, says. \u201cI heard about animals in distress that instinctively knew that they need help from humans. I was thinking that this is one smart whale.\u201d",
      "The sighting was unusual because the beluga was so tame and they're rarely seen as far south. It was also wearing a harness, which had a mount for a camera, and bore the words, in English, \u201cEquipment St Petersburg\u201d.",
      "Mr Hesten helped to remove the harness from the whale, which then swam to the nearby port of Hammerfest, where it lived for several months.",
      "Seemingly unable to catch live fish to eat, it charmed visitors by nudging at their cameras and even on one occasion returning a mobile phone.",
      "\u201cIt was very obvious that this particular whale had been conditioned to be putting his nose on anything that looked like a target because he was doing it each time,\u201d says Eve Jourdain, a researcher from the Norwegian Orca Survey.",
      "\u201cBut we have no idea what kind of facility he was in, so we don\u2019t know what he was trained for.\u201d",
      "Captivated by the whale's story Norway made arrangements for the beluga to be monitored and fed. The name it was given \u2013 Hvaldimir - is a nod to hval which is Norwegian for whale, and the name of Russia's President, Vladimir Putin.",
      "Dr Shpak did not want to name her sources in Russia for their own safety but said she had been told that when the beluga surfaced in Norway, the Russian marine mammal community immediately identified it as one of theirs.",
      "\u201cThrough the chain of vets and trainers the message came back \u2013 that they were missing a beluga called Andruha,\u201d she says.",
      "According to Dr Shpak, Andruha/Hvaldimir had first been captured in 2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia's Far East. A year later it was moved from a facility owned by a dolphinarium in St Petersburg to the military programme in the Russian Arctic, where his trainers and vets remained in contact.",
      "\u201cI believe that when they started to work in open water, trusting this animal (not to swim away), the animal just gave up on them,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cWhat I've heard from the guys at the commercial dolphinarium who used to have him was that Andruha was smart, so a good choice to be trained. But at the same time, he was kind of like a hooligan - an active beluga - so they were not surprised that he gave up on (following) the boat and went where he wanted to.\u201d",
      "Satellite images from near the Russian naval base in Murmansk show what could have been Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s old home. Pens can clearly be seen in the water with what appear to be white whales inside.",
      "\u201cThe location of the beluga whales very close to the submarines and the surface vessels might tell us that they are actually part of a guarding system,\u201d says Thomas Nilsen, from Norwegian online newspaper The Barents Observer.",
      "Russia, for its part, has never officially addressed the claim that Hvaldimir/Andruha was trained by its army. But it does have a long history of training marine mammals for military purposes.",
      "Speaking in 2019, a Russian reserve colonel, Viktor Baranets, said: \"If we were using this animal for spying, do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'Please call this number'?\"",
      "Sadly, Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s incredible story does not have a happy ending.",
      "Having learned to feed himself, it spent several years travelling south along Norway\u2019s coast and in May 2023 was even spotted off the coast of Sweden.",
      "Then on September 1 2024 its body was found floating at sea, near the town of Risavika, on Norway's south-western coast.",
      "Had the long arm of Putin\u2019s Russia caught up with the reluctant beluga?",
      "It appears not. Despite some activist groups suggesting that the whale had been shot, that explanation has been dismissed by the Norwegian police.",
      "They say there was nothing to suggest that human activity directly caused the beluga\u2019s death. A post-mortem examination revealed that Hvaldimir/Andruha died after a stick became lodged in his mouth."

      "Instead, they may have oceans, and the moons may even be capable of supporting life, scientists say.",
      "Much of what we know about them was gathered by Nasa\u2019s Voyager 2 spacecraft which visited nearly 40 years ago.",
      "But a new analysis shows that Voyager's visit coincided with a powerful solar storm, which led to a misleading idea of what the Uranian system is really like.",
      "Uranus is a beautiful, icy ringed world in the outer reaches of our solar system. It is among the coldest of all the planets. It is also tilted on its side compared to all the other worlds \u2013 as if it had been knocked over \u2013 making it arguably the weirdest.",
      "We got our first close-up look at it in 1986, when Voyager 2 flew past and sent back sensational pictures of the planet and its five major moons.",
      "But what amazed scientists even more was the data Voyager 2 sent back indicating that the Uranian system was even weirder than they thought.",
      "The measurements from the spacecraft\u2019s instruments indicated that the planets and moons were inactive, unlike the other moons in the outer solar system. They also showed that Uranus\u2019s protective magnetic field was strangely distorted. It was squashed and pushed away from the Sun.",
      "A planet\u2019s magnetic field traps any gases and other material coming off the planet and its moons. These might be from oceans or geological activity. Voyager 2 found none, suggesting that Uranus and its five largest moons were sterile and inactive.",
      "This came as an enormous surprise because it was unlike the solar system\u2019s other planets and their moons.",
      "But the new analysis has solved the decades-long mystery. It shows that Voyager 2 flew past on a bad day.",
      "The new research shows that just as Voyager 2 flew past Uranus, the Sun was raging, creating a powerful solar wind that might have blown the material away and temporarily distorted the magnetic field.",
      "So, for 40 years we have had an incorrect view of what Uranus and its five largest moons are normally like, according to Dr William Dunn of University College London.",
      "\u201cThese results suggest that the Uranian system could be much more exciting than previously thought. There could be moons there that could have the conditions that are necessary for life, they might have oceans below the surface that could be teeming with fish!\u201d.",
      "Linda Spilker was a young scientist working on the Voyager programme when the Uranus data came in. She is now still serving as the project scientist for the Voyager missions. She said that she was delighted to hear about the new results, which have been published in the Journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "\u201cThe results are fascinating, and I am really excited to see that there is potential for life in the Uranian system,\u201d she told BBC News.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m also so pleased that so much is being done with the Voyager data. It\u2019s amazing that scientists are looking back at the data we collected in 1986 and finding new results and new discoveries\u201d.",
      "Dr Affelia Wibisono of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, who is independent of the research team, described the results as \u201cvery exciting\u201d.",
      "\u201cIt shows how important it is to look back at old data, because sometimes, hiding behind them is something new to be discovered, which can help us design the next generation of space exploration missions\u201d.",
      "Which is exactly what Nasa is doing, partly as a result of the new research.",
      "It has been nearly 40 years since Voyager 2 last flew past the icy world and its moons. Nasa has plans to launch a new mission, the Uranus Orbiter and Probe, to go back for a closer look in 10 years\u2019 time.",
      "According to Nasa\u2019s Dr Jamie Jasinski, whose idea it was to re-examine the Voyager 2 data, the mission will need to take his results into account when designing its instruments and planning the scientific survey.",
      "\u201cSome of the instruments for the future spacecraft are very much being designed with ideas from what we learned from Voyager 2 when it flew past the system when it was experiencing an abnormal event. So we need to rethink how exactly we are going to design the instruments on the new mission so that we can best capture the science we need to make discoveries\u201d.",
      "Nasa\u2019s Uranus probe is expected to arrive by 2045, which is when scientists hope to find out whether these far-flung icy moons, once thought of as being dead worlds, might have the possibility of being home to life."

      "\"It's now in what we call a 'gravity well' at 105 degrees West longitude, wandering backwards and forwards like a marble at the bottom of a bowl. And unfortunately this brings it close to other satellite traffic on a regular basis.",
      "\"Because it's dead, the risk is it might bump into something, and because it's 'our' satellite we're still responsible for it,\" he explains.",
      "Dr Eves has looked through old satellite catalogues, the National Archives and spoken to satellite experts worldwide, but he can find no clues to the end-of-life behaviour of Britain's oldest spacecraft.",
      "It might be tempting to reach for a conspiracy theory or two, not least because it's hard to hear the name \"Skynet\" without thinking of the malevolent, self-aware artificial intelligence (AI) system in The Terminator movie franchise.",
      "But there's no connection other than the name and, in any case, real life is always more prosaic.",
      "UK military satellite launches to boost space power",
      "MoD contracts Airbus for Skynet telecoms satellite",
      "How do we solve the problem of space debris?",
      "What we do know is that Skynet-1A was manufactured in the US by the now defunct Philco Ford aerospace company and put in space by a US Air Force Delta rocket.",
      "\"The first Skynet satellite revolutionised UK telecommunications capacity, permitting London to securely communicate with British forces as far away as Singapore. However, from a technological standpoint, Skynet-1A was more American than British since the United States both built and launched it,\" remarked Dr Aaron Bateman in a recent paper on the history of the Skynet programme, which is now on its fifth generation.",
      "This view is confirmed by Graham Davison who flew Skynet-1A in the early 70s from its UK operations centre at RAF Oakhanger in Hampshire.",
      "\"The Americans originally controlled the satellite in orbit. They tested all of our software against theirs, before then eventually handing over control to the RAF,\" the long-retired engineer told me.",
      "\"In essence, there was dual control, but when or why Skynet-1A might have been handed back to the Americans, which seems likely - I'm afraid I can't remember,\" says Mr Davison, who is now in his 80s.",
      "Rachel Hill, a PhD student from University College London, has also been scouring the National Archives.",
      "Her readings have led her to one very reasonable possibility.",
      "\"A Skynet team from Oakhanger would go to the USAF satellite facility in Sunnyvale (colloquially known as the Blue Cube) and operate Skynet during 'Oakout'. This was when control was temporarily transferred to the US while Oakhanger was down for essential maintenance. Perhaps the move could have happened then?\u201d Ms Hill speculated.",
      "The official, though incomplete, logs of Skynet-1A\u2019s status suggest final commanding was left in the hands of the Americans when Oakhanger lost sight of the satellite in June 1977.",
      "But however Skynet-1A then got shifted to its present position, it was ultimately allowed to die in an awkward place when really it should have been put in an \"orbital graveyard\".",
      "This refers to a region even higher in the sky where old space junk runs zero risk of running into active telecommunications satellites.",
      "Graveyarding is now standard practice, but back in the 1970s no-one gave much thought to space sustainability.",
      "Attitudes have since changed because the space domain is getting congested.",
      "At 105 degrees West longitude, an active satellite might see a piece of junk come within 50km of its position up to four times a day.",
      "That might sound like they\u2019re nowhere near each other, but at the velocities these defunct objects move it\u2019s starting to get a little too close for comfort.",
      "The Ministry of Defence said Skynet-1A was constantly monitored by the UK's National Space Operations Centre. Other satellite operators are informed if there's likely to be a particularly close conjunction, in case they need to take evasive action.",
      "Ultimately, though, the British government may have to think about removing the old satellite to a safer location.",
      "Technologies are being developed to grab junk left in space.",
      "Already, the UK Space Agency is funding efforts to do this at lower altitudes, and the Americans and the Chinese have shown it's possible to snare ageing hardware even in the kind of high orbit occupied by Skynet-1A.",
      "\"Pieces of space junk are like ticking time bombs,\" observed Moriba Jah, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.",
      "\"We need to avoid what I call super-spreader events. When these things explode or something collides with them, it generates thousands of pieces of debris that then become a hazard to something else that we care about.\"",

      "The BBC has been shown documents and secret video recordings made by the human rights organisation, Global Witness.",
      "It is understood that one of its representatives approached the COP29 team posing as the head of a fictitious Hong Kong investment firm specialising in energy.",
      "He said this company was interested in sponsoring the COP29 summit but wanted to discuss investment opportunities in Azerbaijan's state energy firm, Socar, in return. An online meeting with Soltanov was arranged.",
      "During the meeting, Soltanov told the potential sponsor that the aim of the conference was \"solving the climate crisis\" and \"transitioning away from hydrocarbons in a just, orderly and equitable manner\".",
      "Anyone, he said, including oil and gas companies, \"could come with solutions\" because Azerbaijan\u2019s \"doors are open\".",
      "However, he said he was open to discussions about deals too \u2013 including on oil and gas.",
      "Initially, Soltanov suggested the potential sponsor might be interested in investing in some of the \"green transitioning projects\" Socar was involved in - but then spoke of opportunities related to Azerbaijan's plans to increase gas production, including new pipeline infrastructure.",
      "\"There are a lot of joint ventures that could be established,\" Soltanov says on the recording. \"Socar is trading oil and gas all over the world, including in Asia.\"",
      "Soltanov then described natural gas as a \"transitional fuel\", adding: \"We will have a certain amount of oil and natural gas being produced, perhaps forever.\"",
      "The UN climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, acknowledges there will be a role for some oil and gas up to 2050 and beyond. However, it has been very clear that \"developing\u2026 new oil and gas fields is incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C\".",

      "These events are supposed to be about reducing the world's use of fossil fuels \u2013 the main driver of climate change \u2013 not selling more.",
      "The standards are set by the UN body responsible for the climate negotiations, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).",

      "Christiana Figueres, who oversaw the signing of the 2015 Paris agreement to limit global temperature rises to well below 2C, told the BBC that she was shocked anyone in the COP process would use their position to strike oil and gas deals.",
      "She said such behaviour was \"contrary and egregious\" to the the purpose of COP and \"a treason\" to the process.",

    "summary": "The Northern Taurids are at their peak on 11-12 November - but will the clouds part to let us see them?",
    "story": [
      "Shooting stars may be spotted tonight as the Northern Taurid meteor shower peaks",
      "Published9 November 2024",
      "Published9 November 2024",
      "Sky watchers will be looking out for the Northern Taurids meteor shower which will peak overnight on Monday (11-12 November).",
      "The meteors can be seen from virtually anywhere on Earth but sightings will be affected by the phase of the Moon and the weather conditions.",
      "These showers, known for their slow-moving, long-lasting meteors, are linked to Comet Encke.",
      "There are two streams to the Taurids with the Southern Taurids having peaked earlier in the month.",
      "What is the Taurid meteor shower?",
      "The Taurid meteor shower is caused by the debris - ice and dust - from Comet Encke as it passes through our solar system.",
      "Each time Encke returns to the inner solar system, its nucleus sheds ice and rock into space into a vast debris stream. When Earth passes through this debris the \"comet crumbs\" heat up as they enter our atmosphere and burn up in bright bursts of light.",
      "Taurid meteors tend to be larger than other meteors and can survive for longer periods as they pass through Earth's atmosphere. They also travel relatively slowly, crossing the sky at about 17 miles (27km) per second. This is about half the speed of the Perseids.",
      "A recent theory as to why Encke has such a large debris stream is that it was once part of a larger comet that broke up about 20,000 years ago. It has the shortest orbital period of any known comet within our solar system, taking just 3.3 years to orbit the Sun.",
      "When is the peak?",
      "Encke's debris stream is so large and spread out that it takes Earth a rather long time to pass through it. This is why we experience two separate parts to the shower - the Southern Taurids and the Northern Taurids.",
      "The Southern Taurids run from about 23 September to 12 November and peaked earlier this month. Northern Taurids stem from a nearby but slightly different stream and are active from about 13 October to 2 December, peaking around 11-12 November.",
      "The Taurids are not very prolific, tending to produce only five meteors per hour but they can be very bright. The showers sometimes produce fireballs \u2013 a perfect target for astrophotography.",
      "There seems to be a seven-year cycle with these fireballs. There were lots of sightings of them in 2022 and the next best opportunity may be in 2029.",
      "How do I watch?",
      "You do not need any equipment such as telescopes or binoculars as the secret is to take in as much sky as possible and allow about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark.",
      "The best time to view is around midnight when the shower's radiant (the spot in the sky from which the meteors appear to emanate), the Taurus constellation, is high in the sky.",
      "To find Taurus, look for the constellation Orion and then peer to the north-east to find the red star Aldebaran, the star in the bull's eye. Shooting stars will be visible all over the night sky so move your gaze around the nearby constellations.",
      "Skies have been clearing over the past 24 hours, leading to improved viewing conditions.",
      "Will I be able to see them?",
      "Viewing the Taurids may be affected by the illumination of the Moon, which could obscure some of the fainter meteors. The Moon will be in a waxing gibbous phase \u2013 going from half moon to full moon.",
      "However, the weather is looking much more favourable for stargazing now. The recent blanket of cloud we have had for several weeks has moved off, leaving a clearer air mass and a much better view of the night sky.",
      "Fog patches may obscure the sky for some - especially across southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, north-west England and north Wales. Any fog will tend to sit in the valleys though, so head for higher ground in these regions to have a better chance of spotting some spectacular shooting stars.",
      "If you do miss this meteor shower you won't have long to wait until the next one, as the Leonid meteor shower is expected to peak next week on the morning of 18 November.",

      "Perseverance during the past three years paid off, however, and the couple\u2019s 1930\u2019s detached house now has improved insulation, a heat pump, and an electric car charging point. Solar panels and battery will follow shortly, if all goes to plan.",
      "Conscious of the confusion around approaches to retrofit, some organisations are moving to improve the advice available to homeowners. Among them is Ecofurb.",
      "\u201cWe can model all the different options that are available, suitable for your home and your budget, and identify a package of measures,\u201d says Liz Lain\u00e9, of Parity Projects, a housing data analysis company, which runs Ecofurb.",
      "The firm offers this initial consultation for free, but full plans, with personalised input from a retrofit coordinator, start at \u00a3470. Ecofurb can also oversee any works as they are carried out by contractors to avoid \u201chorror stories\u201d, says Ms Lain\u00e9.",
      "There are many other organisations that offer to help homeowners plan a retrofit.",
      "The work often involves carrying out a heat-loss survey, to spot cold areas that require insulation, and to better understand a property\u2019s heating demand. Experts might also advise on the suitability of solar panels for your home, for example.",
      "There\u2019s the Get a Heat Pump website, launched by the charities Nesta and The MCS Foundation, which explains what heat pumps are and how they might fit into a home renovation plan.",
      "RICS, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, has also just launched a new retrofit standard for its members \u2013 essentially, it encourages surveyors with the appropriate training to offer their services to homeowners planning or undergoing a retrofit.",
      "The RICS website will soon include a range of retrofit advice and a tool to help homeowners find a suitable surveyor in their local area, says Steve Lees, from the RICS retrofit project team.",
      "Improving the energy efficiency of homes is \u201cessential\u201d for decarbonisation, says Gerald Charles, head of housing retrofit at the Centre for Sustainable Energy, but he adds that the current lack of good advice remains a genuine problem.",
      "\u201cThe industry as a whole don\u2019t appreciate the importance of good retrofit advice,\u201d he says.",
      "One entrepreneur who has noticed a knowledge gap in the market is James Major, founder and chief executive of HubbPro, which helps architects plan energy efficient buildings. Architects don\u2019t always have the latest information about how to incorporate energy-saving technologies into their designs, notes Mr Major.",
      "\u201cClean tech isn\u2019t part of what they do or what they should know \u2013 that\u2019s an engineering function,\u201d he says. And yet architects\u2019 clients increasingly ask about such tech when planning a new home or an extension.",
      "Through an initiative called MyHubb, Mr Major is now offering architects detailed reports that estimate the carbon reduction potential and payback period on retrofitted measures - such as heat pump-based heating systems or solar panels, for instance.",
      "He says these reports cost around \u00a31,000, though he adds that this price is not yet finalised.",
      "Mr Duffy says he will keep looking for solutions to his own retrofit conundrum. But he makes another point. So much of the currently available technology and advice is tailored to individual homeowners.",
      "He suggests that neighbourhood-scale schemes, for example to provide solar power to a whole street, might make more sense and could include more people in one go.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what I would think is the logical way of thinking about this,\u201d he says.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:03:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Big mining firms are switching to driverless trucks and other autonomous equipment.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 20:03:52 GMT",
    "summary": "Gary O'Donoghue looks at Trump's \"trifecta\" of power, and how far it will help him keep his promises.",
    "story": [
      "On election night, Donald Trump repeated the phrase: \"Promises made, promises kept.\"",
      "Now, Republicans have officially taken control of Congress and his \"promises\" are a whole lot easier to keep.",
      "In Washington political parlance, it's called \"a governing trifecta\", when the president's party also controls both chambers of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate.",
      "That control is what Donald Trump's Republican Party now has.",
      "Single-party control was once common, but in recent decades it has become rarer and shorter.  Often, the party in power loses seats when midterm congressional elections roll around two years later.",
      "Both Trump and Joe Biden enjoyed trifectas for their first two years in the White House, but they also saw that having such control is no guarantee a president can get their way.",
      "Seven things Trump says he will do in powerWhen does he become president again?What happens to his legal cases nowHow he pulled off an incredible comeback",
      "Seven things Trump says he will do in power",
      "When does he become president again?",
      "What happens to his legal cases now",
      "How he pulled off an incredible comeback",
      "In his first two years, Trump passed a signature tax bill - reducing corporate taxes from 35% to 21%, and cutting some taxes on individuals.",
      "But with some members of his own party resistant to his surprise ascent to the top in 2016, he struggled with other aims.",
      "His plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) failed when a senator from his own party, John McCain, refused to vote for it. He also failed to pass an infrastructure bill as he had promised.",
      "In his first two years, when the Democrats controlled the House and the Senate, Biden succeeded in passing the American Rescue plan, the Investment and Jobs Act, and the Chips and Science Act. But he, too, had to significantly scale back his sending and investment plans - touted as the Build Back Better package - after opposition from one of his own senators.",
      "A major impediment to total control for either party is that Senate bills require a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes, to bypass the filibuster, which enables senators to delay legislation by keeping debate open-ended. That means that when a party has a simple majority in the Senate, it needs to reach across the aisle to get a bill passed.",
      "Even with a healthy majority in the Senate this time around, Trump will not have the magic 60 seats that would allow him to overcome opposition attempts to delay legislation.",
      "And on Wednesday, Republicans in the Senate selected John Thune as their majority leader over Florida's Rick Scott, the clear favourite in the Trump camp, in a sign some lawmakers may be reasserting their independence (Trump did not officially endorse Scott).",
      "That said, a trifecta, if astutely managed, does open the way for the possibility of major legislative initiatives.",
      "Trump's power advantage could be key in pushing through his big promises such as the largest deportation of migrants in history, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "Using legislation to achieve these ends will make such plans much harder to overturn in the courts - something Donald Trump was plagued by in his first term when he extensively used executive orders that were regularly and often successfully challenged.",
      "The judicial landscape also has changed in Trump's favour.",
      "The signature achievement of his first term was putting three conservatives on the Supreme Court - cementing a two-thirds majority for possibly decades to come.",
      "He also named more than four dozen judges to the federal appeals courts, flipping several circuits to a more conservative bent.",
      "The majority Republicans have in the Senate also provides a key advantage.",
      "Trump will be able to get his nominees for administration posts approved more easily, something he struggled with back in 2017 when internal resistance to him in the Republican Party was still significant.",
      "All this bodes for a busy and possibly turbulent next two years. But, as recent history indicates, these trifectas don't last all that long. The incoming administration will want to get a move on."

      "Chief of Mission Bernard Lee told the BBC that two major lines of trenches had been dug, along with three more limited ones, each some 6m (20 ft) wide.",
      "He estimated that trenches crossed into the AoS in a handful locations, by a couple of metres in each case, but said he had not visited the sites himself.",
      "UNDOF was not able to immediately share visual evidence of the reported incursions, and permission for the BBC to view or film the locations from a nearby observation post has so far not been granted.",
      "Initial searches of satellite photographs have not produced images in enough detail to independently confirm the UN allegations.",
      "The AoS was set up as part of Israel\u2019s ceasefire agreement with Syria in 1974, following Israel\u2019s earlier occupation of the Golan Heights.",

      "Despite the presence of Iran-backed militia groups in Syria, this frontier has remained relatively calm, as Israeli ground forces have battled Iranian allies in Gaza and Lebanon over the past 13 months.",
      "But UNDOF said in a statement that the Syrian authorities had \u201cstrongly protested\u201d the ongoing Israeli work. And that the UN itself had \u201crepeatedly\u201d taken its concerns over the Israeli violations to Israel\u2019s military authorities.",
      "Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) spokesman Lt Col Nadav Shoshani told the BBC that the trenches were designed to protect against infiltration by Iran-backed groups in Syria - and did not break the ceasefire agreement.",
      "\u201cIsraeli officials have been communicating with the UN about these issues,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I can tell you that the IDF is operating on Israeli territory making sure that a terror invasion is not possible, making sure we are defending our borders.\u201d",
      "The threat of a surprise invasion by Israel\u2019s neighbours has loomed larger here since the 7 October Hamas attacks.",
      "\u201cWill [the trenches] stop what happened on 7 October? Yes,\u201d said Bernard Lee.  \u201cCould you get a pick-up truck over it? No.\u201d",
      "But the defences being built along this frontier don\u2019t address the more immediate threat from drones and missiles regularly launched by Iranian militia groups in Syria and Iraq \u2013 and frequently shot down by Israeli forces.",
      "Nor do they address Israel\u2019s concerns about Syria being an \u201coxygen line\u201d for Iran to smuggle weapons to its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah.",
      "Mr Lee said commercial smugglers already used the AoS to smuggle cigarettes and electronics between Syria and Lebanon. And that a new patrol road, built by the UN, is assisting them.",
      "\u201cThey come over the mountain, enter the area of separation with a trail of pack horses, eight at a time, with two armed guys,\u201d he said. \u201cThey unload the pack horses and a pick-up truck meets them at our road: we\u2019ve motorized the smuggling business.\u201d",
      "Asked whether the same route could be used to take weapons from Syria into Lebanon, he replied: \u201cThat is what the IDF are concerned about.\u201d",
      "Israel has also pointed to what it says are \u201cdaily\u201d violations along the demilitarized frontier by Syria.",
      "In May, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UN wrote to the secretary-general to complain about Syrian violations, including \u201carmed presence in the area of separation\u201d which \u201conly heighten tensions in our already volatile region\u201d.",
      "Iran-backed militia in the area are a concern for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime, too, after years of civil war.",
      "It has appeared unwilling to be drawn in to the Israel-Hezbollah war, despite frequent Israeli strikes inside Syria targeting Hezbollah and Iranian positions and weapons shipments.",
      "\u201cThe situation is frightening,\u201d said Farhat, a Syrian hotel owner in the occupied Golan Heights. \u201cOur eyes are looking more to the sky than to the plants. There\u2019s fear here.\u201d",

      "Israel is already fighting Iranian allies - Hamas and Hezbollah - on two of its borders. But more than a year into this regional conflict, friction is also being felt along its quietest frontier.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 09:10:45 GMT",
    "summary": "The singer and actress stars in Emilia P\u00e9rez, a new Netflix musical which has been tipped for awards.",
    "story": [
      "When Emilia P\u00e9rez premiered earlier this year, it became one of the breakout hits of the Cannes Film Festival, where its four lead stars jointly won best actress.",
      "On Wednesday, the Spanish-language musical is released worldwide on Netflix as the film awards race continues to heat up ahead of the Oscars in March.",
      "Selena Gomez, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n and Adriana Paz launched the movie at the London Film Festival last month, where it continued to build its momentum.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez follows a dangerous Mexican Cartel leader (played by Gasc\u00f3n), who asks a high-powered lawyer named Rita (Salda\u00f1a) to help him fake his own death.",
      "But the reason he wants to retire and disappear from the world of crime isn't what you might expect - the drug baron wants to change gender and live a new life as a woman.",
      "The rest of the film focuses on four women, including the newly-transitioned Emilia P\u00e9rez, as they each pursue their own version of happiness in modern-day Mexico.",
      "P\u00e9rez is portrayed by Spanish trans actress Gasc\u00f3n, who has been tipped as a possible best actress contender in the forthcoming awards race.",
      "French director Jacques Audiard came up with the idea for the film after reading a chapter in Boris Razon's 2018 novel \u00c9coute about a drug lord who changes identity.",
      "Audiard went one step further for the film, and made it a story of changing gender.",
      "\"I was less interested in a change of identity to evade competitor drug barons, and more interested in the change of identity for the sake of the person she was and is,\u201d the director tells BBC News. \"I was more interested in the past and what led to that transition.\"",
      "The role required someone very specific \u2013 a trans actress, who was a Spanish speaker, who could also sing and dance.",
      "Recalling the casting process, Gasc\u00f3n explains: \u201cI was contacted when I was in Mexico by a production team, and was told 'We need an actress as crazy as you - you're the only one who can do this role, but you need to learn five songs for tomorrow!'",
      "\u201cAnd I was like 'OK, let's record the whole album and we'll go on tour as soon as you want!\u2019\" she jokes. \u201cBut I did say, \u2018this is going to be difficult, I'm not a singer'. But the team in the film, they worked with me incredibly, they really helped me with all the songs and made it so that we could do the best work possible.\u201d",
      "Asked about Gasc\u00f3n's casting, Audiard adds simply: \u201cWithout her, there would be no film.\u201d",
      "Interestingly, Gasc\u00f3n campaigned to play both the male and female roles \u2013 in other words, the character both before and after transition.",
      "Audiard had originally intended for a different actor to play the male drug lord Manitas, because, the director explains, he was \"uncomfortable asking [Gasc\u00f3n] to revisit something she was moving away from\".",
      "But, Gasc\u00f3n recalled: \u201cI said to Jacques, I want to play this role in the complete arc, because for me it is important to do the full part. It wouldn't be the same film if another actor played [Manitas].\"",
      "That meant using effects and make-up such as a fake beard, so she could play the drug baron in the first section of the musical.",
      "\"This film is this film because the same actress played the complete performance,\" Gasc\u00f3n continues. \"It's that kind of role you have once in your life and I didn't want to lose the opportunity to play this.\u201d",
      "The ongoing debate about whether actors should have lived experience of characters they play is complex, and Gasc\u00f3n herself says: \"I prefer that all actors have the full opportunities. When you chose this career, it's because you want to express another life that's not like your life.",
      "\"But,\" she continues, \"obviously when you are closer to the role of the character, it's better. In this case, I think it's beautiful, because I give all of myself to this role.\"",
      "Gasc\u00f3n has been described as a \"wonderful discovery\" by the Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney, who said she gives \"a magnificent performance\".",
      "\"The warmth, the joyous self-realisation, the complexity and authenticity... that illuminate her characterisation no doubt owe much to the parallels in the Spanish star\u2019s life - in her own words, she was an actor before becoming an actress, a father before becoming a mother.\"",
      "Gomez plays the drug lord's wife, who is kept in the dark about her former lover's new identity, while Paz portrays Emilia's new romantic interest after transitioning.",
      "Reviews of Emilia P\u00e9rez, which is released on Netflix next month, have been generally positive so far.",
      "\"It's a wild, gritty, glitter-soaked ride that defies convention and classification,\" said Entertainment Weekly's Maureen Lee Lenker.",
      "She praised the film's performances, commenting: \"Selena Gomez is a welcome surprise, shedding any remaining hints of her Disney Channel origins in her portrayal of a hard-loving wife of a narco.",
      "\"The film's climax in particular allows Gomez to shine as a dramatic actress in new ways. She conveys heartache and anguish through a tortured physicality that propels her into the unpredictable state of a woman on the verge of something dangerous.\"",
      "Asked by the BBC's Graham Norton if it was comfortable going back to the world of singing and dancing for the musical, Gomez said: \"No, because this was completely different.",
      "\"It was intricate dance moves I never knew my body could do, and it was also me playing a character so if anything I tried to avoid what I was comfortable with.\"",
      "The Telegraph's Tim Robey described the film as \"amazingly confident \u2013 it\u2019s clever, earnest, ridiculous, knowing, forceful and absolutely bonkers\", while Hoai-Tran Bui of Inverse said it was \"an emotionally fulfilling triumph\".",
      "Not all critics were as enthusiastic about the film, however.",
      "\"Emilia P\u00e9rez was originally intended to be an opera, which perhaps partly explains its saccharine sentimentality, repetitive lyrics, and diverging story branches. But that doesn\u2019t excuse its almost random, whiplash-inducing tonal pivots,\" said Slant's Kyle Turner.",
      "However, Lauren Bradshaw of Fangirl Freakout said: \"Emilia P\u00e9rez is a magnificent, genre-bending thrill ride that transcends the typical movie construct, breathing a fresh burst of excitement into the way we think about film.\"",
      "As an actress, Gomez is best known for starring in Only Murders in the Building, but also has a successful singing career with hits including Back To You, Wolves and Love You Like a Love Song.",
      "Her co-star Salda\u00f1a, meanwhile, has starred in a large number of blockbusters in the last two decades, with roles in the Avatar and Guardians of the Galaxy franchises.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Emilia P\u00e9rez could be a big awards player, but Academy voters may see an opportunity to recognise Salda\u00f1a's box office success via this more critically acclaimed work.",
      "Their co-star Adriana Paz is a Mexican actress whose credits include Not Forgotten, Hilda and La Caridad, while Gasc\u00f3n also had a successful acting career before transitioning in 2018.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez has already been selected as France's entry for the best international feature category at the Oscars, which take place in March.",
      "But despite the film's awards traction, Paz tells BBC News: \u201cI never think about that, really. I get into a project because I'm interested in the topic, character, director or actors, you do it because it really matters to you.\u201d",
      "She adds that the attention in recent months is unlike anything she's experienced in her career. \"It's been a lot,\" she says, \"because I've been working in Spain and have a long career in Mexico, and people have a recognition of my work, but not like [it's been] since Cannes.",
      "\"In my country they feel very proud of me, and there was a lot of people that didn't know about my work, and now thanks to Emilia they are getting to know my work... and they see 'we feel so proud as Mexicans that you won this award.'\"",
      "After the success of Emilia Perez, Paz says she would \"love to\" appear in more musicals in future, and loves singing.",
      "But Gasc\u00f3n has a slightly different take. \"I don't like musicals!\" she laughs, adding that she hopes casting directors aren't too enthusiastic about her performance.",
      "\"I don't like to sing, I don't want to be compared to Shakira or something like that, and I don't like dancing, so please don't call me!\"",

      "The climate-damaging vapours left behind by jet planes could be easily tackled, aviation experts say, with a new study suggesting they could be eliminated for a few pounds per flight.",
      "Jet condensation trails, or contrails, have spawned wild conspiracy theories alleging mind control and the spreading of disease, but scientists say the real problem is their warming effect.",
      "Researchers argue these smoky trails essentially double the amount of heating that\u2019s caused by aviation's use of fossil fuels.",

      "Contrails form in the sky in the same way that your breath goes misty on a chilly morning.",

      "\u201cThe scale of the warming that's associated with them is roughly having a similar impact to that of aviation carbon emissions.\u201d",
      "Conspiracy theories have grown up around contrails, with some people alleging they are in fact \u201cchemtrails\u201d that contain chemical or biological substances.",

      "\u201cIt is unfortunate that these conspiracy theories are muddying the water on an issue where we need a lot of consensus, a lot of clarity,\u201d said Matteo Mirolo, from Breakthrough Energy, and one of the organisers of the COP29 discussion about the contrails.",

      "According to the Transport & Environment study, some 80% of the warming associated with contrails is generated by just 3% of flights.",
      "Tweaking the flight paths of a handful of aircraft could reduce contrail warming by more than half by 2040, at a cost of less than \u00a34 per flight.",
      "Geography and a flight's latitude have a strong influence on whether a contrail is warming. Flights over North America, Europe and the North Atlantic region accounted for more than half of global contrail warming in 2019, the report said.",
      "Time of day also influences the climate effects of contrails. Those formed by evening and night flights have the largest warming contribution. Seasonality is also important - the most warming contrails tend to occur in winter.",
      "\u201cPlanes are already flying around thunderstorms and turbulence areas,\u201d Mr Lopez de la Osa said.",
      "\u201cWe will need to add one more constraint to flight planning, which is avoiding areas of contrail formation.\u201d",

      "Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News on Sunday \"we know he promised to sign an executive order to secure the southern border\".",
      "\"We know that on day one he is going to launch the largest mass deportation of illegal immigrants in American history,\" she said.",
      "In the week since his re-election, Trump has prioritised filling leadership positions that would oversee immigration, suggesting he is preparing to tackle his plans for border policy early.",
      "He tapped veteran immigration official Tom Homan as his \"border tsar\"; selected South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to oversee homeland security; and appointed Steven Miller as White House deputy chief of staff for policy. Mr Miller is best known for shaping some of Trump's most restrictive policies on illegal immigration during his first term.",
      "Any mass deportation programme could face logistical difficulties as well as a flurry of legal challenges from immigration and human rights activists.",
      "Trump could also re-implement his \"Remain in Mexico\" policy that required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while claims are processed.",
      "President Joe Biden had called the programme \"inhumane\" and tried to end it on his first day in office, but faced legal challenges. In 2022, the Supreme Court allowed him to move ahead.",
      "During the Trump administration, about 70,000 asylum seekers were returned to Mexico to wait for their hearings.",
      "Another day one promise was to end birthright citizenship - the 150-year-old principle that says anyone born on US soil is an American citizen.",
      "It's not clear how Trump plans to achieve this policy. He has pledged an executive order but birthright citizenship is explicitly guaranteed by the US Constitution, meaning it can only be altered under specific circumstances.",
      "He would need states to agree to a national convention or a two-thirds vote in favour in the narrowly split Congress to propose a change, then subsequent approval by three-fourths of state legislatures - of which Republicans control just over half.",
      "How would Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations of migrants work?",
      "What Trump's got wrong on birthright law",
      "6 January",
      "Trump did not mention pardons in his victory speech, but he has long suggested that pardoning those convicted of storming the Capitol in 2021 would be a priority.",
      "\"Oh, absolutely, I would. If they're innocent, I would pardon them,\" Trump said during a panel at the National Association of Black Journalists.",
      "US presidents have wide authority to forgive people convicted of federal crimes or end their prison sentences. Prosecutors may also decide to drop pending cases depending on who Trump might choose to pardon.",
      "What's less clear is who might get a pardon.",
      "At one point, Trump told CNN: \"I am inclined to pardon many of them. I can't say for every single one, because a couple of them, probably they got out of control.\"",
      "Ms Leavitt told the Washington Post that he will decide \u201con a case-by-case basis when he is back in the White House\u201d.",
      "More than 1,500 people were arrested in connection with the Capitol riot. According to federal numbers, more than 750 of them were sentenced for crimes ranging from trespassing to assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.",
      "Jack Smith",
      "Trump has also faced his own legal challenges over his actions following the 2020 election and a separate classified documents case.",
      "Special Counsel Jack Smith, a veteran prosecutor appointed to oversee the US Department of Justice's investigations into Trump, filed charges, to which the president-elect has pleaded not guilty.",
      "This week, sources told CBS News that Mr Smith plans to resign before Trump takes office and avoid Trump's promises to fire him. The BBC's US media partner also reported that his office would wind down the two cases it was pursuing against Trump.",
      "It remains unclear whether Trump and his supporters will still try to punish Mr Smith. Congressional Republicans have reportedly implied they intend to investigate his work.",
      "\"Jack Smith\u2019s abuse of the justice system cannot go unpunished\", billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk posted on social media.",
      "Trump had said firing Jack Smith is one of his top priorities.",
      "\"I would fire him within two seconds. He\u2019ll be one of the first things addressed,\" he said in an interview in October.",
      "Trump regularly railed against the special counsel in interviews and online, calling him a \"crooked person\", a \"scoundrel\" and other insults.",
      "Smith's cases were already facing an uncertain future. The Supreme Court ruled in July that presidents have partial immunity from criminal prosecution for their conduct in office, undermining Mr Smith's work.",
      "Trump's electoral win also gives him the power to pardon himself of any federal crimes, though no president has done so before.",

      "What happens to Trump\u2019s convictions and legal cases after election win?",
      "Paris climate agreement",
      "In his 2016 campaign, Trump made withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement a priority. Within six months of taking office, the United States moved to exit the landmark deal.",
      "President Joe Biden made rejoining the agreement one of his top priorities when he ran against Trump in 2020. Biden signed a letter requesting the US be readmitted on his first day in office.",
      "How will Trump respond in his second term? Media reports suggest that his team is preparing orders to withdraw once again when he takes office in January.",
      "Leaving the agreement would mean the US is no longer beholden to meeting set carbon emissions reductions.",
      "Among other priorities at odds with the Paris standards, Trump has said he wants to prioritise US production of oil and gas. He promised to quickly expedite permitting and fracking - \"We\u2019re drilling, drilling, drilling,\" he told Fox News host Sean Hannity last year.",
      "Trump has also criticised the Biden administration's plans to expand wind energy and increase electric car production, which could be early targets in his new administration.",
      "Russia and Ukraine",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump said he could end the war in Ukraine \"in a day\". He has also repeatedly criticised the US government's continued support of Ukraine, casting the war as a drain on resources.",
      "He has not yet given specifics on how he would negotiate the war's end beyond saying he would help the two countries strike a deal.",
      "Since his re-election, Trump has spoken to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a call that lasted \"about half an hour\", with billionaire Elon Musk also taking part. A source told the BBC that \"it was not really a conversation to talk about very substantial things\".",
      "The Kremlin denied that Trump held a call with Vladimir Putin, though media reports said Trump warned the Russian president against escalating the war in Ukraine.",
      "Trade and economy",
      "The economy is an issue that Trump heavily campaigned on, vowing to end inflation as soon as he takes office.",
      "\u201cWe will target everything from car affordability to housing affordability to insurance costs to supply chain issues,\u201d Trump has said.",
      "\u201cI will instruct my cabinet that I expect results within the first 100 days, or much sooner than that.\u201d",
      "He said he would sign an executive order that directs every cabinet secretary and agency head to \u201cuse every tool and authority at their disposal\u201d to defeat inflation and to bring consumer prices down.",
      "Trump\u2019s plan includes imposing tariffs on imported goods, especially those coming in from China, arguing that these taxes would keep manufacturing jobs in the US.",
      "It\u2019s still unclear how widespread these tariffs will be, but Trump has raised the prospect of at least a 10% across-the-board tariff on imported goods, as well as a 60% import tax on goods from China.",
      "He also vowed to target Mexico with his tariffs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to inform (the Mexican president) on Day 1 or sooner that if they don\u2019t stop this onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country, I\u2019m going to immediately impose a 25% tariff on everything they send into the US,\u201d he has said.",
      "These tariffs would probably not need congressional approval.",
      "Trump already introduced tariffs in his first term, citing Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which empowers a president to impose duties on goods that could affect US national security.",
      "Another promise is to \u201cend the Biden-Harris war on American energy\u201d, Trump has said, vowing to ramp up oil drilling and fracking as a way to lower the cost of energy bills for consumers.",
      "Trump can do this with an executive order that rolls back environmental protections, which would allow him to halt clean energy projects and scrap climate targets set by the Biden administration.",
      "The president-elect has also vowed to fire Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, on day one. Gensler, who was appointed by Biden, pushed for climate disclosure rules and strong enforcement of the cryptocurrency market.",
      "Trump has championed cryptocurrency, and his election saw the value of Bitcoin go up by 30% in the past week due to an expectation that his administration will be more crypto-friendly.",
      "Title X",
      "Donald Trump has vowed to undo the changes made by President Biden to Title X, the country\u2019s only national, federally-funded family planning programme.",
      "In 2019, during his first term, Trump\u2019s administration implemented a new rule that prohibited any health provider in the Title X network from mentioning abortion to patients, even if a patient raised questions about it themselves.",
      "The change effectively stripped tens of millions of dollars from organisations such as Planned Parenthood that offer or refer patients for abortions.",
      "But just months later, when Biden took office, he had that policy reversed.",
      "Now, it\u2019s expected that Trump will change the rules again.",

    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk has been tasked with leading incoming President Donald Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "In a statement on social media, the US president-elect said Musk - along with former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy - would \"dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies\".",
      "It is a role that the tech entrepreneur has arguably prepared for through his business leadership, and one he has spent months pushing for.",

      "What top team picks tell us about Trump 2.0",
      "Will Trump be sentenced over hush money case?",
      "Second-term priorities take shape",
      "Musk told a Trump rally in October that he believed the US government's budget could be cut by \"at least\" $2tn from about $6.5tn. He has also frequently suggested the number of government employees could be significantly reduced.",
      "Ramaswamy, meanwhile, has put forward plans to scrap a number of federal departments including the Department of Education, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI.",
      "Railing against regulation",
      "Musk has cast his plans to optimise government efficiency in heroic terms, pointing to his hopes of one day colonising Mars, while arguing that the feat would only be possible \"so long as it is not smothered by bureaucracy\".",
      "At the time, he said creating the new Doge was \"the only path to extending life beyond Earth\".",
      "Any major cuts to government agencies could also have potentially significant implications for his business interests, which are closely entwined with the government.",
      "Rocket firm SpaceX alone has more than $8bn-worth of ongoing contracts with the US government, according to public contracting sites, and could stand to benefit further from closer government ties.",
      "Meanwhile, his electric car company Tesla is facing investigations from numerous government agencies over issues such as the safety of its self-driving features. His desire to cut regulation could affect such probes.",
      "Musk in recent years has repeatedly accused regulators of launching trivial probes and standing in the way of his companies.",
      "In September he threatened to sue the Federal Aviation Administration over its plans to fine his SpaceX company $633,000 for alleged licence infringements related to some of its rocket launches from Cape Canaveral in Florida. He accused the agency of \"regulatory overreach\".",
      "Musk \"stands to benefit personally from a lot of the deregulation that he touts,\" says Christopher Phelps, a professor of modern US political history, adding: \"I think putting someone who is a billionaire and runs major corporations in charge of a federal project of deregulation is innately full of conflicts of interest.\"",
      "Others said Musk, who has long described himself as having a libertarian bent, appeared to be a true believer in the benefits of smaller government.",
      "\"There\u2019s no doubt that Musk has significant vested interests in the US regulatory landscape as a result of his many business enterprises,\" says Prof Gift.",
      "\"At the same time, it\u2019s hard to make the case that this is the only impetus driving him.",
      "\"Musk has undertaken huge personal and political risks in coming out for Trump, and many of his activities and rhetoric seem to reflect an individual ideologically committed to causes he believes in.\"",
      "\"Clearly he has got skin in the game and there\u2019s a self-interest, but equally you can have a sincere belief that there is too much government regulation and too much government bureaucracy,\" says Alex Waddan, a professor of US politics at the University of Leicester.",
      "Reward for loyalty",
      "For years, Musk did not play a big role in politics, despite his large fortune, now worth more than $300bn, according to Forbes estimates.",
      "But he spoke out against the pandemic lockdowns of 2020. His criticism of the Biden administration mounted after the White House did not invite Tesla to an electric car summit in 2021.",
      "He formally endorsed Trump this year after an assassination attempt, ultimately donating a reported $200m (\u00a3157m) to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign and appearing at numerous rallies.",
      "Prof Phelps describes Musk's relationship with Trump as \"transactional\", adding that the new role \"gives him a lot of symbolic clout - and possibly the clout to get the things that matter most to him done\".",
      "As the South African-born billionaire is not a US citizen by birth, Musk cannot become president - something that has frustrated other famous faces who became involved in politics in the past.",
      "But he can have an influence on US policy, and Trump will have a sympathetic adviser to call upon.",
      "\"Trump is looking to surround himself with loyalists in his new administration, and there\u2019s no-one who\u2019s been more loyal than Musk since he announced his endorsement for Trump,\" says Thomas Gift, a political science professor and director of the Centre on US Politics at University College London.",
      "\"Not only did Musk go 'all in' in supporting Trump personally and financially during the campaign, but he\u2019s also evolved into a trusted adviser on topics as diverse as technology policy to the war in Ukraine.\"",
      "In an early sign of the influence the tech entrepreneur may be rewarded with for his loyalty, Musk was party to a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky following the election. The war in Ukraine will be a major foreign policy concern when Trump takes office.",
      "\"That is actually quite extraordinary,\" says Prof Waddan. \"Normally, even your biggest donors wouldn\u2019t get that kind of access.\"",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Musk first raised the idea of a cost-cutting effort while hosting Trump on X this summer. The official name is a winking reference to a meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog, which then gave its name to the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, a favourite of Musk, which has seen its value soar since the election.",
      "Prof Phelps says the name is \"a nod to crypto deregulation being part of what they\u2019ll do\".",
      "But it is not clear how much of Musk's talk of cutting might actually become reality.",
      "For one thing, the new department will not have an official role, but provide \"advice and guidance from outside government\" according to the announcement.",
      "Experts have also warned that cuts of the scale discussed could be enormously disruptive - and run into pushback in Congress - depending on how rapidly they are implemented.",
      "Musk himself acknowledged the risks, saying Americans should be ready to stomach temporary hardship for long-run gain.",
      "The way he has run his own firms may hint at what Americans can expect.",
      "After his October 2022 takeover of the social media platform Twitter - which he branded as X - Musk introduced radical changes, including the reduction X's workforce from around 8,000 to 1,500 in a matter of weeks.",
      "\"His idea of efficiency was to let a lot of people go,\" says Alex Waddan, a professor of US politics at the University of Leicester.",
      "Musk also loosened content moderation, stopped verifying accounts and welcomed users back to the platform who had been banned for violating its rules on hate speech and disinformation.",
      "Among the users he reinstated was Trump, who had been banned following the Capitol riot in January 2021 after continuing to claim the 2020 election had been rigged against him.",
      "Critics argue his changes have given prominence to hate-speech and misinformation - though Musk maintains the site is politically neutral.",
      "The overhaul also prompted an exodus of advertisers, the main way the site has made money. Though Musk has introduced new ways to raise revenue, such as paid subscriptions, the company today is worth far less than the $44bn Musk paid for it just two years ago.",
      "Musk's record at his other big companies - Tesla and SpaceX - is stronger.",
      "Among car companies, Tesla stands out for making electric vehicles at a large profit, thanks in part to streamlined operations. His rocket firm SpaceX is credited with enabling rocket launches at significantly lower cost.",
      "\"As a serial entrepreneur, Musk has been relentless in trying to improve institutional efficiency at his own enterprises,\" Prof Gift says.",
      "He adds that though Musk's primary role will be \"slashing through the thicket of red tape that is the US federal government\", his position will also give him influence in the new administration.",
      "\"While his role in the Department of Government Efficiency will be a more informal one, there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s got Trump's ear - at least for the moment.\"",

      "Stephen Miller, who has been Trump\u2019s close adviser and speechwriter since 2015, is Trump\u2019s choice for White House deputy chief of staff for policy.  He will likely shape any plans for mass deportations - and pare back both undocumented and legal immigration. During Trump's first term, Miller was involved in developing some of the administration's strictest immigration policies.",
      "Thomas Homan, acting director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency in Trump\u2019s first term, supported the president\u2019s policy of separating undocumented families detained at the US-Mexico border. Now he\u2019s back with an even broader portfolio, as Trump\u2019s \u201cimmigration tsar\u201d.",
      "\u201cI will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen,\u201d Homan said at a conservative conference in July.",
      "Critics have warned that Trump\u2019s mass deportation plan could cost upwards of $300bn. In an interview with NBC News last week, however, the president-elect said cost was not an issue.",
      "\u201cWhen people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries, and now they\u2019re going to go back to those countries because they\u2019re not staying here,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no price tag.\u201d",

      "China hawks take flight",
      "Many conservatives believe that China poses the single greatest threat to continued US global dominance, both economically and militarily. While Trump has been more circumspect, limiting most of his China critiques to the realm of trade, he is filling his foreign policy team with vocal China critics.",
      "The president-elect picked Florida Congressman Mike Waltz, a retired Army colonel, as his national security adviser \u2013 a key foreign policy post within the White House. Waltz has said the US is in a \u201ccold war\u201d with China and was one of the first members of Congress to call for a US boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.",
      "In October, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Trump\u2019s pick for US ambassador to the UN, accused China of \u201cblatant and malicious election interference\u201d amid reports that China-backed hackers attempted to gather information from the former president\u2019s phones.",
      "While Trump has yet to officially name his choice for secretary of state, Florida Senator Marco Rubio \u2013 another China hawk \u2013 appears to be the leading contender for the top diplomatic job. In 2020, Rubio was sanctioned by the Chinese government after he pushed measures to punish the nation for its crackdown on pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong.",
      "US-China relations were often rocky during Trump's first term, amidst trade disputes and the Covid pandemic. The Biden administration, which kept many of Trump's China tariffs and imposed some new ones, only somewhat calmed the waters.

      "Elon Musk, the wealthiest man in the world, has been a full-time presence at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago transition headquarters. According to media reports, he is advising the president-elect on cabinet nominees and even joined a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week.",

      "Musk\u2019s political action committee spent around $200m to help Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and he promises to continue to fund the group\u2019s efforts to advance the president-elect\u2019s agenda and help Republican candidates in upcoming congressional elections.",
      "Meanwhile, it remains to be seen where Robert F Kennedy Jr, another key figure, lands. Trump has said that he plans to give the former Democrat and vaccine sceptic, who abandoned his independent bid and endorsed the Republican, a role in making America \u201chealthy\u201d again.",
      "\u201cHe wants to do some things, and we\u2019re going to let him go to it,\u201d Trump said in his election victory speech.",
      "Prioritising presidential power over Congress",
      "As Trump takes office, Republicans have control of the Senate and could still take the House, albeit by a slim margin. However, the president-elect\u2019s early actions suggest he is more concerned with exercising his presidential power than working with the legislative branch.",
      "Last week, he posted on social media that the Senate\u2019s Republican leadership should smooth the way for more presidential \u201crecess appointments\u201d \u2013 allowing him to fill top administration jobs without Senate approval when Congress is not in session. The move would strengthen presidential power by undercutting the chamber\u2019s constitutional role to \u201cadvise and consent\u201d on political appointees.",
      "Meanwhile, the president-elect keeps chipping away at those narrow congressional majorities. Senators who move to administration roles can quickly be replaced by appointment from the governor of their home state. But any House vacancies \u2013 such as ones created by Stefanik and Waltz\u2019s departures \u2013 require special elections that can take months to schedule.",

      "Even in the best of circumstances, congressional legislation takes time, effort and compromise. Executive action, such as new immigration enforcement, can be done with the stroke of a presidential pen.",
      "Trump\u2019s actions indicate he is, at least at the moment, more focused on the latter.",
      "Rewarding loyalists",
      "Trump has only just begun filling out the thousands of jobs that open up with a new presidential administration, not including the senior-level career bureaucrats he has said he will replace.",
      "In 2016, as a political newcomer, he had to rely on more establishment Republicans for key roles. This time, he has a wealth of prospective candidates with proven track records of supporting him and after eight years, Trump loyalists are the Republican establishment.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump named South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary, and Fox News host and conservative author Pete Hegseth as defence secretary.",
      "The latter has been particularly controversial, given his lack of experience navigating the sprawling US military bureaucracy and penchant for inflammatory remarks. For Trump, however, status as an outsider and a willingness to lean into hot-button cultural issues are a strength, not a flaw.",
      "And above all else, Hegseth and Noem have been fierce Trump defenders from the start.",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s other picks, like Rubio and Stefanik, were critics of Trump early in his first presidential bid, but they have now spent years demonstrating that their harsh words are a thing of the past.",
      "Rubio, who ran for president against Trump in 2016, may still have White House ambitions, however. Trump often soured on appointees who seemed drawn to the limelight during his first term, and even the warmest of relationships could go bad.",

      "Hegseth, 44, who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, will be responsible for the world's most powerful military in his first political role.",
      "Announcing his choice on Tuesday, Trump described him as \"tough, smart and a true believer in America First\".",
      "The news came on the same day Trump announced another political newcomer, billionaire Elon Musk, would take a government cost-cutting role.",
      "Trump's administration is taking shape after his win in last week's presidential election. Hegseth was one of a flurry of security appointments that also included Trump's pick of John Ratcliffe to head the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).",
      "If confirmed for his role by the US Senate, Hegseth will arrive at the Pentagon with decisions to make on issues such as military assistance for Israel during its campaign in Gaza, and on support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's invasion.",
      "Trump wants the US to disentangle itself from foreign conflicts generally. During the election campaign, he criticised the Biden administration's expenditure to support Kyiv.",

      "Also on Tuesday, Trump confirmed that he wanted South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to play a significant role as homeland security secretary. Another military veteran, Michael Waltz, was chosen by Trump as national security adviser - meaning he will advise the president on foreign threats.",
      "Senator Marco Rubio - who shares Waltz's hawkish views on China - is expected to be Trump's future secretary of state, sources have told the BBC's US partner, CBS News. But the pick is not yet confirmed.",
      "Republicans have won back control of the Senate, the upper chamber of Congress, and are inching towards a majority in the House, the lower chamber, as vote-counting continues.",
      "Some of the government appointments - including Hegseth's - require a vote of approval by senators, although Trump, also a Republican, has demanded that the next leader of the US Senate let him bypass this process. He can give out other jobs directly.",
      "Senate Republicans are due to vote on a new leader on Wednesday - the day that Trump is also expected to visit the outgoing president, Joe Biden, at the White House as part of the traditional transfer of power.",
      "Who is Pete Hegseth?",
      "Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Ivy League graduate Hegseth has in recent years worked as a conservative commentator. He lives with his wife and seven children in Tennessee.",
      "He has hosted programmes on Fox News, using his platform to draw attention to military and veterans' issues. He had his last day at Fox on Tuesday.",
      "He is reported by US media to have successfully lobbied Trump during his first presidency to pardon servicemen accused of war crimes.",
      "In his statement announcing Hegseth as his pick for defence secretary on Tuesday, Trump highlighted the former soldier's education at Princeton and Harvard universities, and his military experience in Afghanistan and Iraq.",
      "\"With Pete at the helm, America\u2019s enemies are on notice - our military will be great again, and America will never back down,\" Trump wrote in a post.",
      "The president-elect also drew attention to Hegseth's work as a published author. He said the book The War on Warrior \"reveals the leftwing betrayal of our warriors, and how we must return our military to meritocracy, lethality, accountability, and excellence\".",
      "What has he previously said about the military?",
      "Hegseth has been an outspoken opponent of what he has referred to as \"woke\" policies within the US military and its leadership.",
      "\"The dumbest phrase on planet earth in the military is our diversity is our strength,\" Hegseth said on a podcast this month.",
      "One of his tasks as defence secretary could be to act on Trump's campaign promises to get rid of US generals who he accuses of pursuing progressive policies in the force.",
      "Before his selection by Trump, Hegseth was asked on the same podcast about what changes he would make in the military. He referred to \"first of all\" firing the US' top military officer, Gen Charles \"CQ\" Brown Jr, saying people involved in diversity, equality or inclusion policies had \"got to go\".",
      "\"Either you're in for war fighting and that's it, that's the only litmus test we care about,\" Hegseth told the Shawn Ryan Show, in an episode released last week.",
      "Gen Brown is a former fighter pilot with command experience in the Pacific and Middle East, and was appointed into the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff role by President Joe Biden last year.",
      "On the same podcast, Hegseth also said \"whatever\" combat standards were in 1995, \"let's just make those the standards\".",
      "What has the reaction been?",
      "Hegseth's pick has been welcomed by a number of prominent Republican figures, but other reactions have been more varied.",
      "North Carolina senator Thom Tillis told Associated Press the choice was \"interesting\", and Senator Tommy Tuberville, of Alabama, said he would \"have to think\" about what he thought of the appointment.",
      "Incoming national security advisor Waltz said Hegseth \"has the grit\" to make \"real reform\" happen at the Pentagon. Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said the job \"should not be an entry-level position\".",
      "Posting on X, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said the appointment of Hegseth as defence secretary would \"make us less safe and must be rejected\".",
      "\"A Fox & Friends weekend co-host is not qualified to be the Secretary of Defense,\" she added. \"I lead the Senate military personnel panel. All three of my brothers served in uniform. I respect every one of our servicemembers.\"",

      "Out of all of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters, Derrick Evans has a particular reason to be happy with November\u2019s election results \u2013 he hopes the president-elect will give him a pardon for participating in riot at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.",
      "\u201cA pardon will be life changing,\u201d said Evans, who was a member of the West Virginia legislature when he and at least 2,000 others stormed Congress. It was part of an effort to overturn the results of the US election, inspired by the false belief that it was Trump, not President Joe Biden, who had won.",
      "He reached an agreement with prosecutors which saw him plead guilty to civil disorder and spent three months in federal prison in 2022. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly said he would pardon the rioters, whom he has called \u201cpatriots\u201d and \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d. But who exactly might be pardoned - and when - is still an open question.",

      "He repeated the pledge at a National Association of Black Journalists forum in Chicago in July.",
      "\"Oh, absolutely, I would,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they're innocent, I would pardon them.\"",
      "But he has stopped short of proposing a blanket pardon, at one point telling CNN: \"I am inclined to pardon many of them. I can't say for every single one, because a couple of them, probably they got out of control.\"",
      "His campaign has previously said decisions would be made \u201con a case-by-case basis when he is back in the White House\u201d.",
      "Arrests still being made",
      "The events of 6 January resulted in one of the largest federal investigations in US history. Nearly 600 people have been charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding police officers.",
      "Some of those who have been given the longest sentences, such as Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and Enrique Tarrio, leader of the Proud Boys, did not participate in the violence inside the building. Instead, they were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other felonies for organising the melee.",
      "Arrests are still being made. In an update issued last week, the FBI said it is still looking for nine suspects wanted for violent assaults on police officers.",
      "But with Trump coming back to the White House, the future of the investigation remains uncertain.",
      "Citing justice department sources, NBC News reported that officials are focusing on trying the \u201cmost egregious\u201d cases before Trump\u2019s inauguration on 20 January.",
      "Delayed hearings",
      "In the meantime, several Capitol riot defendants have asked for hearings to be delayed in anticipation of pardons.",
      "Among them are Christopher Carnell, a North Carolina man who was found guilty of several riot-related charges earlier in the year.  His lawyers asked for a hearing to be delayed last week because of possible \"clemency actions relevant to his case\u201d, but the request was turned down.",
      "Jonathanpeter Klein, who along with his brother Matthew pleaded guilty to several charges in July, asked for his sentencing hearing, scheduled for 15 November, to be delayed. That request, too, was turned down.",
      "A lawyer for Joe Biggs, a member of the Proud Boys who was handed one of the longest riot-related sentences, told reporters that he would be asking Trump for a pardon.",
      "Biggs was sentenced to 17 years in prison in 2023 after being convicted of crimes including seditious conspiracy, intimidation or threats to prevent officials from discharging their duties, and interference with law enforcement during civil disorder.",
      "During the riot, Biggs and others led a group of Proud Boys, tearing through barriers and barging into the Senate chamber.",
      "At trial, Biggs and others argued they were merely following Trump\u2019s orders. His lawyer, Norman Pattis, told reporters in Florida that he would be seeking a pardon from the Trump administration.",
      "Wendy Via, co-founder of the not-for-profit Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), said that there is already a sense of excitement among rioters and their supporters.",
      "\u201cFolks on fringe sites are calling for the release of what they are calling the Jan 6 \u2018prisoners of war\u2019 or \u2018hostages\u2019,\u201d she said.",
      "They include Jake Lang, who is charged with a number of crimes including assaulting police officers, and who regularly posts online from his jail cell in New York.",

      "For the moment, the release of everyone charged with riot-related offences seems unlikely, but non-violent offenders such as Derrick Evans have called for large numbers to be freed.",
      "And, he suggested, a pardon would not be enough to compensate him and others for the time they spent behind bars.",

      "Rather, he has said families could be \"deported together\", when asked whether deportations could be carried out without separating families.",

      "Older, white conservatives were reducing in number, and non-white Americans were projected to be in the majority by 2044. College-educated professionals, younger people, black Americans, Latinos and other ethnic minorities, and blue-collar workers were part of a \u201ccoalition of the ascendant\u201d.",
      "These voters were left-leaning on cultural issues and supportive of an active federal government and a strong social safety net. And they constituted a majority in enough states to ensure a Democratic lock on the Electoral College \u2013 and the presidency.",

      "Cracks began forming when non-college educated voters slipped away from the Democrats in midterm elections in 2010 and 2014. They then broke en masse to Trump in 2016. While Joe Biden, with his working-class-friendly reputation built over half a century, won enough back to take the White House in 2020, his success proved to be only a temporary reprieve.",
      "How small gains delivered Trump a big win",
      "Why Latinos flocked to Trump's coalition",
      "This year, Trump supplemented his gains with the blue-collar workers by also cutting into the Democratic margins among young, Latino and black voters. He has carved up the coalition of the ascendant.",
      "According to exit polls, Trump won:",
      "- 13% of the black vote in 2024 compared to Republican John McCain\u2019s 4% against Obama",
      "- 46% of the Latino vote this time, while McCain got 31% in 2008",
      "- 43% of voters under 30 against the 32% for McCain",

      "\u201cI started to see realignment could happen because the Democrats are not in line with the thinking of the country,\" the president-elect told NBC News.",
      "Immigration and identity politics",
      "Trump did it with a hard-line message on immigration that included border enforcement and mass deportations \u2013 policies that Biden and the Democrats recoiled from when they took power back from Trump in 2021, lest they anger immigrant rights activists in their liberal base.",
      "Illegal border crossings reached record levels under the Biden administration, with more than eight million encounters with migrants at the border with Mexico.",
      "\u201cIf you watch a video from Hillary Clinton back in 2008 in the primaries, she talks about making sure there's wall-building, making sure that immigrants who violate the law get deported, making sure everybody learns English,\u201d said Kevin Marino Cabrera, a Republican commissioner in Miami-Dade County. \u201cIt's funny how far to the left [the Democrats] have gone.\u201d",
      "This week, Trump became the first Republican since 1988 to win that heavily Latino county in Florida. He also won Starr County in south Texas, with its 97% Latino population, with 57% of the vote. In 2008, only 15% of the county voted for McCain, the Republican.",
      "Mike Madrid, an anti-Trump Republican strategist who specialises in Latino voting trends, told the BBC that the problem with \u201cdemography is destiny\u201d was that it risked treating all non-white Americans as an \u201caggrieved racial minority\u201d. \u201cBut that is not and nor has it ever been the way Latinos have viewed themselves,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cI hate that if you\u2019re black, you've got to be a Democrat or you hate black people and you hate your community,\u201d Kenard Holmes, a 20-year-old student in South Carolina, told the BBC during the presidential primaries earlier this year. He said he agreed with Republicans on some things and felt Democratic politicians took black voters for granted.",
      "With some states still tabulating their results, Trump currently has improved on his electoral margins in at least 2,367 US counties, while slipping in just 240.",
      "It wasn\u2019t just the number of counties that Trump won that made a difference, either. Kamala Harris needed to post significant margins in the cities to offset Republican strength in rural areas. She consistently fell short.",
      "In Detroit\u2019s Wayne County, for example, which the latest US Census reports is 38% black, Harris won 63% of the vote \u2013 significantly lower than Joe Biden\u2019s 68% in 2020 and Obama\u2019s 74% in 2008.",
      "Polls consistently suggested that the economy, along with immigration, were the two issues of highest importance to voters - and where polls indicated Trump had an advantage over Harris.",
      "His economic message cut across racial divides.",
      "\u201cWe're just sick of hearing about identity politics,\" said Nicole Williams, a white bartender with a black husband and biracial children in Las Vegas, Nevada \u2013 one of the key battleground states that Trump flipped this year.",
      "\u201cWe're just American, and we just want what's best for Americans,\" she said.",

      "Democrats are already engaged in considerable soul-searching, as they come to grips with an election defeat that has delivered the White House, the Senate and, perhaps, the House of Representatives to Republican control.",
      "Various elements within the party are offering their own, often conflicting, advice on the best path from the wilderness back to power.",
      "Left-wing Senator Bernie Sanders, who twice ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, also criticised identity politics and accused the party of abandoning working-class voters.",
      "Some centrist Democrats, meanwhile, have argued that the struggle to connect with voters goes beyond the economy and immigration. They point to how the Trump campaign was also able to use a cultural message as a wedge to fracture the Democratic coalition.",
      "Pelosi blames Biden for election loss as finger pointing intensifies",
      "Who's in the frame to join Trump's new top team?",
      "Among the positions that Republicans targeted in this year\u2019s election were calls to shift funding away from law enforcement, decriminalise undocumented border-crossings and minor crimes like shoplifting, and provide greater protections for transgender Americans.",
      "Many arose after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 and the resulting rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as other efforts to advance social justice and acknowledge darker parts of American history.",
      "Within a few years, however, some of those positions proved a liability for Democrats when trying to win over persuadable voters and keep their coalition from fraying. Harris, for example, backed away from some positions she\u2019d taken when she first ran for president in 2019.",
      "In the last month of the presidential campaign, the Trump team made the vice-president\u2019s past support for taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for federal prisoners and detained immigrants a central focus.",
      "One advert ended with the line: \u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\u201d",
      "The Trump campaign spent more than $21m on transgender issue ads in the first half of October \u2013 about a third of their entire advertising expenditures and nearly double what they spent on spots on immigration and inflation, according to data compiled by AdImpact.",
      "It\u2019s the kind of investment a campaign makes if it has hard data showing an advert is moving public opinion.",
      "After Trump\u2019s convincing win, Congressman Seth Moulton, a moderate from Massachusetts, said his party needed to rethink its approach on cultural issues.",
      "\u201cDemocrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face,\u201d Moulton told the New York Times. \u201cI have two little girls, I don\u2019t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I\u2019m supposed to be afraid to say that.\u201d",
      "Progressive Democrats, meanwhile, reject that characterisation, and argue that standing up for the rights of minorities has always been a core value of the party. Congressman John Moran wrote on X in response: \"You should find another job if you want to use an election loss as an opportunity to pick on our most vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Mike Madrid, the political strategist, has a brutal assessment of where the Democratic coalition is today.",
      "\u201cThe Democratic Party was predicated on what really is an unholy alliance between working-class people of colour and wealthier white progressives driven and animated by cultural issues,\u201d Madrid said. \u201cThe only glue holding that coalition together was anti-Republicanism.\u201d",
      "Once that glue came unstuck, he said, the party was ripe for defeat.",
      "Future elections are sure to be held in a friendlier political environment for Democrats. And Trump, who has shown a unique ability to attract new and low-propensity voters to the polls, has run his last campaign.",
      "But 2024\u2019s results will provide plenty of fuel for Democratic angst in the days to come.",
      "The Harris campaign itself believes she lost to Trump because she was facing a restive public angry over the economic and social turbulence in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic.",
      "\u201cYou stared down unprecedented headwinds and obstacles that were largely out of our control,\u201d campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon wrote in a letter to her staff. \u201cThe whole country moved to the right, but compared to the rest of the country, the battleground states saw the least amount of movement in his direction. It was closest in the places we competed.\u201d",
      "Moses Santana, a Puerto Rican living in Philadelphia, is from a demographic which seemed reliably Democratic a decade or so ago. But when he spoke to the BBC this week, he was not so convinced the Democrats had delivered when in power - or that their message today connected with Americans like him.",

    "story": [
      "Before the east and west coast rap beef of the 1990s boiled over with the murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG, legendary producer Quincy Jones called a secret meeting at which he appealed for an end to the violence.",
      "As hip-hop rose from the streets to the mainstream in the 90s, the rappers and hustlers that broke through had few role models who had trodden that path before them.",
      "There was one man, though, who had been there, and done pretty much everything.",
      "Quincy Jones had been in gangs and had been stabbed at the age of seven in 1930s Chicago, before becoming a major force in American music thanks to his work with legends like Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson.",
      "He was at the heart of revolutions in jazz, swing, soul, funk, disco and pop - but one aspect of his career that got less attention when he died last week at the age of 91 was his place in hip-hop.",
      "Jones was revered in all corners of music, including rap. Unlike most in the old guard and the media, he immediately realised the scene's artistic and cultural importance.",
      "Hip-hop reminded him of the bebop jazz of his youth. \"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "\"Quincy understood it and got it right away,\" says pioneering artist, rapper and presenter Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "Jones worked with leading rappers in the 80s, and in the 90s he recognised risks including a volatile rivalry that had begun to erupt between competing labels and stars.",
      "So he brought artists, executives and elder black American statesmen together for a secret summit in 1995, hoping it would be a turning point.",
      "The east coast was hip-hop's spiritual home. In 1992, Sean Combs - then known as Puffy and later as P Diddy - launched his Bad Boy record label in New York with artists including Notorious BIG, aka Biggie Smalls.",
      "Meanwhile, across America, Los Angeles was coming into its own as the capital of gangsta rap, led by menacing mogul Suge Knight's Death Row Records, which had Dr Dre and Tupac.",
      "In 1994, Tupac was shot and injured during a robbery in the lobby of a studio. He later implied that his former friend Biggie may have known about the attack in advance. Biggie then released the track Who Shot Ya?, which Tupac thought was about him.",
      "The beef continued at the Source magazine awards on 3 August 1995, when Knight goaded Combs and Bad Boy Records from the stage.",

      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "'He changed my life': Stars remember Quincy Jones",
      "The brewing east-west beef wasn't the only reason Jones called it - it was mainly intended to discuss the state of hip-hop and let the new generation hear life and business advice from a group of highly successful black executives.",
      "But rap's negative image and the burgeoning tensions were a big talking point.",
      "\"He knew this was a bubbling issue, and so his idea was to bring together a symposium,\" says Fab 5 Freddy, who was hosting Yo! MTV Raps at the time and was the event's moderator.",
      "Jones told the summit: \"The thing that really provoked me to say it's time to pay attention now is Tupac.\"",
      "Tupac was missing, however - he was in jail for sexual assault at the time. Suge and Dre were there, as were Combs and Biggie.",
      "Jones had already experienced his own beef with Tupac - the rapper criticised the producer in a 1993 edition of Source for marrying white women.",
      "\"We finally hooked up, even though it was tension conditions in the beginning,\" Jones said at the event.",
      "\"We finally talked to each other, and he said nobody had talked to him like that before.",
      "\"And I said, I can't take it any more. Because we can no longer afford to be non-political, and I'm talking to the hip-hop nation now.\"",
      "About 50 influential artists and executives were in the room, including Public Enemy's Chuck D, members of A Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri and Boyz n the Hood film-maker John Singleton.",
      "Jones wrote in his now-out-of-print 2001 autobiography: \"I had been concerned about the potentially volatile diversity of a group who'd never been in the same room together.\"",
      "They were joined by veteran executives Clarence Avant and Ahmet Ertegun, plus Colin Powell, the former national security adviser and head of the US military who would go on to become the first African-American secretary of state.",
      "Powell had presidential ambitions - that was why the summit was held in secret. Jones wanted to save Powell from being associated with the negative publicity that surrounded rap music.",
      "He switched venues at the last minute to throw press off the scent, and confiscated the recordings.",
      "\"Rest assured that my discretion is based on a deep respect for you and a valued friendship,\" Jones wrote to Powell in an unpublished letter held at Indianapolis University Library.",
      "\"I know that we are going to make a difference at this conference. Thanks for the way you handled the situation. Maybe we can turn the battleship an inch or two.\"",
      "Jones later wrote in his book: \"Some of the younger rappers didn't even know who he was. When addressing some of the more confrontational comments from the floor, Powell maintained his South Bronx demeanour and authoritative cool throughout.\"",
      "Fab 5 Freddy remembers one exchange between Powell and Knight. \"There was an encounter where he [Knight] had something to say, and Colin Powell responded.",
      "\"Here you have this guy who was a four-star general talking to Suge Knight, and he pretty much put Suge in his place.\"",

      "Ex-gang leader pleads not guilty to Tupac murder",
      "Diddy accused of 'revenge' rape over Tupac claims",
      "Jones had ended up reconciling with Tupac. After Tupac's 1993 comments, Jones's 17-year-old daughter Rashida - who would go on to star in US sitcom The Office - wrote an irate letter to Source attacking the rapper.",
      "When Tupac bumped into one of Jones's other daughters, Kidada, he apologised, thinking she was Rashida. But Tupac and Kidada hit it off and began a relationship.",
      "\"Though we got off to a rocky start, as I came to know and feel him I saw his enormous potential and sensitivity as an artist and as a human being,\" Quincy Jones wrote.",
      "There have also been claims that Tupac was planning to leave Death Row for Jones's record label.",

      "A former gang leader, Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis, was charged with his murder last year. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Then in 1997, Notorious BIG was shot dead outside a party thrown by Jones's record label and magazine. No-one has ever been charged.",
      "Meanwhile, today Knight is in prison for a hit-and-run, while Combs is awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which he denies.",
      "The violence in the 90s \"wasn't necessary\" and was caused by \"wannabes and gang-related troublemakers\" on the edges of the music industry, according to Fab 5 Freddy.",

      "Freddy believes some lessons were learned at the summit, however, and that it deserves a place in hip-hop history.",

    "title": "Runaway 'spy whale' fled Russian military training says marine scientist",
    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 05:17:08 GMT",
    "summary": "Marine scientist uncovers the story behind Andruha's escape from Russian military training programme.",
    "story": [
      "The mystery as to why a beluga whale appeared off the coast of Norway wearing a harness may finally have been solved.",
      "The tame white whale, which locals named Hvaldimir, made headlines five years ago amidst widespread speculation that it was a Russian spy.",
      "Now an expert in the species says she believes the whale did indeed belong to the military and escaped from a naval base in the Arctic Circle.",
      "But Dr Olga Shpak does not believe it was a spy. She believes the beluga was being trained to guard the base and fled because it was a \"hooligan\".",
      "Seeking sanctuary for whale dubbed a Russian spy",
      "Russia has always refused to confirm or deny that the beluga whale was trained by its military.",
      "But Dr Shpak, who worked in Russia researching marine mammals from the 1990s until she returned to her native Ukraine in 2022, told BBC News: \u201cFor me it\u2019s 100% (certain).\u201d",
      "Dr Shpak, whose account is based on conversations with friends and former colleagues in Russia, features in a BBC documentary, Secrets of the Spy Whale, which is now on BBC iPlayer and being shown on BBC Two on Wednesday at 21:00 GMT.",
      "Secrets of the Spy Whale",
      "The mysterious whale first came to public attention five years ago when it approached fishermen off the northern coast of Norway.",
      "\u201cThe whale starts rubbing against the boat,\u201d Joar Hesten, one of the fishermen, says. \u201cI heard about animals in distress that instinctively knew that they need help from humans. I was thinking that this is one smart whale.\u201d",
      "The sighting was unusual because the beluga was so tame and they're rarely seen as far south. It was also wearing a harness, which had a mount for a camera, and bore the words, in English, \u201cEquipment St Petersburg\u201d.",
      "Mr Hesten helped to remove the harness from the whale, which then swam to the nearby port of Hammerfest, where it lived for several months.",
      "Seemingly unable to catch live fish to eat, it charmed visitors by nudging at their cameras and even on one occasion returning a mobile phone.",
      "\u201cIt was very obvious that this particular whale had been conditioned to be putting his nose on anything that looked like a target because he was doing it each time,\u201d says Eve Jourdain, a researcher from the Norwegian Orca Survey.",
      "\u201cBut we have no idea what kind of facility he was in, so we don\u2019t know what he was trained for.\u201d",
      "Captivated by the whale's story Norway made arrangements for the beluga to be monitored and fed. The name it was given \u2013 Hvaldimir - is a nod to hval which is Norwegian for whale, and the name of Russia's President, Vladimir Putin.",
      "Dr Shpak did not want to name her sources in Russia for their own safety but said she had been told that when the beluga surfaced in Norway, the Russian marine mammal community immediately identified it as one of theirs.",
      "\u201cThrough the chain of vets and trainers the message came back \u2013 that they were missing a beluga called Andruha,\u201d she says.",
      "According to Dr Shpak, Andruha/Hvaldimir had first been captured in 2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia's Far East. A year later it was moved from a facility owned by a dolphinarium in St Petersburg to the military programme in the Russian Arctic, where his trainers and vets remained in contact.",
      "\u201cI believe that when they started to work in open water, trusting this animal (not to swim away), the animal just gave up on them,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cWhat I've heard from the guys at the commercial dolphinarium who used to have him was that Andruha was smart, so a good choice to be trained. But at the same time, he was kind of like a hooligan - an active beluga - so they were not surprised that he gave up on (following) the boat and went where he wanted to.\u201d",
      "Satellite images from near the Russian naval base in Murmansk show what could have been Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s old home. Pens can clearly be seen in the water with what appear to be white whales inside.",
      "\u201cThe location of the beluga whales very close to the submarines and the surface vessels might tell us that they are actually part of a guarding system,\u201d says Thomas Nilsen, from Norwegian online newspaper The Barents Observer.",
      "Russia, for its part, has never officially addressed the claim that Hvaldimir/Andruha was trained by its army. But it does have a long history of training marine mammals for military purposes.",
      "Speaking in 2019, a Russian reserve colonel, Viktor Baranets, said: \"If we were using this animal for spying, do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'Please call this number'?\"",
      "Sadly, Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s incredible story does not have a happy ending.",
      "Having learned to feed himself, it spent several years travelling south along Norway\u2019s coast and in May 2023 was even spotted off the coast of Sweden.",
      "Then on September 1 2024 its body was found floating at sea, near the town of Risavika, on Norway's south-western coast.",
      "Had the long arm of Putin\u2019s Russia caught up with the reluctant beluga?",
      "It appears not. Despite some activist groups suggesting that the whale had been shot, that explanation has been dismissed by the Norwegian police.",
      "They say there was nothing to suggest that human activity directly caused the beluga\u2019s death. A post-mortem examination revealed that Hvaldimir/Andruha died after a stick became lodged in his mouth."

    "summary": "Analyst Alex de Waal looks at how the US president-elect could deal with conflicts on the continent.",
    "story": [
      "It is difficult to try to predict the decisions that US President-elect Donald Trump will make when he returns to the White House.",
      "But one thing seems unlikely to change: his dislike of patient, principled diplomacy as a means to peace and his preference for transactional politics and populist gestures.",
      "This brings openings and perils in some areas in Africa.",
      "Eight years ago, the Obama administration was working with the African Union (AU) to change United Nations (UN) rules for funding peacekeepers to put African missions on a firm financial basis.",
      "The AU Commission worked with the UN and other multilateral organisations to construct an \"African peace and security architecture\" that ranged from proactive diplomacy to avert looming conflicts through to coordinated mediation efforts and peacekeeping operations, all underpinned by norms and principles enshrined in the UN Charter and the AU Constitutive Act.",
      "How long ago that seems.",
      "Plans for more robust peacekeeping evaporated in the transition to the first Trump administration.",
      "Since then, no new UN or AU peacekeeping missions have been authorised. Several - including in Darfur, Sudan and Mali - have been closed, and others scaled down.",
      "The Biden administration did not reverse the trend.",
      "The idea of \"liberal peace\" - that peace, democracy, justice and open markets all go together - had long been a powerful strand in US global strategy.",
      "The AU embraced its multilateralism but recoiled from being lectured on human rights and democracy and were divided on Western military interventions such as in Libya.",
      "Some African leaders preferred Trump\u2019s candour and focus on results.",
      "The \"Trump Doctrine\" for the Middle East and Africa swept aside multilateralism in favour of transactional deals with American allies in Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and, above all, Israel.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and UAE President Mohamed bin Zayed set the strategy of the Abraham Accords, and Trump basked in the glory when Arab countries signed up.",
      "Trump\u2019s other consistent positions were hostility towards China\u2019s influence on the continent and aversion to deploying American soldiers.",
      "At the request of Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - described by Trump as \"my favourite dictator\" - then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin took charge of mediating Egypt\u2019s dispute with Ethiopia over the Nile waters.",
      "The immediate issue was how much water would be retained by the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam as it approached completion.",
      "As the talks faltered, Washington put its thumb on the scales, suspending aid to Ethiopia, while Trump suggested that Egypt might \"blow up\" the dam.",
      "America recognised Morocco\u2019s claim over Western Sahara in exchange for Rabat signing the Abraham Accords and thereby recognising Israel.",
      "In the era of \"liberal peace\", an agreement to end a civil war was the drafting of a democratic constitution, along with measures for disarming and demobilising rival armies, transitional justice and reconciliation, and aid-funded programmes to deliver a peace dividend for the afflicted populace.",
      "The first Trump administration preferred direct deal-making, whereby autocrats cut a private bargain over the counter. Scholars call this the \"illiberal peace\".",
      "Trade, aid, security: What does Trump's win mean for Africa?",
      "Trade, aid, security: What does Trump's win mean for Africa?",
      "When then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Sudan after the popular revolution that led to the ousting of military-Islamist ruler Omar al-Bashir, his main agenda was a simple trade: America would lift sanctions when Sudan agreed to sign the Abraham Accords.",
      "In October 2020, the White House announced that President Trump had \"brokered a historic peace agreement\" between Israel and Sudan.",
      "On the heels of deals with Bahrain and the UAE, and weeks before Americans voted in the presidential election, this was Trump\u2019s \"October surprise\".",
      "It came too late to save Sudan from the economic crisis that crushed its democratic experiment and fell away after Trump lost to Joe Biden.",
      "But it\u2019s fair to assume that the second Trump administration will continue this way.",
      "The exact alignments and deals are impossible to predict, and much will depend on the individuals appointed to key positions. But the \"liberal peace\" is now dead and buried.",
      "Sudan is currently Africa\u2019s largest war and its biggest famine for decades. There is no sign that Trump is concerned.",
      "The biggest obstacle to peace is that the UAE supports one side with weapons and cash while Egypt and Saudi Arabia back the other. There is no prospect for peace while this continues.",
      "For those Arab powerbrokers, Sudan is just one element in their geostrategic calculations, ranked below Israel-Palestine, Iran and relations with Washington.",
      "But if there is a reshuffle of the Middle Eastern political cards, a bargain over Sudan might be a by-product, even an opportunity for Trump to bask in the glow of an unexpected peacemaker.",
      "It will not bring an end to violence, let alone usher in democracy, but it would open the space for serious negotiations.",
      "A similar calculation holds for Ethiopia and its fractious relations with an Egypt-led coalition that includes Eritrea and Somalia.",
      "Along with an array of African leaders, Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is heavily reliant on Emirati largesse. Tensions in the Horn of Africa would be reduced if Egypt and the UAE align their strategies.",
      "The Biden administration's policy towards the Horn of Africa was neither committed to principled multilateralism, nor ready to use its leverage with the Gulf states.",
      "Its envoys could only grasp for minor wins such as pauses in the fighting or opening checkpoints for aid convoys.",
      "The tangled wars in Sudan, Ethiopia and their neighbours cry out for bold action - and if he were so minded, Trump might cut the Gordian Knot.",
      "But the risks of a conflagration are high.",
      "The Trump White House will not be likely to restrain bellicose tendencies by Middle Eastern powerbrokers or African leaders, and - especially during the US policy vacuum of the next few months - any one of those leaders could launch a war, confident that America will not respond.",
      "In his first term, Trump showed no interest in the US military footprint in Africa.",
      "Apparently on a whim, he ordered the withdrawal of American troops from Somalia, where they were involved in the war against the jihadist group al-Shabab - a decision reversed by the Biden administration.",
      "It\u2019s unlikely that Trump will pay attention to the Pentagon\u2019s operations against jihadists there or in the West African Sahel, unless there is a high-profile incident with American casualties.",
      "And America\u2019s Middle Eastern allies will be keen for the US to retain its military base in Djibouti.",
      "Reports of collusion between Yemen\u2019s Houthis and al-Shabab, heightening risks of attacks in East Africa or on shipping in the Indian Ocean, may rekindle US interest in military operations.",
      "Alternatively, missions could be outsourced to allies such as the UAE or private military contractors.",
      "Kenyan President William Ruto\u2019s rapport with Biden will do him no favours, but Kenya\u2019s new status as a \"major non-Nato ally\"  - and contributor of police to Haiti - will likely retain good standing within the Department of Defense.",
      "West Africa is today the locus of the world\u2019s most active jihadist movements as well as a tide of putschists who cut deals with Russia\u2019s security outfit, the Wagner Group, now merged into its Africa Corps.",
      "If Trump sees West Africa through the prism of relations with Moscow, and his planned deal with President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine, it will introduce a wild card into the region\u2019s politics.",
      "But tensions will arise because his ally, Morocco, has its own ambitions for strategic leadership across West Africa.",
      "It\u2019s a major non-Nato ally and has been leery of Russian influence in Algeria, Libya and the Sahel - adding up to a mix that would be stirred if Trump cuts deals with Putin.",
      "Transactional politics imply cutting deals with coup leaders and warlords whose crimes are their credentials.",
      "AU principles such as outlawing unconstitutional changes in government will be disregarded.",
      "Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu may have preferred Biden, but he is familiar with Trump\u2019s style of politics and will seek a formula for keeping America onside in its war against jihadist group Boko Haram.",
      "In February, just weeks after the presidential inauguration in Washington, Africa\u2019s leaders will meet in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to elect a new chairperson of the AU Commission.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 00:30:46 GMT",
    "summary": "Justice DY Chandrachud retired as India\u2019s chief justice on Sunday. Many are debating his legacy.",
    "story": [
      "How will history judge my tenure?",
      "That\u2019s a question Dhananjay Yashwant Chandrachud, who retired as India\u2019s 50th chief justice on Sunday, asked just weeks before he finished his term.",
      "Justice Chandrachud said his mind was \u201cheavily preoccupied with fears and anxieties about the future and the past\u201d.",
      "\u201cI find myself pondering: Did I achieve everything I set out to do? How will history judge my tenure? Could I have done things differently? What legacy will I leave for future generations of judges and legal professionals?\u201d he said.",
      "The soul searching came at a time when many in India are also debating what legacy he leaves behind.",
      "Justice Chandrachud served more than eight years as a top court judge and as chief justice for the past two years. He presided over one of the most powerful Supreme Courts in the world with jurisdiction over India\u2019s 1.4 billion citizens.",
      "The top court is the final court of appeal, the final interpreter of the constitution and its judgements, which are binding on all other courts in India, routinely make news - although judges seldom do.",
      "But Justice Chandrachud, sometimes described as India\u2019s \u201cfirst celebrity judge\u201d and a \"rockstar judge\", has routinely hit the headlines.",
      "According to Arghya Sengupta of the Vidhi Centre For Legal Policy, the jurist was India's most prolific chief justice who wrote 93 judgements - more than his last four predecessors put together \u2013 including some on matters of seminal importance. He also made huge strides in terms of digitisation and livestreaming of court hearings \u2013 making them more accessible to citizens.",
      "But some of the recent coverage has also been unflattering, with critics saying he wasn't assertive enough and his tenure has been disappointing.",
      "The Harvard-educated judge has many firsts to his name \u2013 he was the youngest to head a high court and his two-year-term was the longest for a chief justice in more than a decade. He\u2019s also the only chief justice whose father also served in the role.",
      "During his years in the Supreme Court, he developed a reputation for being a progressive, liberal judge known for his nuanced and thoughtful judgements related to matters of liberty, freedom of speech and gender and LGBT rights.",
      "He was part of landmark rulings that decriminalised homosexuality and allowed menstruating women into Kerala\u2019s Sabarimala shrine. His utterances on the right to privacy and right to dissent were extensively praised.",
      "So, his elevation to be India\u2019s top judge in November 2022 was welcomed by senior lawyers, activists and citizens with many expressing a \u201cstrong hope that under his leadership the court will rise to greater heights\u201d.",
      "It was a time when India\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government was getting ready to secure a third term in the 2024 general election.",
      "Opposition parties, activists and sections of the press were accusing the government of targeting them, with global rights organisations saying Indian democracy was under threat.",
      "Although the government denied any wrongdoing, many of India\u2019s top academics, rights activists and popular opposition leaders found themselves in jail and the country kept sliding on the global press freedom index. (The government has always rejected such ratings, saying they are biased against India.)",
      "Senior lawyer Kamini Jaiswal says Justice Chandrachud\u2019s appointment had come at \u201ca crucial juncture as some of the last chief justices had left under a cloud of dark spots and the position had been denigrated with serious allegations\u201d.",
      "\u201cSo, we thought Justice Chandrachud would use his erudition and brilliant mind to do a lot of good for the citizens. But he has been disappointing,\u201d she said.",
      "Senior Supreme Court lawyer Chander Uday Singh says his record is \u201ca mixed bag\u201d.",
      "\u201cIn his judgments, he would lay down the law brilliantly which could be used as a precedent for future cases. But whenever the state was heavily invested in any issue, he failed to hold power to account, so the state got away with what they had set out of achieve.\u201d",
      "For instance, he points out that the court struck down a government scheme that allowed people to make anonymous donations to political parties, calling it unconstitutional and illegal. \u201cBut then he did not hold anyone accountable for the illegality.\u201d",
      "Similarly, when it came to a political crisis in the western state of Maharashtra or Delhi\u2019s power struggle with the federal government, his judgments tended to favour the government, he adds.",
      "\u201cThere was hope that through his judgments, he would set things right in a country that is under a strong majoritarian government. But he fell short.\u201d",
      "Several top lawyers have also criticised Justice Chandrachud for what he did as the \u201cmaster of the roster\u201d by failing to effectively prevent the prolonged incarceration of political prisoners - leading to the death of some of them without ever getting bail. This happened despite Justice Chandrachud saying that bail should be the norm and not the exception.",
      "And as he neared his retirement, Justice Chandrachud also made headlines for what he did not in the court, but outside.",
      "In September, there was uproar over a viral video that showed him praying at home with PM Modi during a Hindu religious festival.",
      "Ms Jaiswal said by publicising the photo, \u201ca message was being sent that the chief justice is close to the PM\u201d. Lawyers, former judges, opposition politicians and many citizens also criticised him saying \u201cthe presence of a politician at a private event erodes the perception of impartiality of the judiciary\u201d.",
      "Another burst of criticism greeted Justice Chandrachud\u2019s comment last month when he said he had asked God for a solution to the vexed Babri Mosque-Ram temple dispute. \u201cI sat before the deity and told him he needed to find a solution and he gave it to me,\u201d he said.",
      "The comment led to a firestorm of criticism, not entirely unexpected as the mosque-temple dispute has been one of the most contentious and religiously polarising issues in modern India.",
      "The mosque was demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992. A five-judge bench, which included Justice Chandrachud, ruled in 2019 that the demolition was illegal, but still gave the disputed land to Hindus and a separate site for the mosque to be built. Earlier this year, PM Modi inaugurated a grand new temple at the site, fulfilling a longstanding promise by his party.",
      "So, no surprise then that Justice Chandrachud\u2019s comment, seen by many as religious, was extensively criticised.",
      "Retired high court judge Anjana Prakash told HW news that his comment was \u201cdramatic, filmy and laughable and it had brought down the level of judiciary\u201d.",
      "\u201cA judge has to decide cases on principles of law. Where does God come into a judgement? Besides, people have different gods. And if a justice from another faith had said this, would the reaction be the same?\u201d she asked.",
      "Justice Prakash and other critics wondered if he was cosying up to the government for a post-retirement assignment.",
      "In the days preceding his retirement, Justice Chandrachud addressed some of the criticism in interactions with the media.",
      "\u201cThe separation of powers doesn\u2019t mean antagonistic relations between the executive and the judiciary, it doesn\u2019t mean that they cannot meet,\u201d he said at an event by the Indian Express newspaper, adding that such meetings were not used \u201cto cut deals\u201d.",
      "\u201cThe ultimate proof of our good behaviour lies in the written word \u2013 in our judgements. Is it consistent with the constitution or not?\u201d",
      "Justice Chandrachud said his comment on seeking divine guidance was because \u201cI am a person of faith\u201d and \u201cto impute motives to judges is not right\u201d.",
      "He added that courts were facing pressure \u201cfrom lobbies and pressure groups\u201d and they would praise a decision critical of the government, but if he ruled in favour of the government, they questioned his independence.",
      "At his farewell on Friday, the outgoing chief justice said he was perhaps India\u2019s most trolled judge, but his \u201cshoulders are broad enough to accept all criticism\u201d.",
      "And at the weekend, he told Times of India that he believed he had \u201cleft the system better than I found it\u201d.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m retiring with a sense of satisfaction,\u201d he said.",

      "As leaders of dozens of Arab and Islamic nations gather in the Saudi capital for a summit, there is widespread speculation about what a second Trump presidency will mean for the region.",
      "In sharp contrast to the fears voiced in Europe about Donald Trump\u2019s famous unpredictability, Gulf Arab countries tend to view him as a force for stability.",
      "Writing in the officially approved Arab News opinion column, the prominent UAE business leader Khalaf al-Habtoor says: \u201cIn a Middle East where security is paramount, Trump\u2019s focus on strengthening alliances and curbing extremist forces offers a way forward.\u201d",
      "Here in Saudi Arabia, Trump is viewed much more favourably than Joe Biden.",
      "Trump chose Riyadh for his first overseas trip as President in 2017, an idea reportedly brokered by Rupert Murdoch.",
      "Through his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Trump enjoys warm relations with the de facto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known by his initials, MBS. The crown prince has never forgiven or forgotten Biden saying that Saudi Arabia needed to be made a pariah for its attitude to human rights.",
      "Trump\u2019s record in office is a mixed one when it comes to the Middle East.",
      "On the one hand he pleased Israel and upset the Arab world by recognising Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital as well as Israel\u2019s annexation of the occupied Golan Heights. But he also secured the Abraham Accords in 2020 which saw the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco establish full diplomatic relations with Israel and Sudan agree to do so.",
      "Trump was, and is, hawkish on Iran.",
      "In 2018, he pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear deal, the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Calling it \u201cthe worst deal in history\u201d, he shared the views of many governments in the region that the deal, aimed at curbing Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, failed to tackle Iran\u2019s ballistic missile programme while enriching the Revolutionary Guards with money then used to fund proxy militias around the region.",
      "In 2020, to Iran\u2019s fury but to the satisfaction of many in the Gulf Arab states, Trump ordered the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the leader of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 Quds Force.",
      "But today\u2019s Middle East is not the same as the one when Trump left the White House.",
      "Israel is at war with Hamas and Hezbollah, and exchanged blows with both the Houthis in Yemen and their backers in Iran.",
      "Under the Biden administration US influence in the region is seen to have waned with a White House largely ineffective at restraining its close ally, Israel, as it wages war in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House is thought likely to give Israel a freer hand to strike targets in Iran - like oil and nuclear facilities - that the Biden administration said were off limits.",
      "\u201cHis staunch support for Israel and aggressive stance towards Iran\u2019s destabilising efforts made him a key ally in the region, and his return to power is expected to intensify efforts to limit Iran\u2019s influence,\u201d former Israeli intelligence officer Joshua Steinrich says.",
      "But something else has changed in the region.",
      "Brokered by China, Saudi Arabia and Iran have agreed to put aside their differences, ending seven years of hostility, characterised most visibly by the war in Yemen where the Saudi air force bombed Iran-backed Houthi rebels.",
      "On Sunday, Saudi Arabia\u2019s military chief flew to Tehran to meet his Iranian counterpart, with both countries now talking about deepening their co-operation on defence and security.",
      "Ever since Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolution in 1979, Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Arab neighbours in the region have viewed Iran as a major threat to their security. But the surprise 2019 drone strike on Saudi oil facilities, attributed to Iran-backed militants in Iraq, was an uncomfortable reminder to the Gulf Arab states as to just how vulnerable they were to attack by Iran.",
      "So today, with an Arab and Islamic summit calling for an end to the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, there is both optimism and a degree of uncertainty about what a second Trump presidency will mean for the Middle East.",

      "Fernando Valenzuela, the beloved Los Angeles Dodgers pitching ace who helped the team win the 1981 World Series, died of septic shock last month, according to his death certificate.",
      "TMZ Sports obtained the document on Tuesday. Valenzuela died on Oct. 22 at age 63, a few weeks after stepping away from his job on the Dodgers' Spanish-language television broadcast and days before the Dodgers began their run to the team's eighth World Series championship. No cause of death was provided at the time.",
      "The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's office listed septic shock as the immediate cause of death. It is a life-threatening condition that occurs when organs malfunction, leading to dangerously low blood pressure. Each year, at least 350,000 people in the U.S. die of the condition, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The medical examiner listed decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis cirrhosis as underlying causes. Also listed as a significant condition contributing to Valenzuela's death was \"probable\" Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rapidly progressive brain disorder.",
      "The document also shows Valenzuela was cremated. A public Mass was held last week at Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in downtown Los Angeles.",
      "He was a native of Etchohauquila, Sonora, Mexico and known affectionately to fans across the baseball world as \"El Toro.\"",
      "The man behind \"Fernandomania,\" which took Los Angeles by storm during the 1980s, spent 11 of his 17 seasons in Major League Baseball with the Dodgers, leading them to a World Series title in 1981."

      "The honorees rose to the top in voting by a panel of experts and the public from among 12 finalists. This year's field included: the party game Apples to Apples, balloons, \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" gamebooks, Hess Toy Trucks, Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game, remote-controlled vehicles, Sequence, the stick horse and trampoline.",
      "\"These are three very deserving toys that showcase the wide range of how people play,\" Christopher Bensch, vice president for collections and chief curator, said in a statement. \"But for My Little Pony in particular, this year is extra validating. The beloved toy was a finalist seven times before finally crossing the finish line!\"",
      "Hasbro's mini-horses, distinguishable by different \"cutie marks\" on their haunches, were introduced in the 1980s and reintroduced in 2003, outselling even Barbie for several years.",

      "Transformers came along in the 1980s, when Hasbro bought the rights to several existing Japanese toy lines featuring transforming robots. They were first marketed with a cartoon and have since graduated to a series of live-action films. Social media sites allow for debates over which figures are must-haves, as well as demonstrations of the sometimes complex process of manipulating them from robot to vehicle or other alternate form.",
      "Regular new Transformers characters keep collectors coming back, Bensch said, \"but the toys are also popular because they are so suited to the ways kids play. The toy line feeds kids' imaginations and fantasy play.\"",
      "Phase 10",
      "Also inducted was Phase 10, which was introduced by inventor and entrepreneur\u00a0Ken Johnson\u00a0in 1982. Today, Mattel sells 2 million decks of the card game annually in 30 countries and more than 20 languages. That makes it one of the bestselling card games in the world, according to the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, where the Toy Hall of Fame is housed.",
      "In the style of rummy, the game challenges players to collect groups of cards to complete 10 phases in sequential order before their opponents.",

      "Anyone can nominate a toy for the Hall of Fame. Museum staff narrows the field to 12 finalists each year. Fans can cast votes online for their favorites and their results are counted alongside ballots from a national advisory committee of historians, educators and others with industry expertise.",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 10:06:56 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"Cheers\" actor's new series is the Netflix comedy \"A Man on the Inside,\" in which he plays a retired widower-turned-investigator who goes undercover in a nursing home.",
    "story": [
      "Sitting down to talk about his new TV show, Ted Danson admits he is nervous. Why? \"Because I want people to see it, I really do,\" he said. \"I think it's an important conversation.\"",
      "It's strange to think of Danson as nervous about anything, but in this case, it's not hard to see why: his latest project means a lot to him, about a subject that touches everyone. In the new Netflix series \"A Man on the Inside,\" Danson is a recently-retired widower without much to do, until he answers an ad from a private investigator, and becomes a mole inside a nursing home.",
      "Like a lot of TV series, the premise seems a little far-fetched, but this one's true: it's based on \"The Mole Agent,\" a 2020 documentary about a real-life 83-year-old who goes undercover in a Chilean nursing home looking for signs of patients being mistreated. What the documentary found was a group of elderly people fighting loneliness and loss with heart and humor.",
      "\"A Man on the Inside\" is no different, says series creator Mike Schur. \"I would say the purpose of this show is simply to discuss a subject that very few people discuss, which is aging,\" said Schur. \"It's this subject that we just don't like to talk about. It's thought of in this country (I think more than other countries) as something almost shameful or embarrassing.\"",
      "\"If you're dying, you somehow made a mistake,\" said Danson.",
      "\"You screwed up! Yeah, you screwed up, you got old, you know?\" Schur said. \"And I think that's weird, because this is what happens if we're lucky. If we're lucky, we get old!\"",
      "At 76, Danson himself is aging gracefully, with an attitude inspired by a Hollywood legend: Jane Fonda. \"She was turning 80, and at 70 I was starting to go, 'Well, I'd better look for a nice place to land, you know, this life plane,' or whatever,\" he said. \"And I looked at her and it was like, no. She has her foot on the gas pedal! She's, like, doing a 12-hour day, shooting her show, jumping on a bus to go, you know, support the service industry in Sacramento with a handful of women.",
      "\"Don't slow down, just keep going, keep living your life. I think that's one of the things our elders can pass on to us. This is how you live life right up until the end.\"",
      "Seems like Danson's elders set a good example: his parents wouldn't allow a TV in their home. \"My mother didn't like them,\" he said. \"She'd rather you read, or go out and play, or be creative.\"",
      "But then, Danson got famous, on TV. \u00a0His parents finally got one. \"But they put kind of this beautiful tapestry over the front of it, so when you walked in their house, you didn't see a TV, you saw this beautiful tapestry with a candle on top, and they would take it off and watch 'Cheers,'\" he said.",
      "Danson still credits his success today to that one show about a Boston bar. But since he hung up his bartender apron in 1993, he's been in hit after hit. He was the title character in \"Becker.\" In \"Damages,\" he held his own with Glenn Close. He went to heaven and hell in \"The Good Place.\" And he's even played himself in \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"",
      "Along the way Danson has used his fame to draw attention to his passion project, Oceana, an organization dedicated to preserving the world's oceans. Asked if he feels they have made progress, he replied, \"Yes. I mean, our focus is fishing, over-fishing, making sure that the fisheries of the world are healthy. Because if done right, you could feed a billion people a fish meal every day.\"",
      "That sounds a little like a miracle \u2013 something he touches on in his new show, and something he says he lives with every day.",
      "Asked what are the miracles in his life, Danson replied, \"Mary Steenburgen is, you know, literally heaven-sent. I did some work on myself for about a year before I met her, after 'Cheers,' becoming emotionally mature and real. And I worked hard at it. And then along came Mary Steenburgen. \u2026 We are so blessed. To love somebody and to be loved, is just one of those heaven-on-earth miracles, you know? And that came with Mary.\"",
      "And the idea Ted Danson is hoping to share with his latest project is that miracles can be found in any life, right up until the very end. \"This is your life,\" he said, \"not just up to, you know, 65 and then you retire and are going down. No, you get to live right up until you don't live. And it's your life. It's such a gift. Explore it, and be excited about it. Yes, it hurts. Yes, it's sad. Yes, there's grief. Yes, there's all of that. But embrace it. Embrace it, is kind of what I think the message of the show is. It's what I hope I live with.\"",
      "He got emotional sharing that. \"I'm just emotional 'cause I finally said something I wanted to say!\" he laughed.",

    "story": [
      "T Bone Burnett is best known as a music producer, but in April, he released \"The Other Side,\" his first album of new music in 18 years. Asked why he releases his own music so infrequently, Burnett replied, \"I've always been a behind-the-scenes person. I like creating in private.\"",
      "Maybe even more remarkable, this fall, he's touring behind it.",
      "He was quoted earlier this year saying he always viewed the audience as a mob coming to get him. \"Yeah, like a lynch mob or something,\" he laughed. \"It was just raw paranoia, but also just insecurity.\"",
      "Burnett is more at home in the studio, where he's produced albums for The Wallflowers, Greg Allman, and Elton John.",
      "Asked what he thinks he can get out of musicians that maybe other people don't, Burnett said, \"Well, what I try to get out of them is just their full love, their full being.\"",
      "He certainly did with Robert Plant and Alison Krauss on \"Raising Sand,\" and won the Grammy for album of the year in 2009:",
      "He described \"accidentally\" ending up in the commercial mainstream in a big way a couple of times. \"I mean, it's always a fluke, but, yes, I have.\"",
      "\"Has that surprised you?\" Mason asked.",

      "\"When the Coens came and said they wanted to do a movie about the history of American music, I thought, oh, this all fits together,\" said Burnett.",

      "Mason asked, \"When you're working on a TV project or a film, what do you see the role of music as? Is it an effective character in a way?\"",
      "\"Yeah, sometimes it is,\" said Burnett. \"It's always the subconscious, the unconscious of the character.\"",
      "\"In 'True Detective,\" it's almost like you were trying to curate a vibe.\"",
      "\"That was a vibe and it had to do with the swamp, and it had to do with the darkness of it all.\"",
      "\"Sounds kind of fun, actually!\"",
      "\"It was so fun!\" Burnett laughed. \"That's what I mean. It's fun to do the dark world, you know, as long as you don't have to actually live in it!\"",
      "Joseph Henry Burnett III grew up in Fort Worth, Texas. He can't recall how he got his nickname T Bone.",

Isn't that crazy? You know, I'm just sonically oriented.\"",
      "In 1975, Bob Dylan recruited Burnett to play guitar in his \"Rolling Thunder\" revue, starting a lifelong friendship. In 2021, they played together again, re-recording Dylan's classic, \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" using a special high fidelity analog system that Burnett says creates the highest quality audio ever.",
      "\"We decided to just make one disc; there are no copies,\" he said. \"The germ of it was, I wanted to do something that couldn't be put online. It couldn't be commoditized. I'm not doing this to keep it away from anybody. I'm just doing it to work at the highest possible level.\"\u00a0The disc sold at auction in 2022 for nearly $1.8 million.",
      "Burnett said, \"I love the process of recording. I love going into a room where there's nothing, and then you come out and there's something.\"",
      "\"It's a mystical kind of thing,\" said Mason.",
      "\"Yeah, it is to me. And you build a world of resonance, and that's the stuff that's the most thrilling to me, and the part of life that a machine will never comprehend.\"",
      "T Bone Burnett's new record earned a Grammy nomination this past week for best Americana album, and at 76, he's even starting to enjoy another sound \u2026 the sound of a crowd. \"I think I had a much more benevolent view of the audience than I used to have,\" he said.",
      "\"And that's because you're just not overthinking it?\" asked Mason.",
      "\"Yeah. That's exactly right!\" he laughed.",

      "The data from the CDC's National Immunization Survey estimates that 37.6% of Americans ages 65 and older had gotten a shot of this season's updated COVID-19 vaccine by Nov. 2, compared with 22.6% of older adults by the same week in 2023.",

      "Rates among nursing home residents getting a COVID-19 vaccine are also better this year: 27% were reported \"up to date\" on this season's shots through Nov. 3, compared with 21% by around the same time in 2023.",
      "More data on COVID-19 vaccinations among seniors is expected later this fall, as the CDC analyzes records gathered from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Health officials had been hoping for improved COVID-19 vaccination rates this year, after authorities worked to launch this year's COVID shots closer to when the annual flu shot is also shipped out to doctor's offices and pharmacies.",
      "Last year's round of COVID-19 vaccines did not get off the ground in many places until late September, long after providers had already begun offering flu shots. CDC officials said that led to confusing messaging and logistical fumbles that may have hampered vaccination rates.",

    "title": "Women suing over Idaho abortion ban said they felt like \"medical refugees\"",
    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 15:03:38 -0500",
    "summary": "One couple took out a loan to cover the out-of-network costs of an abortion and drove eight hours to a hospital in the neighboring state.",
    "story": [
      "Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion bans told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\"We felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\" said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\"We are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has outlined a number of promises to \"Make America Healthy Again\" under President-elect Donald Trump, vowing to combat an \"epidemic\" of chronic diseases that he has described as an \"existential\" threat to America's future.",
      "All are under the banner of fighting what Kennedy sees as a common thread behind a broad swath of ailments: that Americans have been \"mass poisoned by big pharma and big food,\" and that federal agencies have failed to stop it. In response, he has also floated a number of specific policy ideas to remake the federal government's public health institutions.",
      "\"[Trump] asked me to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country. And he said, I want to see results, measurable results in the diminishment of chronic disease within two years. And I said, Mr. President, I will do that,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "Authority for a MAHA agenda",
      "Kennedy's allies say Trump's election is also a mandate for their platform of health proposals, which they say delivered key votes for the president-elect. Trump has promised to let Kennedy \"go wild\" on health issues.",
      "\"The American people re-elected President Trump by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.,\" Karoline Leavitt, Trump-Vance Transition spokeswoman, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Some ideas in Kennedy's wide-ranging platform have evolved since his original longshot\u00a0presidential campaign. He has acknowledged Trump does not agree with him on every policy.",
      "The president-elect has listed oil and gas as one off-limits issue for Kennedy. In the past, Kennedy has been critical of \"big oil\" and natural gas, over the fatal toll of fossil fuel pollution and climate change.",
      "Several of Kennedy's ideas would require presidential or congressional action to implement, though it is possible that they could be supercharged by emergency powers.",
      "\"I'm going to urge President Trump on day one to do the same thing they did in COVID, which is to declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 26.",

      "Kennedy claims a number of health issues have worsened due to federal inaction, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders, infertility rates, diabetes and obesity.",
      "He aims to address that by replacing many staff throughout the agencies, which Kennedy has accused of being too sympathetic to large food and drug companies. As a co-chair of Trump's transition, Kennedy has been vetting a slate of staffers who could fill top positions throughout the Trump administration.",
      "Kennedy has said Trump tasked him with returning agencies \"to their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science.\" He has also said \"medical expertise\" is not the priority for all staff picks.",
      "\"What we don't really need at HHS is more medical expertise. What we need is an expertise on decoupling the agency from institutional corruption. Because it's the corruption that has distorted the science,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",

      "Kennedy himself has been floated to head the Department of Health and Human Services, though some allies say he could be more effective in a \"czar\" type role out of the White House.",
      "\"Get the chemicals out\" of food",
      "When talking about his platform, Kennedy often lampoons products like McDonald's French fries or Fruit Loops cereal as examples of how foods sold in the U.S. are made with ingredients that are banned or discouraged abroad, or have changed for the worse.",
      "\"It's easy to fix. We have a thousand ingredients in our foods that are illegal in Italy and other countries in Europe,\" he said on Oct. 29.",
      "Trump agrees with his plans to \"get the chemicals out\" of America's food supply, Kennedy says, which also includes upending the use of common pesticides and herbicides by American farmers.",
      "Kennedy has described the food in the U.S. as \"just poison,\" citing his own anecdotal experience with his son struggling with eczema while eating pasta in the U.S.",
      "\"When he ate any kind of pasta in this country, he would get these terrible, terrible outbreaks, you know, really agonizing. And he moved to Italy and he lived off of pasta for a year and a half and he never got a case,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy suspects that was caused by glyphosate, used in Roundup brand weed-killers, which Italy moved to start restricting in 2016. Italy's decision was over worries that it could pose a cancer risk, and some advocacy groups in the U.S. have also voiced similar concerns.",
      "Agricultural trade associations have defended glyphosate as \"one of the safest, most effective\" tools farmers have to manage weeds and support \"important conservation practices.\"",
      "Kennedy's plea to crack down on food additives and chemicals comes as the FDA is in the middle of launching its own new effort \u2014 and is calling on Congress to step up funding for \u2014 scrutinizing chemicals currently allowed in foods.",
      "Food industry groups have generally voiced support for the FDA to step up its vetting of chemicals in food, in hopes that it \"negates the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures drawing up their own restrictions.",
      "Reducing unhealthy and processed foods in federal programs",
      "Kennedy has also promised to \"get processed food out of school lunch immediately\" and voiced frustration over the amount of federal food assistance for low-income Americans that goes towards sugary drinks and processed food.",
      "One way Kennedy could try to get at this issue is through the federal dietary guidelines process, jointly run by the USDA and HHS, which is in the final stages of crafting the next edition of recommendations that influence a broad range of government nutrition programs.",
      "\"Kids shouldn't be eating grains. They should definitely not be eating seed oils. And they for sure should not be eating sugar. And yet that is what we're forcing them to eat,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "On seed oils, Kennedy has claimed that the switch away from oils like beef tallow which were high in saturated fats in favor of vegetable oils was a mistake, and is to blame for a rise in obesity rates. That puts him at odds with longstanding recommendations to limit saturated fats.",
      "\"The guidance around this has been reviewed many times since, and has only become stronger in its conclusion for the role of saturated fat, particularly in its relationship with higher risks of cardiovascular disease,\" Deirdre Tobias, a researcher on this year's Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, said last month.",
      "Grains have been more divisive at this year's committee and the broader scientific community, which has debated setting lower limits to overall grain consumption alongside recommendations to switch from refined to whole grains.",
      "Setting new limits is difficult, scientists on the panel have said, because the only source of some key nutrients for many Americans is cereals and breads fortified with vitamins.",
      "Kennedy has also been critical of the panel of outside researchers put together to create the scientific report underpinning the recommendations, but acknowledges broader changes will also be needed to move the needle.",
      "While Kennedy says he personally would \"never eat anything in a package\" as a rule of thumb, he acknowledges \"most people don't have access to the resources I have.\"",
      "\"We need to start forcing these companies to internalize their costs. So the illusion of cheap food goes away, right? Because if you're drinking Coke and it seems cheap and it gives you diabetes over the long run, that's not very cheap,\" he said on Sept. 30.",
      "Curbing the influence of drugmakers",
      "Kennedy has called for a \"review\" of guidelines that govern advertising by pharmaceutical companies.",
      "The FDA currently regulates advertising about prescription drugs, going after drugmakers that misrepresent their products. Responsibility for some other medical products is shared between the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "Kennedy has urged Trump to go further, saying he is advising the president-elect to \"ban pharmaceutical advertising on TV\" over concerns that it is influencing news coverage of health issues.",
      "He has also urged reform of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which charges pharmaceutical companies millions of dollars for the cost of the FDA vetting their applications to decide whether to approve new drugs.",
      "\"We need to end the corruption. 50% of FDA's budget comes not from the taxpayer, but from the pharmaceutical industry,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "Kennedy has not said how Congress or the Trump administration would make up the difference from the fees if they were cut, which amount to around $3 billion out of FDA's budget.",
      "Undoing the fees could leave taxpayers effectively subsidizing a hefty bill previously paid for by drugmakers \u2014 or a return to the significant delays for new medications that initially spurred the creation of the fees.",
      "Promoting alternatives to drugs",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of waging a \"war on public health\" which he says includes \"aggressive suppression\" of anything \"that advances human health and can't be patented by Pharma.\"",
      "In his view, that includes treatments like psychedelics, which recently fell short of FDA approval, and foods like raw milk, which officials have stepped up warnings against amid this year's unprecedented bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Kennedy has also praised the dietary supplement industry for a court win against the FDA, after the agency tried to take action against what it said was an illegally marketed anti-aging drug.",
      "Also on Kennedy's list are things like \"clean foods\" and exercise, which he wants to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover.",
      "The promise has echoes of the \"food is medicine\" initiative, which has called for the health care system to offer more financial support for healthier lifestyle habits.",
      "\"If a doctor's patient has diabetes or obesity, the doctor ought to be able to say, I'm going to recommend gym membership, and I'm going to recommend, good food and Medicaid ought to be able to finance those things the same as they would Ozempic,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has also promised to promote healthier lifestyles in other ways, ranging from requiring nutrition classes in federally funded medical schools to reviving the presidential fitness test in schools.",
      "\"Informed choices\" on vaccines",
      "Kennedy has a long record criticizing the safety of vaccines, including recent misleading claims that shots have an \"exemption from pre-licensing safety testing\" before they are approved.",
      "In fact, the FDA requires new vaccines be studied for their safety and efficacy in large trials, results of which are published in peer-reviewed journals and publicly disclosed.",
      "His activism on the issue dates back decades, including a now-retracted article he published in Rolling Stone in 2005 claiming a link between autism and an ingredient called thimerosal that had been used in vaccines before 2001 \u2014 which medical research has disproven. His focus has broadened since then.",
      "\"This doesn't mean vaccines is the only cause of autism. Our kids today are swimming around in a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods that operate along the same biological pathways. But some of it's coming from pharmaceutical drugs,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that is not \"anti-vaccine\" and would not seek to ban them under Trump, instead saying he wants to \"restore the transparency\" around them \u2014 echoing lawsuits by the group he chaired, Children's Health Defense, over its Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "\"[Trump] doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country. You ought to know the risks and benefits of everything you take,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "But Kennedy has also asserted \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and encouraged people to \"resist\" CDC guidelines on vaccines for kids \u2014 raising concern among public health officials, who point to the success of vaccination in saving millions of children worldwide from debilitating illness or premature death from preventable diseases.",
      "Opposing water fluoridation",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy said one of Trump's first acts in the White House would be to \"advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water.\"",
      "While a number of health risks have been tied to higher levels of fluoride, most are extremely rare in the U.S. and involve far greater exposure than what is added to drinking water.",
      "Fluoride has been incorporated into a majority of U.S. water systems for decades. The American Dental Association estimates that the practice has reduced tooth decay by about 25%, though some research suggests modern use of toothpaste with fluoride has reduced the policy's benefits.",
      "Kennedy's announcement does come as the Environmental Protection Agency is now under a federal court order to take action over one specific risk: the concern that fluoride might lower children's IQ \"at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" stemming in large part from a report published by the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Beyond influencing what rule the Trump administration's EPA ends up pursuing in response to the order, Kennedy could also take aim at fluoride through another route: changing the CDC's widely-cited statement about the practice, which hails water fluoridation as one of the greatest \"public health achievements of the 20th century.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has described fluoride as \"a poison\" and praised the nonprofits for suing over the issue.",
      "\"The simple answer is I don't like it,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 17:30:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Allowing enhanced subsidies for health insurance bought through ACA marketplaces to expire would cause premiums to soar, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",
      "Making the enhanced subsidies permanent would cost $335 billion over 10 years,\u00a0according to\u00a0the CBO.",

    "story": [
      "Idit Negrin would try anything to beat the trauma haunting her since attending the Nova Music Festival on October 7th, when Hamas massacred hundreds of civilians. \"We saw the terrorists, and they started shooting at us,\" she said. She ran for her life.",
      "Afterwards, \"I woke up every night, every night around 3 o'clock screaming and sweating and shaking. I think after a day, or two days after, I felt that I'm falling down, crying.\"",
      "We met her this summer as she was two-thirds of the way through her 60-session course of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). It's a treatment long used to combat compression sickness in divers, and wounds that will not heal. But at the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research, in Be'er Ya'akov, Israel, they're now also treating a very different malady: post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.",
      "Negrin described her experiences with PTSD: \"You feel like you're going crazy. I call people and scream, 'There is a terror attack again!' And then you understand that you have no control of your brain.\"",
      "Negrin is trying to regain that control, along with about 650 other October 7th survivors suffering from PTSD who are being treated, for free, alongside military veterans at the Sagol Center \u2013 currently the largest hyperbaric center worldwide.",
      "Dr. Shai Efrati runs this clinic, where they're treating up to 350 patients a day, and are on the forefront of this sort of medicine. \"What we are doing is actually tricking the body,\" Efrati said. \"Hypoxia, lack of oxygen, is the most powerful trigger to induce all the repair mechanism cascade.\"",
      "Efrati says they're inducing repair mechanisms in the body and brain inside these pressurized chambers, where it feels like you're scuba diving down to 30 feet. Patients breathe in pure oxygen, which under such high-pressure conditions the body can absorb at up to 16 times the normal level. Then, masks are removed for five-minute intervals.",
      "Efrati said, \"The decline from very high back to the normal is being interpreted at the similar level as hypoxia, as lack of oxygen. That causes the body to trigger the stem cells, and for the first time even in humans, we can see generation of new neurons, generation of new blood vessels in the brain. And this is mind-blowing.\"",
      "The treatment has been described as \"unapproved\" and \"not proven.\" \"When we speak about hyperbaric oxygen therapy, this is how it should look like,\" Efrati said.",
      "\"You're saying there are a lot of frauds out there?\" asked Doane.",
      "\"Indeed. And this is not only not good, it can be even dangerous.\"",
      "Dr. Efrati is constantly experimenting with new ways to use this treatment. At his clinic near Tel Aviv, we got to see how they're catering hyperbaric medicine to athletes (\"If we can shorten the recovery period, you can push harder doing the exercises\"), and helping patients with brain injuries regain movement through the growth of new neurons and blood vessels in the brain.",
      "\"It's not that we are fixing his running,\" Efrati said about one athlete's performance. \"We are fixing the brain.\"",
      "They've published several studies, looking at PTSD in veterans. One, out today, found that 68% of patients showed significant improvement. Another reported that PTSD remission lasted at least two years, which is higher than other established treatments. \"We want to evaluate everything objectively,\" said Efrati.",
      "It's conclusive enough for the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, to ask Efrati's team to stop testing and start treating. The doctor says that while you can always ask for more data, \"You see the evidence in front of you.\"",
      "Shachar Mizrhai was one of those IDF veterans referred in 2018 for the initial clinical trial. He was a soldier during a 2014 Israeli offensive in Gaza and was in an armored vehicle when it was ambushed. In the short term, he was thinking about survival; the suffering came later. \"I can't sleep at night,\" he said. \"In the moment I put [on] the uniform, I feel like I want to die. I smell blood. I smell war.\"",
      "He'd tried drugs, therapy and sleeping pills. He contemplated suicide. \"Nothing really helped to get back to life,\" he said. \"And I heard that this might be help, and maybe this is my last chance before I finish my life.\"",
      "Dr. Keren Doenyas-Barak, who heads the PTSD program at the Sagol Center, followed Mizrhai through his 60 sessions, and showed us his brain scans from June 2018, and March 2019, highlighting activation of areas used to effectively regulate emotion, or process information. The later brain scan images were lighting up; that wasn't happening before the treatment.",
      "\"Many people tend to look at PTSD as a psychological phenomenon, not as a biological phenomenon,\" Doenyas-Barak said. \"So, we treat PTSD very similar to other brain conditions.\"",
      "For Mizrhai, the treatment changed everything:\" \"It's the first time that I was feeling again. I begin to sleep at night, I was less afraid. It's make me feel alive again. \u2026 I was a dying man, and after this, I'm a living man.\"",
      "North Carolina Republican Congressman and medical doctor Greg Murphy said, \"If it's being offered in Israel and they're getting such good results, why the hell are we not offering it in the United States?\"",
      "That's a question Murphy \u2013 a member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs \u2013 is raising in the halls of Congress. One in 10 of his constituents is a veteran. \"I love our VA,\" he said. \"But we're not reaching a certain segment of our veterans if we're having 22 commit suicide every day. And if we're doing something and there is a treatment that has shown definitive results, I believe it's medical malpractice not to offer that to our veterans.\"",
      "In 2023 he introduced the Veterans' National Traumatic Injury Treatment Act. \"We just basically want the VA to do a pilot study within their own confines to see whether they show that hyperbaric oxygen works or not,\" he said.",
      "And what is he hearing from the VA? \"They just don't want to do anything; it's just hands up,\" he said. \"The reasons that we've heard is, 'Well, the results are mixed.' Fine. Look at the results in the last 15 years. Look at the studies in Israel. We are seeing an absolute effect in this, and other disorders, for Parkinson's, migraines, some even MS, neurological disorders.\"",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" requested an interview with the Department of Veterans Affairs, but they declined to comment.",
      "In Salt Lake City, Utah, we met Dr. Lin Weaver, who runs Hyperbaric Medicine at Intermountain Health. They treat about 20 patients a day, which puts into perspective the huge numbers - 350 daily \u2013 being treated in Israel. \u00a0He says they use their hyperbaric chambers for PTSD patients rarely, because it is expensive, but he has seen positive results: \"I've had patients that I've treated. Every one has got surprisingly better,\" Weaver said.",
      "But insurance companies say there is not enough proof it works for PTSD. And in the U.S., out-of-pocket costs soar above $50,000.",
      "\"What's necessary is like a drug trial,\" Weaver said. \"But these trials take years to accomplish. It all rests with, 'Is there an initiative? And is there a funding source?'\"",
      "Doane asked, \"But if doctors like you feel so strongly that this works, why isn't there enough push coming from folks like you to say, 'Prove this'?\"",
      "\"Well, believe me, we've tried,\" Weaver replied. \"I have submitted proposals to extramural funding agencies. So far, they haven't accepted them.\"",
      "Doane asked Dr. Efrati, \"You are out on the frontier here of medicine. Is there a danger in that?\"",
      "\"As a scientist, I will always tell you I need more study, I need more data,\" he replied. \"But as a physician, when I'm sitting in front of you looking at your eyes, you have a problem now. This is our job as a physician.\"",
      "Idit Negrin says this treatment is giving her hope she can move past that nightmare at the Nova Music Festival. She hopes, with the therapy, she can move on with her life.",
      "But she wears a reminder \u2013 a Nova necklace \u2013 while she gets treatment. \"I don't get her off my neck,\" she said.",
      "Her progress is motivation for Dr. Efrati to keep innovating, thinking about the future so his patients can process the past.",
      "Doane said, \"Some people are gonna listen to this and say it sounds too good to be true.\"",

      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is now on a short list being floated by some Trump allies to serve as the next head of the Department of Health and Human Services, multiple people close to the president-elect's campaign say.",
      "Hopes among Kennedy's backers that he could be nominated to lead the department have risen in recent days, after Republicans cemented their majority in the Senate.",
      "Kennedy's odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called \"anti-science, fringe public health stances\" that outraged Trump's opponents and a broad array of health experts during the campaign.",
      "That includes\u00a0a comment\u00a0that \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective\" and his chairmanship of the group Children's Health Defense, which has claimed that the \"parallel between rising disease rates and the increasing number of childhood vaccines is hard to ignore.\" Doctors argue statements like these mislead about the safety of immunizations and threaten to erode hard-fought improvements in U.S. vaccination rates against preventable diseases.",
      "Kennedy himself has been noncommittal when asked publicly about the possibility he could be picked to head the sprawling HHS umbrella of agencies, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy told Fox News he was \"confident that if I wanted to do HHS secretary, the president would fight like hell to make that happen,\" but also said that he was unsure if that would be \"the most effective\" role for him.",
      "In a CNN interview last month, Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, was asked whether Kennedy would be in charge of HHS.",
      "\"Of course not,\" he replied.",
      "But two people close to the campaign say the election results have played a big role in changing the thinking on whether Kennedy could clear a steep and often painful Senate confirmation process that can bog down nominees.",
      "Kennedy's supporters argue that the election offers a mandate not just for Trump's platform overall but for Kennedy and his \"Make America Healthy Again\" proposals to combat chronic disease, citing the votes Kennedy may have delivered in Trump's favor.",
      "As one example, podcast host Joe Rogan initially voiced support for Kennedy and his ideas before later endorsing Trump.",
      "\"We have not yet decided exactly what that strategy is going to be, but that is a possibility,\" Kennedy told NPR in an interview after the election, asked if he would be named to a Senate-confirmed position.",
      "As to the question of whether Kennedy is now in serious contention for the HHS secretary role, Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Americans reelected Trump \"by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.\"",

Under Ladapo, the state's health department has warned some against getting COVID-19 booster shots, citing claims that federal health authorities and outside experts criticized as unproven or misleading.",
      "Other names floated by Trump allies in Washington include former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former deputy HHS secretary Eric Hargan, who supporters think could be effective because he knows how to navigate the department's bureaucracy.",
      "But people close to the campaign say few Trump surrogates and supporters have spent as much time with the president-elect as Kennedy or plotted as ambitious an agenda.",
      "The two spent hours flying together in the final stretch of the campaign. Kennedy was also in Florida after the election, huddling with the president-elect's top ranks to weigh potential candidates to fill the administration.",
      "\"He's going to help make America healthy again. And he's a great guy and he really means it. He wants to do some things, and we're going to let him go to it,\" Trump said on Wednesday morning after the election.",
      "Trump has previously said he's been friends with Kennedy \"for a long time\" and would let him \"go wild\" on many of his policy priorities, except for curbing fossil fuels.",
      "\"I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines. The only thing I don't think I'm going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet,\" Trump said in New York on Oct. 27.",
      "Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform",
      "Kennedy's nomination would come at a key time for many of the issues he campaigned on, which he says underpin \"the chronic-disease crisis.\"",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of \"aggressive suppression\" of a range of products, including psychedelics \u2014 after MDMA failed to earn the agency's approval earlier this year \u2014 and raw milk, which officials have discouraged amid the ongoing bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Other proposals include restricting pharmaceutical advertising and rewriting the laws that currently rely on drugmakers paying fees to fund most FDA approvals. Ahead of the election, he warned FDA officials who \"are part of this corrupt system\" to \"pack your bags.\"",
      "In the days ahead of the election, Kennedy said Trump had asked him to \"root out the corruption and the conflicts of interests\" in agencies that oversee drugs and vaccines, pledging to \"restore transparency\" and stop \"hiding science.\"",
      "\"He doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country,\" Kennedy said in remarks posted on Nov. 2.",
      "His call for stopping water fluoridation comes as the Environmental Protection Agency is now facing a court order to take action against the practice.",
      "That ruling was driven in part by a review released by the NIH earlier this year, examining the risk it might lower children's IQ, and comes as critics have called on the CDC to revise its statement backing fluoridation. The NIH review found that concentrations of fluoride in drinking water higher than recommended levels were associated with lower IQ in children, but more studies were needed on the effect of lower concentrations of fluoride.",

Its stock price has since plunged, prompting speculation that the company could be acquired by another buyer and sparking concern among customers about the security of their genetic information.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 15:03:38 -0500",
    "summary": "One couple took out a loan to cover the out-of-network costs of an abortion and drove eight hours to a hospital in the neighboring state.",
    "story": [
      "Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion bans told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\"We felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\" said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",

      "U.S. inflation rose 2.6% on an annual basis last month, representing an uptick from September when the Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates amid signs of cooling prices and a weaker labor market.",
      "That matched forecasts from economists polled by FactSet that the Consumer Price Index rose 2.6% in October. The CPI rose 2.4% in September, when the Fed ushered in a jumbo rate cut of 0.5 percentage points, followed by a second rate cut this month.",
      "The slight rise on a month-over-month basis signals that the Fed's battle to tame inflation to its goal of a 2% annual rate might take a bumpy path over the next months. Some types of goods and services, from housing to insurance products, are still experiencing sharply higher prices, crimping consumers' budgets and creating economic headwinds.",
      "\"Looking ahead to the next six months, we foresee consumers and businesses still spending but doing so more prudently amid still-elevated costs and rates,\" noted EY chief economist Gregory Daco in a November 11 research note.",
      "A key driver of last month's inflation bump was the housing market, with shelter prices rising 0.4% in October, contributing about half of the monthly increase, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Wednesday. Transportation costs also rose due to higher airfares and a 14% annual jump in auto insurance, the report said.",
      "Despite the monthly uptick in prices, the Federal Reserve is forecast to cut rates for a third time this year at its December meeting, with two-thirds of economists polled by FactSet predicting a 0.25 percentage point cut. The latest CPI report isn't likely to derail that, given that the inflation numbers were in line with expectations, noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multi sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management in an email.",
      "\"Bang in-line core inflation leaves the Fed on track to cut rates in December,\" Rosner wrote. \"After a run of unseasonably hot autumn data, today's number cools fears of an imminent slowdown in the pace of rate cuts.\"",

      "The inflation report marks the first since the November 5 election, which handed former President Donald Trump another win.

      "He added, \"The value retail segment has been a major growth area over the past few years, and while the regular Amazon site has a good value-for-money reputation, its wide offer means that it is not primarily seen as an everyday low-price destination.\"",
      "What is Amazon Haul?",
      "Amazon Haul is an online storefront within the Amazon app that sells low-cost items, aimed especially at consumers who shop at discount retailers such as Temu and Shein.",
      "To find Amazon Haul, go to the Amazon app and search \"Haul\" in the search bar, or go to www.amazon.com/haul\u00a0on your browser.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 12:02:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Could the tariffs Trump's threatened to slap on Chinese imports backfire and help Beijing? Some experts say they will.",
    "story": [
      "Hong Kong \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to slap up a tariff of up to 60% on all goods imported to the U.S. from China. While that may sound like a potent economic threat to a country where economic growth is already faltering, could it actually be just what China needs?",
      "\"I do expect U.S.-China economic relations to be more volatile under Trump, but I think overall, this may turn out to be better for China,\" Chen Zhiwu, the top finance professor at the University of Hong Kong and a former professor at Yale University, told CBS News.",
      "Chen said if Trump does follow through with his threat of such steep tariffs on China, it \"might force the leadership in Beijing to have no other choice but to focus on the economy \u2014 especially given that the Chinese economy right now is in very big trouble.\"",
      "Since the start of Trump's first term in the White House, and through President Biden's term, China's economic growth has slowed from roughly 7% to 4.5%. The country's property market has crashed because of massive overbuilding, leading to the rise of empty ghost cities. Youth unemployment rocketed to a new high of nearly 19% in September, dimming prospects for China's future workforce.",
      "Beijing's intense focus over the past decade on bolstering its military to meet its geopolitical ambition of rivaling the U.S. and its European and Asia-Pacific allies has further sacrificed opportunities for domestic economic growth, said Chen.",
      "\"If you count the number of warships, China has by far the highest number of warships than any country, higher than even the U.S.' naval ships. What industries have grown the most so far this year? Definitely those warfare-related industries have gone up the most, but those consumer-oriented industries have had no growth or negative growth,\" he said.",
      "Most of China's top 20 aerospace and defense stocks have recorded double-digit growth over the past year alone.",
      "Tariffs \"a good thing for China for the long term\"?",
      "\"The pressure the U.S. is putting on China will become a good thing for China for the long term,\" agreed Wang Xiangwei, a former editor-in-chief of the Hong Kong-based newspaper South China Morning Post.",
      "China has relied on two primary engines to support rapid economic growth over the past 40 years, since former leader Deng Xiaoping initiated reforms and started opening the country up, Wang told CBS News. Those have been manufacturing cheap exports for the world by leveraging China's long-cheap labor force, and later, spending billions on domestic infrastructure including roads, rail and airports.",
      "But labor has become more expensive with the rise of China's booming middle class, and the government is running out of new things to build across the country.",
      "How China came to dominate the EV market, and what the U.S. can do to catch up",
      "How China came to dominate the EV market, and what the U.S. can do to catch up",
      "Beijing has found it difficult, meanwhile, to fire up a potential third engine of economic growth: The capacity of the country's 1.3 billion people to consume domestically made products.",
      "Trump's threatened tariffs could give a needed external push for that to change, said Wang.",
      "\"I believe China's going to suffer in the short term. In the long term, he's [Trump] going to help China to make that painful transition,\" Wang said, noting that in the U.S., domestic consumption accounts for 70% to 80% of the national GDP, while in China, it's \"only about 60%.\"",
      "In effect, pushing China's own people to buy more of their country's own goods and services could, in the view of the two analysts, prove to be Beijing's best protection against Trump's threatened tariffs.",
      "\"The best tool would be to stimulate consumption growth inside China,\" said Chen. \"At the moment, the leadership has not really tried to help the Chinese consumers by sending them government checks and even tax costs to corporations. I think if the Chinese government really moves in that direction more aggressively, then it would help the Chinese economy generate more internal domestic consumption demand to make up for some of their possible lost exports to the U.S.\"",
      "Beijing needs Washington, but tariffs could have a complex impact",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he imposed tariffs ranging from 10% to 25% on Chinese agricultural products imported to the U.S., including seafood, pork and dairy. Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs, kicking off a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "Nearly eight years later, however, Beijing appears less able to wage such a war, due to its close economic links with the U.S.",
      "\"In terms of retaliation choices for China, it's very limited,\" said Chen. \"China imports a lot of agricultural products like soybeans, corn. They may try to import more such agricultural products from Brazil, and also from Russia as one of their ways to retaliate against the U.S. But at the end of the day, China imports so much [computer] chips from Nvidia, Intel, especially Qualcomm,\" Wang said. \"Those products are what China needs. So, China cannot produce internally.\"",
      "In effect, if Beijing does impose retaliatory tariffs, it could be shooting itself in the proverbial foot. Tariffs would make all those products, vital to China's continued economic and technological development, more expensive for its own people.",
      "But another possible impact of Trump's expected protectionist policies could actually be to push some of America's oldest allies and trade partners closer to China, reversing the so-called decoupling of the U.S. and Western European economies from Beijing that Washington has pushed under Mr. Biden.",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "\"The Biden administration did such a good job to more or less unite that,\" said Chen. \"If Trump makes the EU and NATO member countries upset, that makes it more possible for Germany, for France or Italy or even the U.K. to warm up more with China on the trade front. So, that may help neutralize, to some extent, the negative impact of the expected Trump tariffs on Chinese goods.\"",
      "Trump has claimed repeatedly that foreign companies would foot the bill, effectively absorbing the additional costs of exporting to the U.S. market imposed by his tariffs, but many economists disagree, and say it would effectively be a tax on American consumers.",
      "According to findings released by the National Retail Federation last week, U.S. consumers could lose between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power per year on everything from clothes and toys to household appliances and travel goods if there is a 60% blanket tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "\"Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,\" NRF Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said. \"A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter. This tax ultimately comes out of consumers' pockets through higher prices.\"",
      "All of that said, and despite Trump's history of anti-China rhetoric, it remains unclear how quickly his administration might actually move to roll out sweeping tariffs, with some economists speculating that the president-elect plans, initially at least, to use the threat of additional levies as a cudgel to negotiate more favorable trade terms with Beijing. Trump could also choose to gradually phase in tariffs, delaying their full impact on China's economy.",
      "Will China attack Taiwan, and would Trump come to the rescue?",
      "Trump's return to the White House may also help Beijing further its interests with Taiwan, the democratically governed island of 23 million people just off China's east coast that the country considers a renegade province. President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring Taiwan back under Beijing's control, by force if necessary.",
      "Since the U.S. government enacted the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, the U.S. is strategically committed to aid in Taiwan's defense in the event of any aggression, including by selling weapons to the island's government.",
      "Open to interpretation, however, and left deliberately vague in the U.S. law, is whether Washington is obligated to directly defend Taiwan, using the power of the American military, if it does come under attack.",
      "President Biden, during his first term, said Washington would, breaking with the long-time policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the Biden White House later returned to.",
      "\"The sovereignty over Taiwan is the red line of all the red lines,\" Wang told CBS News. \"Trump, in his presidential campaign speeches, he made it very clear\u2026 [that he's] unlikely to send troops to defend Taiwan.\"",
      "\"I believe that China's not going to invade Taiwan anytime soon,\" Wang added, noting that Beijing has \"so many problems it'll have to fix at home.\"",
      "If Beijing did invade Taiwan, the fallout would be felt worldwide.",
      "\"That would be a devastating hit to the global economy,\" said Chen. \"I hope that it would not happen. So, maybe now, given the challenges with the Chinese economy, the leadership is realizing that without a stable economy, then all its global geopolitical ambitions would not have any economic foundation.\"",

      "In the first six months of 2024, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year, but spent 10% less per mile. The airline's revenue per mile from fares was down nearly 20%, contributing to its losses.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has called the Biden administration's student loan relief efforts a \"total catastrophe.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden made student loan forgiveness a central issue to his administration, rolling out efforts to forgive debt as well as to lower repayments for millions of borrowers. But with President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House in January, the future of those efforts is now in question.",
      "During the presidential debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump described Mr. Biden's efforts to forgive student borrowers as \"a total catastrophe.\" While he hasn't explicitly addressed his plans for student loans, he's called for eliminating the Department of Education, which manages the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio.",
      "It's unclear which agency or group would manage those loans if the Education Department were to be eliminated, a step that would require approval from Congress. The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump's plans for student debt relief.",
      "There's a lot on the line for the 46 million Americans who hold $1.7 trillion in student loans, a financial burden that about half of borrowers say has impacted their life choices, delaying home purchases or starting their families, according to a 2021 Morning Consult study. Mr. Biden's term is drawing to an end with two of his key relief efforts tied up in the courts, adding to the uncertainty about what Trump's second presidency will mean for those plans.",
      "\"We know what is in Project 2025, and we know what we saw in the first Trump administration,\" Persis Yu, managing counsel for the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student loans. \"We just should be very concerned about what the next administration will mean for borrowers.\"",
      "The next Trump administration may be unlikely to continue the Biden administration's effort to fight against ongoing lawsuits targeting current student debt relief efforts, according to NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood in an email. That could mean an end to those programs, experts say.",
      "\"Programs that the Biden administration created or expanded access to via regulatory changes could be easily rolled back,\" she added.",
      "What has Trump said about student loan relief?",
      "During his September debate with Vice President Kamala Harris,Trump bashed the Biden administration's efforts.",
      "\"When they said they're going to get student loans terminated and it ended up being a total catastrophe. He went out, got rejected again by the Supreme Court,\" Trump said, referring to the high court's 2023 decision that blocked Mr. Biden's initial student loan forgiveness program, which would have provided up to $20,000 in relief per borrower.",
      "\"So all these students got taunted with this whole thing about \u2014 this whole idea. And how unfair that would have been. Part of the reason they lost,\" he added.",
      "What does Project 2025 say about student loans?",
      "Project 2025\u00a0\u2014 an initiative overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation to guide the next Republican president in an overhaul of the executive branch \u2014 calls for the abolishment of the Department of Education, and says student loans should be handled by the private sector. It also advocates for scuttling student loan relief.",
      "\"The new administration must end the practice of acting like the federal student loan portfolio is a campaign fund to curry political support and votes,\" Project 2025 says. \"The new administration must end abuses in the loan forgiveness programs. Borrowers should be expected to repay their loans.\"",
      "It's unclear whether Trump agrees with those views, although he has called for an end to the Education Department. While on the campaign trail, Trump distanced himself from Project 2025, calling some of the proposals \"abysmal.\"",
      "What is the status of Biden's student loan relief plans?",
      "Currently, there are two student loan relief plans that are tied up in court, both of which are being challenged by Republican-led states.",
      "The\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, is an income-driven repayment program, which pegs a borrower's monthly payment to their income, lowering their financial costs. Some lower-income borrowers in SAVE have monthly payments of $0.",
      "The plan's 8 million enrollees are now in limbo, however, after court rulings blocked the Biden administration from implementing the plan. Currently, those borrowers are in forbearance through April, meaning that their loans are essentially paused while the Biden administration defends the plan in court.",
      "Separately, another Biden administration plan to use\u00a0the Higher Education Act to erase all or some of the student debt held by 30 million borrowers has also hit a legal roadblock, with a court putting that plan on hold in October.",
      "In the latter case, the Republican states argued that Mr. Biden's plan sought to \"unlawfully mass cancel up to hundreds of billions of dollars in student loans.\" The Education Department vowed to defend both plans.",
      "What could happen to these programs under Trump?",
      "Bob Eitel, who served during the first Trump administration as a senior counselor to the education secretary, said he expects the president-elect will move to rescind the proposed loan cancellation regulations.",
      "\"The Trump administration may pursue different avenues of loan relief, but it will not be the mass, blanket types of forgiveness that the current administration has pursued,\" said Eitel, president and co-founder of the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies.",
      "Some other student loan relief programs may remain, such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which would be tougher to eliminate but could become less accessible, said NerdWallet's Wood.",
      "That program, which was signed into law by former President George W. Bush in 2007, forgives student debt for public workers like teachers and police officers after 10 years in repayment. The Biden administration reworked the PSLF to make it easier for people to qualify for forgiveness, after the vast majority of people who applied were told they were ineligible.",
      "During Trump's first term, the Education Department was overseen by Betsy DeVos, who promoted school choice in K-12 and also called for deep spending cuts. She also proposed ending the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, although she was unsuccessful.",
      "Do Americans support student loan relief?",
      "It's a divisive issue among voters, with people's views colored by their political leanings and whether they themselves have student debt, according to an AP-Norc poll published in June.",
      "Only 15% of Republicans believe student loan forgiveness is important, versus 58% of Democrats. More than half of people currently paying student loans say it's an important issue, versus one-third of those with no experience with student debt, the poll found.",
      "Republicans have objected to Mr. Biden's efforts because they could deprive some lenders of revenue, while some object to forgiving loans for people who enrolled in college, given that a minority of Americans have college degrees.",

This year's field included: the party game Apples to Apples, balloons, \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" gamebooks, Hess Toy Trucks, Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game, remote-controlled vehicles, Sequence, the stick horse and trampoline.",
      "\"These are three very deserving toys that showcase the wide range of how people play,\" Christopher Bensch, vice president for collections and chief curator, said in a statement. \"But for My Little Pony in particular, this year is extra validating. The beloved toy was a finalist seven times before finally crossing the finish line!\"",
      "Hasbro's mini-horses, distinguishable by different \"cutie marks\" on their haunches, were introduced in the 1980s and reintroduced in 2003, outselling even Barbie for several years.",
      "The collectibles were recognized for encouraging fantasy and storytelling \u2014 the kind of creative play the Hall of Fame demands of inductees \u2014 along with popularity over time.",
      "\"The My Little Pony line has endured for decades because it combines several traditional forms of doll play with children's fascination with horses,\" said Michelle Parnett-Dwyer, curator of dolls and toys. \"The variety of figures promotes collecting as a pastime, too.\"",
      "Transformers",
      "Transformers came along in the 1980s, when Hasbro bought the rights to several existing Japanese toy lines featuring transforming robots. They were first marketed with a cartoon and have since graduated to a series of live-action films. Social media sites allow for debates over which figures are must-haves, as well as demonstrations of the sometimes complex process of manipulating them from robot to vehicle or other alternate form.",
      "Regular new Transformers characters keep collectors coming back, Bensch said, \"but the toys are also popular because they are so suited to the ways kids play. The toy line feeds kids' imaginations and fantasy play.\"",
      "Phase 10",
      "Also inducted was Phase 10, which was introduced by inventor and entrepreneur\u00a0Ken Johnson\u00a0in 1982. Today, Mattel sells 2 million decks of the card game annually in 30 countries and more than 20 languages. That makes it one of the bestselling card games in the world, according to the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, where the Toy Hall of Fame is housed.",
      "In the style of rummy, the game challenges players to collect groups of cards to complete 10 phases in sequential order before their opponents.",
      "\"Whether played in its original form or in one of its variations, Phase 10 has become an iconic game title that continues to encourage multigenerational social and competitive play,\" said Mirek Stolee, the museum's curator of board games and puzzles.",
      "Anyone can nominate a toy for the Hall of Fame. Museum staff narrows the field to 12 finalists each year. Fans can cast votes online for their favorites and their results are counted alongside ballots from a national advisory committee of historians, educators and others with industry expertise.",

    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 16:07:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Measure that would repeal so-called \"government pensions offset\" has been gaining support in House.",
    "story": [
      "The House is expected to try to pass a Social Security-related bill this week to ensure benefits for workers who are also eligible for other pensions, despite a surprise move by hard-right Freedom Caucus leaders to derail the effort.",
      "It's a quick turnaround to salvage what had been a bipartisan effort to pass the bill, called the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, during what's now the lame-duck post-election period of the Congress.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal the so-called \"government pensions offset,\" or GPO, which reduces Social Security spousal or widow(er) benefits for those who receive noncovered pensions, according to the Social Security Administration's\u00a0website.",
      "The summary also says the bill also eliminates the so-called \"windfall elimination provision\" that \"in some instances reduces Social Security benefits for individuals who also receive a pension or disability benefit from an employer that did not withhold Social Security taxes.\"",
      "Such pensions are paid by employers \u2014 typically, state and local governments or non-U.S. employers \u2014 that do not withhold Social Security taxes from employee salaries.",
      "\"The GPO reduces the spousal or widow(er) benefit by two-thirds of the monthly non-covered pension and can partially, or fully, offset an individual's spousal/widow(er) benefit, depending on the amount of the non-covered pension,\" according to SSA.gov.",
      "The bill would repeal the GPO provision and reinstate full Social Security benefits.",
      "For instance, under the GPO, an individual with a $900 spousal benefit from Social Security, who also has a $1,000 non-covered pension, would see their Social Security benefit reduced by $667, or two-thirds the non-covered pension amount. That leaves them with a $233 remaining spousal benefit.",
      "If the GPO measure is repealed, the same individual would be entitled to the entire $900 spousal benefit amount without an offset reduction.",
      "Does the bill have bipartisan support?",
      "Yes, the bill was introduced by a Republican, Rep. Garrett Graves of Louisiana, and a Democrat, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, and it has gained support in the House. A robust 300 lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have signed on to it.",
      "Other groups have also supported the bill, such as the National Association of Counties, which represents county governments. That group says that eliminating the GPO would help county governments recruit workers at a time when many are facing labor shortages.",
      "What happened next to the bill?",
      "To force the legislation forward, the sponsors of the bill, Rep. Graves and Rep. Spanberger, this fall used a rarely successful process called a discharge petition.",
      "They collected the minimum 218 signatures needed from House lawmakers to dislodge the bill from committee and send it to the floor for a vote.",
      "The move is often seen as an affront to House leaders, particularly the House speaker and the majority leader who determine the floor schedule.",
      "But Spanberger and Graves \u2014 who both did not seek reelection \u2014 had little to lose. Besides, Johnson backed the bill before becoming speaker.",
      "Did the House Freedom Caucus block the Social Security bill?",
      "Two leaders of the conservative House Freedom Caucus intervened when the rest of Congress was away from Capitol Hill, mostly in home states for Election Day.",
      "The Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., and former chair Rep. Bob Goode, R-Va., used a routine pro forma session of the House on Nov.\u00a05 to swiftly table part of the measure.",
      "The Freedom Caucus tends to block new spending. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would add some $196 billion to the federal deficit over a decade.",
      "Graves said that's the amount people are missing out on without reinstating full Social Security benefits.",
      "But in tabling the legislation the conservatives actually set back its procedural rule, but not the bill itself.",
      "The legislation is expected to move forward with a House vote anyway, possibly in the week ahead.",
      "Could the Social Security Fairness Act still pass?",
      "Yes, but that said, passage will now be tougher, requiring a supermajority threshold rather than a simple majority as had been planned under the rule that the Freedom Caucus leaders turned back.",
      "If it passes the House, it's unclear if the bill has enough support to clear the Senate. But the wide margin in the House indicates potentially broad support.",
      "It would then go to President Joe Biden's desk. If signed into law, the summary says the changes are effective for benefits payable after December 2023.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 16:06:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Medicare's Part B monthly premium is outpacing both inflation and Social Security's cost-of-living adjustment.",
    "story": [
      "America's seniors will pay more for their health care in the new year, as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has announced that premiums for its Part B plan will increase by about 6% in 2025.",
      "Part B covers visits to doctors, outpatient care, preventative services such as vaccines, medical equipment like wheelchairs as well as home health care. (Part A, which covers inpatient care in hospitals and other facilities, is premium-free for all but about 1% of beneficiaries due to taxes paid by most retirees while they worked.)",
      "What is the Medicare Part B premium for 2025?",
      "The standard monthly premium for Medicare Part B enrollees will climb by $10.30, or about 6%, to $185.00 from $174.70 in 2024, CMS said\u00a0Friday.",
      "Meanwhile, the annual deductible for all Medicare Part B beneficiaries will rise to $257 in 2025 from $240.",
      "The reason for the 2025 premium and deductible increases is due to \"projected price changes and assumed utilization increases that are consistent with historical experience,\" according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "The premium stood at $164.90 in 2023, when the cost fell just over $5 from the year before, a rare decline.",
      "How does that compare with the Social Security COLA?",
      "Medicare's Part B premiums have generally outrun inflation as well as Social Security's annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA).",
      "Yearly inflation climbed 2.4% in September, while the Social Security COLA for next year will be 2.5%, or an average of $50 more per household.",
      "What do higher-income Medicare enrollees pay?",
      "Given that a beneficiary's Part B monthly premium is based on one's income, wealthier Americans also pay an Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount, or IRMAA, which impacts about 8% of those with Medicare Part B, CMS stated.",
      "Those who are married and lived with their spouses at any time during the year, but who file separate tax returns with modified adjusted gross income of $106,000 or less, will pay just the Medicare Part B premium of $185.00 a month.\u00a0Beneficiaries with incomes above $106,000 but below $394,000 are looking at paying IRMAA of $406.90 plus the standard $185.00, or $591.90 a month.\u00a0Seniors with incomes in excess of $394,000 will pay $443.90 in IRMAA and the standard $185.00, or a total of $628.90 a month.",
      "Those who are married and lived with their spouses at any time during the year, but who file separate tax returns with modified adjusted gross income of $106,000 or less, will pay just the Medicare Part B premium of $185.00 a month.",

      "How does that impact Social Security benefit payments?",
      "Medicare enrollees who are already getting Social Security benefits can expect the new 2025 Part B premium to be automatically deducted from their Social Security checks in January.",
      "Those not yet receiving Social Security benefits but paying Medicare Part B each month will need to make sure they are paying the increased tally, beginning in January.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 19:17:45 -0500",
    "summary": "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Matt Gaetz, whose selection as attorney general prompted backlash, resigned from Congress.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump says he will nominate longtime ally GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida to serve as his attorney general\u00a0\u2014 a choice that quickly prompted backlash from Democrats and some Republicans over Gaetz's history. Following Trump's announcement, Gaetz resigned from his seat in the House of Representatives, House Speaker Mike Johnson said.",
      "Gaetz, who has represented Florida's 1st Congressional District since 2017, has been the focus of several investigations into his conduct.",
      "In a statement on social media, Trump praised him as a \"tenacious attorney\" who will \"end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and restore Americans' badly shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department.\"",
      "Responding to Trump's announcement, Gaetz said, \"It will be an honor to serve as President Trump's Attorney General!\"",
      "If confirmed, Gaetz would lead the Justice Department \u2014 a federal agency of more than 100,000 employees \u2014 and oversee its numerous investigative components, including the FBI. Gaetz's ascent to the Justice Department's top job will come at a unique time, after Mr. Trump spent all of his 2024 presidential campaign under federal investigation or prosecution.",
      "Johnson said Wednesday night that Gaetz had already submitted his letter resigning from Congress, effective immediately.",
      "\"That caught us by surprise a little bit,\" Johnson said. \"But I asked him what the reasoning was, and he said, 'Well, you can't have too many absences,'\" referring to the GOP's slim majority in the House of Representatives. Johnson said Florida law would allow Gaetz's replacement to be selected within the next eight weeks or so.",
      "\"I've already placed a call to Gov. DeSantis in Florida and said, 'Let's start the clock,'\" Johnson said.",
      "In a confirmation process, Gaetz would undoubtedly face questions about an ongoing review by the bipartisan House Ethics Committee, which said in a statement earlier this year it was looking into allegations that Gaetz may have \"engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct.\"",
      "Gaetz has denied all wrongdoing and maintained his innocence throughout a Justice Department probe \u2014 closed last year \u2014\u00a0 into allegations that he violated sex trafficking laws and obstructed justice. Federal prosecutors in Florida did not file any charges in the case and informed the congressman that the case was closed.",
      "Senators, who will vote on his confirmation, began to weigh in as they learned of Trump's intent to nominate Gaetz.",
      "\"He wants to be the top cop, so I would say that yeah, he's certainly going to have to answer all those things, whether they're legit or not legit,\" GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said of past allegations against Gaetz. \"Some of these investigations are still open, obviously.\" Cramer also said the pick was \"a surprise to me\" and expressed some reservations.",
      "\"The one thing about Matt was that concerned me a little bit. I didn't like the way he handled the squabble with with Speaker McCarthy.\" He said he was for every one of Trump's other nominees, adding, \"Matt could earn that, but I'm not there right out of the chute with Matt.\"",
      "\"This one was not on my bingo card,\" GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told reporters. \"I don't think this is a serious nomination for attorney general. We need to have a serious attorney general.\"",
      "Senate Republican conference Chair John Barrasso, when asked by reporters about Gaetz, said, \"The president is going to continue to make his appointments. We're going to continue to look forward to them coming to the Senate and have hearings and get his Cabinet confirmed as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Sources told CBS News that the most conceivable, easiest and fastest way to install Gaetz would be for the House and Senate to recess shortly after Inauguration Day so that Gaetz and others could be installed through recess appointments, a temporary option that doesn't require Senate confirmation.",
      "One former senior Justice Department official during Trump's first administration told CBS News that \"Matt Gaetz has no business running DOJ.\"",
      "Gaetz, who has served on the House Judiciary Committee and has been a vocal critic of the Biden administration, would take over the post as the first confirmed attorney general under a Trump presidency since Bill Barr. Barr resigned in 2020 when then-President Trump sought to remain in power after he lost the election. Barr left office at the end of that year and was replaced by an acting attorney general, Jeff Rosen. Rosen and a number of his subordinates later testified against Trump during a hearing of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol. The former officials alleged that Trump had sought to pressure the Justice Department to investigate his claims of election fraud.",
      "During the Biden administration, Attorney General Merrick Garland has sought to distance himself and the department from the White House after Trump's first term. Justice Department norms and regulations have been consistent themes of Garland's public comments throughout the nearly four years he has served under President Biden.",
      "Garland, a former federal judge, appointed numerous special counsels to conduct investigations into high-profile figures, including Mr. Biden, his son Hunter and Mr. Trump.",
      "Gaetz's expected nomination comes as some of the president-elect's supporters have called for change inside the Justice Department. Attorney Mark Paoletta, who was thought to be in the running to serve as Mr. Trump's attorney general, said, \"Career DOJ lawyers must be fully committed to implementing President Trump's policies or they should leave or be fired.\"",
      "\"If the president wants to deport illegal aliens, secure the border, ban race-based 'affirmative action' and DEI, investigate antisemitism, halt Big Tech censorship, grant pardons and commutations to Jan 6th defendants, he has every right to expect that these perfectly lawful policies are implemented,\" Paoletta wrote. \"It is absolutely unacceptable for career employees to seek to thwart this policy agenda.\"",
      "Trump's first term brought tension between the White House and his two Senate-confirmed attorneys general, Jeff Sessions and Barr. Sessions, who angered Trump because he recused himself from the Justice Department investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, was forced out shortly after the 2018 midterm elections.",
      "In a statement released after last week's election results, the Justice Department said it is \"committed to ensuring an orderly and effective transition to the new Administration.\"",
      "Beyond the political implications, like attorneys general of both parties who have preceded him, Gaetz would likely try to shape the Justice Department around the priorities of the president. And he would be all but certain to reverse course on various Biden-era policies, too.",
      "Trump has called for mass deportations, pardons for some of those convicted in the ongoing Jan. 6 investigation and regulation slashing \u2014 all actions in which the Justice Department is likely to play a central role.",
      "Trump and Republicans have long criticized Garland's leadership and targeted various Justice Department initiatives, including the expansion of civil rights and business regulation cases. Under the Trump administration, that is likely to come to an end.",
      "Much of next attorney general's work would depend on who Trump appoints to lead various Justice Department divisions, like those that handle national security and criminal matters. Trump's pick to oversee the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel will also likely be key to Trump's agenda because this office will issue decisions on the department's legal interpretation of the president's decisions. For instance, it could cement the president's power to fire certain political appointees and career government officials.",
      "FBI Director Christopher Wray reports directly to the attorney general. He was nominated by Trump in 2017 for a ten-year term. Since then, however, the president-elect has criticized the Bureau amid the federal probes into Trump's conduct, and he has vowed to implement reforms.",

It requires the schools to designate separate bathrooms, locker rooms and overnight accommodations \"for the exclusive use\" of either males and females, based on one's gender assigned at or near birth, in both school buildings and facilities used for a school-sponsored event.",
      "The legislation would not apply to school employees, emergencies or people helping young children or those with disabilities, and schools would still be able to provide single-use and family bathroom facilities.",

      "\"If allowed to go into effect, SB 104 will create unsafe environments for trans and gender non-conforming individuals of all ages,\" Jocelyn Rosnick, the group's policy director, said in a statement. \"This bill ignores the material reality that transgender people endure higher rates of sexual violence and assaults, particularly while using public restrooms, than people who are not transgender.\"",
      "Transgender and gender-nonbinary teens who were subject to restroom or locker room restrictions had a higher prevalence of sexual assault, according to a 2019 study published in the journal Pediatrics. About 36% of surveyed teens reported sexual assault, the study found.",

      "A majority of these megadonors were Republicans, according to Open Secrets, the nonpartisan watchdog organization that tracks the influence of money on politics.\u00a0 And with Trump's decisive victory, they hit the jackpot.",
      "So, who are these high rollers and what do they want in return for their generosity?",
      "Often, megadonors get lumped together in a single basket as plutocrats whose largesse is mostly about increasing their wealth with government contracts, tax breaks and regulatory relief, corrupting the democratic process along the way, according to critics of the U.S.' campaign finance system. There's certainly truth to that, but the story is more complicated.",
      "The super wealthy titans of tech and industry don't always share the same motivations and goals.\u00a0 Some are single-minded about bankrolling candidates as a way to bolster their bottom lines. But others are more ideologically driven, passionate about pet policies or reforming the way the government operates. Still others are driven by the scale of their ambitions or they crave the contact high of proximity to power.",
      "In some ways political giving defies neat categories, and some megadonors may have overlapping interests.\u00a0 Some donors' primary motivation may be an ideological commitment to unleashing the power of free markets, but that may also benefit their personal business interests.",
      "Others may be more transactional, fending off government investigations into their businesses or securing lucrative contracts, although that might coincide with their political beliefs.",
      "\"Megadonors can have a variety of financial, ideological or personal motivations for pouring millions into politics,\" said Brendan Fischer, deputy executive director of Undocumented, an investigative watchdog group. \"These motivations can operate on a spectrum or as a Venn diagram.\"",
      "But either way, with so much money flooding into American politics, it is helpful to be aware of the agendas and interests behind the torrent of cash gushing into the system. What follows is a taxonomy of the Republican donor class in the wake of a momentous election that has many wondering where the country is headed and who stands to benefit from the money that is driving the change.",
      "The Oligarch",
      "One dictionary definition of an oligarch is a \"very wealthy business leader who helps to run the government.\" That would seem to fit Elon Musk, the world's richest man, who personally gave more than $130 million (and his super PAC gave $200 million) to help Trump win back the White House. Musk has wasted no time taking advantage of his election dividend.",
      "He's been weighing in on key staffing decisions, has been named to head up (along with Vivek Ramaswamy) a commission on government efficiency and, according to Axios, even joined a call that Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week. Musk also traveled with Trump to Washington Wednesday for meetings with President Biden and with congressional Republicans.",
      "Musk stands to benefit financially from that clout he has with the incoming administration. His companies are mammoth players across some of the most powerful sectors of the economy, from electric vehicles to rocketry and space exploration, from satellite-powered internet technology to artificial intelligence. According to the New York Times, Musk has at least 100 different contracts with the federal government with 17 different agencies. His SpaceX rocket company already has tens of billions of dollars in government contracts and stands to gain billions more during a Trump presidency.",
      "And Musk has carefully cultivated key government regulators who could bring him a financial windfall after Trump takes office. One, according to Politico, is FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, who Trump is expected to name as the agency's chairman. Carr has been critical of his fellow commissioners for cutting Musk's Starlink satellite company out of the Biden administration's rural broadband program, denying him hundreds of millions or even potentially billions in subsidies.",
      "Meanwhile look for Musk to influence SEC and other regulatory appointments that could stop investigations into his businesses. But what makes Musk unique is that his influence far transcends U.S. policies that could benefit his own businesses. Musk, through his global business empire, has the power to affect geopolitics on a scale perhaps greater than any person outside of government in history.",
      "His personal wealth, estimated at $314 billion dollars (it jumped about $70 billion since Trump was elected), is greater than the GDP of multiple countries combined and the defense budgets of many industrialized Western countries. Musk's Starlink owns at least half of the satellites currently in orbit. Through Starlink, Musk has the power to alter the course of wars, since the communications constellation he controls is often the primary way governments can get internet access in combat zones. His ambitions seem boundless \u2014 he even hopes to be at the forefront of colonizing space.",
      "And none of that even takes into account his ownership of X, the social media platform he bought for $44 billion in 2022 and positioned as a MAGA megaphone to help Trump.",
      "\"All oligarchs have wealth power at their disposal, but not all are positioned in the same way,\" said Jeffrey Winters, a professor at Northwestern who is an expert on oligarchs. \"Some sell candy bars everyone eats. Others are engaged in space, high tech, own major media or have defense contracts. This takes their power to another level.\"",
      "The Pragmatist",
      "These are the megadonors who are laser-focused on influencing policy and legislation on behalf of their business interests. They may be hard-edged conservatives, but they are pragmatic about how their political giving can help their bottom line and the American economy. A quintessential example would be Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of the Citadel hedge fund, who gave $100,000,000 in the 2024 cycle, putting him at No. 5 on the list of top contributors, according to Open Secrets.",
      "A self-described \"Reagan Republican,\" Griffin has long given to more establishment-oriented Super PACs like the Senate Leadership Fund and its counterpart in the lower chamber, the Congressional Leadership Fund. He has not donated to Trump. Nor has he given money to political causes closely associated with Trump's America First agenda. Instead, he has been tactical in his giving, focusing often on Republican candidates in down-ballot races who have business experience or are military veterans and can give Congress a more business-oriented complexion.",
      "\"Griffin is more of an establishment Republican more aligned with the traditional goals of the party, rather than the Trumpy wing,\" says Anna Massoglia, a campaign finance expert.",
      "Griffin said in a statement to CBS News, \"I'm grateful for our country and for all those who've come before us. Going forward, we all share a duty to further strengthen our nation and improve the lives of our fellow citizens. As such, I support solution-oriented leaders who share my commitment to individual rights and freedom, economic policies encouraging prosperity and upward mobility, access to high-quality education for all children and young adults, safe communities, and a strong national defense.\"",
      "A more cutting-edge example of the pragmatists are donors who back the crypto-currency industry.\u00a0Crypto Super PACs such as Fairshake and Defend American Jobs have been determined in their contributions to help elect pro-crypto candidates.",
      "Defend America Jobs poured in $40 million to help elect Bernie Moreno, the crypto-friendly candidate who defeated long-time Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown in the Ohio Senate race. Among those boosters of crypto and other digital currencies who gave heavily during the 2024 cycle were Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, whose venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz ponied up $45.2 million to pro-crypto super PACs. CBS News was not able to reach Andreesen Horowitz for comment.",
      "Winklevoss Capital Management, the firm run by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, chipped in another $5 million. \"The crypto army is striking!\" Tyler Winklevoss posted on X on Election NIght, hailing Brown's defeat. But bucking the trend toward purely partisan contributions, the crypto industry gives to Republicans and Democrats alike, so long as they commit to keeping their industry unshackled by government regulations.",
      "The Ideologue",
      "These megadonors are more driven by personal causes that are not directly tied to their business interests. A representative example is Miriam Adelson, who along with her now-deceased husband Sheldon Adelson has been a casino magnate and major supporter of Jewish and Israel causes. In 2024, Miriam Adelson contributed more than $132 million to help Trump's election effort. Adelson knows that her largesse drives results.",
      "After the Adelsons donated tens of millions of dollars to help Trump win the White House in 2016, the new president announced the U.S. government would recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and said he would move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Adelsons even offered to pay for the construction of the new embassy. Miriam Adelson has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "\"These are passion projects, not attempts to feather the nest,\" says one Republican who knows Adelson but asked not to be named in discussing her donations.",
      "Another high-profile example of ideological givers are the billionaire shipping supply magnates Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein. The Wisconsin-based manufacturers of cardboard boxes and other packaging supplies, the Uihleins' business skyrocketed in sales in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic ignited an e-commerce boom. The Uihleins did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "During the 2024 campaign cycle, they were among the top five political donors, contributing more than $133 million to conservative causes. While much of their money went to Trump's election, they also gave generously to other MAGA-allied causes. They've given to so-called election integrity groups that questioned the results of the 2020 election, as well as organizations like Moms for Liberty, which advocates against public school curricula that mention LGBTQ rights or critical race theory and supports book bans.",
      "The Enigma",
      "Some megadonors are so discreet about their political giving that it is hard to know what category they belong in. One example is Tim Mellon, the reclusive railroad magnate and heir to the Gilded Age Mellon fortune who happens to have given more money to Trump's election (at least $197 million) than any other donor.",
      "Mellon doesn't go on cable TV or hobnob with politicos at party conventions, but he has written a memoir and penned some opinion pieces that offer some clues. Early in his adult life, he held liberal views on race, the problem of income equality and the environment. But as Mellon's business career evolved, he developed a strong antipathy for what he viewed as intrusive government regulations on business, which seems to have strongly shaped his political views.",
      "One defining episode for Mellon occurred after he bought an airport in Connecticut in the late 1990s. He cut down 340 trees, arguing that they posed a danger to pilots landing their planes. But state environmental regulators ultimately sued him and won. He was ordered to pay tens of thousands of dollars in damages. Did that experience fuel his desire to influence politics with his vast fortune? Perhaps, but it is also the case that Mellon has contributed to causes that would seem to have little to do with his particular business interests.",
      "In the 2024 cycle he also gave $25 million to support Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential run. Some speculated that Mellon was trying to be a spoiler to help Trump, whom he was also backing financially.\u00a0 But last August, he wrote an article in the American Spectator explaining his support for Kennedy.\u00a0 Mellon, it turns out, is a COVID-19 vaccine skeptic. \"I could not fathom how a 'vaccine' could be foisted on the general public with so little (if any) adequate testing.\"",
      "He began giving to Kennedy's Children's Health Defense, which promotes false information about vaccines \u2014 and later to the Super PAC supporting Kennedy. None of that would seem to help Mellon's personal business interests. Mellon did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "summary": "Tulsi Gabbard represented Hawaii as a Democrat in the U.S. House from 2013 to 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he has selected former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to serve as his director of national intelligence. Gabbard represented Hawaii in Congress as a Democrat from 2013 to 2021 and unsuccessfully sought the party's presidential nomination in 2020.",
      "\"For over two decades, Tulsi has fought for our country and the freedoms of all Americans,\" Trump said in a statement announcing Gabbard as his pick. \"As a former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, she has broad support in both parties \u2014 she is now a proud Republican!\"",
      "The president-elect said Gabbard \"will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community, championing our constitutional rights, and securing peace through strength.\"",
      "The position requires Senate confirmation.",
      "Gabbard does not have experience in the field of intelligence and opposes the United States' intervention in the war in Ukraine.",
      "In February 2022, just as Russia was preparing to invade Ukraine, Gabbard took to social media to blame the Biden administration, writing, \"This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia's legitimate security concerns regarding Ukraine's becoming a member of NATO, which would mean US/NATO forces right on Russia's border.\"",
      "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in 2019 that she believed the Russians were \"grooming\" a Democratic presidential primary contender to be a third-party candidate, which appeared to be a reference to Gabbard. Gabbard sued Clinton for defamation in 2020, but dropped the suit shortly after it was filed.",
      "In 2019, Gabbard also expressed opposition to U.S. involvement in Syria's civil war and said the country's leader, Bashar al-Assad, \"is not the enemy of the United States because Syria does not pose a direct threat to the United States.\" Gabbard\u00a0met with Assad\u00a0in 2017, which she defended at the time as a \"fact-finding mission,\" but in 2019 she described him a \"brutal dictator.\"",
      "Gabbard served in the Army National Guard for more than 20 years and was deployed to Iraq and Kuwait. She was elected as a Democrat to represent Hawaii in Congress in 2012 and served four terms. During her tenure in the House, Gabbard served on the Armed Services, Homeland Security and Foreign Affairs committees.",
      "During the 2020 presidential campaign, she opted not to pursue another term in the House and instead\u00a0mounted a longshot bid\u00a0for the Democratic presidential nomination.",
      "Gabbard\u00a0announced in 2022\u00a0that she would be leaving the Democratic Party, claiming it was \"under the complete control of an elitist cabal of warmongers\" driven by \"wokeness.\"",
      "She endorsed Trump in his bid for the White House in August and was\u00a0tapped to serve\u00a0as co-chair of his transition team with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who had also been a lifelong Democrat until he ran for president as an independent and then endorsed Trump.",
      "Trump has spent the days following his election to a second term\u00a0filling the ranks of his Cabinet and senior staff at the White House. Among those the president-elect has tapped for his national security team are Rep. Michael Waltz of Florida for national security adviser, former Rep. John Ratcliffe for CIA director and Fox News host Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense.",
      "Gabbard's selection to join Trump's administration continues a shift in political allegiance for the former Democrat, who endorsed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent, during the 2016 presidential campaign and\u00a0stepped down from her role\u00a0as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee to do so.",

    "summary": "Sen. John Thune\u200b of South Dakota won on the second round of voting against Sen. John Cornyn\u200b of Texas in the race for Senate Republican leader.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans elected Sen. John Thune as leader on Wednesday, after Minority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2014 the longest serving leader in the Senate history \u2014 opted to step down from the post.",
      "Thune, the current whip, won 29 votes on the second round of voting against the former Whip Sen. John Cornyn, who received 24. Sen. Rick Scott was eliminated after the first round after receiving the least votes.",
      "Meeting behind closed doors on Wednesday morning, the Republican senators cast secret ballots to elect their new leadership, as the three candidates vied for Senate Republican leader, with President-elect Donald Trump's shadow looming over the race.",
      "A candidate needed a majority of the conference, or 27 votes, to become leader.",
      "\"It's a new day in the United States Senate and it's a new day in America,\" Thune told reporters following the leadership elections. \"The American people have loudly rejected the failed policies of the Biden-Harris-Schumer agenda.\"",
      "The South Dakota Republican said the \"Republican team is united,\" adding that \"we are excited to reclaim the majority and to get to work with our colleagues in the House to enact President Trump's agenda.\"",
      "\"We have a mandate from the American people,\" Thune continued. He cited the Democrats' defeat last week, and he promised to deliver on Trump's priorities. \"We will make sure that the president and his team have the tools and support that they need to enforce border security laws and to remove the violent criminals who are wreaking havoc in every one of our states.\"",
      "Thune outlined that Republicans will work to streamline \"the bureaucratic machine,\" overturn \"costly\" regulations, and work to restore energy dominance in America to lower costs and bolster national security.",
      "\"I'm excited to get to work with this team right away,\" Thune said, while pledging to be a leader for the entire Republican conference, no matter who they supported for the role.",
      "Thune of South Dakota, Cornyn of Texas and Scott were gunning for the top role, having worked behind the scenes for months to win support from their colleagues. But the leadership race took on new meaning following the 2024 elections, which saw Republicans take control of the Senate for the 119th Congress. With Trump's return to the White House next year, and with Republicans projected to retain control of the House, the GOP will have a unified government in Washington, teeing up a long list of legislative priorities for the new Senate leader to work on with Trump.",
      "Though Trump didn't make an endorsement in the leadership race, he loomed large over the contest, weighing in with demands for the new leader to speed the confirmation of his nominees. Thune made clear Wednesday that the the GOP majority will work to process Trump's nominees quickly.",
      "Even without a Trump endorsement, his MAGA base of supporters made clear who they favored in the race, launching a vocal social media campaign for Scott as leader in recent days and warning that Cornyn and Thune would threaten Trump's agenda.",
      "Scott was considered the underdog in the race, facing Thune and Cornyn, who both have years of experience in leadership \u2014 but who have also been less reliable supporters of Trump. The Florida Republican challenged McConnell for the role in 2022, when he earned just 10 votes.",
      "Scott said in a statement after his loss that he will \"do everything possible to make sure John Thune is successful in accomplishing President Trump's agenda.\"",
      "\"I may have lost the vote, but I am optimistic,\" Scott said, adding that he ran for leader \"to fundamentally change how the Senate operates and upend the status quo.\"",
      "Senate Republicans also elected the rest of the leadership slate, with Sen. John Barrasso as whip, Sen. Tom Cotton as conference chair, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito as Policy Committee chair and Sen. Tim Scott as chair of the GOP campaign arm, the NRSC.",
      "Capito praised Vice President-elect and Sen. JD Vance, who voted with the Republican conference on Wednesday. Capitol said that Vance was \"in there with us every step of the way,\" to ensure that Republicans across government are \"going to have a united voice.\"",

      "\"I am honored to announce that I have nominated Pete Hegseth to serve in my Cabinet as The Secretary of Defense,\" Trump said in a statement Tuesday night. \"Pete has spent his entire life as a Warrior for the Troops, and for the Country. Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First. With Pete at the helm, America's enemies are on notice \u2014 Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down.\"",
      "Hegseth, the co-host of \"Fox & Friends Weekends,\" is a longtime conservative and staunch Trump ally who has talked about the changes Trump should make at the Pentagon. He said the Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Charles Q. Brown should be fired for \"pursuing the radical positions of left-wing politicians.\"",
      "And he believes women should not be in combat for the U.S. military, a point he reiterated last week in an interview with \"The Shawn Ryan Show\" podcast.",
      "\"I'm just saying straight-up, we should not have women in combat roles,\" he said. \"It hasn't made us more effective. It hasn't made us more lethal. Has made fighting more complicated.\"",
      "\"We've all served with women, and they're great,\" he told Ryan. But \"our institutions don't have to incentivize that in places where traditionally \u2014 not traditionally \u2014 over human history, men in those positions are more capable.\" Ashton Carter, who was defense secretary during the Obama administration, opened all combat roles to women in 2015.",
      "Hegseth is the author of the recent book \"The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free,\" a New York Times bestseller, in which he denounces what he calls the \"warped, woke, and caustic policies of our current military.\"",
      "In it, he blamed former President Barack Obama and the Pentagon for shortfalls in recruitment, claiming they \"embraced the social justice messages of gender equity, racial diversity, climate stupidity, and the LGBTQA+ alphabet soup in their recruiting pushes.\" He continued: \"Only one problem: There just aren't enough lesbians from San Francisco who want to join the 82nd Airborne. Not only do the lesbians not join, but those very same ads turn off the young, patriotic, Christian men who have traditionally filled our ranks.\"",

He\u00a0has tattoos associated with white supremacists and neo-Nazis (on a recent podcast, Hegseth defended one as \"just a Christian symbol\").",
      "Hegseth previously served as head of Concerned Veterans for America, a group backed by conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch.",
      "In 2012, Hegseth\u00a0ran for Senate\u00a0as a Republican in his home state of Minnesota but withdrew from the race following the state convention. Kurt Bills, a state representative, won the GOP nomination but lost in the general election to Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar.",
      "Hegseth has \"an excellent background as a junior officer but does not have the senior national security experience that secretaries need,\" Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told The Associated Press, adding that the lack of experience might make it more difficult for Hegseth to get through Senate confirmation.",
      "Asked about the choice Tuesday night, Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst told CBS News that Hegseth is \"going to be a very strong secretary.\"",

      "Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, asked what he thought of Hegseth for the post, responded, \"I'd have to think about it.\"",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina called the choice \"interesting,\" and Sen. Todd Young of Indiana said he doesn't have \"a sense of his background.\"",
      "\"Wow,\" was the response from Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, when she learned of the selection from a reporter. Asked if Hegseth was a good choice, she replied, \"I'm just surprised. I'm not going to comment whether it's good, bad or indifferent. I'm just surprised because the names that I've heard for secretary of defense have not included him.\"",

      "By leaving before the start of Trump's second term, Smith would keep the president-elect from firing him, as Trump has said repeatedly he plans to do. The special counsel is expected to issue a final report, as required by Justice Department rules, though it will likely be more historical than factual.",
      "It's unclear when the report will be submitted to Attorney General Merrick Garland and likely sent to Congress, as the attorney general has done with reports from other special counsels\u00a0before they were made public. The New York Times first reported Smith's plans to step down.",
      "Smith was appointed by Garland two years ago to take over the Justice Department's investigations into Trump: the first involving his handling of sensitive government documents after leaving office at the end of his first term; and the second related to an alleged scheme to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 presidential election.",
      "The special counsel brought charges last year against Trump as a result of both probes. The president-elect was charged with 40 counts\u00a0related to the documents marked classified recovered from his South Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, and his alleged attempts to interfere with the Justice Department's investigation. He was also charged with four counts stemming from what prosecutors said was an unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the last presidential election.",
      "Proceedings in the case related to the 2020 election were paused for several months as Trump pursued claims that he was shielded from federal prosecution by presidential immunity. The Supreme Court ruled in July that former presidents cannot face charges arising from official actions taken while in the White House.",

      "Here's how the vacancies will be filled:",
      "Filling vacancies in the Senate",
      "Rules differ across states for how to fill a Senate vacancy. In 45 states, governors appoint replacements to serve until the next election, while in just five states \u2014 Kentucky, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin \u2014 vacancies are filled by expedited special elections.",
      "Trump tapped Vance, an Ohio Republican first elected to the Senate in 2022, as his running mate in July, prompting him to depart from the Senate to serve as vice president following the election. And Trump is expected to name Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida as his nominee for secretary of state, a Cabinet position that requires confirmation by the Senate.",
      "In both Florida and Ohio, the governor appoints a replacement to serve until the next statewide election. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will appoint someone to fill the respective seats until a special election can be held in 2026. The winner of the 2026 election would serve the remainder of Vance and Rubio's terms, meaning that person would have to run for election again in 2028.",
      "Both DeWine and DeSantis have long histories with Trump, with the Ohio governor being one of the few prominent Republicans who declined to endorse Trump's 2024\u00a0 bid. And DeSantis' relationship with Trump had been similarly frosty, after the two men faced off in the GOP presidential primaries earlier this year. But both Republican governors are expected to work in the best interest of the party, especially after Trump's decisive victory.",

      "In Florida, a number of possibilities have emerged for DeSantis to appoint, including Trump's daughter in-law, Lara Trump, a co-chair of the Republican National Committee. DeSantis's chief of staff James Utheier and Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez have also been among names floated, as have Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody and former Florida House Speaker Jose Olivia.",
      "Filling vacancies in the House",
      "In the House, vacancies are filled by special elections. But the timing of those elections can vary.",
      "Trump selected Stefanik, the current Republican conference chair, to serve as his ambassador to the United Nations, teeing up a special election to fill her seat representing New York's 21st congressional district. The district, which Stefanik won by more than 20 points in her reelection bid last week, is solidly red, making it a safe seat for Republicans in a special election. But it will remain vacant until a special election is held \u2014 a timeframe that is set by Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and could take up to 90 days \u2014 taking away from what is expected to be a narrow Republican majority in the House.",
      "Rep. Michael Waltz, who Trump selected to serve as his National Security adviser, also represents a solidly red district in Florida. His seat will also be filled by a special election, and DeSantis is expected to work to quickly set a timeframe to replace him.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 05:00:06 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has called the Biden administration's student loan relief efforts a \"total catastrophe.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden made student loan forgiveness a central issue to his administration, rolling out efforts to forgive debt as well as to lower repayments for millions of borrowers. But with President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House in January, the future of those efforts is now in question.",
      "During the presidential debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump described Mr. Biden's efforts to forgive student borrowers as \"a total catastrophe.\" While he hasn't explicitly addressed his plans for student loans, he's called for eliminating the Department of Education, which manages the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio.",
      "It's unclear which agency or group would manage those loans if the Education Department were to be eliminated, a step that would require approval from Congress. The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump's plans for student debt relief.",
      "There's a lot on the line for the 46 million Americans who hold $1.7 trillion in student loans, a financial burden that about half of borrowers say has impacted their life choices, delaying home purchases or starting their families, according to a 2021 Morning Consult study. Mr. Biden's term is drawing to an end with two of his key relief efforts tied up in the courts, adding to the uncertainty about what Trump's second presidency will mean for those plans.",
      "\"We know what is in Project 2025, and we know what we saw in the first Trump administration,\" Persis Yu, managing counsel for the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student loans. \"We just should be very concerned about what the next administration will mean for borrowers.\"",
      "The next Trump administration may be unlikely to continue the Biden administration's effort to fight against ongoing lawsuits targeting current student debt relief efforts, according to NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood in an email. That could mean an end to those programs, experts say.",
      "\"Programs that the Biden administration created or expanded access to via regulatory changes could be easily rolled back,\" she added.",
      "What has Trump said about student loan relief?",
      "During his September debate with Vice President Kamala Harris,Trump bashed the Biden administration's efforts.",
      "\"When they said they're going to get student loans terminated and it ended up being a total catastrophe. He went out, got rejected again by the Supreme Court,\" Trump said, referring to the high court's 2023 decision that blocked Mr. Biden's initial student loan forgiveness program, which would have provided up to $20,000 in relief per borrower.",
      "\"So all these students got taunted with this whole thing about \u2014 this whole idea. And how unfair that would have been. Part of the reason they lost,\" he added.",
      "What does Project 2025 say about student loans?",
      "Project 2025\u00a0\u2014 an initiative overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation to guide the next Republican president in an overhaul of the executive branch \u2014 calls for the abolishment of the Department of Education, and says student loans should be handled by the private sector. It also advocates for scuttling student loan relief.",
      "\"The new administration must end the practice of acting like the federal student loan portfolio is a campaign fund to curry political support and votes,\" Project 2025 says. \"The new administration must end abuses in the loan forgiveness programs. Borrowers should be expected to repay their loans.\"",
      "It's unclear whether Trump agrees with those views, although he has called for an end to the Education Department. While on the campaign trail, Trump distanced himself from Project 2025, calling some of the proposals \"abysmal.\"",
      "What is the status of Biden's student loan relief plans?",
      "Currently, there are two student loan relief plans that are tied up in court, both of which are being challenged by Republican-led states.",
      "The\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, is an income-driven repayment program, which pegs a borrower's monthly payment to their income, lowering their financial costs. Some lower-income borrowers in SAVE have monthly payments of $0.",
      "The plan's 8 million enrollees are now in limbo, however, after court rulings blocked the Biden administration from implementing the plan. Currently, those borrowers are in forbearance through April, meaning that their loans are essentially paused while the Biden administration defends the plan in court.",
      "Separately, another Biden administration plan to use\u00a0the Higher Education Act to erase all or some of the student debt held by 30 million borrowers has also hit a legal roadblock, with a court putting that plan on hold in October.",
      "In the latter case, the Republican states argued that Mr. Biden's plan sought to \"unlawfully mass cancel up to hundreds of billions of dollars in student loans.\" The Education Department vowed to defend both plans.",
      "What could happen to these programs under Trump?",
      "Bob Eitel, who served during the first Trump administration as a senior counselor to the education secretary, said he expects the president-elect will move to rescind the proposed loan cancellation regulations.",
      "\"The Trump administration may pursue different avenues of loan relief, but it will not be the mass, blanket types of forgiveness that the current administration has pursued,\" said Eitel, president and co-founder of the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies.",
      "Some other student loan relief programs may remain, such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which would be tougher to eliminate but could become less accessible, said NerdWallet's Wood.",
      "That program, which was signed into law by former President George W. Bush in 2007, forgives student debt for public workers like teachers and police officers after 10 years in repayment. The Biden administration reworked the PSLF to make it easier for people to qualify for forgiveness, after the vast majority of people who applied were told they were ineligible.",
      "During Trump's first term, the Education Department was overseen by Betsy DeVos, who promoted school choice in K-12 and also called for deep spending cuts. She also proposed ending the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, although she was unsuccessful.",
      "Do Americans support student loan relief?",
      "It's a divisive issue among voters, with people's views colored by their political leanings and whether they themselves have student debt, according to an AP-Norc poll published in June.",
      "Only 15% of Republicans believe student loan forgiveness is important, versus 58% of Democrats. More than half of people currently paying student loans say it's an important issue, versus one-third of those with no experience with student debt, the poll found.",
      "Republicans have objected to Mr. Biden's efforts because they could deprive some lenders of revenue, while some object to forgiving loans for people who enrolled in college, given that a minority of Americans have college degrees.",
      "The Biden administration is \"saddling working Americans with Ivy League debt,\" said Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey in a September statement.",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday that billionaire Elon Musk and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy will head up a new temporary agency known as the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Trump in a statement said the two \"will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies - Essential to the 'Save America' Movement.\"",
      "Trump seemed to suggest that Musk and Ramaswamy might not formally join the government, explaining that the two would \"provide advice and guidance from outside of Government, and will partner with the White House and Office of Management & Budget to drive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to Government never seen before.\"",
      "In his own statement, Musk said the new agency \"will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in Government waste, which is a lot of people!\"",
      "Trump, in his statement, set a deadline for their work, saying it would \"conclude no later than July 4, 2026.\"",
      "\"A smaller Government, with more efficiency and less bureaucracy, will be the perfect gift to America on the 250th Anniversary of The Declaration of Independence,\" Trump wrote. \"I am confident they will succeed!\"",
      "The Trump campaign described the agency as \"potentially, the 'Manhattan Project' of our time,\" referencing the secret World War II program that was involved in developing the atomic bomb.",
      "Musk was a major part of Trump's reelection campaign effort, while Ramaswamy ran against Trump in the Republican primary before endorsing him.",
      "The department's acronym, DOGE, is also a dog meme that inspired Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency promoted by Musk that was created as a joke and is credited with being the first meme coin.",
      "It's not clear how the organization will operate. It could come under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which dictates how external groups that advise the government must operate and be accountable to the public.",
      "Federal employees are generally required to disclose their assets and entanglements to ward off any potential conflicts of interest, and to divest significant holdings relating to their work. Because Musk and Ramaswamy would not be formal federal workers, they would not face those requirements or ethical limitations.",
      "Musk has been a constant presence at Mar-a-Lago since Trump won the presidential election.",
      "The president-elect has often said he would give Musk a formal role overseeing a group akin to a blue-ribbon commission that would recommend ways to slash spending and make the federal government more efficient. Musk at one point suggested he could find more than $2 trillion in savings \u2014 nearly a third of total annual government spending.",
      "Trump had made clear that Musk would likely not hold any kind of full-time position, given his other commitments.",
      "\"I don't think I can get him full-time because he's a little bit busy sending rockets up and all the things he does,\" Trump said at a rally in Michigan in September. \"He said the waste in this country is crazy. And we're going to get Elon Musk to be our cost cutter.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 21:13:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A district court judge appointed by former President Barack Obama temporarily blocked a Louisiana law ordering schools to display the Ten Commandments.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge has temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that would have required public schools statewide to display the Ten Commandments in their classrooms by Jan. 1. U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles of Baton Rouge, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, ruled Tuesday that the law violates the free exercise and establishment clauses of the First Amendment.",
      "The ruling found the Louisiana law was \"unconstitutional on its face and in every application,\" prohibited Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill and defendants in this case from enforcing the mandate, and required them to notify public schools of the change.",
      "The Louisiana Attorney General's Office on Tuesday alleged the judge's ruling only applies to the five school districts in the state named in the lawsuit \u2014 East Baton Rouge Parish Schools, Livingston Parish Schools, St. Tammany Parish Schools, Orleans Parish Schools and Vernon Parish Schools.",
      "And in a statement provided to CBS News, Murrill said that \"we strongly disagree with the court's decision and will immediately appeal, as HB 71's implementation deadline is approaching on January 1, 2025.\"",
      "Tuesday's decision came alongside a preliminary injunction issued in a lawsuit brought by parents of Louisiana public school students, who are represented by a legal team from the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom From Religion Foundation.",
      "Defendants include Louisiana Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley, along with members of the state education board and other local school boards, all of whom the attorney general represents.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican whose push to integrate elements of his own Christian faith into secular life has been central to his political platform, signed the Ten Commandments legislation into law in June. Referred to as HB 71 in the ongoing lawsuit, it ordered all public K-12 classrooms and state-funded universities in Louisiana to display a poster-sized printout of the commandments \u2014 a set of moral directives essentially meant to lay the foundation of certain religious sects, including the Christian church \u2014 in \"large, easily readable font\" starting next year.",
      "Proponents of the law argued it would reinstate a former relic of \"state and national history, culture, and tradition\" in Louisiana's public education spaces and claimed the measure was not only rooted in religion. But those who opposed the legislation raised questions about its constitutionality.",
      "In an original complaint challenging the Ten Commandments law, the ACLU claimed it amounted to a violation of church and state and would effectively discriminate against students, particularly students who are not Christian. Their lawsuit sought a court order declaring HB 71 infringed on the constitutional religious rights laid out by the First Amendment, which forbids the government from \"establishing\" a religion, or favoring one religion over others, and protects the religious liberties of individual citizens.",
      "\"The state's main interest in passing H.B. 71 was to impose religious beliefs on public-school children, regardless of the harm to students and families,\" read the original complaint. \"The law's primary sponsor and author, Representative Dodie Horton, proclaimed during debate over the bill that it 'seeks to have a display of God's law in the classroom for children to see what He says is right and what He says is wrong.'\"",
      "The ACLU said in a statement its lawsuit represented a group of plaintiffs \"who are Jewish, Christian, Unitarian Universalist, and non-religious.\" Each felt \"the newly enacted statute violates longstanding U.S. Supreme Court precedent\" along with the U.S. Constitution, the statement added.",
      "Meanwhile, Christopher Dier, an American history teacher based in New Orleans, has filed a separate lawsuit against the new law in federal court in New Orleans. Dier's lawyers on Tuesday submitted a copy of deGravelles' ruling to the judge overseeing Dier's case as evidence to strengthen their claim that the new law is a violation of religious freedoms.",
      "\"If I had to put the Ten Commandments in my classroom, it would make me feel as if I'm a state agent, coercing students to follow one specific religion, which is not the goal of public-school educators, especially history teachers,\" said Dier, who was awarded Louisiana teacher of the year in 2020. \"We want our students to feel included.\"",
      "Nicole Hunt, an attorney with the Christian advocacy group Focus on the Family, disagrees that the displays of the Ten Commandments would single out any students or teachers in schools who do not have Christian beliefs.",
      "\"As a parent, I would be excited to see the Ten Commandments posted on my student's wall,\" Hunt told CBS News. \"They serve not only as moral guidelines for the individuals and for society, things like do not murder do not commit adultery, these are things that help to create a thriving community, and a thriving nation.\"",
      "\"It's a symbol of religious freedom in America,\" she added.",

    "summary": "Senator-elect Ruben Gallego has some advice for Democrats: \"Go touch grass and meet real Latinos.\"",
    "story": [
      "As Democrats work to sort out last week's election results and determine why they lost Latino men in droves, a Latino Democrat and senator-elect has some advice for party leaders and top consultants: \"Go touch grass and meet real Latinos.\"",
      "CBS News Tuesday projected Gallego as the victor in Arizona's U.S. Senate contest against Republican Kari Lake. He believes much of his party is out of touch with a key demographic he says they can't win national elections without.",
      "\"There is no winning nationally without Latinos,\" Gallego said in an extensive interview with CBS News senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe Tuesday. \"...There's no path forward into the Democratic Party, into a national party, without Latinos.\"",
      "Exit polls show Vice President Kamala Harris lost Latino men to President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 a significant blow to a party that's long relied on them as part of a broad coalition. The results were openly feared most of the past year by Democratic Party leaders and operatives.",
      "Going forward, Gallego said candidates need to go out and find Latinos where they already are. Gallego focused on bringing his campaign to Latino voters \u2014 sometimes, without talking about politics at all. His campaign hosted rodeos, boxing match watch parties, and carne asada cookouts. His team took food to construction shift workers at work sites after they'd clocked out in the early morning. Knocking on people's doors, after shift workers are exhausted and preparing for the next day, won't work, he said.",
      "\"Talk to them. And talk to them as often as possible,\" Gallego said. \"And don't expect you to be able to talk to them one way through TV.\"",
      "There are \"millions and millions\" of Latino men out there, Gallego said, and they're not afraid to speak their mind.",
      "Democrats on the national stage also missed the mark in how they spoke about immigration. Gallego's first Spanish-language TV ad was about border security. Latinos in Arizona looked at the migration crisis at the border, with refugees pouring into the country, and called it \"chaos,\" Gallego said.",
      "While campaigning, \"We didn't actually speak about immigration reform because we know that the Latino voter just doesn't believe it anymore,\" Gallego said, meaning, Latino voters don't believe Washington will actually pass a massive immigration reform bill in the near future.",
      "Instead, Congress needs to focus on fortifying U.S.-Mexico border security first to build trust, he said.",
      "But that message, O'Keefe suggested, may be a hard pill to swallow for fellow Democrats.",
      "\"I'm a pharmacist about to give out very hard pills in the Senate,\" Gallego said.",
      "Gallego also hinted that Democrats missed the mark on addressing inflation. Born on the south side of Chicago to a Colombian mother and a Mexican father, with his mother raising four children alone, Gallego said he knows what it's like to grow up struggling. He saw the flashing warning signs on inflation, not just in the polls, but as he talked with his working-class family members and constituents.",
      "\"Growing up working class, there's nothing more hurtful than working hard and then not being able to provide for your family,\" Gallego said. \"And I instinctively knew that's what these men were going through.\"",
      "\"This is the first time I've ever seen men say I can't do this,\" Gallego said. \"I can't keep working, and it's still not making a difference, and that's when I realized it was really kind of a problem.\"",
      "Raised by his mother, Gallego became a U.S. Marine and served in the Iraq war. He moved to Arizona for a local political job, ran and won a seat in the state House before winning his first congressional race in 2014, representing most of Phoenix and Glendale.",
      "He began on Capitol Hill with an outspoken progressive reputation and was among the Democrats calling on the U.S. Senate to abandon the filibuster. But Gallego has shifted his politics to the center in recent years, a reflection of the state's roughly three-way voter registration split between Democrats, Republicans and independents.",
      "He launched his Senate campaign nearly two years ago, focusing early advertising and outreach on his military service, a key credential in a state with a hefty military and veteran population and a history of electing military veterans, including the late Republican Sen. John McCain, to Congress. With nominal Democratic primary opposition and polls giving him an early lead, independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema announced in March she would not run for reelection, avoiding a three-way contest.",
      "Until Sinema won her Senate race in 2018, a Democrat hadn't been elected to the Senate in Arizona in three decades, though Sinema went on to leave the party. Then in 2020, Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat, won a competitive Senate race to serve the remainder of McCain's term after his death.",
      "In his race, Gallego wasn't about to give up on Trump voters \u2014 or any voters, he said.",
      "A rising star in the party \u2014 a veteran and Latino who was victorious in a state Trump won \u2014 Gallego brushed off questions about a future bid for president.",
      "\"Can I rule out running? I can \u2014 I can rule out a lot of things,\" Gallego said. \"First thing I want to focus on is this U.S. Senate race.\"",
      "\"That's not a no,\" O'Keefe pointed out.",
      "\"It's not a yes, either,\" Gallego said, adding a Spanish word for patience: \"C\u00e1lmate.\"",

      "All are under the banner of fighting what Kennedy sees as a common thread behind a broad swath of ailments: that Americans have been \"mass poisoned by big pharma and big food,\" and that federal agencies have failed to stop it. In response, he has also floated a number of specific policy ideas to remake the federal government's public health institutions.",
      "\"[Trump] asked me to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country. And he said, I want to see results, measurable results in the diminishment of chronic disease within two years. And I said, Mr. President, I will do that,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",

      "\"What we don't really need at HHS is more medical expertise. What we need is an expertise on decoupling the agency from institutional corruption. Because it's the corruption that has distorted the science,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has said he hopes \"to have every nutritional scientist\" across the Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture \"fired on Day One.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has been floated to head the Department of Health and Human Services, though some allies say he could be more effective in a \"czar\" type role out of the White House.",
      "\"Get the chemicals out\" of food",
      "When talking about his platform, Kennedy often lampoons products like McDonald's French fries or Fruit Loops cereal as examples of how foods sold in the U.S. are made with ingredients that are banned or discouraged abroad, or have changed for the worse.",
      "\"It's easy to fix. We have a thousand ingredients in our foods that are illegal in Italy and other countries in Europe,\" he said on Oct. 29.",
      "Trump agrees with his plans to \"get the chemicals out\" of America's food supply, Kennedy says, which also includes upending the use of common pesticides and herbicides by American farmers.",
      "Kennedy has described the food in the U.S. as \"just poison,\" citing his own anecdotal experience with his son struggling with eczema while eating pasta in the U.S.",
      "\"When he ate any kind of pasta in this country, he would get these terrible, terrible outbreaks, you know, really agonizing. And he moved to Italy and he lived off of pasta for a year and a half and he never got a case,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy suspects that was caused by glyphosate, used in Roundup brand weed-killers, which Italy moved to start restricting in 2016. Italy's decision was over worries that it could pose a cancer risk, and some advocacy groups in the U.S. have also voiced similar concerns.",
      "Agricultural trade associations have defended glyphosate as \"one of the safest, most effective\" tools farmers have to manage weeds and support \"important conservation practices.\"",
      "Kennedy's plea to crack down on food additives and chemicals comes as the FDA is in the middle of launching its own new effort \u2014 and is calling on Congress to step up funding for \u2014 scrutinizing chemicals currently allowed in foods.",
      "Food industry groups have generally voiced support for the FDA to step up its vetting of chemicals in food, in hopes that it \"negates the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures drawing up their own restrictions.",
      "Reducing unhealthy and processed foods in federal programs",
      "Kennedy has also promised to \"get processed food out of school lunch immediately\" and voiced frustration over the amount of federal food assistance for low-income Americans that goes towards sugary drinks and processed food.",
      "One way Kennedy could try to get at this issue is through the federal dietary guidelines process, jointly run by the USDA and HHS, which is in the final stages of crafting the next edition of recommendations that influence a broad range of government nutrition programs.",
      "\"Kids shouldn't be eating grains. They should definitely not be eating seed oils. And they for sure should not be eating sugar. And yet that is what we're forcing them to eat,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "On seed oils, Kennedy has claimed that the switch away from oils like beef tallow which were high in saturated fats in favor of vegetable oils was a mistake, and is to blame for a rise in obesity rates. That puts him at odds with longstanding recommendations to limit saturated fats.",
      "\"The guidance around this has been reviewed many times since, and has only become stronger in its conclusion for the role of saturated fat, particularly in its relationship with higher risks of cardiovascular disease,\" Deirdre Tobias, a researcher on this year's Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, said last month.",
      "Grains have been more divisive at this year's committee and the broader scientific community, which has debated setting lower limits to overall grain consumption alongside recommendations to switch from refined to whole grains.",
      "Setting new limits is difficult, scientists on the panel have said, because the only source of some key nutrients for many Americans is cereals and breads fortified with vitamins.",
      "Kennedy has also been critical of the panel of outside researchers put together to create the scientific report underpinning the recommendations, but acknowledges broader changes will also be needed to move the needle.",
      "While Kennedy says he personally would \"never eat anything in a package\" as a rule of thumb, he acknowledges \"most people don't have access to the resources I have.\"",
      "\"We need to start forcing these companies to internalize their costs. So the illusion of cheap food goes away, right? Because if you're drinking Coke and it seems cheap and it gives you diabetes over the long run, that's not very cheap,\" he said on Sept. 30.",
      "Curbing the influence of drugmakers",
      "Kennedy has called for a \"review\" of guidelines that govern advertising by pharmaceutical companies.",
      "The FDA currently regulates advertising about prescription drugs, going after drugmakers that misrepresent their products. Responsibility for some other medical products is shared between the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "Kennedy has urged Trump to go further, saying he is advising the president-elect to \"ban pharmaceutical advertising on TV\" over concerns that it is influencing news coverage of health issues.",
      "He has also urged reform of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which charges pharmaceutical companies millions of dollars for the cost of the FDA vetting their applications to decide whether to approve new drugs.",
      "\"We need to end the corruption. 50% of FDA's budget comes not from the taxpayer, but from the pharmaceutical industry,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "Kennedy has not said how Congress or the Trump administration would make up the difference from the fees if they were cut, which amount to around $3 billion out of FDA's budget.",
      "Undoing the fees could leave taxpayers effectively subsidizing a hefty bill previously paid for by drugmakers \u2014 or a return to the significant delays for new medications that initially spurred the creation of the fees.",
      "Promoting alternatives to drugs",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of waging a \"war on public health\" which he says includes \"aggressive suppression\" of anything \"that advances human health and can't be patented by Pharma.\"",
      "In his view, that includes treatments like psychedelics, which recently fell short of FDA approval, and foods like raw milk, which officials have stepped up warnings against amid this year's unprecedented bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Kennedy has also praised the dietary supplement industry for a court win against the FDA, after the agency tried to take action against what it said was an illegally marketed anti-aging drug.",
      "Also on Kennedy's list are things like \"clean foods\" and exercise, which he wants to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover.",
      "The promise has echoes of the \"food is medicine\" initiative, which has called for the health care system to offer more financial support for healthier lifestyle habits.",
      "\"If a doctor's patient has diabetes or obesity, the doctor ought to be able to say, I'm going to recommend gym membership, and I'm going to recommend, good food and Medicaid ought to be able to finance those things the same as they would Ozempic,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has also promised to promote healthier lifestyles in other ways, ranging from requiring nutrition classes in federally funded medical schools to reviving the presidential fitness test in schools.",
      "\"Informed choices\" on vaccines",
      "Kennedy has a long record criticizing the safety of vaccines, including recent misleading claims that shots have an \"exemption from pre-licensing safety testing\" before they are approved.",
      "In fact, the FDA requires new vaccines be studied for their safety and efficacy in large trials, results of which are published in peer-reviewed journals and publicly disclosed.",
      "His activism on the issue dates back decades, including a now-retracted article he published in Rolling Stone in 2005 claiming a link between autism and an ingredient called thimerosal that had been used in vaccines before 2001 \u2014 which medical research has disproven. His focus has broadened since then.",
      "\"This doesn't mean vaccines is the only cause of autism. Our kids today are swimming around in a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods that operate along the same biological pathways. But some of it's coming from pharmaceutical drugs,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that is not \"anti-vaccine\" and would not seek to ban them under Trump, instead saying he wants to \"restore the transparency\" around them \u2014 echoing lawsuits by the group he chaired, Children's Health Defense, over its Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "\"[Trump] doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country. You ought to know the risks and benefits of everything you take,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "But Kennedy has also asserted \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and encouraged people to \"resist\" CDC guidelines on vaccines for kids \u2014 raising concern among public health officials, who point to the success of vaccination in saving millions of children worldwide from debilitating illness or premature death from preventable diseases.",
      "Opposing water fluoridation",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy said one of Trump's first acts in the White House would be to \"advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water.\"",
      "While a number of health risks have been tied to higher levels of fluoride, most are extremely rare in the U.S. and involve far greater exposure than what is added to drinking water.",
      "Fluoride has been incorporated into a majority of U.S. water systems for decades. The American Dental Association estimates that the practice has reduced tooth decay by about 25%, though some research suggests modern use of toothpaste with fluoride has reduced the policy's benefits.",
      "Kennedy's announcement does come as the Environmental Protection Agency is now under a federal court order to take action over one specific risk: the concern that fluoride might lower children's IQ \"at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" stemming in large part from a report published by the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Beyond influencing what rule the Trump administration's EPA ends up pursuing in response to the order, Kennedy could also take aim at fluoride through another route: changing the CDC's widely-cited statement about the practice, which hails water fluoridation as one of the greatest \"public health achievements of the 20th century.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has described fluoride as \"a poison\" and praised the nonprofits for suing over the issue.",
      "\"The simple answer is I don't like it,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",

    "summary": "Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows was charged with two counts in the case brought by Fulton County prosecutors over alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday turned away former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows' bid to move his state prosecution to federal court in the case stemming from an alleged effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia.",
      "The court's denial of Meadows' appeal leaves in place a lower court decision that returned the prosecution to state court. Meadows and President-elect Donald Trump, for whom he worked, were charged alongside 17 others by Fulton County prosecutors for their alleged efforts to reverse Trump's electoral loss in Georgia in 2020.",
      "They pleaded not guilty to all charges. Proceedings have been on hold for months as a Georgia appeals court is set to consider in December whether to allow Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to continue prosecuting Trump and his allies.",
      "Meadows served as Trump's chief of staff from March 2020 to January 2021 and was a prominent figure in the president-elect's attempts to stay in office for a consecutive term after the November 2020 presidential election.",
      "Two counts were brought against him by Fulton County prosecutors: the first alleges that he engaged in a wide-ranging racketeering conspiracy with Trump, and the second alleges he participated in an effort to solicit a public officer, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, to violate his oath of office.",
      "Meadows is portrayed in the indictment returned in August 2023 as a go-between for Trump and others involved in coordinating the strategy for contesting the 2020 election and disrupting the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021. He participated in a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call between Trump and Raffensperger, during which the then-president asked Raffensperger to \"find\" 11,780 votes, enough to make him the winner of Georgia's election.",
      "After Meadows was charged, he sought to transfer the case to federal court under a federal officer removal statute and argued that the actions alleged in the indictment related to his role as chief of staff.",
      "The district court, however, sent the case back to the Fulton County Superior Court. While U.S. District Judge Steve Jones conceded that some of the charged conduct involved Meadows' official duties, there was not enough evidence to establish that a \"heavy majority\" of the acts alleged against him related to his role as chief of staff.",
      "\"Meadows's alleged association with post-election activities was not related to his role as White House Chief of Staff or his executive branch authority,\" Jones wrote in his September 2023 decision.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld the district court's decision, finding that the federal officer removal statute does not apply to former federal officers and \"his participation in an alleged conspiracy to overturn a presidential election was not related to his official duties.\"",
      "\"At bottom, whatever the chief of staff's role with respect to state election administration, that role does not include altering valid election results in favor of a particular candidate,\" Chief Judge William Pryor wrote for the three-judge panel.",
      "Meadows appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that whether a chief of staff prosecuted based on actions related to his work for the president can remove his case to federal court is not a close call.",
      "Calling the 11th Circuit's decision \"miserly and counterintuitive,\" Meadow's lawyers warned in a filing that allowing it to stand would open former federal officers up to politicized state prosecutions for unpopular federal policies.",
      "\"The chief of staff is a unique federal officer, the top aide to a coequal branch of government personified by the president,\" they wrote. \"If former officers cannot remove at all, and if even a current chief of staff cannot remove a case arising out of acts taken in the White House in service of the president, then the floodgates are open, and 'nightmare scenarios' will not take long to materialize.\"",
      "Fulton County prosecutors urged the Supreme Court to reject Meadows' appeal and leave the 11th Circuit's decision in place. They noted that Trump did not even move his case to federal court, and said Meadows failed to \"articulate any coherent source of authority for the president or his staff to supervise or affect a state's administration of elections.\"",

    "story": [
      "Covering your surfboard in bright lights sounds like an open invitation to great white sharks, but research released Tuesday by Australian scientists found it might actually stave off attacks.",
      "Biologist Laura Ryan said the predator often attacked its prey from underneath, occasionally mistaking a surfer's silhouette for the outline of a seal.",

      "Seal-shaped decoys were strung with different configurations of LED lights and towed behind a boat to see which attracted the most attention.",

      "\"It's like an invisibility cloak but with the exception that we are splitting the object, the visual silhouette, into smaller bits,\" Hart said.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency rule follows through on a directive from Congress included in the 2022 climate law. The new fee is intended to encourage industry to adopt best practices that reduce emissions of methane - the primary component of natural gas - and thereby avoid paying.",
      "Methane is a climate \"super pollutant\" that is far more potent in the short term than carbon dioxide and is responsible for about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States, and advocates say reduction of methane emissions is a crucial way to slow climate change.",
      "The rule, set to be announced Tuesday at an international climate conference in Azerbaijan, comes hours after President-elect Donald Trump named former New York congressman Lee Zeldin to head the agency in Trump's second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Zeldin is expected to move to reverse or loosen dozens of environmental regulations approved under President Biden as Trump seeks to establish U.S. \"energy dominance\u2033 worldwide.",
      "Trump is likely to target the methane fee amid a flurry of expected actions he has promised to deregulate the oil and gas industry.",
      "As outlined by the EPA, excess methane produced in 2024 could result in a fee of $900 per ton, with fees rising to $1,200 per ton in 2025 and $1,500 per ton by 2026. Industry groups are likely to challenge the rule, including any effort to impose a retroactive fee.",
      "The rule wouldn't become final until early next year, following publication in the Federal Register.",
      "EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that the rule will work in tandem with a new EPA rule on methane emissions imposed this year. The rule targets the U.S. oil and natural gas industry for its role in global warming as Mr. Biden seeks to secure his legacy on fighting climate change.",
      "The fee, formally known as the Waste Emissions Charge, will encourage early deployment of available technologies to reduce methane emissions and other harmful air pollutants, Regan said. The fee \"is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden's methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,\" he said.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-led states have challenged the earlier methane rule in court, but lost a bid for the Supreme Court to block the rule while the case continues before lower-level judges.",
      "Opponents argue that the EPA overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards with the new regulations. The EPA, though, said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public.",
      "Many large oil and gas companies already meet or exceed methane-performance levels set by Congress under the climate law, meaning they are unlikely to be forced to pay the new fee, Regan and other officials said.",
      "Even so, the EPA estimates that the rule will result in cumulative emissions reductions of 1.2 million metric tons of methane (the equivalent of 34 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide) through 2035. That figure is similar to clean-air gains from taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year, the EPA said. Cumulative climate benefits could total as much $2 billion, the agency said.",
      "Like the earlier methane rule, the new fee faces a near-certain legal challenge from industry groups. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, called a fee proposed earlier this year a \"punitive tax increase\" that \"undermines America's energy advantage.''",
      "The API said it looks forward to working with Congress to repeal the \"misguided new tax on American energy.\"",
      "Environmental groups, for their part, have hailed the impending methane fee, saying oil and gas companies should be held accountable for pollution that contributes to global warming. Oil and gas companies routinely calculate that it's cheaper to waste methane through flaring and other techniques than to make necessary upgrades to prevent leaks, they said.",
      "The EPA said it expects that over time, fewer oil and gas companies will be charged for excess methane as they reduce emissions in compliance with the rule.",

    "summary": "1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led archeologists to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that was decisive in the spread of Islam in the region.",
    "story": [
      "Beirut \u2014 Declassified 1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led a British-Iraqi archeological team to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that became decisive in the spread of Islam throughout the region.",
      "The Battle of al-Qadisiyah was fought in Mesopotamia \u2014 in present-day Iraq \u2014 in the A.D. 630s between Arab Muslims and the army of the Sassanid Persian dynasty during a period of Muslim expansion. The Arab army prevailed and continued on its march into Persia, now Iran.",
      "A joint team of archeologists from the U.K.'s Durham University and the University of Al-Qadisiyah stumbled across the site while undertaking a remote sensing survey to map the Darb Zubaydah, a pilgrimage route from Iraq's Kufa to Mecca in Saudi Arabia built more than 1,000 years ago. The findings were published Tuesday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "While mapping the route, the team noticed that a site some 20 miles south of Kufa in Iraq's southern Najaf province \u2014 a desert area with scattered plots of agricultural land \u2014 had features that closely matched the description of the al-Qadisiyah battle site described in historic texts.",
      "William Deadman, a specialist in archaeological remote sensing at Durham University, said the Cold War era satellite images are commonly used tools by archeologists working in the Middle East because the older images often show features that have been destroyed or altered and wouldn't show up on present-day satellite images.",
      "\"The Middle East has developed so much in the last 50 years, both agricultural expansion and urban expansion,\" he said. Some of the distinguishing features at the al-Qadisiyah site, such as a distinctive trench, were \"much more pristine and clear\" in the 1970s images, he said.",
      "A survey on the ground confirmed the findings and convinced the team that they had correctly identified the site.",
      "The key features were a deep trench, two fortresses and an ancient river that was reportedly once forded by elephant-mounted Persian troops, said Jaafar Jotheri, a professor of archeology at the University of Al-Qadisiyah who's part of the team that made the discovery. The survey team also found pottery shards consistent with the time period when the battle took place.",
      "A revealing, well-known battle",
      "Jotheri said Iraqis of his generation, who grew up under the rule of Saddam Hussein, were all familiar with the battle in minute detail, down to the names of the generals on both sides.",
      "The battle at the time had political connotations \u2014 Iraq was engaged in a devastating war with Iran through much of the 1980s. Saddam pointed to the Battle of Qadisiyah as a harbinger of victory for Iraq.",
      "Like most children growing up in that era, Jotheri said he'd watched a popular movie about the battle multiple times as it was on regular rotation on television.",
      "In the post-Saddam era, al-Qadisiyah has become something of a political litmus test. Iraqis' views of the battle vary depending on their feelings toward Iran, which has expanded its influence in the country since the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam.",
      "\"There is some political and religious context in this battle because now, of course, we have religious differences, ethnic differences, political differences in Iraq and we read or we view everything based on our \u2026 differences,\" Jotheri said. But he added, \"We all agree that it is a very important battle, a decisive one, and we all know about it.\"",
      "Discovery was part of a regional trend",
      "The team plans to begin excavations at the site in the coming year, Jotheri said.",
      "The discovery comes as part of a broader project launched in 2015 to document endangered archaeological sites in the region.",
      "It also comes at the time of a resurgence of archeology in Iraq, a country often referred to as the \"cradle of civilization,\" but where archeological exploration has been stunted by decades of conflict that halted excavations and led to the looting of tens of thousands of artifacts.",
      "In recent years, the digs have returned and thousands of stolen artifacts have been repatriated.",

    "story": [
      "Three NASA astronauts who just wrapped up a 235-day mission to the International Space Station discussed their flight with reporters Friday, but steadfastly refused to comment on a medical issue of some sort that resulted in one astronaut spending the night in a hospital after landing.",
      "The unidentified astronaut flew back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston the day after splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico on Oct. 25, rejoining their crewmates. But NASA, citing medical privacy issues, provided no details other than to say the astronaut \"is in good health and will resume normal post-flight reconditioning with other crew members.\"",
      "\"I know there may be some interest in our post-flight medical event, where we diverted to a hospital,\" Crew 8 pilot Mike Barratt, a physician-astronaut, told reporters Friday. \"You know, space flight is still something we don't fully understand. We're finding things that we don't expect sometimes, and this was one of those times.",
      "\"We're still piecing things together on this. And so to maintain medical privacy and to let our processes go forward in an orderly manner, this is all we're going to say about that event at this time.\"",
      "Barratt, Crew 8 commander Matt Dominick, astronaut Jeanette Epps and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin were launched from the Kennedy Space Center on March 3 and docked at the space station two days later. They returned to Earth last month after an extended stay in space.",
      "Barratt, Dominick and Epps all appeared healthy and in good spirits Friday as they continue their re-adjustment to gravity. Grebenkin flew back to Moscow shortly after splashdown, but in a social media post just after the crew's return to Earth, he was smiling and said to be in good shape.",
      "While the presumably minor medical issue remains a mystery, the crew shared highlights of their stay in space, including details about a water leak during preparations for a June spacewalk that triggered a blizzard in the space station's airlock.",
      "After a spacesuit \"discomfort\" problem forced Dominick and astronaut Tracy Dyson to call off a planned spacewalk on June 13, Dyson and Barratt suited up for another excursion on June 24.",
      "While floating in the airlock with the outer hatch open to space, an umbilical failed to \"seat\" properly and water began spewing into the chamber.",
      "\"Oh, my goodness,\" Dyson said when she noticed the water spewing out. \"There's a lot of water flowing. There's literally water everywhere. ... I've got ice all over my helmet.\"",
      "\"It was not a trivial leak,\" Barratt reflected Friday. \"Anybody who was watching NASA TV at the time could see there was basically a snowstorm, a blizzard spewing from the air lock, because we already had the hatch open. We were seeing flakes of ice in the air lock. Tracy was seeing a lot of them on her helmet, on her gloves, whatnot.",
      "\"So it was...dramatic is the right word, to be real honest. I think literally, Tracy's actions were nowhere short of a heroic to be able to re-mate that umbilical with her hands covered with ice and kind of being vision impaired and getting the air lock closed.\"",
      "Barratt said he grabbed her space-suited legs so Dyson could \"lever that thing closed, and she just made it happen. So yeah, there was a bit of drama. Everything worked out fine. And again, normal processes and procedures saved our bacon.\"",
      "NASA plans to resume spacewalks in January, and Barratt said the suits will be in good shape.",
      "\"I think we're leaving them a brand new umbilical, a really clean interface on that side where we had the problem and the suits are charged and really ready to go,\" he said. \"So I think we are more than ready for the next EVA campaign. I just wish we were doing it.\"",
      "That said, he pointed out, \"none of our spacesuits are spring chickens. And so we will expect to see some hardware issues with repeated use. So again, it's one of those things that we are always, at every second, ready to stop...or work a contingency procedure.\"",
      "As for the suit \"discomfort\" issue that Dominick reported prior to the earlier spacewalk attempt, no details were provided.",

      "Temu and Shein have won over\u00a0many Gen Z shoppers and other bargain hunters by offering low-cost clothing, electronics and other items that typically ship directly from manufacturers in China. At the same time, U.S. consumers are still feeling the bite of inflation that hit a 40-year high in the pandemic, with many searching for deals as a result.",
      "\"Amazon Haul is a response to both the rise of low-price Chinese marketplaces and the fact that consumers are increasingly seeking value for money as they try to make their budgets stretch further,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData.",
      "He added, \"The value retail segment has been a major growth area over the past few years, and while the regular Amazon site has a good value-for-money reputation, its wide offer means that it is not primarily seen as an everyday low-price destination.\"",
      "What is Amazon Haul?",
      "Amazon Haul is an online storefront within the Amazon app that sells low-cost items, aimed especially at consumers who shop at discount retailers such as Temu and Shein.",
      "To find Amazon Haul, go to the Amazon app and search \"Haul\" in the search bar, or go to www.amazon.com/haul\u00a0on your browser.",
      "How much do Amazon Haul items cost?",
      "Amazon said everything on Amazon Haul costs less than $20, but most products are priced at $10 and less.",

      "Posts proliferated on X and other platforms pointing to hiccups like technical issues with voting machines, power outages and spelling errors on ballots as examples of a supposedly brewing conspiracy. And at 4:30 p.m. on Election Day, former President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that there was \"a lot of talk about massive cheating\" in Pennsylvania \u2014 which officials said had \"no factual basis whatsoever.\"",
      "But as the votes were tallied and it became clear that Trump was on his way to a decisive victory, the deluge of posts questioning the integrity of the election fell to a trickle, researchers say.",
      "\"I think this shows that these narratives are pushed when they serve a purpose, and they are stage setting often for efforts to dispute unfavorable results,\" said Max Read, a senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. \"And then once that stage setting and those claims are no longer needed, they're not pushed anymore.\"",
      "The shift was stark in Elon Musk's \"Election Integrity Community,\" a group of nearly 65,000 started by the platform owner's political action committee encouraging members to report \"voter fraud or irregularities.\"",
      "The group had already become a repository for speculation and unfounded rumors before Election Day. When the polls opened, hundreds of posts an hour were shared until the early hours of the morning on Wednesday, when the race was called for Trump in Pennsylvania, all but eliminating a winning path for Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "After that, the posting drastically diminished.",
      "Read's team at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue also found that mentions across the platform of voting machines in Pennsylvania and Michigan soared on Tuesday afternoon but dropped to hardly any by Wednesday morning.",
      "On Tuesday morning, a software error caused voting machines to be temporarily down in Cambria County, a county in southwestern Pennsylvania with a population of about 131,000. Voters used paper ballots and a court order extended voting hours from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. But some on social media baselessly suggested the technical issues were something nefarious, a plot to discard votes in a county Trump won by a wide margin in both of the last two elections.",
      "Danielle Lee Tomson, who leads the Center for an Informed Public's research on election rumors at the University of Washington, said the narrative around Pennsylvania voting machines echoed the conversation around election issues in Maricopa County, Arizona, in 2022. In that election, some ballots were printed with ink too light to be read by tabulators, so they were placed in a secure box and counted separately at the state's election headquarters. Claims that the errors were intentional fueled a lawsuit challenging the results that was later dismissed.",
      "\"On Election Day, we can always expect there to be irregularities or glitches or problems at polling sites,\" Tomson said. \"The question is will those issues be contorted into a larger narrative that election fraud is happening.\"",
      "While the volume of election rumors has drastically decreased, false claims are still spreading about races that have not yet been called. In Arizona, where Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake trails Democratic candidate Ruben Gallego, social users on the right are using the fact that Gallego had more votes than Harris by Friday to cast doubt on the validity of his lead.",
      "Meanwhile, turnout numbers are being twisted by both the left and the right to cast doubt on election results. While millions of votes are still being counted, some point to higher turnout in 2020 as evidence that there are 20 million \"missing votes.\" On the right, some claim this is evidence that 2020 was stolen from Trump; on the left, some say it's grounds for a recount.",
      "But the volume of posts questioning Harris's loss was nowhere near the \"Stop the Steal\" efforts that followed Trump's 2020 election loss, according to both Tomson and Read's research. No elected officials cast doubt on the outcome the way Trump pushed election denial when he lost in 2020. Harris urged all Americans to accept the results of the election in her concession speech on Wednesday.",
      "\"A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,\" Harris said. \"And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.\"",

Gaetz's ascent to the Justice Department's top job will come at a unique time, after Mr. Trump spent all of his 2024 presidential campaign under federal investigation or prosecution.",

      "\"That caught us by surprise a little bit,\" Johnson said. \"But I asked him what the reasoning was, and he said, 'Well, you can't have too many absences,'\" referring to the GOP's slim majority in the House of Representatives. Johnson said Florida law would allow Gaetz's replacement to be selected within the next eight weeks or so.",
      "\"I've already placed a call to Gov. DeSantis in Florida and said, 'Let's start the clock,'\" Johnson said.",
      "In a confirmation process, Gaetz would undoubtedly face questions about an ongoing review by the bipartisan House Ethics Committee, which said in a statement earlier this year it was looking into allegations that Gaetz may have \"engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct.\"",
      "Gaetz has denied all wrongdoing and maintained his innocence throughout a Justice Department probe \u2014 closed last year \u2014\u00a0 into allegations that he violated sex trafficking laws and obstructed justice.

      "\"He wants to be the top cop, so I would say that yeah, he's certainly going to have to answer all those things, whether they're legit or not legit,\" GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said of past allegations against Gaetz. \"Some of these investigations are still open, obviously.\" Cramer also said the pick was \"a surprise to me\" and expressed some reservations.",
      "\"The one thing about Matt was that concerned me a little bit. I didn't like the way he handled the squabble with with Speaker McCarthy.\" He said he was for every one of Trump's other nominees, adding, \"Matt could earn that, but I'm not there right out of the chute with Matt.\"",
      "\"This one was not on my bingo card,\" GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told reporters. \"I don't think this is a serious nomination for attorney general. We need to have a serious attorney general.\"",
      "Senate Republican conference Chair John Barrasso, when asked by reporters about Gaetz, said, \"The president is going to continue to make his appointments. We're going to continue to look forward to them coming to the Senate and have hearings and get his Cabinet confirmed as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Sources told CBS News that the most conceivable, easiest and fastest way to install Gaetz would be for the House and Senate to recess shortly after Inauguration Day so that Gaetz and others could be installed through recess appointments, a temporary option that doesn't require Senate confirmation.",
      "One former senior Justice Department official during Trump's first administration told CBS News that \"Matt Gaetz has no business running DOJ.\"",
      "Gaetz, who has served on the House Judiciary Committee and has been a vocal critic of the Biden administration, would take over the post as the first confirmed attorney general under a Trump presidency since Bill Barr. Barr resigned in 2020 when then-President Trump sought to remain in power after he lost the election. Barr left office at the end of that year and was replaced by an acting attorney general, Jeff Rosen. Rosen and a number of his subordinates later testified against Trump during a hearing of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol. The former officials alleged that Trump had sought to pressure the Justice Department to investigate his claims of election fraud.",
      "During the Biden administration, Attorney General Merrick Garland has sought to distance himself and the department from the White House after Trump's first term. Justice Department norms and regulations have been consistent themes of Garland's public comments throughout the nearly four years he has served under President Biden.",
      "Garland, a former federal judge, appointed numerous special counsels to conduct investigations into high-profile figures, including Mr. Biden, his son Hunter and Mr. Trump.",
      "Gaetz's expected nomination comes as some of the president-elect's supporters have called for change inside the Justice Department. Attorney Mark Paoletta, who was thought to be in the running to serve as Mr. Trump's attorney general, said, \"Career DOJ lawyers must be fully committed to implementing President Trump's policies or they should leave or be fired.\"",
      "\"If the president wants to deport illegal aliens, secure the border, ban race-based 'affirmative action' and DEI, investigate antisemitism, halt Big Tech censorship, grant pardons and commutations to Jan 6th defendants, he has every right to expect that these perfectly lawful policies are implemented,\" Paoletta wrote. \"It is absolutely unacceptable for career employees to seek to thwart this policy agenda.\"",
      "Trump's first term brought tension between the White House and his two Senate-confirmed attorneys general, Jeff Sessions and Barr. Sessions, who angered Trump because he recused himself from the Justice Department investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, was forced out shortly after the 2018 midterm elections.",
      "In a statement released after last week's election results, the Justice Department said it is \"committed to ensuring an orderly and effective transition to the new Administration.\"",
      "Beyond the political implications, like attorneys general of both parties who have preceded him, Gaetz would likely try to shape the Justice Department around the priorities of the president. And he would be all but certain to reverse course on various Biden-era policies, too.",
      "Trump has called for mass deportations, pardons for some of those convicted in the ongoing Jan. 6 investigation and regulation slashing \u2014 all actions in which the Justice Department is likely to play a central role.",
      "Trump and Republicans have long criticized Garland's leadership and targeted various Justice Department initiatives, including the expansion of civil rights and business regulation cases. Under the Trump administration, that is likely to come to an end.",
      "Much of next attorney general's work would depend on who Trump appoints to lead various Justice Department divisions, like those that handle national security and criminal matters. Trump's pick to oversee the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel will also likely be key to Trump's agenda because this office will issue decisions on the department's legal interpretation of the president's decisions. For instance, it could cement the president's power to fire certain political appointees and career government officials.",
      "FBI Director Christopher Wray reports directly to the attorney general. He was nominated by Trump in 2017 for a ten-year term. Since then, however, the president-elect has criticized the Bureau amid the federal probes into Trump's conduct, and he has vowed to implement reforms.",
      "Michael Kaplan, \n                                                  \n                      Andres Triay, \n                                                  \n                                  Kaia Hubbard, \n                                                  \n                      Fin G\u00f3mez and \n                                                  \n                      Alan He\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "The Ohio Senate on Wednesday approved a ban on transgender students using bathrooms that fit their gender identities and sent the measure to Republican Gov. Mike DeWine.",
      "The Republican-backed bill applies to public K-12 schools and institutions of higher education. It requires the schools to designate separate bathrooms, locker rooms and overnight accommodations \"for the exclusive use\" of either males and females, based on one's gender assigned at or near birth, in both school buildings and facilities used for a school-sponsored event.",
      "The legislation would not apply to school employees, emergencies or people helping young children or those with disabilities, and schools would still be able to provide single-use and family bathroom facilities.",
      "State Sen. Jerry Cirino, a Kirtland Republican, said the bill \"is about safety and security.\"",
      "The ACLU of Ohio urged the governor not to sign the measure, which it condemned as a violation of the right of privacy of LGBTQ+ Ohioans that will make them less safe.",
      "\"We are closely considering next steps,\" the ACLU said on social media.",
      "\"If allowed to go into effect, SB 104 will create unsafe environments for trans and gender non-conforming individuals of all ages,\" Jocelyn Rosnick, the group's policy director, said in a statement. \"This bill ignores the material reality that transgender people endure higher rates of sexual violence and assaults, particularly while using public restrooms, than people who are not transgender.\"",
      "Transgender and gender-nonbinary teens who were subject to restroom or locker room restrictions had a higher prevalence of sexual assault, according to a 2019 study published in the journal Pediatrics. About 36% of surveyed teens reported sexual assault, the study found.",
      "The Center for Christian Virtue commended legislators for passing the bill and called on DeWine to sign it. The governor has said he's inclined to sign the bill, but will conduct a legal review first.",
      "\"Today is a huge victory for children and families in Ohio,\" CCV Policy Director David Mahan said in a statement. \"Amended SB104 is common-sense legislation that will guarantee the only people entering young ladies' private spaces are female, not men claiming to be female.\"",
      "At least 11 states have adopted laws barring transgender girls and women from girls' and women's bathrooms at public schools, and in some cases other government facilities.",
      "The laws are in effect in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Utah. A judge's order putting enforcement on hold is in place in Idaho.",
      "Ohio House Republicans attached the measure to a proposal regarding Ohio's college credit program for high school students before passing it in June, much to the chagrin of one of the Democratic state senators who had signed on as a co-sponsor.",
      "Sen. Catherine Ingram, of Cincinnati, said she was taking her name off the bill.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Nickie Antonio said she couldn't believe Republican leaders prioritized the bill on their first day back following the November election.",

It's about demonizing those who are different, and our children are watching and listening to the fearmongering.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 17:44:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Who are the high rollers who bankrolled Trump and Republicans in the 2024 election, and what do they want in return for their generosity?",
    "story": [
      "More than $20 billion flooded into the 2024 presidential campaign, shattering the record for political spending in a single election. In an accelerating trend in American politics, Donald Trump, Kamala Harris and their allies raised colossal sums of money from billionaires.",
      "A majority of these megadonors were Republicans, according to Open Secrets, the nonpartisan watchdog organization that tracks the influence of money on politics.\u00a0 And with Trump's decisive victory, they hit the jackpot.",
      "So, who are these high rollers and what do they want in return for their generosity?",
      "Often, megadonors get lumped together in a single basket as plutocrats whose largesse is mostly about increasing their wealth with government contracts, tax breaks and regulatory relief, corrupting the democratic process along the way, according to critics of the U.S.' campaign finance system. There's certainly truth to that, but the story is more complicated.",
      "The super wealthy titans of tech and industry don't always share the same motivations and goals.\u00a0 Some are single-minded about bankrolling candidates as a way to bolster their bottom lines. But others are more ideologically driven, passionate about pet policies or reforming the way the government operates. Still others are driven by the scale of their ambitions or they crave the contact high of proximity to power.",
      "In some ways political giving defies neat categories, and some megadonors may have overlapping interests.\u00a0 Some donors' primary motivation may be an ideological commitment to unleashing the power of free markets, but that may also benefit their personal business interests.",
      "Others may be more transactional, fending off government investigations into their businesses or securing lucrative contracts, although that might coincide with their political beliefs.",
      "\"Megadonors can have a variety of financial, ideological or personal motivations for pouring millions into politics,\" said Brendan Fischer, deputy executive director of Undocumented, an investigative watchdog group. \"These motivations can operate on a spectrum or as a Venn diagram.\"",
      "But either way, with so much money flooding into American politics, it is helpful to be aware of the agendas and interests behind the torrent of cash gushing into the system. What follows is a taxonomy of the Republican donor class in the wake of a momentous election that has many wondering where the country is headed and who stands to benefit from the money that is driving the change.",
      "The Oligarch",
      "One dictionary definition of an oligarch is a \"very wealthy business leader who helps to run the government.\" That would seem to fit Elon Musk, the world's richest man, who personally gave more than $130 million (and his super PAC gave $200 million) to help Trump win back the White House. Musk has wasted no time taking advantage of his election dividend.",
      "He's been weighing in on key staffing decisions, has been named to head up (along with Vivek Ramaswamy) a commission on government efficiency and, according to Axios, even joined a call that Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week. Musk also traveled with Trump to Washington Wednesday for meetings with President Biden and with congressional Republicans.",
      "Musk stands to benefit financially from that clout he has with the incoming administration. His companies are mammoth players across some of the most powerful sectors of the economy, from electric vehicles to rocketry and space exploration, from satellite-powered internet technology to artificial intelligence. According to the New York Times, Musk has at least 100 different contracts with the federal government with 17 different agencies. His SpaceX rocket company already has tens of billions of dollars in government contracts and stands to gain billions more during a Trump presidency.",
      "And Musk has carefully cultivated key government regulators who could bring him a financial windfall after Trump takes office. One, according to Politico, is FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, who Trump is expected to name as the agency's chairman. Carr has been critical of his fellow commissioners for cutting Musk's Starlink satellite company out of the Biden administration's rural broadband program, denying him hundreds of millions or even potentially billions in subsidies.",
      "Meanwhile look for Musk to influence SEC and other regulatory appointments that could stop investigations into his businesses. But what makes Musk unique is that his influence far transcends U.S. policies that could benefit his own businesses. Musk, through his global business empire, has the power to affect geopolitics on a scale perhaps greater than any person outside of government in history.",
      "His personal wealth, estimated at $314 billion dollars (it jumped about $70 billion since Trump was elected), is greater than the GDP of multiple countries combined and the defense budgets of many industrialized Western countries. Musk's Starlink owns at least half of the satellites currently in orbit. Through Starlink, Musk has the power to alter the course of wars, since the communications constellation he controls is often the primary way governments can get internet access in combat zones. His ambitions seem boundless \u2014 he even hopes to be at the forefront of colonizing space.",
      "And none of that even takes into account his ownership of X, the social media platform he bought for $44 billion in 2022 and positioned as a MAGA megaphone to help Trump.",
      "\"All oligarchs have wealth power at their disposal, but not all are positioned in the same way,\" said Jeffrey Winters, a professor at Northwestern who is an expert on oligarchs. \"Some sell candy bars everyone eats. Others are engaged in space, high tech, own major media or have defense contracts. This takes their power to another level.\"",
      "The Pragmatist",
      "These are the megadonors who are laser-focused on influencing policy and legislation on behalf of their business interests. They may be hard-edged conservatives, but they are pragmatic about how their political giving can help their bottom line and the American economy. A quintessential example would be Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of the Citadel hedge fund, who gave $100,000,000 in the 2024 cycle, putting him at No. 5 on the list of top contributors, according to Open Secrets.",
      "A self-described \"Reagan Republican,\" Griffin has long given to more establishment-oriented Super PACs like the Senate Leadership Fund and its counterpart in the lower chamber, the Congressional Leadership Fund. He has not donated to Trump. Nor has he given money to political causes closely associated with Trump's America First agenda. Instead, he has been tactical in his giving, focusing often on Republican candidates in down-ballot races who have business experience or are military veterans and can give Congress a more business-oriented complexion.",
      "\"Griffin is more of an establishment Republican more aligned with the traditional goals of the party, rather than the Trumpy wing,\" says Anna Massoglia, a campaign finance expert.",
      "Griffin said in a statement to CBS News, \"I'm grateful for our country and for all those who've come before us. Going forward, we all share a duty to further strengthen our nation and improve the lives of our fellow citizens. As such, I support solution-oriented leaders who share my commitment to individual rights and freedom, economic policies encouraging prosperity and upward mobility, access to high-quality education for all children and young adults, safe communities, and a strong national defense.\"",
      "A more cutting-edge example of the pragmatists are donors who back the crypto-currency industry.\u00a0Crypto Super PACs such as Fairshake and Defend American Jobs have been determined in their contributions to help elect pro-crypto candidates.",
      "Defend America Jobs poured in $40 million to help elect Bernie Moreno, the crypto-friendly candidate who defeated long-time Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown in the Ohio Senate race. Among those boosters of crypto and other digital currencies who gave heavily during the 2024 cycle were Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, whose venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz ponied up $45.2 million to pro-crypto super PACs. CBS News was not able to reach Andreesen Horowitz for comment.",
      "Winklevoss Capital Management, the firm run by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, chipped in another $5 million. \"The crypto army is striking!\" Tyler Winklevoss posted on X on Election NIght, hailing Brown's defeat. But bucking the trend toward purely partisan contributions, the crypto industry gives to Republicans and Democrats alike, so long as they commit to keeping their industry unshackled by government regulations.",
      "The Ideologue",
      "These megadonors are more driven by personal causes that are not directly tied to their business interests. A representative example is Miriam Adelson, who along with her now-deceased husband Sheldon Adelson has been a casino magnate and major supporter of Jewish and Israel causes. In 2024, Miriam Adelson contributed more than $132 million to help Trump's election effort. Adelson knows that her largesse drives results.",
      "After the Adelsons donated tens of millions of dollars to help Trump win the White House in 2016, the new president announced the U.S. government would recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and said he would move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Adelsons even offered to pay for the construction of the new embassy. Miriam Adelson has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "\"These are passion projects, not attempts to feather the nest,\" says one Republican who knows Adelson but asked not to be named in discussing her donations.",
      "Another high-profile example of ideological givers are the billionaire shipping supply magnates Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein. The Wisconsin-based manufacturers of cardboard boxes and other packaging supplies, the Uihleins' business skyrocketed in sales in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic ignited an e-commerce boom. The Uihleins did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "During the 2024 campaign cycle, they were among the top five political donors, contributing more than $133 million to conservative causes. While much of their money went to Trump's election, they also gave generously to other MAGA-allied causes. They've given to so-called election integrity groups that questioned the results of the 2020 election, as well as organizations like Moms for Liberty, which advocates against public school curricula that mention LGBTQ rights or critical race theory and supports book bans.",
      "The Enigma",
      "Some megadonors are so discreet about their political giving that it is hard to know what category they belong in. One example is Tim Mellon, the reclusive railroad magnate and heir to the Gilded Age Mellon fortune who happens to have given more money to Trump's election (at least $197 million) than any other donor.",
      "Mellon doesn't go on cable TV or hobnob with politicos at party conventions, but he has written a memoir and penned some opinion pieces that offer some clues. Early in his adult life, he held liberal views on race, the problem of income equality and the environment. But as Mellon's business career evolved, he developed a strong antipathy for what he viewed as intrusive government regulations on business, which seems to have strongly shaped his political views.",
      "One defining episode for Mellon occurred after he bought an airport in Connecticut in the late 1990s. He cut down 340 trees, arguing that they posed a danger to pilots landing their planes. But state environmental regulators ultimately sued him and won. He was ordered to pay tens of thousands of dollars in damages. Did that experience fuel his desire to influence politics with his vast fortune? Perhaps, but it is also the case that Mellon has contributed to causes that would seem to have little to do with his particular business interests.",
      "In the 2024 cycle he also gave $25 million to support Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential run. Some speculated that Mellon was trying to be a spoiler to help Trump, whom he was also backing financially.\u00a0 But last August, he wrote an article in the American Spectator explaining his support for Kennedy.\u00a0 Mellon, it turns out, is a COVID-19 vaccine skeptic. \"I could not fathom how a 'vaccine' could be foisted on the general public with so little (if any) adequate testing.\"",
      "He began giving to Kennedy's Children's Health Defense, which promotes false information about vaccines \u2014 and later to the Super PAC supporting Kennedy. None of that would seem to help Mellon's personal business interests. Mellon did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he has selected former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to serve as his director of national intelligence. Gabbard represented Hawaii in Congress as a Democrat from 2013 to 2021 and unsuccessfully sought the party's presidential nomination in 2020.",
      "\"For over two decades, Tulsi has fought for our country and the freedoms of all Americans,\" Trump said in a statement announcing Gabbard as his pick. \"As a former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, she has broad support in both parties \u2014 she is now a proud Republican!\"",
      "The president-elect said Gabbard \"will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community, championing our constitutional rights, and securing peace through strength.\"",
      "The position requires Senate confirmation.",
      "Gabbard does not have experience in the field of intelligence and opposes the United States' intervention in the war in Ukraine.",
      "In February 2022, just as Russia was preparing to invade Ukraine, Gabbard took to social media to blame the Biden administration, writing, \"This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia's legitimate security concerns regarding Ukraine's becoming a member of NATO, which would mean US/NATO forces right on Russia's border.\"",
      "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in 2019 that she believed the Russians were \"grooming\" a Democratic presidential primary contender to be a third-party candidate, which appeared to be a reference to Gabbard. Gabbard sued Clinton for defamation in 2020, but dropped the suit shortly after it was filed.",
      "In 2019, Gabbard also expressed opposition to U.S. involvement in Syria's civil war and said the country's leader, Bashar al-Assad, \"is not the enemy of the United States because Syria does not pose a direct threat to the United States.\" Gabbard\u00a0met with Assad\u00a0in 2017, which she defended at the time as a \"fact-finding mission,\" but in 2019 she described him a \"brutal dictator.\"",
      "Gabbard served in the Army National Guard for more than 20 years and was deployed to Iraq and Kuwait. She was elected as a Democrat to represent Hawaii in Congress in 2012 and served four terms.

    "story": [
      "23andMe, the struggling ancestry tracing company, continues to spiral, raising questions about its business prospects and what could happen to its sensitive customer genetic testing data.",
      "23andMe on Tuesday announced it is slashing 40% of its workforce as part of a restructuring plan. The move comes after its entire board resigned in September. Its stock price has since plunged, prompting speculation that the company could be acquired by another buyer and sparking concern among customers about the security of their genetic information.",
      "CEO Anne Wojcicki has said she intends to take the company private and is not considering third-party takeover proposals.",
      "Customer data collected from its genetic testing tools makes up the company's most valuable asset. Because 23andMe is not a health care company, health privacy laws don't apply, raising questions about what the business might opt to do with its 15 million users' personal genetic data.",
      "Under 23andMe's current user agreement, users must opt-in to allow the company to share their personal DNA or data. The agreement states that if the company is acquired, customers' data may be accessed or sold as part of such a transaction.",
      "23andMe told CBS MoneyWatch correspondent Kelly O'Grady that while there are no plans for a sale, the current privacy agreement would apply.",
      "Meanwhile, at least 11 states have passed privacy laws that would require customers' consent before their genetic data is transferred.",
      "Still, experts say a new owner could change 23andMe's privacy terms following a sale, potentially putting the onus on consumers to push back against any move to share their data.",
      "23andMe said that roughly 80% of its customers consent to participate in the company's research program, which it said has generated more than 270 peer-reviewed publications uncovering new genetic insights into disease. Any data that shared is anonymized and cannot be traced back to individual customers, according to the company.",
      "Still, users can can take additional steps to protect their data, including deleting their 23andMe accounts \u2014 a process that is automated and straightforward.",
      "\"If, at any time, you are no longer interested in participating in our Services, you may delete your 23andMe account directly within your Account Settings,\" the company states on its website.",
      "That requires you to log in to your account and submit a request. The company then emails you a data deletion request confirmation, which you must verify.",
      "\"They'll get rid of your sample, they'll delete all of your personal information and they will close the account,\" O'Grady said.",
      "23andMe, which went public in 2021, has struggled to generate profits, with most buyers of its saliva-based testing kits only needing to make a single purchase. The company reported a net loss of $667 million for its last fiscal year, more than double the loss of $312 million for the year prior.",
      "23andMe posted another loss in quarterly earnings released Tuesday. The company reported a net loss of $59.1 million for the 2025 fiscal year's second quarter, compared to a loss of $75.3 million for the same year prior.",

      "Last year's round of COVID-19 vaccines did not get off the ground in many places until late September, long after providers had already begun offering flu shots. CDC officials said that led to confusing messaging and logistical fumbles that may have hampered vaccination rates.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 15:03:38 -0500",
    "summary": "One couple took out a loan to cover the out-of-network costs of an abortion and drove eight hours to a hospital in the neighboring state.",
    "story": [
      "Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion bans told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\"We felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\" said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\"We are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\" she said.",

Intense fighting ensued and continued until the surrender of Bataan peninsula and Corregidor Island in spring 1942.",

Calvi was among those reported captured when forces in Bataan surrendered. He, and thousands of others, were subjected to the 65-mile Bataan Death March and then held at a prisoner of war camp where 2,500 prisoners died during the course of the war.",
      "Calvi died on July 16, 1942, according to prison and historical records, just months after the surrender of the peninsula. He was buried in a mass grave, known as Common Grave 316.",
      "That grave and others at the camp were exhumed by the American Graves Registration Service after World War II ended. The remains from the graves were brought to a temporary U.S. military mausoleum that had been constructed in Manila, the Philippines' capital city.",
      "In 1947, the service attempted to identify the remains. Eleven sets of remains from Common Grave 316 were identified, and the remaining 17 were declared unidentifiable. Those unidentified remains were buried at the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial as Unknowns. Calvi's name, along with the names of other soldiers declared dead, was carved onto the Walls of the Missing at the cemetery.",
      "In April 2019, the DPAA began efforts to identify the Unknowns from Common Grave 316. The 17 sets of remains were exhumed and sent to the DPAA laboratory for analysis. Scientists used multiple techniques, including dental and anthropological analysis, mitochondrial and Y-chromosome DNA analysis, and historical evidence. On Sept. 16, they identified the set of remains as Calvi's.",
      "Before Calvi enlisted in the military, he had been a notable athlete, playing varsity baseball and football at his Massachusetts high school, according to archival news clippings shared by the DPAA. Before he was taken prisoner, Calvi was wounded at least once in action, but returned to active duty after recovering in a hospital in the Philippines. He was survived by his parents, two brothers, several aunts and uncles, and one nephew.",

      "Mace said that records show the primates are subjected to \"painful and deadly experiments.\"",

      "On Wednesday, 43 monkeys being held at the research facility in Yemassee, South Carolina broke loose from their enclosure after a caretaker accidentally failed to secure the gate, Westergaard told CBS News. Of 50 primates inside, only seven stayed behind as the rest of the group proceeded to roam free just outside of the facility property.",
      "Westergaard likened the state of affairs to \"a playground situation\" and said at the time the animals were \"just being goofy monkeys jumping back and forth playing with each other.\" Attempts to bait the creatures initially failed, and local police warned residents in the area to secure the doors and windows of their homes to prevent any of the escaped primates from entering.",
      "With 11 of the monkeys still on the loose, Westergaard said Tuesday that recovery crews felt they had developed some solid leads to find the runaways.",
      "\"Late this afternoon we spotted a few more monkeys close to the traps, and heard others cooing in the forest,\" he told CBS News. \"We'll be back at it before dawn tomorrow and will continue for as long as it takes.

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 12:02:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Could the tariffs Trump's threatened to slap on Chinese imports backfire and help Beijing? Some experts say they will.",
    "story": [
      "Hong Kong \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to slap up a tariff of up to 60% on all goods imported to the U.S. from China. While that may sound like a potent economic threat to a country where economic growth is already faltering, could it actually be just what China needs?",
      "\"I do expect U.S.-China economic relations to be more volatile under Trump, but I think overall, this may turn out to be better for China,\" Chen Zhiwu, the top finance professor at the University of Hong Kong and a former professor at Yale University, told CBS News.",
      "Chen said if Trump does follow through with his threat of such steep tariffs on China, it \"might force the leadership in Beijing to have no other choice but to focus on the economy \u2014 especially given that the Chinese economy right now is in very big trouble.\"",
      "Since the start of Trump's first term in the White House, and through President Biden's term, China's economic growth has slowed from roughly 7% to 4.5%. The country's property market has crashed because of massive overbuilding, leading to the rise of empty ghost cities. Youth unemployment rocketed to a new high of nearly 19% in September, dimming prospects for China's future workforce.",
      "Beijing's intense focus over the past decade on bolstering its military to meet its geopolitical ambition of rivaling the U.S. and its European and Asia-Pacific allies has further sacrificed opportunities for domestic economic growth, said Chen.",
      "\"If you count the number of warships, China has by far the highest number of warships than any country, higher than even the U.S.' naval ships. What industries have grown the most so far this year? Definitely those warfare-related industries have gone up the most, but those consumer-oriented industries have had no growth or negative growth,\" he said.",
      "Most of China's top 20 aerospace and defense stocks have recorded double-digit growth over the past year alone.",
      "Tariffs \"a good thing for China for the long term\"?",
      "\"The pressure the U.S. is putting on China will become a good thing for China for the long term,\" agreed Wang Xiangwei, a former editor-in-chief of the Hong Kong-based newspaper South China Morning Post.",
      "China has relied on two primary engines to support rapid economic growth over the past 40 years, since former leader Deng Xiaoping initiated reforms and started opening the country up, Wang told CBS News. Those have been manufacturing cheap exports for the world by leveraging China's long-cheap labor force, and later, spending billions on domestic infrastructure including roads, rail and airports.",
      "But labor has become more expensive with the rise of China's booming middle class, and the government is running out of new things to build across the country.",
      "How China came to dominate the EV market, and what the U.S. can do to catch up",
      "How China came to dominate the EV market, and what the U.S. can do to catch up",
      "Beijing has found it difficult, meanwhile, to fire up a potential third engine of economic growth: The capacity of the country's 1.3 billion people to consume domestically made products.",
      "Trump's threatened tariffs could give a needed external push for that to change, said Wang.",
      "\"I believe China's going to suffer in the short term. In the long term, he's [Trump] going to help China to make that painful transition,\" Wang said, noting that in the U.S., domestic consumption accounts for 70% to 80% of the national GDP, while in China, it's \"only about 60%.\"",
      "In effect, pushing China's own people to buy more of their country's own goods and services could, in the view of the two analysts, prove to be Beijing's best protection against Trump's threatened tariffs.",
      "\"The best tool would be to stimulate consumption growth inside China,\" said Chen. \"At the moment, the leadership has not really tried to help the Chinese consumers by sending them government checks and even tax costs to corporations. I think if the Chinese government really moves in that direction more aggressively, then it would help the Chinese economy generate more internal domestic consumption demand to make up for some of their possible lost exports to the U.S.\"",
      "Beijing needs Washington, but tariffs could have a complex impact",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he imposed tariffs ranging from 10% to 25% on Chinese agricultural products imported to the U.S., including seafood, pork and dairy. Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs, kicking off a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "Nearly eight years later, however, Beijing appears less able to wage such a war, due to its close economic links with the U.S.",
      "\"In terms of retaliation choices for China, it's very limited,\" said Chen. \"China imports a lot of agricultural products like soybeans, corn. They may try to import more such agricultural products from Brazil, and also from Russia as one of their ways to retaliate against the U.S. But at the end of the day, China imports so much [computer] chips from Nvidia, Intel, especially Qualcomm,\" Wang said. \"Those products are what China needs. So, China cannot produce internally.\"",
      "In effect, if Beijing does impose retaliatory tariffs, it could be shooting itself in the proverbial foot. Tariffs would make all those products, vital to China's continued economic and technological development, more expensive for its own people.",
      "But another possible impact of Trump's expected protectionist policies could actually be to push some of America's oldest allies and trade partners closer to China, reversing the so-called decoupling of the U.S. and Western European economies from Beijing that Washington has pushed under Mr. Biden.",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "\"The Biden administration did such a good job to more or less unite that,\" said Chen. \"If Trump makes the EU and NATO member countries upset, that makes it more possible for Germany, for France or Italy or even the U.K. to warm up more with China on the trade front. So, that may help neutralize, to some extent, the negative impact of the expected Trump tariffs on Chinese goods.\"",
      "Trump has claimed repeatedly that foreign companies would foot the bill, effectively absorbing the additional costs of exporting to the U.S. market imposed by his tariffs, but many economists disagree, and say it would effectively be a tax on American consumers.",
      "According to findings released by the National Retail Federation last week, U.S. consumers could lose between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power per year on everything from clothes and toys to household appliances and travel goods if there is a 60% blanket tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "\"Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,\" NRF Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said. \"A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter. This tax ultimately comes out of consumers' pockets through higher prices.\"",
      "All of that said, and despite Trump's history of anti-China rhetoric, it remains unclear how quickly his administration might actually move to roll out sweeping tariffs, with some economists speculating that the president-elect plans, initially at least, to use the threat of additional levies as a cudgel to negotiate more favorable trade terms with Beijing. Trump could also choose to gradually phase in tariffs, delaying their full impact on China's economy.",
      "Will China attack Taiwan, and would Trump come to the rescue?",
      "Trump's return to the White House may also help Beijing further its interests with Taiwan, the democratically governed island of 23 million people just off China's east coast that the country considers a renegade province. President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring Taiwan back under Beijing's control, by force if necessary.",
      "Since the U.S. government enacted the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, the U.S. is strategically committed to aid in Taiwan's defense in the event of any aggression, including by selling weapons to the island's government.",
      "Open to interpretation, however, and left deliberately vague in the U.S. law, is whether Washington is obligated to directly defend Taiwan, using the power of the American military, if it does come under attack.",
      "President Biden, during his first term, said Washington would, breaking with the long-time policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the Biden White House later returned to.",
      "\"The sovereignty over Taiwan is the red line of all the red lines,\" Wang told CBS News. \"Trump, in his presidential campaign speeches, he made it very clear\u2026 [that he's] unlikely to send troops to defend Taiwan.\"",
      "\"I believe that China's not going to invade Taiwan anytime soon,\" Wang added, noting that Beijing has \"so many problems it'll have to fix at home.\"",
      "If Beijing did invade Taiwan, the fallout would be felt worldwide.",
      "\"That would be a devastating hit to the global economy,\" said Chen. \"I hope that it would not happen. So, maybe now, given the challenges with the Chinese economy, the leadership is realizing that without a stable economy, then all its global geopolitical ambitions would not have any economic foundation.\"",

      "The U.S. letter had threatened to cut off some U.S. military assistance to Israel if its demands were not met within 30 days \u2014 a deadline that has now passed.",
      "\"Israel's actions failed to meet any of the specific criteria set out in the U.S. letter,\" the eight humanitarian groups, including Save the Children and Oxfam, said in a joint assessment of Israel's response to the U.S. demands.",
      "The joint statement was published Tuesday as the U.S. State Department said it had assessed that Israel was not breaching U.S. laws on blocking aid supplies into Gaza, and that Israel had taken steps to address U.S. demands, so there would be no change in the ongoing provision of American weapons to Israel.",
      "The aid groups' report said the humanitarian \"situation is in an even more dire state today than a month ago,\" particularly in northern Gaza, which has faced the brunt of Israel's ongoing war with the Iran-backed group Hamas.",
      "\"We've seen some progress being made,\" State Department Spokesperson Vedant Patel said Tuesday. \"We would like to see some more changes happen.\"",
      "Earlier this month, a United Nations-backed report warned of \"an imminent and substantial likelihood of famine occurring, due to the rapidly deteriorating situation in the Gaza Strip.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 09:01:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Michael Scott Moore was kidnapped in Somalia in 2012 and held hostage for nearly three years.",
    "story": [
      "Two Somali pirates have been sentenced to 30 years in prison for kidnapping American journalist Michael Scott Moore and holding him hostage for 977 days, federal prosecutors said Tuesday.",
      "Moore, a freelance journalist, traveled to Somalia in 2012 to research piracy and the nation's economy. On January 21, he was kidnapped by multiple heavily armed men and transported him to a secluded area, where he was held captive along with two fishermen from the Seychelles. Moore was moved several times over the course of three months, then transported to a hijacked boat, the F/V Naham III. Moore and one of the fishermen were held captive there, along with 28 crew members, for several more months, according to the Department of Justice. The fisherman was tortured, and the crew members told Moore that the pirates had killed the ship's captain when they hijacked the vessel, prosecutors said.",
      "Moore remained a hostage for another two years, continuously shuffled between safehouses, kept under armed guard and chained at night to prevent escape, prosecutors said. He was repeatedly threatened, according to the Department of Justice, and forced to make proof-of-life videos requesting large ransom payments. In 2014, negotiators paid a ransom of $1.6 million to secure Moore's release. Moore has said his family funded the ransom payment, and published a book about his experience in 2018.",
      "Abdi Yusef Hassan, 56, and Mohamed Tahlil Mohamed, 43, each \"played significant roles in Moore's captivity,\" according to the Department of Justice, and were handed 30-year prison sentences.",
      "Hassan, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, served as the minister of the interior in the Somalian province where Moore was captured. That meant he was in charge of police and security forces, but he also \"served as an overall leader of the pirates,\" according to the Department of Justice. He \"headed their efforts to extort a massive ransom from Moore's aging mother,\" the department said, and directed the production of the proof-of-life videos and participated in ransom negotiations. He also used his home as a base of operations for the pirates, the Department of Justice said. He was arrested in Minneapolis in 2019.",
      "Tahlil, also of Mogadishu, served in the nation's army and was a supervisor of the pirates who guarded Moore during the early months of his time in captivity. He used his military position, training and experience \"to serve as the pirates' head of security and armorer,\" according to the Department of Justice, and was in charge of moving Moore from location to location. He also provided and repaired weapons used to keep Moore in captivity. Tahlil was jailed in New York City in 2018.",
      "Both men were convicted of hostage taking, terrorism and firearms offenses after a three-week trial in February 2023. They were sentenced on Tuesday. The Department of Justice did not provide details about where they will serve their sentences.",
      "Each were also sentenced to one day of supervised release, in addition to the prison term.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 06:59:36 -0500",
    "summary": "Germ\u00e1n Reyes was arrested on charges of homicide for the killing of Alejandro Arcos just a week after he took office as mayor, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "A former prosecutor and local police official was arrested Tuesday in connection with the grisly decapitation of a mayor on Oct. 6.",
      "Officials in the southern state of Guerrero confirmed that Germ\u00e1n Reyes was arrested on charges of homicide for the killing of Alejandro Arcos just a week after he took office as mayor of the state capital, Chilpancingo.\u00a0 The public prosecutor's office in Guerrero released a photo of the suspect, identifying him as German \"N\" in line with the usual practice of not giving full names.",
      "The arrest was shocking, because officials had previously blamed the killing on a local drug and extortion gang, and Reyes was formerly employed as special prosecutor for Guerrero state, a high-level position.",
      "The implication was that Reyes - who was also a former military officer who, according to his official resume, retired with rank of captain in the military justice system - had somehow worked in collusion with the gang.",
      "That would suggest that at least one of the two warring gangs fighting for control of Chilpancingo controls, intimidates or works with officials there.",
      "If Reyes is convicted, it would also be a stinging rebuke for a policy adopted by cities across Mexico of hiring retired military officers for top local police jobs, on the assumption that they are less prone to corruption.",
      "It was also revealing that state detectives had to rely on federal forces - soldiers and the National Guard - to make the arrest, suggesting they may not have trusted state and local police who would normally carry out such tasks.",
      "It was not clear what title Reyes held in the Chilpancingo municipal security force, or whether he served both under Arcos or the replacement mayor who took office after he was killed. Four mayors from other towns in Mexico requested protection\u00a0a day after Arcos' remains were found.",
      "Mexico's top federal security official, Omar Garc\u00eda Harfuch, said earlier Tuesday that Arcos -the mayor whose body was found in a pickup truck, with his severed head placed on the roof of the vehicle - was apparently killed by the same gang responsible for killing 11 market vendors, including four boys, last week.",
      "The vendors, members of an extended family, were abducted in late October as they traveled to sell their wares. Their bodies were found dumped in the bed of a pickup truck on an avenue in Chilpancingo last week.",
      "While neither Harfuch nor state prosecutors would name the gang, a local human rights activist said the Ardillos were responsible for killing the market vendors.",
      "The activist, who did not want to be quoted for fear of reprisals, said the Ardillos gang controlled large parts of the state and had state congressmen and other officials working for them.",
      "The Ardillos have been locked in a years-long battle for control of Chilpancingo with a rival gang, the Tlacos. That turf battle has left mutilated corpses strewn around the city in recent years.",
      "Mexican cartels frequently dump bodies of their hostages \u2014 or post grisly videos of torture, interrogation and decapitations of their victims \u2014 to\u00a0intimidate their rivals\u00a0and authorities. Messages are\u00a0often left on victims' bodies\u00a0by cartels seeking to threaten their rivals or punish behavior they claim violates their rules.",
      "Chilpancingo, a city of about 300,000, is so completely dominated by gangs that in 2023, one of them staged a demonstration of hundreds of people, hijacked a government armored car, blocked a major highway and took police hostage to win the release of arrested suspects.",
      "Violence in Guerrero reached such unprecedented levels that earlier this year, Roman Catholic bishops announced they had helped arrange a truce in another part of the state between two warring drug cartels.",
      "At the time, former president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador- who refused to confront the gangs - said he approved of such talks.",
      "\"Priests and pastors and members of all the churches have participated, helped in pacifying the country. I think it is very good,\" said L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office Sept. 30.",

    "summary": "The U.S. says there will be a \"firm response\" as Ukrainian forces holding ground in Russia's Kursk region now face North Korean troops \"engaging in combat.\"",
    "story": [
      "Kyiv, Ukraine\u00a0\u2014 Russia attacked the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Wednesday with a sophisticated combination of missiles and drones for the first time in 73 days, authorities reported, as the Pentagon said most of the North Korean troops sent to help Moscow's war effort were fighting to drive Ukraine's army off Russian soil in the Kursk border region. South Korea's spy agency also said North Korean troops were \"engaging in combat\" in the Kursk region, hours after the U.S. military shared its assessment of the growing Russian-North Korean cooperation.",
      "Air raid warnings blared for hours as Russia targeted eight regions of Ukraine, firing six ballistic and cruise missiles and 90 drones, the Ukrainian air force said. Air defenses downed four missiles and 37 drones, and another 47 drones were stopped by electronic jamming, the statement said.",
      "The damage was being assessed.",
      "The air assault came as most of the more than 10,000 North Korean troops sent by Pyongyang to help Moscow in the war were engaged in fighting in Kursk, where a Ukrainian army incursion three months ago has succeeded in holding a broad area of land, embarrassing the Kremlin.",
      "Russia's military has trained the North Korean soldiers in artillery, drone skills and basic infantry operations, including trench clearing, Pentagon deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told a briefing Tuesday. The cooperation faces challenges, according to the Pentagon, including how to achieve military interoperability and overcoming the language barrier.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said previously that the\u00a0deployment of North Korean troops to Russia\u00a0was a sign of Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"growing desperation\" as the full-scale war he launched against Ukraine nears the end of its third year, but he also said it marked \"a significant escalation\" in North Korea's involvement in the conflict, and \"a dangerous expansion of Russia's war.\"",
      "Officials in Kyiv have said Russia deployed around 50,000 troops to Kursk in a bid to dislodge the Ukrainians.",
      "Russia has in recent months been assembling forces for a counteroffensive in Kursk, according to the Institute for the Study of War think tank, though the timescale of the operation is not known.",
      "Russia's plans in Kursk and Ukraine's efforts to hold back a Russian onslaught in the eastern Donetsk region coincide with political uncertainty over how the incoming U.S. administration of President-elect Donald Trump will change Washington's policy on the war. U.S. military aid is vital for Ukraine, but Trump has signaled he doesn't want to keep giving tens of billions of dollars to Kyiv.",
      "President Biden intends to bolster U.S. military support to Ukraine in the final months of his administration, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday.",
      "The U.S. will \"continue to shore up everything we're doing for Ukraine to make sure that it can effectively defend itself against this Russian aggression,\" Blinken told reporters at NATO headquarters, before planned meetings with allied envoys and Ukrainian officials.",

    "summary": "The babies - one born on Feb. 14 and the other on Feb. 15, 1965 - are now 59-year-old women and they are filing a lawsuit.",
    "story": [
      "In 1965, a Norwegian woman gave birth to a baby girl in a private hospital. Seven days later she returned home with a baby.",
      "When the baby developed dark curls that made her look different from herself, Karen Rafteseth Dokken assumed she just took after her husband's mother.",
      "It took nearly six decades to discover the true reason: Rafteseth Dokken's biological daughter had been mistakenly switched at birth in the maternity ward of the hospital in central Norway.",
      "The girl she ended up raising, Mona, was not the baby she gave birth to.",
      "The babies \u2014 one born on Feb. 14 and the other on Feb. 15, 1965 \u2014 are now 59-year-old women who together with Rafteseth Dokken are suing the state and the municipality.",
      "In their case, which opened in the Oslo District Court on Monday, they argue that their human rights were violated when authorities discovered the error when the girls were teenagers and covered it up. They claim Norwegian authorities had undermined their right to a family life, a principle enshrined in the European human rights convention, and demand an apology and compensation.",
      "Rafteseth Dokken, now 78, was in tears as she described learning so many years later that she got the wrong baby, according to Norwegian broadcaster NRK.",
      "\"It was never my thought that Mona was not my daughter,\" she said in court on Tuesday. \"She was named Mona after my mother.\"",
      "Mona described a sense of never belonging as she grew up. That sense of uncertainty pushed her in 2021 to do a DNA test, which showed that she was not the biological daughter of those who raised her.",
      "But the woman who raised the other baby knew long before.",
      "A routine blood test in 1981 revealed that the girl she was raising, Linda Karin Risvik Gotaas, was not biologically related. The woman raising her, however, did not pursue a maternity case. Norwegian health authorities were informed of the mix-up in 1985, but refrained from telling the others involved.",
      "Both women who were swapped at birth have said in interviews that it was a shock to learn about the mix-up, but the knowledge made pieces of their lives fall into place, explaining differences both in terms of appearance and demeanor.",
      "Kristine Aarre Haanes, representing Mona, said the state \"violated her right to her own identity for all these years. They kept it secret.\"",
      "Mona could have learned the truth when she was a young adult, but instead \"she did not find out the truth until she was 57.\"",
      "\"Her biological father has died. She has no contact with her biological mother,\" added Aarre Haanes.",
      "Circumstances surrounding the 1965 swap at Eggesboenes hospital are unclear, but media reports by NRK suggest there were several cases during the 1950s and 1960s where children were accidentally swapped at the same institution. At the time babies were kept together while their mothers rested in separate rooms.",
      "In other cases the errors were spotted before the children were permanently placed with the wrong families, according to the reports.",
      "An official from the Norwegian Ministry of Heath and Care Services said the state was unaware of similar cases and that there were no plans for a public inquiry.",
      "Asgeir Nygaard, representing the Norwegian state, is fighting the case on the grounds that the 1965 switch took place in a private institution and that the health directorate in the 1980s did not have the legal authority to inform the other families when they discovered the error.",
      "\"Documentation from that time indicates that government officials found the assessments difficult, inter alia because it was legally unclear what they could do,\" he wrote in a statement to The Associated Press ahead of the trial's opening. \"Therefore, in court, we will argue that there is no basis for compensation and that the claims being made are in any case statute-barred.\"",
      "The trial is scheduled to run through Thursday, but it was not clear when a ruling is expected.",
      "A similar situation reportedly occurred in the U.S. in 1969, when two baby girls were accidentally switched at a Texas hospital, and the mistake wasn't noticed until a DNA test was done in 2018. The women later filed a lawsuit against the corporation that later bought the hospital.",
      "According to the DNA Diagnostics Center, in the U.S., up to 500,000 babies each year are at \"potential risk of going home with the wrong parent,\" but newborns inadvertently switched at birth are generally noticed almost immediately after the incident. The center says only eight incidents of babies switched at birth were physically documented in the U.S. between 1995 and 2008, although the center says that number is likely higher.",

    "story": [
      "Port-au-Prince, Haiti\u00a0\u2014 The Federal Aviation Administration prohibited U.S. airlines from flying to Haiti for 30 days after gangs shot three planes and the United Nations also Tuesday temporarily suspended flights to Port-au-Prince, limiting humanitarian aid coming into the country. Bullets hit a Spirit Airlines plane when it was about to land in the capital Monday, injuring a flight attendant and forcing the airport to shut down. Photos and videos obtained by The Associated Press show bullet holes dotting the interior of a plane.",
      "On Tuesday, JetBlue and American Airlines announced that post-flight inspections found their planes also had been shot Monday while departing Port-au-Prince. American suspended flights to the capital until Feb. 12.",
      "The shootings were part of a wave of violence that erupted as the country plagued by gang violence swore in its new prime minister after a politically tumultuous process. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the agency documented 20 armed clashes and more roadblocks affecting humanitarian operation during the violence Monday.",
      "The Port-au-Prince airport will remain closed until Nov. 18, and Dujarric said the U.N. will divert flights to the country's second airport in the northern, more peaceful, city of Cap Ha\u00eftien.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince said in a security alert Monday that it was aware of \"gang-led efforts\" to block travel to and from the capital that may include \"armed violence, and disruptions to roads, ports, and airports.\"",
      "\"The security situation in Haiti is unpredictable and dangerous,\" the embassy warned. \"Travel within Haiti is conducted at your own risk. The U.S. government cannot guarantee your safety traveling to airports, borders, or during any onward travel. You should consider your personal security situation before traveling anywhere in Haiti.\"",
      "Even more limited access to the epicenter of the violence, Port-au-Prince, is likely to be devastating as\u00a0gangs choking the life out of the capital have pushed Haiti to the brink of famine. Dujarric warned that cutting off flights would mean \"limiting the flow of humanitarian aid and humanitarian personnel into the country.\"",
      "Already, a convoy of 20 trucks filled with food and medical supplies in the south had been postponed and an operation providing cash assistance to a thousand people in the Carrefour area where violence broke out had to be canceled.",
      "\"We are doing all we can to ensure the continuation of operations amidst this challenging environment,\" he said. \"We call for an end to the escalating violence, to allow for safe, sustained and unimpeded humanitarian access.\"",
      "On Tuesday, life in much of Haiti's capital was frozen after the wave of violence. Heavily armed police in armored cars outside the airport checked trucks used for public transportation passing by.",
      "Schools were closed, as were banks and government offices. Streets, where just a day before gangs and police were locked in a fierce firefight, were eerily empty, with few driving by other than a motorcycle with a man who had been shot clinging to the back.",
      "The sounds of heavy gunfire still echoed through the streets in the afternoon \u2014 a reminder that despite political maneuvering by Haiti's elites and a strong push by the international community to restore peace, the country's toxic slate of gangs kept its firm hold on much of the Caribbean nation.",
      "The United Nations estimates that gangs control 85% of the capital, Port-au-Prince. A U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police to quell gang violence struggles with a lack of funding and personnel, prompting calls for a U.N. peacekeeping mission.",
      "President Luis Abinader in the Dominican Republic, which shares a border with Haiti, was the first leader on the island to condemn the violence, describing the shooting a \"terrorist act\".",
      "On Tuesday, a transitional council established in April to restore democratic order to Haiti also condemned the violence.",
      "\"This cowardly crime, which threatens Haiti's sovereignty and security, aims to isolate our country on the international stage. The perpetrators of these heinous acts will be hunted down and brought to justice,\" the council wrote in a statement.",
      "The council has taken sharp criticism from many in Haiti who contend that its political fights and corruption allegations against three members created the political instability, allowing gangs to make violent power grabs like the one seen Monday.",
      "That came to a head over the weekend, when it fired former interim Prime Minister Garry Conille - long at odds with the council. They replaced him with businessman Alix Didier Fils-Aim\u00e9, who was inaugurated Monday surrounded by suit-clad officials and diplomats while gangs terrorized the capital around them.",
      "Neither Fils-Aim\u00e9 or Conille have commented on the wave of violence.",
      "Conille originally called the council's move illegal, but on Tuesday acknowledged Fils-Aim\u00e9's appointment in a post on the social media platform X.",
      "\"(I) wish him success in fulfilling this mission. At this crucial moment, unity and solidarity are essential for our country. Long live Haiti!\" he wrote. Fils-Aim\u00e9 promised to work with international partners to restore peace and hold long awaited elections, a vow also made by his predecessor.",
      "But many Haitians, like 43-year-old Martha Jean-Pierre, have little taste for the political fighting, which experts say only gives gangs more freedom to continue expanding their control.",
      "Jean-Pierre was among those to brave the streets of Port-au-Prince on Tuesday to sell the plantains, carrots, cabbage and potatoes she carried in a basket on her head. She had no choice, she said - selling was the only way she could feed her children.",
      "\"What good is a new prime minister if there's no security, if I can't move freely and sell my goods?\" she said, nodding to her basket of vegetables. \"This is my bank account. This is what my family depend on.\"",

      "On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department lamented that Conille and the council \"were unable to move forward in a constructive manner\" and called on Fils-Aim\u00e9 and the council to provide a clear action plan outlining a joint vision on how to decrease violence and pave the path for elections to be held to \"prevent further gridlock.\"",

    "story": [
      "Covering your surfboard in bright lights sounds like an open invitation to great white sharks, but research released Tuesday by Australian scientists found it might actually stave off attacks.",
      "Biologist Laura Ryan said the predator often attacked its prey from underneath, occasionally mistaking a surfer's silhouette for the outline of a seal.",
      "Ryan and her fellow researchers showed that seal-shaped boards decked with bright horizontal lights were less likely to be attacked by great white sharks.",
      "This appeared to be because the lights distorted the silhouette on the ocean's surface, making it appear less appetizing.",

      "\"It's like an invisibility cloak but with the exception that we are splitting the object, the visual silhouette, into smaller bits,\" Hart said.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, head of the Anglican Church, resigned Tuesday after a review found that he and other senior church leaders had covered up the \"prolific and abhorrent\" abuse of over 100 boys and young men in the United Kingdom and other countries by a British lawyer who helped lead Christian summer camps in the U.K. and other countries.",
      "John Smyth was accused of attacking boys and young men he met at Christian camps in the 1970s and 1980s. He died in South Africa in 2018 at the age of 77 without ever facing any legal proceedings.",
      "\"The last few days have renewed my long felt and profound sense of shame at the historic safeguarding failures of the Church of England,\" Welby said in a statement announcing his resignation. \"For nearly twelve years I have struggled to introduce improvements. It is for others to judge what has been done.\"",
      "An independent Church of England review into the handling of complaints against Smyth found last week that, \"despite the efforts of some individuals to bring the abuse to the attention of authorities, the responses by the Church of England and others were wholly ineffective and amounted to a coverup,\" the leader of the review said.",
      "\"I am so sorry that in places where these young men, and boys, should have felt safe and where they should have experienced God's love for them, they were subjected to physical, sexual, psychological and spiritual abuse,\" Welby said in an initial statement responding to the review's findings. \"I am sorry that concealment by many people who were fully aware of the abuse over many years meant that John Smyth was able to abuse overseas and died before he ever faced justice.\"",
      "Welby has said he was unaware of Smyth's abuse until 2013, the year he became the archbishop.",
      "\"Nevertheless the review is clear that I personally failed to ensure that after disclosure in 2013 the awful tragedy was energetically investigated,\" Welby said. \"Since that time the way in which the Church of England engages with victims and survivors has changed beyond recognition. Checks and balances introduced seek to ensure that the same could not happen today.\"",
      "The Archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior figure in the Church of England, also known as the Anglican Church. The U.S.-based Episcopal Church, which has 1.6 million members, is part of the worldwide Anglican Communion and there are over 7,000 Episcopal churches across the U.S.",
      "Welby has played a central role in many high-profile events, including officiating the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and delivering the sermon at the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II.",
      "\"I think, rightly, people are asking the question: 'Can we really trust the Church of England to keep us safe?' And I think the answer at the moment is 'no,'\" Bishop of Newcastle Helen-Ann Hartley told CBS News' partner network BBC News, calling on Welby to resign.",
      "Andrew Morse, who told the BBC he was abused for years by Smyth as a teenager, had also called for Welby to resign. He said Welby's \"admission that in 2013, which is really modern day in comparison to the 1970s and 1980s, that he didn't do enough, that he wasn't rigorous\u2026 is enough in my mind to confirm that Justin Welby, along with countless other Anglican churchmen, were part of a cover-up about the abuse.\"",
      "Morse said he was beaten several times by Smyth during his youth, and that further abuse could have been stopped if Welby had acted when he found out about Smyth's actions in 2013.",
      "\"It is those African lives and those African victims that are very much on my conscience \u2014 and I would hope on the archbishop's conscience too.\"",

      "He was dissatisfied with the split of financial assets in his divorce, according to a preliminary investigation, police said.",

      "By Tuesday morning, searches for information about the incident on Chinese social media platforms were being heavily censored. A search on Weibo, similar to X, for the sports center only turned up a few posts, with only a couple referring to the fact that something had happened there, and no pictures or details. Articles by Chinese media outlets about the incident from Monday night had been taken down.",

      "A Navy destroyer that was sunk by Japanese forces during World War II has been discovered, the U.S. Navy confirmed on Monday. The Royal Australian Navy found the USS Edsall at the bottom of the Indian Ocean more than 80 years after it went down with more than 200 crew members on board.",
      "The USS Edsall, a 314-foot destroyer, was built in 1919 and commissioned in 1920. During World War II, the ship took part in numerous conveys, protecting other vessels from Japanese attacks in Australian waters.",
      "On March 1, 1942, Japanese naval forces attacked the ship. During the extended engagement, the Edsall was able to dodge heavy shelling, which led some Japanese soldiers to nickname the ship \"the dancing mouse,\" according to the Naval History and Heritage Command. Japanese air forces later joined the attack, and several hours after the fight began, the Edsall sank with over 200 crew members on board, having taken just one fatal hit among thousands of rounds.",
      "Almost all of the crew members were lost, according to the U.S. Navy, making the wreck \"a hallowed site.\"",

      "\"This is part of our continuing efforts to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice,\" said U.S. Ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy in a statement announcing the discovery. \"We will now be able to preserve this important memorial and hope that the families of the heroes who died there will know their loved ones rest in peace. We will tell their stories, learn from their bravery, and be inspired by their sacrifice. We will always remember them.\"",

      "Dr. Nadezhda Buyanova, 68, was arrested in February after Anastasia Akinshina, the mother of one of her patients, reported the pediatrician to authorities. Akinshina alleged that Buyanova told her and her son that his father, a Russian soldier who was killed in Ukraine, was a legitimate target for Kyiv's troops and had blamed Moscow for the war.",
      "A video of the outraged Akinshina complaining about Buyanova was widely publicized, and chief of Russia's Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin personally demanded a criminal case be brought against the doctor.",
      "Buyanova, who was born in western Ukraine, denied the accusation, insisting she never said what she was accused of saying. In a tearful closing statement to the court last week, she had urged it to acquit her.",
      "Her defense argued that the prosecution failed to present evidence that the purported conversation took place, including any recordings of it, and alleged that her accuser fabricated the story out of animosity toward Ukrainians, according to the independent news site Mediazona, which reported all of the hearings in the trial.",
      "In her closing statement to the court, Buyanova said it was \"painful\" to read the accusations in the indictment, and broke down.",

    "story": [
      "Beirut \u2014 Declassified 1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led a British-Iraqi archeological team to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that became decisive in the spread of Islam throughout the region.",
      "The Battle of al-Qadisiyah was fought in Mesopotamia \u2014 in present-day Iraq \u2014 in the A.D. 630s between Arab Muslims and the army of the Sassanid Persian dynasty during a period of Muslim expansion. The Arab army prevailed and continued on its march into Persia, now Iran.",
      "A joint team of archeologists from the U.K.'s Durham University and the University of Al-Qadisiyah stumbled across the site while undertaking a remote sensing survey to map the Darb Zubaydah, a pilgrimage route from Iraq's Kufa to Mecca in Saudi Arabia built more than 1,000 years ago. The findings were published Tuesday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "While mapping the route, the team noticed that a site some 20 miles south of Kufa in Iraq's southern Najaf province \u2014 a desert area with scattered plots of agricultural land \u2014 had features that closely matched the description of the al-Qadisiyah battle site described in historic texts.",
      "William Deadman, a specialist in archaeological remote sensing at Durham University, said the Cold War era satellite images are commonly used tools by archeologists working in the Middle East because the older images often show features that have been destroyed or altered and wouldn't show up on present-day satellite images.",
      "\"The Middle East has developed so much in the last 50 years, both agricultural expansion and urban expansion,\" he said. Some of the distinguishing features at the al-Qadisiyah site, such as a distinctive trench, were \"much more pristine and clear\" in the 1970s images, he said.",
      "A survey on the ground confirmed the findings and convinced the team that they had correctly identified the site.",
      "The key features were a deep trench, two fortresses and an ancient river that was reportedly once forded by elephant-mounted Persian troops, said Jaafar Jotheri, a professor of archeology at the University of Al-Qadisiyah who's part of the team that made the discovery. The survey team also found pottery shards consistent with the time period when the battle took place.",
      "A revealing, well-known battle",
      "Jotheri said Iraqis of his generation, who grew up under the rule of Saddam Hussein, were all familiar with the battle in minute detail, down to the names of the generals on both sides.",
      "The battle at the time had political connotations \u2014 Iraq was engaged in a devastating war with Iran through much of the 1980s. Saddam pointed to the Battle of Qadisiyah as a harbinger of victory for Iraq.",
      "Like most children growing up in that era, Jotheri said he'd watched a popular movie about the battle multiple times as it was on regular rotation on television.",
      "In the post-Saddam era, al-Qadisiyah has become something of a political litmus test. Iraqis' views of the battle vary depending on their feelings toward Iran, which has expanded its influence in the country since the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam.",
      "\"There is some political and religious context in this battle because now, of course, we have religious differences, ethnic differences, political differences in Iraq and we read or we view everything based on our \u2026 differences,\" Jotheri said. But he added, \"We all agree that it is a very important battle, a decisive one, and we all know about it.\"",
      "Discovery was part of a regional trend",
      "The team plans to begin excavations at the site in the coming year, Jotheri said.",
      "The discovery comes as part of a broader project launched in 2015 to document endangered archaeological sites in the region.",
      "It also comes at the time of a resurgence of archeology in Iraq, a country often referred to as the \"cradle of civilization,\" but where archeological exploration has been stunted by decades of conflict that halted excavations and led to the looting of tens of thousands of artifacts.",
      "In recent years, the digs have returned and thousands of stolen artifacts have been repatriated.",

      "The review, led by Hebrew University of Jerusalem, analyzed multiple studies related to autism and cellular activity. The findings were published in the journal Brain Medicine.",
      "The researchers focused on four specific types of particles that make up air pollution: fine particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NO, NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ozone (O3).",
      "MELANIA TRUMP SAYS BARRON AUTISM RUMORS CAUSED \u2018IRREPARABLE DAMAGE\u2019",
      "They also investigated four different ways in which these particles could impact the fetus.",
      "Those four ways were neuroinflammation, oxidative/nitrosative stress (an imbalance of free radicals and antioxidants that causes cell damage), epigenetic modifications (chemical changes to DNA) and disruptions to certain neurotransmitters, according to the study.",
      "Lead study author Haitham Amal, PhD (center) is an associate professor at The School of Pharmacy at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is pictured with his research team. (Igor Fabrov)",
      "\"Increasing air pollution may significantly raise the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly ASD, due to gene-environment interactions,\" lead study author Haitham Amal, PhD, an associate professor at The School of Pharmacy at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"The brain starts developing at birth and continues to develop until the mid 20s,\" Georges Ghacibeh, M.D., a neurologist at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, told Fox News Digital. He was not involved in the study.",
      "The risk is highest during times of accelerated development, such as prenatal and early childhood periods, the researcher said. (iStock)",
      "\"During the early years, from conception until about age 5, the brain undergoes the most changes and therefore is more susceptible to the impact of external factors,\" added Ghacibeh.",
      "In a previous study published in 2023, the same research team found that nitric oxide (NO), which is one of the particles in air pollution, is a \"key pathological factor in autism,\" Amal noted.",
      "The brain is most susceptible to external factors from conception until age 5, experts say.",
      "Ghacibeh agreed that air pollution could increase autism risk.",
      "\"Chemicals inhaled by a pregnant mother or a young child, if they enter the bloodstream and make it to the brain of the fetus or developing child, can affect various metabolic pathways, either by interfering directly with certain chemical reactions inside the cells, or by reducing the amount of oxygen delivered to the brain,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "In the U.S., autism affects one in 36 children, or about 2.3%, as of 2024, according to statistics from the CDC. (iStock)",
      "This can interrupt the process of normal brain development, according to the doctor, causing brain cells to lose their normal function.",
      "\"The mechanism would be similar to the effect of certain medications ingested during pregnancy that can lead to developmental delay or autism in the child,\" Ghacibeh said.",
      "Study doesn\u2019t prove cause",

      "Ghacibeh agreed, noting that epidemiological studies prove association but not causality.",
      "\"In other words, if two phenomena occur simultaneously, such as high levels of air pollution and a rise in autism, this does not necessarily prove that one caused the other \u2014 it just means that both phenomena occurred at the same time. It is possible that additional, unknown factors might have played a role as well,\" he said.",
      "Air pollution affects approximately 131.2 million people, or 39% of the U.S., as noted in the 2024 American Lung Association's State of the Air report.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Future research should aim to better understand pollution\u2019s effects on \"genetically susceptible individuals\" and to find ways to protect those at greatest risk, according to Amal.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 16:48:02 -0500",
    "summary": "President Joe Biden&apos;s Environmental Protection Agency finalized a new rule Tuesday taxing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, but critics argue the move is &quot;irrelevant&quot; and will serve to boost Big Oil and stifle innovation.",
    "story": [
      "Former GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., speaks to 'The Story' after being asked to join the incoming Trump administration as EPA administrator.",
      "President Joe Biden's Environmental Protection Agency finalized a new rule Tuesday, taxing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector.",
      "The new tax was born out of Biden's sweeping climate legislation passed by Congress, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a Waste Emissions Charge provision. Although the waste emissions charge was mandated by Congress, the Biden administration had discretion on how tightly to clamp down.",
      "The fee will start at $900 per metric ton of methane emitted over a specific performance level during 2024. In subsequent years, the fee will increase. In 2025, it will grow to $1,200 per metric ton. In 2026, it will increase to $1,500 per ton. Meanwhile, each subsequent year after that, the fee will continue to rise, according to the EPA.",
      "BIDEN ADMIN SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE POSES NATIONAL SECURITY RISKS, SENDS DELEGATION TO ADDRESS THEM",
      "\"The final Waste Emissions Charge is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden\u2019s methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air, and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,\" EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a press release.",
      "President Joe Biden's Environmental Protection Agency finalized a new rule Tuesday, taxing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector.",
      "Prior to Tuesday's new methane emissions rule, Biden and his administration imposed other rules aimed at clamping down on methane. Shortly after taking office in 2021, he signed a law repealing a Trump-era action that rescinded stricter methane-emissions standards imposed under then-President Barack Obama.",
      "While climate change advocates, such as the Clean Air Task Force, have praised Biden's rule regulating methane emissions, Steve Milloy, a fellow at the Energy and Environmental Legal Institute, described the action as \"irrelevant.\" Milloy said that because upwards of 95% or more of the greenhouse gasses trapped by the earth's atmosphere are water vapor and carbon dioxide, little to no room remains for methane to be stored.",
      "VOTERS DECIDE ON CLIMATE MEASURES, REJECT INITIATIVE TO TAX NATURAL GAS POWERED BUILDINGS IN CALIFORNIA CITY",
      "Milloy also suggested the new methane emissions rule will likely be ineffective, considering it targets the oil and gas sector but not the agricultural sector as well.",
      "\"The largest source of methane is actually microbes,\" Milloy pointed out \u2014 as opposed to man-made power plants. Microbes are tiny organisms that live in cow's stomachs, agricultural fields and wetlands, according to The Washington Post.",

      "In addition to the effectiveness, Milloy pointed out that the tax will also be to the benefit of Big Oil companies, while hurting smaller ones.",
      "\"It's because all these regulations cripple the competition,\" Milloy said. \"Taxing the oil industry, you know, Big Oil is going to be all for that.\"",
      "North Carolina Republican Rep. Greg Murphy, who was endorsed by Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions during his bid for re-election this year, echoed that going after the oil and gas industry with this latest tax will serve to \"raise costs and prevent investment.\"",

      "1. Email validation: By opening the email or engaging with the email (clicking a link or responding to it), you can validate that the email account they messaged is active. Oftentimes, scammers randomly email people whose email address they've gotten from data breaches, the dark web or data harvesting.",
      "2. Information gathering: If you reply to the email or use any other contact information they provide to \"reinstate\" your account, it will validate that the email address they reached out to is active, and they will likely hard-sell you for financial and personal information. If you call any phone number they provide you, they will also connect your phone number with your email address so they can continue to update their information on you.",
      "3. Malware distribution: They will often have buttons, links or attachments included in the email. If you click the attachment, it can download malware or a virus to your device.

      "In August 2024, a popular cybercriminal on an online forum advertised \"high-quality .gov emails\" for sale, meant for espionage, social engineering, data extortion, emergency data requests and more. The listing even included U.S. credentials, and the seller claimed they could guide buyers on making emergency data requests and even sell real stolen subpoena documents to help them pose as law enforcement.",
      "Another cybercriminal boasted about owning government emails from over 25 countries. They claimed anyone can use these emails to send a subpoena to a tech company and get access to usernames, emails, phone numbers and other personal client info. Some con artists are even hosting a \"masterclass\" on how to create and submit their own emergency data requests to pull data on any social media account, charging $100 for the full rundown.",

      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "How this phishing scam works",
      "When law enforcement, whether federal, state or local, wants information about someone\u2019s account at a tech company, like their email address or other account details, they typically need a warrant, subpoena or court order. When a tech company receives one of these requests from an official email address, they\u2019re required to comply. So, if a scammer gets access to a government email, they can fake a subpoena and get information on just about anyone.",
      "To bypass verification, scammers often send emergency data requests, claiming that someone\u2019s life is at risk and that the data is needed urgently. Because companies don\u2019t want to delay in case of an actual emergency, they may hand over the information, even if the request turns out to be fake. By portraying it as a life-or-death situation, scammers make it harder for companies to take time to verify the request.",
      "For example, the FBI reported that earlier this year, a known cybercriminal posted pictures on an online forum of a fake emergency data request they\u2019d sent to PayPal. The scammer tried to make it look legitimate by using a fraudulent mutual legal assistance treaty, claiming it was part of a local investigation into child trafficking, complete with a case number and legal code for verification. However, PayPal recognized that it wasn\u2019t a real law enforcement request and denied it.",

      "CYBERSCAMMERS USE AI TO MANIPULATE GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS",
      "What can companies do to avoid falling for these phishing scams?",
      "1) Verify all data requests: Before sharing sensitive information, companies should verify every data request, even those that look legitimate. Establish a protocol for confirming requests directly with the agency or organization that supposedly sent them.",
      "2) Strengthen email security:\u00a0Use email authentication protocols like DMARC, SPF and DKIM to block emails from unauthorized sources. Implement anti-phishing filters to detect suspicious content in messages.",
      "3) Train employees on phishing awareness: Regular training sessions on phishing scams can help employees recognize red flags, such as urgent language, unusual requests or emails from unknown addresses. Employees should be encouraged to report suspicious emails.",
      "4) Limit access to sensitive data: Restrict who can view or share sensitive customer data. Fewer people with access means fewer chances for accidental or intentional data leaks.",
      "5) Implement emergency verification procedures: Have a clear verification process in place for \"emergency\" data requests, including steps for double-checking with higher management or legal teams before responding to any urgent request for customer information.",

      "Is there something you need to do?",
      "This particular phishing scam mostly targets big tech companies, so there\u2019s not much you can do directly. However, it\u2019s a reminder that you shouldn\u2019t automatically trust an email, even if it comes from a .gov address. Here are some steps you can take to stay safe.",
      "1) Double-check email addresses and links: Even if an email looks official, take a moment to check the sender\u2019s email address and hover over any links to see where they actually lead. Be cautious if anything looks off. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Use\u00a02FA for all sensitive accounts. This extra layer of security helps protect you even if your login credentials are compromised.",
      "3) Stay updated on phishing scams:\u00a0Keep an eye on the latest phishing tactics, so you know what to look out for. Regular updates help you spot new types of scams before they affect you.",
      "4) Verify suspicious requests:\u00a0If you get an unexpected email asking for sensitive info, contact the sender directly through an official channel to confirm the request.",

      "Scammers are taking phishing emails to a whole new level. I often recommend checking the email carefully when you receive anything suspicious to see if it\u2019s legit. But now, since scammers can even access government emails, you need to be extra cautious. This phishing scam seems to target mostly big tech companies, so it\u2019s on them to strengthen their security and verify every request thoroughly before sharing any user information. It's also up to governments worldwide to protect their digital assets from being compromised.",

      "Last year, these criminals stole $477 million from veterans, military personnel and their spouses, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). That\u2019s a $63 million jump from 2022, showing that the military community is a big target for scammers. The number of military members who lost money to these attacks went up by 7% to 30,948, per the FTC\u2019s latest data.",
      "These scammers use all kinds of tricks to get veterans to hand over personal info or hard-earned cash, including veterans' benefit scams and IRS scams. I break down five of the most common scams targeting our military heroes and how to stay safe from them.",

      "Image of military personnel (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Romance scams",
      "Romance scams have become an increasingly painful reality for veterans, as scammers target them through fake online relationships to exploit their emotions and financial stability. Often, these scammers pose as attractive, understanding individuals on dating apps, social media platforms or even support forums specifically tailored for veterans. They\u2019ll build a relationship over weeks or months, using flattery and fabricated stories to create a strong emotional connection with their target.",
      "Once the scammer believes they\u2019ve gained enough trust, they\u2019ll ask for money, typically by inventing a sudden, urgent situation. It might be a \"medical emergency,\" a supposed travel expense to come to visit or even a claim that they need help with a legal matter. The requests start small but can quickly escalate as the scammer continues to manipulate the victim's emotions.",
      "This continues to be the most common fraud targeting veterans, costing them and their families over $40 million in 2020, according to Aura. Among all romance scam victims, those ages 50-69 were hit the hardest, losing $179.65 million in just the first three quarters of 2022. That figure has almost certainly surged in 2024.",

A scammer might claim you\u2019re eligible for new or additional benefits, contacting you by phone, email or text. When dealing with unsolicited advice, remember that if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.",

      "Phishing scams from fake government agencies",
      "Phishing scams are a social engineering trick where scammers send emails that look like they\u2019re from official places, like the government or your bank. These legit-looking emails act as bait, but the real goal is to grab your banking or credit card info.",
      "Sometimes, these scam emails will ask you to click a link or download an attachment, which can install malware on your device. Scammers are also known to send phishing links through LinkedIn, Facebook or other social media.",
      "One classic example is the IRS scam. Though it targets everyone, military members are prime targets. Scammers pretend to be IRS agents, threatening jail time, fines or other penalties if they don\u2019t get immediate payment. They even spoof IRS caller IDs to make their calls look real.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Rental property scams",
      "Rental property scams are a common way scammers try to exploit people looking for a place to rent. In these scams, fraudsters often post fake listings for apartments or houses on popular rental websites or social media platforms. The listing might look too good to be true, like a beautiful place at an unbelievably low price.",
      "The scammer will usually claim to be out of town or unavailable to meet in person, asking potential renters to send a deposit or rent payment upfront to \"secure\" the property. In some cases, they may even send fake lease agreements or claim that the property is already rented, but they can still \"help\" find a similar place.",
      "BEWARE OF THIS SOCIAL SECURITY SCAM BY CROOKS TRYING TO TRICK YOU",
      "Car sales and financing scams",
      "Car sales and financing scams targeting veterans are unfortunately common. Scammers know that veterans may have limited experience with certain financial deals, so they exploit that by offering unrealistic car sales or financing options. These scams can take various forms, and the result is often financial loss and stress.",
      "Image of military personnel honoring our troops (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways veterans can protect themselves from scams",
      "1) Be cautious with unsolicited offers: Whether it\u2019s a phone call, email or text, if someone claims to offer help with veterans' benefits or promises something too good to be true, don\u2019t take the bait. Verify the legitimacy of any offer directly through official channels like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or trusted veteran organizations.",
      "2) Watch out for emotional manipulation in online relationships: Romance scammers often prey on veterans' emotions. Avoid sharing personal or financial details with people you meet online, especially if the relationship feels rushed or too perfect. If someone asks for money after just a few weeks or months, it\u2019s likely a scam.",
      "3) Verify government communications: Scammers often impersonate government agencies like the IRS or VA. If you get a message that threatens penalties or asks for personal information, don\u2019t respond. Instead, contact the agency directly using official contact details to confirm whether the message is legitimate.",
      "4) Be skeptical of rental or car sale deals that seem too good to be true: If a rental listing or car sale seems too cheap or perfect to be true, it probably is. Always visit the property or dealership in person, and never send money upfront without seeing the product or having a signed agreement.",
      "5) Protect your personal information: Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. Scammers use phishing emails and fake websites to steal personal and financial information. Ensure your devices have updated security software and be extra cautious when handling sensitive data online.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6)\u00a0Invest in data removal services: Consider using data removal services to protect your personal information from being harvested by scammers. These services can help remove your data from public databases and people-search websites, reducing the risk of identity theft and unwanted solicitations.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers rely on misinformation to trick you. However, by staying informed and being extra careful when navigating the internet, you can stay safe. These bad actors are constantly finding new ways to target veterans, from romance scams to fake government offers. Being cautious, verifying offers and keeping your data secure are the best ways to avoid falling victim to these heartless fraudsters.",

      "With cybercriminals lurking around every corner, protecting your identity and finances can feel daunting. But what if I told you that a VPN could be your secret weapon?",
      "By masking your IP address and encrypting your data, a VPN makes you nearly invisible to online threats.",
      "Let\u2019s dive into how this powerful tool can safeguard your online activities and keep your financial transactions secure.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "A woman using a VPN on a tablet\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is a VPN?",
      "A VPN, or virtual private network, is a service that encrypts your internet connection, ensuring that your online activities remain private and secure. By routing your internet traffic through a secure server, VPNs mask your IP address, making it difficult for hackers and malicious entities to track your online behavior.",
      "A VPN being used on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "CAN YOU BYPASS VPN BLOCKS AND PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY?",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms \u2014 IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from its server network, effectively preventing websites and cybercriminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",

      "Identity theft occurs when someone illegally obtains your personal information to commit fraud. This can lead to unauthorized transactions and damage to your credit status. So, how can a VPN prevent identity theft? By encrypting your internet connection, VPNs protect against data breaches and unauthorized access to personal information, especially on unsecured networks like public Wi-Fi. VPNs also prevent third parties from tracking your online activities, reducing the risk of personal data being harvested for malicious purposes.",

      "Online transactions are vulnerable to interception by cybercriminals looking to steal financial information such as credit card numbers and banking credentials. A VPN can be used as a shield for financial data. VPNs ensure that all data exchanged during online transactions is encrypted, making it nearly impossible for hackers to access sensitive financial information. When using public Wi-Fi networks, which are often targeted by cybercriminals, a VPN provides an additional layer of security by encrypting all data transmissions.",

      "2. Use strong passwords:\u00a0Combine the use of a VPN with strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts to enhance security. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",

    "published": "Sat, 09 Nov 2024 10:00:11 -0500",
    "summary": "OpenAI recently introduced a new memory feature for ChatGPT that enables it to remember information about people, including age, gender and beliefs.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson discusses OpenAI ending its safety task force, actress Scarlett Johansson claiming the company copied her voice and the growing popularity of the voice notes phone feature.",
      "ChatGPT is an amazing tool, and its developer, OpenAI, keeps adding new features from time to time.",
      "Recently, the company introduced a new memory feature in ChatGPT, which essentially enables it to remember things about you. For example, it can recall your age, gender, philosophical beliefs and pretty much anything else.",
      "These memories are meant to remain private, but a researcher recently demonstrated how ChatGPT's artificial intelligence memory features can be manipulated, raising questions about privacy and security.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "ChatGPT introduction screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is ChatGPT's Memory feature?",
      "ChatGPT\u2019s memory feature is designed to make the chatbot more personal to you. It remembers information that might be useful for future conversations and tailors responses based on that information, even if you open a different chat. For example, if you mention that you\u2019re vegetarian, the next time you ask for recipes, it will provide only vegetarian options.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "You can also train it to remember specific details about you, such as saying, \"Remember that I like to watch classic movies.\" In future interactions, it will tailor recommendations accordingly. You have control over ChatGPT\u2019s memory. You can reset it, clear specific memories or all memories, or turn this feature off entirely in your settings.",

      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "The security vulnerability in ChatGPT",
      "As reported by\u00a0Arstechnica, security researcher Johann Rehberger found that it\u2019s possible to trick the AI into remembering false information through a method called indirect prompt injection. This means the AI can be manipulated into accepting instructions from unreliable sources like emails or blog posts.",
      "For instance, Rehberger demonstrated that he could trick ChatGPT into believing a certain user was 102 years old, lived in a fictional place called the Matrix and thought the Earth was flat. After the AI accepts this made-up information, it will carry it over to all future chats with that user. These false memories could be implanted by using tools like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive to store files, upload images or even browse a site like Bing \u2014 all of which could be manipulated by a hacker.",
      "Rehberger submitted a follow-up report that included a proof of concept, demonstrating how he could exploit the flaw in the ChatGPT app for macOS. He showed that by tricking the AI into opening a web link containing a malicious image, he could make it send everything a user typed and all the AI's responses to a server he controlled. This meant that if an attacker could manipulate the AI in this way, they could monitor all conversations between the user and ChatGPT.",
      "Rehberger's proof-of-concept exploit demonstrated that the vulnerability could be used to exfiltrate all user input in perpetuity. The attack isn't possible through the ChatGPT web interface, thanks to an API OpenAI rolled out last year. However, it was still possible through the ChatGPT app for macOS.",
      "When Rehberger privately reported the finding to OpenAI in May, the company took it seriously and mitigated this issue by ensuring that the model doesn\u2019t follow any links generated within its own responses, like those involving memory and similar features.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",

      "CYBER SCAMMERS USE AI TO MANIPULATE GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS",
      "OpenAI\u2019s response",
      "After Rehberger shared his proof of concept, OpenAI engineers took action and released a patch to address this vulnerability. They released a new version of the ChatGPT macOS application (version 1.2024.247) that encrypts conversations and fixes the security flaw.",
      "So, while OpenAI has taken steps to address the immediate security flaw, there are still potential vulnerabilities related to memory manipulation and the need for ongoing vigilance in using AI tools with memory features. The incident underscores the evolving nature of security challenges in AI systems.",
      "The company says, \"It\u2019s important to note that prompt injection in large language models is an area of ongoing research. As new techniques emerge, we address them at the model layer via instruction hierarchy or application-layer defenses like the ones mentioned.\"",
      "How do I disable ChatGPT memory?",
      "If you're not cool with ChatGPT keeping stuff about you or the chance that it could let a bad actor access your data, you can just turn off this feature in the settings.",
      "Open the\u00a0ChatGPT app or website\u00a0on your computer or smartphone.Click on the\u00a0profile icon in the top right corner of the screen.Go to Settings and then select Personalization.Switch the Memory option off, and you\u2019re all set.",

      "As AI technologies like ChatGPT become more prevalent, it's crucial to adhere to cybersecurity best practices to protect your personal information. Here are some tips for enhancing your cybersecurity:",
      "1. Regularly review privacy settings:\u00a0Stay informed about what data is being collected. Periodically check and adjust privacy settings on AI platforms like ChatGPT and others to ensure you\u2019re only sharing information you\u2019re comfortable with.",
      "2. Be cautious about sharing sensitive information:\u00a0Less is more when it comes to personal data. Avoid disclosing sensitive details such as your full name, address, or financial information in conversations with AI.",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create passwords that are at least 12 characters long, combining letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoid reusing them across different accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your ChatGPT and other AI accounts.\u00a0By requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code, you significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.",
      "5. Keep software and applications up to date:\u00a0Stay ahead of vulnerabilities.\u00a0Regular updates often include security patches that protect against newly discovered threats, so enable automatic updates whenever possible.",
      "6. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0 In an age where AI is everywhere, protecting your data from cyber threats is more important than ever. Adding strong antivirus software to your devices adds a critical layer of protection. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "7. Regularly monitor your accounts:\u00a0Catch issues early. Frequently check bank statements and online accounts for any unusual activity, which can help you identify potential\u00a0breaches quickly.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "As AI tools like ChatGPT get smarter and more personal, it's pretty interesting to think about how they can tailor conversations to us. But, as Johann Rehberger\u2019s findings remind us, there are some real risks involved, especially when it comes to privacy and security. While OpenAI is able to mitigate these issues as they arise, it also shows that we need to keep a close eye on how these features work. It's all about finding that sweet spot between innovation and keeping our data safe.",

      "Rubio is blunt on China, writing on X, for example, \"Communist China is not, and will never be, a friend to democratic nations.\" In May 2022, Rubio introduced the \"Taiwan Peace Through Strength Act,\" a bill that would fast-track U.S.-Taiwan military coordination.\u00a0Rubio stated in connection to the bill that, \"Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is not the first time an authoritarian regime invaded its neighbor and, unfortunately, it won\u2019t be the last.

      "But according to the JINSA report, prior to the October 2023 attacks by Hamas, Iran-sanctioned militant groups opted to target U.S. troops over Israeli positions because \"Iranian-linked groups determined that the U.S. responses would be less forceful than Israel\u2019s.\"",
      "That strategy halted after the Hamas attack on Israel, and in October this year alone Iran-backed groups launched more than 110 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), missiles and rockets at Israel from Iraq.",
      "\"Leveraging its Iraqi proxies to fire at Israel was likely a means for Iran to increase fire against the Jewish state without triggering the retaliation on Iranian territory that its direct attacks have incurred,\" Cicurel said.",
      "Security experts have told Fox News Digital they believe the international community can expect to see increased fighting in Iraq and Syria between Israel and Iran-backed militias as Tehran looks to prevent strikes on its own homeland from becoming normalized.",

      "\"With Israel having dismantled Hamas and neutralized much of Hezbollah\u2019s capabilities, Iran will likely increasingly target Israel by using its proxies in Iraq and Syria, which it has similarly armed with Iran-made rockets, missiles and drones,\" Cicuerl said.",

      "Just as the U.S. has seen an increase in Iran-backed attacks levied at it since last year, so, too, has Israel.",
      "Not only has Iran directly fired some 320 ballistic missiles, 170 cruise missiles and 30 UAVs during its April and October attacks on the Jewish state, its top proxy fighting force, Hezbollah, has fired a reported 16,170 projectiles at Israel since October 2023, nearly 40% of which were fired last month when 6,340 rockets, missiles and UAVs targeted the Levant nation.",
      "Israel also saw at least 111 UAVs, missiles and rockets thrown at it from Iran-backed groups in Iraq last month, which is more than 2.5 times the number of attacks from Iraq than in September and likely a strong motivator for the strike that Israel carried out in Iraq and Syria during its retaliatory strike against Tehran late last month.",

      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",

      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier.

      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \"incremental improvements.\"",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \"have taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\"",

      "CHINA OFFICIALLY 'DOESN'T CARE' ABOUT TRUMP WIN; UNOFFICIALLY, EXPERTS SAY BEIJING IS RATTLED",
      "Eventually, however, \"larger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\" Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\"As well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\" Childs said.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday he will nominate Tulsi Gabbard, a former House Democrat who became a high-profile Trump supporter, to be director of national intelligence.",
      "\u201cFor over two decades, Tulsi has fought for our Country and Freedoms of all Americans,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cI know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and securing Peace through Strength. Tulsi will make us all proud!\u201d",
      "In her own statement Wednesday, Gabbard said she was grateful for the chance to \"defend the safety, security and freedom of the American people\" as a member of Trump's Cabinet.",
      "\"I look forward to getting to work,\" she added.",
      "Gabbard announced shortly before the 2022 midterm elections that she was leaving the Democratic Party, which she accused in a video on X of\u00a0\u201cactively working to undermine our God-given freedoms enshrined in our Constitution.\u201d",
      "In August, she endorsed Trump, began working\u00a0as a co-chair for his transition team and helped him prepare for his lone debate against Vice President Kamala Harris. Last month she formally announced she would join the Republican Party.",
      "Gabbard ran\u00a0for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential race and\u00a0ended her campaign in March 2020 to endorse Joe Biden. She also served in the House from 2013 to 2021 and was vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee from 2013 to 2016.",
      "She is a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve\u00a0and was previously deployed to the Middle East and Africa.",
      "If she is confirmed, Gabbard will be the first person of color\u00a0to be director of national intelligence, a position created by President George W. Bush.",
      "Gabbard has been widely criticized for her meeting in 2017 with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who had been accused of human rights violations and war crimes. She defended the meeting, telling MSNBC at the time, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be able to be willing to meet with whoever we need to if there is a possibility and a chance that that can help us take steps forward towards peace.\"",
      "In 2019, Gabbard was one of the only House Democrats not to vote for Trump's first impeachment on charges that he abused power and obstructed Congress.",
      "Gabbard has also criticized the House Jan. 6 committee, arguing that the panel's first public hearing in June 2022 about its investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack was centered on achieving \"political interests.\"",
      "\"They don't have their priorities straight. So much of this has been politicized. It's been sensationalized with very specific objectives that have nothing to do with upholding the Constitution,\" Gabbard said in an interview on Fox News in 2022.",
      "After a New York jury found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts in his hush money trial this year, Gabbard said in video remarks posted online that the Biden-Harris administration was responsible for the \"personal political persecution of Donald Trump.\""

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 20:04:48 GMT",
    "summary": "President-elect Trump now has a clear path to enact his agenda and fill out his administration with both the House and Senate in Republican hands come January.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans will maintain control of the House of Representatives by the thinnest of margins, NBC News projected Wednesday, handing President-elect Donald Trump and his party all the levers of power in Washington.",
      "A Republican-controlled Congress will allow Trump to quickly fill out his Cabinet and other top administration roles and advance his agenda for at least the next two years, though Democrats will have some sway with small majorities in the House and Senate.",
      "House Republicans\u2019 razor-thin victory was propelled by Trump\u2019s decisive win over Vice President Kamala Harris in both the Electoral College and the popular vote. It represents a stinging blow to Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and the Democrats, who now will have virtually no check on Trump, a man they warned on the campaign trail is a threat to democracy, an extremist and a fascist.",
      "As of Wednesday afternoon, Republicans flipped seven seats, while Democrats flipped six seats, for a net GOP gain of just one seat. So far, Republicans have captured the 218 seats needed to secure the majority to Democrats\u2019 208 seats. Last week, Republicans flipped three Democratic Senate seats to win control of the upper chamber.",
      "\u201cIt is a beautiful morning in Washington. It is a new day in America,\u201d a celebratory Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said on the steps of the Capitol, flanked by his leadership team, as the House returned to Washington on Tuesday. \u201cThe sun is shining, and that is a reflection about how we all feel.\u201d",
      "How Republicans won",
      "Democrats had believed they were in a good position to win back the majority they lost just two years ago. They needed a net gain of only four seats to flip control of the House given that Republicans now hold 220 seats to the Democrats\u2019 212 \u2014 one of the smallest majorities in modern history.",
      "But the two parties basically have fought to a draw in the House, preserving a status quo that favored Republicans.",
      "In New York, Democrats were able to knock off a trio of vulnerable freshman GOP incumbents: Rep. Brandon Williams in the Syracuse region, Rep. Anthony D\u2019Esposito on Long Island, and Rep. Marc Molinaro, whose district includes parts of the Hudson Valley and the Catskills. They were among the 18 GOP House districts that President Joe Biden carried in 2020.",
      "Democratic challenger George Whitesides also ousted vulnerable GOP Rep. Mike Garcia in Southern California.",
      "But Trump\u2019s triumph \u2014 including wins in battlegrounds like Pennsylvania and Michigan where there were key House races \u2014 helped buoy GOP incumbents and new candidates in the places that mattered.",
      "Two of the biggest GOP prizes came in the Keystone State. Republicans unseated two vulnerable, veteran Democrats in neighboring districts in eastern Pennsylvania. GOP businessman Rob Bresnahan ousted six-term Rep. Matt Cartwright, a former member of leadership, in the 8th District, which Trump carried in 2020. In the neighboring 7th District based in Allentown, GOP state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie upset Democratic Rep. Susan Wild, the top Democrat on the House Ethics Committee.",
      "In the state capital, Harrisburg, Democrats believed they had a good chance to knock off former Freedom Caucus Chairman Scott Perry, a Trump ally who played a role in the effort to overturn the 2020 election. But the six-term incumbent beat back a strong challenge from former local TV anchor Janelle Stelson, who attacked Perry on everything from the Jan. 6 Capitol attack and abortion rights to his votes on veterans issues.",
      "Republicans also captured a Michigan seat that had been held by Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who successfully ran for an open Senate seat. And GOP challenger Gabe Evans narrowly defeated freshman Rep. Yadira Caraveo, D-Colo., by less than 1 percentage point in a heavily Hispanic district north of Denver.",
      "The task of governing",
      "The tiny House victory is hugely consequential as Republicans turn to the task of governing. When Trump and his congressional allies take the reins in January, they will have another rare opportunity to push through major policy initiatives through \u201creconciliation\u201d \u2014 an arcane process that will allow the GOP to fast-track legislation without Democratic support.",
      "Discussions about what reforms to pursue began even before the election, with some Republicans pushing to use reconciliation to renew expiring Trump tax cuts and others like Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump ally, calling for Republicans to take up border security legislation. It\u2019s not yet clear what would be in that border bill, but Trump has said repeatedly that he will \u201cseal\u201d the southern border on Day One as president and launch \u201cthe largest deportation program in American history.\u201d",
      "In the closing days of the campaign, Johnson told supporters a \u201cmassive\u201d reform of the Affordable Care Act would be part of the GOP\u2019s first 100-day agenda, though he has since denied that Republicans would try to repeal Obamacare as they failed to do in 2017.",
      "With little wiggle room, Republicans are sure to run into challenges. And Trump has already selected two members of the new majority to serve in his administration, Reps. Elise Stefanik of New York and Mike Waltz of Florida. Both are in solidly Republican districts the party will likely carry in special elections to replace them, but vacancies following their departures could be an issue for Johnson.",
      "The GOP had a minuscule majority in this Congress, and it struggled to push its agenda forward. Instead, the past two years were defined by a successful conservative coup against Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California, the expulsion of a New York Republican congressman and intraparty squabbling over GOP spending bills.",
      "Johnson and Republicans will now have partners in a Senate majority and the White House, which they hope will allow them to rally behind Trump and put some of that infighting behind them. Johnson and his top lieutenants \u2014 Majority Leader Steve Scalise, also from Louisiana, and Majority Whip Tom Emmer, of Minnesota \u2014 all ran unopposed for re-election to their posts on Wednesday.",
      "Johnson will still need to secure 218 votes on the House floor on the first day of the new Congress, in early January, to win his first full term as speaker.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s unified government \u2026\u00a0if we have a bicameral approach \u2014 Republicans in both chambers working together to develop that agenda and implement it, and President Trump is guiding the way \u2014 I think you will certainly have a lot less dissension in the ranks on our side,\u201d Johnson said in an interview with NBC News at a Pennsylvania campaign stop before the election.",
      "\u201cI think everybody\u2019s going to want to be a part of that majority that is solving the problems of the country,\u201d the speaker added. \u201cAnd I think governing is going to be a whole lot easier come January.\u201d"

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 19:58:02 GMT",
    "summary": "Republicans win the House as well as the Senate, giving Donald Trump a clear path to pass legislation. But the small majority has struggled with unity and chaos.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Over the last two years, a narrow Republican House majority has fought bitterly over everything from electing a speaker, keeping the government functioning and even passing symbolic messaging bills. Those divisions led to one of the least productive congresses in modern times.",
      "Now, Republicans have clinched at least 218 seats to win a House majority, NBC News projects, but it\u2019ll be another small one. And this time the stakes are much higher, as the party seizes full control of Washington under President-elect Donald Trump with high expectations from voters.",
      "Will the party be able to unify, govern and deliver this time?",
      "\u201cThe House has always been a chaotic place, will always be a chaotic place. Anyone who thinks it\u2019s going to be smooth sailing has never spent one day walking these halls. But it\u2019ll be on us as members to actually go out and find a way to deliver,\u201d Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, told NBC News. \u201cAnd I certainly think the members that helped bring this majority \u2014 we have more to gain, more to lose than anyone else.\u201d",
      "The unified government gives Republicans power to set outcomes and deprives them of their recent luxury of sharing the political blame for paralysis with a Democratic president.",
      "The GOP trifecta will face major tasks with portions of Trump's tax cuts as well as Obamacare subsidies expiring at the end of 2025. There will also be deadlines like a new round of government funding, with the possibility of another shutdown fight, a farm bill reauthorization and a debt ceiling extension, all of which are subject to the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold and therefore likely to require cutting deals with Democrats.",
      "With Trump returning to the White House, Republicans will also control the Senate \u2014 but with far short of the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster, a rule that many GOP senators insist they will keep. Outgoing Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., promised after the election that \u201cthe filibuster will stand.\" Incoming Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., echoed that promise Wednesday after he was elected to the position.",
      "Republicans will be able to use a Senate rule to bypass the filibuster for matters involving taxes and spending, but other legislation will be subject to 60 votes. The party will have to decide how aggressively to pursue Trump's legislative promises like new immigration restrictions and conservative priorities like anti-abortion or anti-transgender legislation.",
      "\u201cWe have to make life affordable, we have to secure the border and keep our communities safe,\" said Rep.-elect Rob Bresnahan, who flipped a divided district in Pennsylvania and helped create the Republican majority.",
      "But the numbers \"provide opportunities, given the fact that Republicans have such a narrow majority in the House,\u201d Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cIf they really try to pass extreme stuff, they\u2019re going to have a hell of a fight on their hands \u2014\u00a0including from some of, at least, their House members who are in Democratic-leaning districts or purple districts. And here in the Senate, obviously, we continue to have a number of tools to exercise.\u201d",
      "There is precedent for a narrow House majority delivering major legislation. In outgoing President Joe Biden\u2019s first two years, Democrats had a slim majority and racked up historic new laws with trillions of dollars in pandemic relief, climate and health care funding, infrastructure spending and semiconductor investments, as well as codifying same-sex marriage, assisting veterans and more.",
      "\u2018You reap what you sow\u2019",
      "Replicating that will be a tall order. Over the last two years, the GOP has been torn between lawmakers seeking incrementalist wins and a hard-right wing making maximalist demands.",
      "\u201cWe could have gotten twice as many conservative victories in the last two years had we had more unity,\u201d said Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D. \u201cThat unity is going to be a key question of the first few months of the 119th Congress.\u201d",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., said he expects Republicans to be as chaotic as they have been during their current majority. And it gives Democrats a playbook to shape outcomes if they stay unified.",
      "\u201cThe last two years are a good example. They also had narrow majorities. We think we\u2019ve done a good job of stopping a really a lot of really bad things. And so I think we\u2019re going have to be using that same strategy,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cI think our leadership is going to do a great job of making sure that we\u2019re a good check.\u201d",
      "One area Democrats will have power is must-pass bills like government funding, the farm bill and debt ceiling extensions, which are subject to a 60-vote threshold in the Senate and therefore become bipartisan endeavors.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see how it plays out. But we have the leverage,\u201d said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to look at it strategically and use it strategically.\u201d",
      "In their recent majority, Republicans took 15 ballots to elect a speaker and threw him out midsession for the first time in U.S. history. They fought over a rules package, government funding legislation, financial assistance for Ukraine to fend off Russia, impeachment of Biden administration officials \u2014 and cycled through three speaker candidates before settling on a little-known dark horse pick, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who is expected to stay in power and has Trump's endorsement.",
      "Rep. Richard Hudson, of North Carolina, the chair of the GOP campaign arm, said he believes a Republican trifecta with Trump at the helm will promote party unity.",
      "\u201cThe American people made it clear they wanted a change of direction, and so they\u2019ve given us an opportunity for unified government, and we got a chance now to try to turn things around,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cThe difference here is with unified government, Donald Trump is setting the agenda. I think it becomes much easier to move that agenda, even with a small majority.\u201d",
      "One unknown is how aggressive the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus will be at driving demands, and whether its members will again withhold votes in pursuit of their preferred results. Their tactics have frustrated other Republicans, who believe it could hurt the party if they revive them next year.",
      "\u201cYou reap what you sow. So think about what you want to do,\u201d said a senior House Republican aide, who sought anonymity to vent candidly.",
      "Another open question is what role the Republicans in swing districts will play. They will undoubtedly be targeted by Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections, where the president\u2019s party almost always faces a backlash and loses seats.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll do what we\u2019ve got to do. So it\u2019ll be fine,\u201d said Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif., who Democrats unsuccessfully targeted in a competitive exurban and rural district east of Los Angeles.",
      "\u2018Trump is so volatile\u2019",
      "Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., a former House majority leader, told NBC News that nobody knows what to expect from the new GOP trifecta.",
      "\u201cIt remains to be seen,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason it remains to be seen is: If Trump wants to be an arbiter, he obviously has enough stick to be that. So from that standpoint, they will have a referee, an arbiter, a conciliator, or whatever they want to call the role of trying to bring people together.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut Trump is so volatile, you can\u2019t count on what is he going to do, and their caucus is so volatile. But clearly they\u2019re in a different context at this point in time. Because they now have a president who will sign bills that would be unacceptable to the American people. In some respects, it\u2019s hard to say. ... They just had a big victory,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have a big victory for the House.\u201d",
      "Progressive Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., noted that the GOP majority will shrink further in the near term as Reps. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., and Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., have been tapped by Trump for roles in his administration.",
      "\u201cSounds like \u2014 the first three months, they\u2019re not going to be able to do anything if they\u2019ve got two people going to the administration,\u201d Pocan said, while urging Democrats to remember that post-pandemic inflation has caused parties across the world to lose power for reasons outside their control.",
      "\u201cSo let\u2019s not beat each other up,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The new Senate Republican majority is promising to leave the filibuster in place, retaining the 60-vote threshold to pass most legislation \u2014 even if it stands in the way of the Trump agenda they hope to advance.",
      "Shortly after he was elected as the next majority leader, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., responded clearly and unequivocally when asked Wednesday if the filibuster would remain unchanged on his watch.",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "In interviews this week, several Republican senators representing various ideological factions told NBC News they support preserving the filibuster rule, as they prepare to take full control of Washington with President-elect Donald Trump back in the White House, a Senate majority of 52 or 53 seats and a narrow House majority.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s unanimity that the filibuster is important. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s controversial,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who ran unsuccessfully for the job of majority leader, said Tuesday.",
      "Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said he\u2019s committed to protecting the filibuster \u2014 and won\u2019t be persuaded by Trump or others.",
      "\u201cNo. No. No. We need to keep the filibuster,\u201d Tuberville said.",
      "Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d supports preserving the 60-vote threshold, even if Trump revives his demands to nix it \u2014 as he unsuccessfully pushed the GOP to do during his first term.",
      "\u201cSenators have a tendency to defend their power, just like everybody else does. I don\u2019t know a lot of wimps in the United States Senate,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve all lived through the possibility of losing the filibuster as a tool to defend. And I would be surprised if there were enough Republicans who thought that we should change it now.\u201d",
      "The Republican commitment to preserving the filibuster wasn\u2019t shared by Democrats when they controlled Congress. In 2022, they pursued a carveout to the 60-vote rule to pass national voting rights legislation by a majority vote. They fell two votes short of changing the rules, although they signaled they\u2019d revisit that push in order to pass abortion rights if they won the 2024 election.",
      "Republicans are less eager to pierce the filibuster, in part because some of their biggest priorities are already exempt from the 60-vote rule. That includes confirming judges and Cabinet nominees, which require a simple majority. Other priorities of cutting taxes and modifying spending laws can be achieved through the 51-vote budget \u201creconciliation\u201d process in the Senate.",
      "In fact, Republicans are hoping to kick off that process by advancing a budget resolution early in January, even before Trump is inaugurated, two senior GOP aides told NBC News. That measure would enable them to pass some of their top priorities on a party-line basis once Trump takes office, including extending Trump\u2019s expiring 2017 tax cuts, delivering more funds for border security and other measures.",
      "Conservative senators also see the 60-vote rule as a backstop against Democrats passing their most ambitious progressive priorities when they eventually regain power. These senators believe their party has more to lose than to gain if there\u2019s no super-majority requirement.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he supports keeping the filibuster \u201cforever \u2014 for the length of the republic.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we wanted to take over the country and ... get what we want, we\u2019d get rid of the filibuster,\" said Paul.",
      "Instead, he said, the GOP will accept that it must govern at \u201ca much slower pace\u201d and not be able to \u201ctransform the country\u201d in a hurry.",
      "\u201cOther than one or two things that will pass under the budget reconciliation, most things are going to take 60 votes,\u201d Paul said.",
      "The filibuster did not come up in the Senate Republican forum Tuesday where they heard from candidates for leadership positions, senators in the room said.",
      "The preservation of the filibuster means that a series of must-pass measures like government funding, a farm bill and debt ceiling extension are subject to 60 Senate votes. The GOP has clinched 52 seats with just Pennsylvania still too close to call, NBC News projects. That means Democrats will have a substantial say on those measures.",
      "\u201cNeither chamber will have an overwhelming majority, and these spending bills will be a bipartisan product,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the Appropriations Committee chair who will become vice chair when Democrats relinquish power on Jan. 3.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who has threatened to resign from the Senate if Republicans nix the filibuster, said he remains confident the party will preserve it in the second Trump administration.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that changes,\u201d Tillis said.",
      "Outgoing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters after the election that \u201cthe filibuster will stand\u201d in the new era of Republican control. (While he won't be in leadership, McConnell has said he\u2019ll finish out the remaining two years of his Senate term as a rank-and-file member).",
      "Paul said Republicans will accept the limitations of the legislative filibuster even when it hinders their goals, like restricting abortion.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got people going, \u2018Oh my goodness, the Republicans are going to have a ban on abortion.\u2019 But you know why there won\u2019t be a ban on abortion? Because of the filibuster,\u201d Paul said. \u201cSo there actually is a very much a high-minded purpose behind the filibuster. Those of us who are for it now in the majority should get some credit from the left who says, oh, we\u2019re all Hitler and we\u2019re all wanting to destroy democracy. No, we\u2019re actually giving a voice to Democrats to make sure that Republicans don\u2019t win every battle.\u201d"

      "\u201cAs Congress returns to Washington, we must prepare the Senate to advance [Trump\u2019s] agenda legislatively and ensure that the president-elect can hit the ground running with his appointees confirmed as soon as possible,\u201d Thune wrote in an op-ed for FoxNews.com. \u201cThe Senate Republican majority will work with President Trump to ensure the Senate calendar allows us to confirm his nominees and pass our shared agenda as quickly and as efficiently as possible.\u201d",
      "Senate Republicans held a candidate forum Tuesday evening after Congress returned from a lengthy recess to hear from all three candidates. And the secret ballot election began Wednesday morning with incumbent and newly elected senators able to vote. Only a handful of members said how they would vote in advance, with most holding their cards close to the vest.",
      "Thune and Cornyn, both elected during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, hail from an institutionalist wing of the GOP. Both have long-standing relationships within the conference and can claim to be next in line, with each having served as the No. 2 Republican for six years.",
      "Before the vote, Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said he was supporting Thune but admitted there\u2019s \u201cvery little\u201d difference between him and Cornyn. \u201cAlthough Cornyn told me yesterday ... people are saying they\u2019re a mirror\u00a0image of each other. To which I say, I think John Thune would take offense to that,\u201d Cramer said.",
      "Colleagues viewed Scott, elected in 2018, as a more divisive figure, and he has been a vocal critic of McConnell for years. He aligned himself solidly with the party\u2019s MAGA wing and had secured some endorsements for the job from Trump allies, including right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson, billionaire benefactor Elon Musk and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.",
      "\"I think I\u2019m uniquely positioned to really help get the Trump agenda done. ...\u00a0I\u2019m optimistic I\u2019m going to win. I\u2019m talking about the things that people say they care about, and so we\u2019ll see,\" Scott told NBC News on Tuesday.",
      "But Trump, notably, didn't weigh in. His ability to anoint his chosen leader was complicated by the secret ballot, which means he won't know which senators voted against his preferred candidate \u2014 or be able to politically punish them.",
      "All three candidates ran on promises to carry out Trump\u2019s agenda, a clear point of agreement among them.",
      "Thune and Cornyn also touted their fundraising prowess and donations to help colleagues win elections.",
      "In a letter to fellow Senate Republicans on Tuesday, Cornyn wrote, \"In order to Make America Great Again, we must Make the Senate Work Again,\" and he promised to decentralize power.",
      "\"To that end, we will reinvest in a Senate committee process to drive an aggressive legislative agenda that secures our border, reduces federal spending, boosts our economy, unleashes the nation\u2019s energy potential, and reverses bad Biden-Harris policies,\" Cornyn continued. \"Our default position for legislation considered on the floor will be an open amendment process managed by the committee chairs to allow for amendments and increase debate.\"",
      "As part of the leadership shakeup, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming was elected by acclamation to the No. 2 position of majority whip after he ran unopposed. And the No. 3 slot features a battle between Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Joni Ernst of Iowa.",
      "Asked about Cotton's team exuding confidence that he has the votes, Ernst said she's not so sure.",
      "\"Kamala Harris thought she had the votes, too,\" Ernst said."

    "story": [
      "Pennsylvania\u2019s Senate race is heading to a recount, with the narrow margin between Republican Dave McCormick and Democratic Sen. Bob Casey triggering it automatically under state law.",
      "Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt announced Wednesday that the unofficial results showing a narrow race have led to a recount. Schmidt noted in his announcement that counties must begin the recount no later than Nov. 20, and they must complete the process by noon on Nov. 26. The results will not be published until Nov. 27.",
      "Just over 29,000 votes, or 0.4 percent of the total votes cast, currently separate the two candidates, with McCormick narrowly leading. Any margin under 0.5 percentage points triggers a recount in Pennsylvania. NBC News has not yet projected a winner in the race.",
      "McCormick spokeswoman Elizabeth Gregory called the Republican\u2019s lead \u201cinsurmountable\u201d in a statement.",
      "\u201cA recount will be a waste of time and taxpayer money, but it is Senator Casey\u2019s prerogative,\u201d Gregory said, going on to reference McCormick\u2019s narrow primary loss in 2022. \u201cSenator-elect McCormick knows what it\u2019s like to lose an election and is sure Senator Casey will eventually reach the right conclusion.\u201d",
      "Casey has not conceded the race. \"When the vote gets to a certain level, the state makes a determination and they made that determination. Lot more votes to count,\" he said Wednesday in the Capitol.",
      "Casey said in a Tuesday statement that \u201cthe American democratic process was born in Pennsylvania and that process will play out.\u201d",
      "Former President Donald Trump carried Pennsylvania, helping him lock up enough electoral votes for the presidency. But the current vote count shows a sizable drop-off between Trump and McCormick, with Trump winning more than 100,000 additional votes than McCormick. Casey is lagging behind Vice President Kamala Harris by around 40,000 votes.",
      "McCormick declared victory a few days after the election, telling supporters in Pittsburgh last Friday that there was no path for Casey to surpass him.",
      "\u201cI wish him the best, and his family the best, and thank them for their service,\u201d McCormick said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to move on to changing the direction of the country.\u201d",
      "Asked about the possibility of a recount, McCormick told reporters on Friday, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether there will be a recount or not, but the people have spoken, there\u2019s a clear victory and I\u2019ll respectfully move forward on that basis.\u201d",
      "Senate Republicans have already secured the Senate majority, picking up Senate seats in West Virginia, Ohio, and Montana.",
      "NBC News projected that Democratic Senate candidates in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin won their Senate races even as Trump carried the states."

    "story": [
      "Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of defense, has said that he believes women should not serve in combat and that he wants to see the military purged of \u201cwoke\u201d officials who support diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "Hegseth, 44, a Fox News host, has an extensive history of eyebrow-raising commentary, especially when it comes to military matters he\u2019d oversee should he be confirmed to join Trump\u2019s second Cabinet and become sixth in line to the presidency.",
      "Hegseth has long maintained a close relationship with Trump. The pair have frequently appeared together in photographs on social media and on Fox\u2019s airwaves. Hegseth started at Fox News in 2014 as an on-air pundit, working his way up to co-hosting the weekend edition of \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d the network\u2019s flagship morning show.",
      "Trump described Hegseth on Tuesday evening as \u201ctough, smart and a true believer in America First.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith Pete at the helm, America\u2019s enemies are on notice \u2014 Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down,\u201d he said.",
      "Neither Fox News nor Trump\u2019s transition team immediately responded to requests for comment about Hegseth\u2019s on-air remarks about the military. Hegseth was an Army National Guard infantry officer, serving tours in Afghanistan and Iraq and at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.",
      "Hegseth has already given clues about how he\u2019d like to remake the Defense Department, the largest and oldest U.S. government agency, with a budget of about $850 billion. Appearing last week on \u201cThe Shawn Ryan Show\u201d podcast, Hegseth said that in Trump\u2019s second term, \u201cany general that was involved, general, admiral, whatever, that was involved in any of the DEI, woke s--t has got to go.\u201d",
      "The first order of business, he said, would be to fire the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr., who he said has pushed a \u201cwoke\u201d agenda.",
      "He also declared that female soldiers should not be allowed to fight on the front lines.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m straight up just saying that we should not have women in combat roles,\u201d Hegseth said on the podcast. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t made us more effective, hasn\u2019t made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.\u201d",
      "The Pentagon first opened all combat roles to women in 2015, a historic policy shift meant to reflect the changing attitudes of gender-based barriers within the military. Women are more than 17% of the military\u2019s active duty force, according to the Defense Department, and they have proven themselves in training, excelled as fighter pilots in overseas combat and broken ground in top roles throughout the armed forces.",
      "Hegseth has also suggested the rules of war ought to be reworked to benefit the U.S. In early 2020, after Iran fired missiles at U.S. forces housed at Iraqi air bases in retaliation for the Trump-authorized strike killing top Iranian Gen. Qassam Soleimani, he said on the air that the U.S. military should be allowed to bomb Iranian historic sites.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t care about Iranian cultural sites,\u201d he said in one appearance. Two days later, he said, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to fight to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb, this regime, then we need to rewrite the rules that are advantageous to us,\u201d adding, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hit cultural sites on purpose, but if you\u2019re using one to harbor your most dangerous weapons, then that should be on the target list, too.\u201d",
      "More to the point, Hegseth said last week on Ryan\u2019s podcast, \u201cthe rules of war are for winners.\u201d",
      "Hegseth has also been vocal about defending members of the military in controversial cases.",
      "He publicly lobbied Trump in 2019 to pardon three U.S. servicemen who were either convicted or accused of war crimes. Among them was Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL platoon leader who was acquitted by a military jury in the killing of a militant in Iraq in 2017 but was convicted on a related minor charge.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not war criminals; they\u2019re warriors,\u201d Hegseth said on the air that year about the men he hoped Trump would pardon.",
      "Trump reversed the sentence against Gallagher that demoted his military rank, prompting the firing of Navy Secretary Richard Spencer, who opposed the decision. Trump also pardoned two others in separate cases involving the killings of Afghans during war.",
      "More recently, Hegseth defended Daniel Penny, the Marine veteran who is on trial in the chokehold death of a homeless Black man in a New York City subway last year, posting to X that Penny is \u201can American hero\u201d and that \u201cthe woke mob is trying to ruin\u201d him.",
      "Early in his career at Fox, Hegseth went viral in 2015 for an on-air incident in which he overshot a target and struck a West Point drummer in the arm with an ax. The man, Master Sgt. Jeffrey Prosperie, sued Hegseth. The Associated Press reported Wednesday that the case was discontinued in 2019 and that Prosperie\u2019s lawyer wrote in a statement, \u201cThe parties have resolved the matter and will make no further comment.\u201d Prosperie could not be reached for comment.",
      "Hegseth is among a flurry of Cabinet-level picks by Trump, including longtime allies like Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., to be attorney general, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida to be secretary of state and former House Democrat Tulsi Gabbard to be director of national intelligence.",
      "At least one of Hegseth\u2019s cable news colleagues met his selection with some skepticism.",
      "\u201cFrom silly diner interviews on Weekend Fox and Friends to Secretary of Defense? I never thought I\u2019d say I\u2019m stunned about any pick after the election but nominating Pete Hegseth for this incredibly important role? Yes he\u2019s a veteran \u2026 and?\u201d former \u201cFox & Friends\u201d host Gretchen Carlson said Tuesday evening on X.",
      "Hegseth\u2019s Fox News colleagues, meanwhile, heaped praise upon him.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t realize how qualified he is until you really look at the r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d co-host Brian Kilmeade said Wednesday morning.",
      "Hegseth, a decorated veteran, could face a challenging confirmation process. Republicans will hold a slim majority in the Senate, and his comments and status as a relative unknown may prove to be obstacles.",
      "\u201cWho?\u201d Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said on Capitol Hill when he was asked Tuesday evening about Trump\u2019s picking Hegseth. \u201cI don\u2019t know Pete. I just don\u2019t know anything about him.\u201d",
      "Nevertheless, even skeptical Republican senators seem open to confirming him.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to be negative right now, because I want to learn more about his background and, you know, and his approach to this stuff, so he\u2019ll go through the regular process,\u201d Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., told reporters Tuesday."

      "The announcement reinforces the closeness that Musk has managed to achieve with Trump, even after the election. But for some people in Trump\u2019s orbit, Musk\u2019s presence has felt overbearing.",
      "Musk has been so aggressive in pushing his views about Trump\u2019s second term that he\u2019s stepping on the toes of Trump\u2019s transition team and may be overstaying his welcome at Mar-a-Lago, according to two people familiar with the transition who have spent time at the\u00a0 Palm Beach, Florida, resort over the past week.",
      "The sources said that Musk\u2019s near-constant presence at Mar-a-Lago in the week since Election Day had begun to wear on people who\u2019ve been in Trump\u2019s inner circle longer than the tech billionaire and who see him as overstepping his role in the transition. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they\u2019re not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s behaving as if he\u2019s a co-president and making sure everyone knows it,\u201d one of the people said of Musk.",
      "\u201cAnd he\u2019s sure taking lots of credit for the president\u2019s victory. Bragging about America PAC and X to anyone who will listen. He\u2019s trying to make President Trump feel indebted to him. And the president is indebted to no one,\u201d this person added.",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",
      "In a statement, Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said, \u201cElon Musk and President Trump are great friends and brilliant leaders working together to Make America Great Again. Elon Musk is a once in a generation business leader and our federal bureaucracy will certainly benefit from his ideas and efficiency.\u201d",
      "In another statement, a separate Trump-Vance spokesperson, Anna Kelly, said, \"Elon Musk is a genius, an innovator, and has literally made history by building creative, modern, and efficient systems. \u00a0Elon Musk has dedicated himself to America\u2019s future by offering to serve with President Trump to ensure our government works more efficiently and uses America\u2019s taxpayer dollars effectively.\"",
      "Musk traveled to Mar-a-Lago to watch the election returns come in last Tuesday night, and he\u2019s been there much of the past week, the two sources said. They said Musk is there at all hours, sitting with Trump and joining calls and meetings.",
      "Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has been involved in sensitive conversations, even before his role in the administration was announced, including briefly joining a phone call last week between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "The second person said that Musk has an \u201copinion on and about everything,\u201d and that he shares them so forcefully that he\u2019s begun to pester Trump insiders.",

      "The individual said that some Trump advisers said they were concerned that Musk didn\u2019t understand one key to being effective in Trump\u2019s world: keeping a low profile. Musk\u2019s engagement has been overly aggressive and may hurt his standing in the long run, the source said.",
      "The second source also said that Musk appeared to be pushing his own agenda, instead of focusing on Trump\u2019s. They said that while Musk is clearly a smart and capable person, the transition is about ensuring those loyal to Trump will be the ones carrying out government policies.",
      "\u201cAppointing people because they are loyal to Elon doesn\u2019t work,\u201d the source said.",
      "In a meeting with House Republicans Wednesday morning, Trump spoke fondly of Musk, according to two lawmakers in the room, praising Musk for his time and dedication to the election. Trump said Musk set aside his own business interests for the campaign and didn\u2019t ask for anything in return. At one point during the meeting, Trump joked about Musk\u2019s continued presence in his orbit, saying, \u201cElon won\u2019t go home. I can\u2019t get rid of him.\u201d The lawmakers insisted the statements were made in jest.",
      "Musk has been among Trump\u2019s most energetic supporters. His super PAC spent more than $152 million to elect Trump and other Republican candidates, with much of the money coming from Musk himself. He held rallies for Trump in battleground state Pennsylvania, offered $1 million daily giveaways for registered voters and turned his social media app X into a megaphone for Trump.",
      "In posts on X in the past week, Musk has pushed various policy ideas including deporting immigrants and slashing government spending.",

It\u2019s not clear whether Musk was on the jet for every flight.",
      "The relationship between Musk and Trump has been rocky over the years, despite their recent alliance.

      "NBC News spoke to six people who have joined or committed to using Threads and Bluesky in place of X after the election because of Musk. Each of them cited growing issues on X, including bots, partisan advertisements and harassment, which they all felt reached a tipping point when Donald Trump was elected president last week with Musk\u2019s support. Musk has since joined Trump on calls and in meetings to weigh in on his transition to president.",
      "For Kara Wurtz, a 39-year-old finance director in St. Louis, the day after the election was the \u201cfinal straw.\u201d After using Twitter for \u201ca good eight years,\u201d Wurtz said under Musk\u2019s leadership, the platform, renamed X, \u201cbecame a place where I wasn\u2019t really getting what I wanted out of it anymore.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery time I opened it up, it would throw things at me that put me in a bad mood,\u201d she told NBC News. \u201cI noticed Tuesday night into Wednesday I started to see a lot more anti-woman stuff. And I was like, \u2018You know what? That\u2019s personal. I\u2019m done.\u2019\u201d",
      "Wurtz, who said she mainly used X for local news, politics and entertainment, has now switched to Threads, where she initially created an account when it launched last year. But her local St. Louis community wasn\u2019t there yet. In the past five days, Wurtz said people she used to follow on X have started to trickle over to Threads.",
      "Wurtz isn\u2019t alone. More than 1 million people joined Bluesky in the past week, the platform said, bringing its user base to over 15 million people, while head of Instagram Adam Mosseri announced Nov. 3 that Threads had surpassed 275 million monthly active users.",
      "According to data from Similarweb, a third-party company that tracks social media analytics, daily traffic to Bluesky jumped above that of Threads on Nov. 6. Bluesky is currently the no. 1 free app on Apple\u2019s App Store, directly ahead of Threads.",
      "\u201cThe majority of new users in this influx is from the United States, followed by Canada and the UK,\u201d a representative for Bluesky told NBC News in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to welcome all of these new people, ranging from Swifties to wrestlers to city planners.\u201d",

      "No\u00eblle Polo, a 22-year-old Texan, joined Bluesky the night after the election. When she woke up the morning after she joined Bluesky, she said, \u201call of the Swifties joined.\u201d Polo is one of thousands of people who run fan accounts about Taylor Swift, forming one of the largest fandoms. On Nov. 6, a notable exodus of the Swifties from X landed on Bluesky, which Polo prefers to Threads because it isn\u2019t connected to her Instagram account.",
      "\u201cI have a private personal account for friends and family and a public account for Taylor Swift, so nobody drowns in my Taylor Swift content,\u201d Polo said. \u201cSwifties have been looking for another app besides Twitter ever since Elon took over. It just wasn\u2019t a healthy environment.\u201d",
      "Rory Mir, an associate director of community organizing at the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that \u201cX is really teaching everyone the importance of who owns the sites that we use and rely on to communicate online.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat people are seeing with X is that it has subjectively deteriorated in value,\u201d Mir continued. \u201cPeople don\u2019t feel like the right boxes are being heard or promoted on the site. They don\u2019t feel safe using the site in many cases.\u201d",
      "For other X users who used the platform to build an audience and find a community, the decision of whether to stop posting or delete their account isn\u2019t an easy one.",
      "\u201cFrom a human perspective, it\u2019s tough to leave a technology that was so beneficial to my growth,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Vilson, an educator and bestselling author who is currently posting on X, Threads and Bluesky. \u201cI\u2019m probably going to post less, but I\u2019m not going to delete the account unless it\u2019s like, if you don\u2019t do this, you\u2019re going to be in huge trouble.\u201d",

      "For people leaving the platform, it hasn\u2019t been clear-cut on what to do with their accounts.",
      "On Friday, X will adopt a new terms of service policy that for the first time explicitly says all users agree to let their posts be used to train artificial intelligence, like the company\u2019s generative AI service, Grok. Currently, X users can go to the site\u2019s settings and opt out.",
      "Anyone using the site agrees that their content can be used for \u201ctraining of our machine learning and artificial intelligence models, whether generative or another type,\u201d the new agreement says.",
      "That change may inspire some to want to delete all of their posts, or potentially fully delete their accounts.",
      "While several free services to automatically delete all of an account\u2019s posts exist, ones reviewed by NBC News either don\u2019t guarantee against adverse effects like potentially suspending the account or require some technical work.

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 19:17:33 GMT",
    "summary": "The share of restaurant operators who say they\u2019re still raising prices has shrunk this year. Trump\u2019s promised tariffs could influence what comes next.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation is drifting down in fits and starts, and so are restaurant menu prices.",
      "Consumer prices were 2.6% higher in October than the same time a year ago, according to federal data released Wednesday, up slightly from September\u2019s 2.4% annual rate. But while the \u201clast mile\u201d in the fight against inflation has proved slow going, dining out costs are moving in a more affordable direction.",
      "The prices of food purchased away from home rose just 0.2% from September to October, down from 0.3% the previous two months, as restaurants ease up on price hikes. About 34% of operators told Toast that they\u2019ve still raised prices over the past year, compared with 42% last year, the point-of-sale software provider found in a survey it released late last month.",
      "\u201cIf you think back to last year, there was a lot of uncertainty about how 2024 would play out,\u201d said Kelly Esten, Toast\u2019s chief marketing officer. Since then, an improving economy has restaurants \u201cfeeling more optimistic about the future than last year,\u201d she said.",
      "Consumers\u2019 hunt for bargains has forced a reckoning over restaurant prices this year. Fast-food brands like McDonald\u2019s have leaned into value menus to lure customers back, and full-service chains like Red Lobster are embarking on ambitious makeovers to fend off bankruptcies that have rippled through the sector.",
      "Dining out is still noticeably pricier than a year ago, with costs up 3.8% last month since October 2023, Wednesday\u2019s government data showed. But restaurant operators are still seeing \u201chealthy sales volume\u201d as inflation cools, according to the National Restaurant Association.",
      "\u201cConsumers\u2019 ability and willingness to spend in restaurants remains intact,\u201d the trade group said last month, noting that the industry\u2019s annual sales growth as of September was more than double that of nonrestaurant retailers during the same period.",
      "Diners are more likely to notice stabilizing menu prices at quick-service restaurants than at sit-down ones.",
      "Lightspeed Commerce, another point-of-sale provider, said its fast-casual clients raised prices by an average 4.3% between September 2023 and September 2024, slower than fine dining restaurants\u2019 5.6% average hikes. But the rate at which all eateries changed their menu prices between the second and third quarters this year plummeted by 26%, the company said.",
      "Quick-service restaurants have lowered prices faster for a number of reasons. Many tend to offer cheaper fare, and any value-driven revolt among budget-conscious customers could be an existential threat, experts say.",
      "\u201cYour hamburger place or salad spot down the street has a lot of competitors that they\u2019re worried about their customers going to, so they\u2019re primarily going to be the businesses that are most concerned about raising prices,\u201d said Ara Kharazian, research lead at payroll and payments provider Square.",
      "Overhead is another factor.",
      "Quick-service restaurants have benefited from slower growth in labor costs, Square found. Wages for workers at quick-service establishments that use the platform have risen about 60% since 2017, less than the roughly 74% at their full-service counterparts, as minimum wage laws expanded and many employers hiked pay in a hot labor market. The company estimates annual inflation faced by quick-service operators at 3.6% as of September, versus 4.3% for restaurants with table service.",
      "With President-elect Donald Trump set to return to the Oval Office on a vow to massively raise tariffs that consumers are expected to feel, it remains to be seen where menu prices may head next year.",
      "Some experts foresee the biggest impact on retail goods such as electronics and apparel, as the U.S. imports only about 15% of its food supply. But the potential for higher prices on wine and avocados, for example, is already rattling some in the industry. On Monday, the US Wine Trade Alliance hosted a fundraising and strategy meeting to brainstorm ideas for \u201cshowing key members of the incoming administration how tariffs on wine do more harm to domestic businesses, than to businesses abroad,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThat may show up at one point during [Trump\u2019s] next administration,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, principal and chief economist at the financial services firm RSM. But any tariff impacts on what consumers pay for food away from home \u201cseem to be second-order questions,\u201d he said.",
      "Much depends on how far the incoming Trump administration may go when it comes to import duties and the extent of support in Congress for any such plan. \u201cShould we get legally binding tariffs imposed by legislation, or tariff levels be reset to the 1930s, then we have a very different discussion,\u201d he said."

      "The blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy may help people cut back on drinking, new research published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry suggests.",
      "In a study of around 228,000 people in Sweden who had alcohol use disorder, researchers found that people who were taking a GLP-1 drug like semaglutide were less likely to be hospitalized for alcohol-related issues.",
      "Just over 28 million adults in the U.S. have alcohol addiction, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.",
      "Only three medicines, however, are approved to treat it.",
      "\u201cThe pharmacological treatments available for AUD are not very good, and relapse is really common,\u201d said Alex DiFeliceantonio, an assistant professor at Virginia Tech\u2019s Fralin Biomedical Research Institute.",
      "The study leader, Dr. Markku L\u00e4hteenvuo, a psychiatric researcher at Niuvanniemi Hospital in Finland, said: \u201cI see so many patients who do not have good outcomes on the medications we have and who are desperate for help with their addiction. We really do need more tools in the toolbox.\u201d",
      "GLP-1 drugs \u2014 the class of medication that includes semaglutide and other popular drugs like tirzepatide \u2014 have shown potential for treating addiction.",
      "A clinical trial published in 2022 found that an older GLP-1 drug called exenatide reduced drinking, but only among those who had both alcohol use disorder and obesity. Several other studies have examined drinking habits among people taking GLP-1 drugs who do not have alcohol use disorder.",
      "In the new study, L\u00e4hteenvuo and his team looked at medical records from 228,000 people in Swedish who were diagnosed with alcohol use disorder from 2006 to 2023. All of the people in the study also had obesity or Type 2 diabetes.",
      "About 60% of the participants were hospitalized for alcohol use disorder at some point during the study period.",
      "Around 75,000 people in the study used some type of medication to treat alcohol use disorder. Among that group, the team documented about 30,000 hospitalizations. (The researchers counted total hospitalizations, which means each tally does not necessarily represent an individual person. Some people may have been hospitalized multiple times.)",
      "The alcohol-related hospitalizations were much lower among people who took a GLP-1 drug.",
      "For the roughly 4,300 people in the study who used semaglutide \u2014 the ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy \u2014 there were about 220 hospitalizations for alcohol use disorder. Others in the study were taking older GLP-1 drugs, including liraglutide and dulaglutide, and also had fewer hospitalizations.",
      "Using hospitalization to determine the drugs\u2019 effects on alcohol use disorder is an imperfect measure, but experts said it is a good place to start.",
      "\u201cAlcohol withdrawal or poisoning would be why someone would require hospitalization, which is a pretty extreme outcome,\u201d DiFeliceantonio said.",
      "But hospital data is widely available, and it can help researchers determine which drugs may work for different types of addiction and which clinical trials they should run first, she added.",
      "Mounting research shows GLP-1 agonists warrant a closer look, especially for alcohol addiction.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve known for some time from animal studies that GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce alcohol intake and motivation to consume alcohol,\u201d said Christian Hendershot, director of clinical research at the University of Southern California Institute for Addiction Science.",
      "The fact that the new study included only people who have alcohol use disorder gives better information about how effective the drugs may be for people with substance addiction, he added.",
      "How a diabetes drug might treat addiction is still a mystery.",
      "One theory is that its effects may have something to do with the drugs\u2019 ability to induce the feeling of satiation. That may reduce cravings for drugs and alcohol the same way the drugs work on food cravings, Hendershot said.",
      "\u201cThey may also reduce the rewarding effects of drugs,\u201d he said.",
      "There are other theories, too. L\u00e4hteenvuo said it may have something to do with the sugar in alcohol. GLP-1 drugs, he said, make sugary beverages less appealing.",
      "Newer GLP-1 drugs, such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, enter the brain in different ways from older versions that have been studied, and moving forward, it will be important to test both, DiFeliceantonio said.",
      "Hendershot said that although the drugs are very safe for people with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, they could present big safety risks for people without obesity or Type 2 diabetes, particularly because of the weight loss they induce.",
      "Early research has also explored GLP-1 drugs for nicotine and opioid addiction, with mixed results. So far, the clearest results have come from studies on alcohol addiction \u2014 but there is still a lot to understand.",
      "\u201cRight now we only have three FDA-approved medications to treat alcohol use disorder. This pales in comparison to medications approved to treat other diseases,\u201d Hendershot said. \u201cAnything we can do to study other medications, including GLP-1 agonists, is critically important for our field.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "An eighth grade transgender boy, who was allegedly threatened with expulsion for using the boys restroom, is suing his South Carolina school district and the state over a budget rule that restricts accommodations for transgender students.",
      "In a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday, John Doe, a pseudonym for a 13-year-old student in the Berkeley County School District, said that administrators told him in August he could only use the girls restroom or a single-occupancy toilet in the nurse\u2019s office due to a new state rule. The school suspended him for a day when administrators later caught him using the boys restroom, and the principal warned that the punishment could escalate to expulsion if he did it again, according to the suit.",
      "\u201cI am bringing this lawsuit because rules like this are damaging to kids\u2019 mental, physical and emotional health,\u201d Doe said in a statement provided by his attorney.",
      "A provision in the state budget passed in June stipulated that public schools would lose 25% of their state funding if they permit students to use single-sex restrooms and locker rooms that do not align with their biological sex. The South Carolina budget rule conflicts with a federal regulation issued by the Biden administration under Title IX, the gender equity law, that requires schools to allow students to use the restrooms or locker rooms that align with their gender identities.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, they have to follow the law,\u201d said Alexandra Brodsky, an attorney with the nonprofit advocacy group Public Justice, which is representing Doe. \u201cAnd the law says that trans students get to equally enjoy their education as their cisgender peers.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit \u2014 which names the Berkeley County School District, the state of South Carolina and state superintendent Ellen Weaver as defendants \u2014 seeks to become a class action case and to declare the South Carolina policy for transgender students a violation of the Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause. The Alliance for Full Acceptance, an LGBTQ advocacy group in South Carolina, is also a plaintiff.",
      "The school district said it has not seen the suit, so it declined to comment. The South Carolina Attorney General\u2019s Office and Department of Education said they do not comment on pending litigation.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s new Title IX rule was enacted in April, but courts have granted injunctions to block the U.S. Department of Education from enforcing it in the 26 Republican-led states, including South Carolina, that sued to stop the federal rule.",
      "In explaining the Title IX regulation, the Biden administration cited a 2020 Supreme Court decision that discrimination against LGBTQ employees in the workplace is a violation of a federal gender equality law. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to roll back protections for transgender students when he takes office again next year.",
      "The Supreme Court has not yet considered a case centered on the rights of transgender students under Title IX, which applies to most K-12 schools and colleges. The high court declined to hear a widely watched case in 2021, Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board, allowing a 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in favor of a transgender student to use the restroom corresponding with their gender identity to stand.",
      "South Carolina lawmakers who pushed the budget rule expected the state would be sued over it, and hoped that once it was, the Supreme Court would take up the issue. The state also instructed schools not to use the word \u201cgender\u201d in school policies and facility signage to comply with the budget rule.",
      "Doe, the plaintiff in the South Carolina suit, was assigned female at birth, but has presented as a boy since he was a young child and has been open about his gender identity since seventh grade, according to the civil complaint.",
      "\u201cThe truth is other students weren\u2019t bothered by me using the bathroom,\u201d Doe said in his statement. \u201cNeither was my school principal. The problem is state law.\u201d",
      "An assistant principal at his school conceded in a meeting that no other students had complained about Doe using the boys restroom, the suit states.",
      "After the district chastised Doe for using the boys restroom, other students began to harass him over his gender identity, according to the suit. His parents decided to pull him from school and enroll him in an online education program run by the school district to avoid the conflicts. The suit described the online school as inferior to Doe\u2019s previous school.",
      "\u201cWhat happens with this case really could be the beginning of a very, very long and intense policy and political battle that we will see take form over the next two to three years,\u201d said Jonathan Collins, co-director of Columbia University\u2019s Politics and Education program, adding that the case \u201ccould be the first step in what becomes a major change in education policy and legal precedent.\u201d",
      "South Carolina is also one of 26 states that have banned gender-affirming medical care for minors. The American Civil Liberties Union is suing to overturn the ban, in a case that is still pending."

      "Nicole Daedone, the founder of OneTaste, a wellness company centered on the practice of \"orgasmic meditation,\" said she will \"absolutely\" testify at her trial next year.",
      "The former CEO is scheduled to stand trial in New York in January on one count of forced labor conspiracy. Prosecutors allege that she and former OneTaste executive Rachel Cherwitz, who is facing the same charge, targeted victims of trauma to become members and manipulated them into performing sex acts and going into debt, among other things. Cherwitz has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d Daedone said of the allegations against her in an exclusive interview with NBC News NOW\u2019s \u201cTop Story.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not true.\u00a0And as much as any human being, as this woman, this person, would not want to go to court because it\u2019s grueling, just even going to small hearings,\u00a0I want to go to court because I want all of this transparent. I want it to be exposed. I want everything that I didn\u2019t say to be said.\"",
      "Daedone rose to fame by teaching the practice of orgasmic meditation, or OM, as a key to women's well-being. She founded OneTaste in 2005 and grew it into a $12 million business with thousands of followers, including celebrity fans like Gwyneth Paltrow and Khloe Kardashian.",
      "But it all came crashing down after a 2018 Bloomberg article and the 2022 Netflix documentary \"Orgasm Inc.\" featured former employees  who said they were subjected to a toxic environment that included emotional and physical abuse.",
      "Daedone and Cherwitz were charged in a 2023 indictment that alleges they preyed on people who had been victims of previous trauma; forced One Taste members into debt by opening lines of credit to finance courses; subjected members to surveillance; had them sleep in communal homes and beds; and encouraged members to engage in sexual acts with investors and clients.",
      "Daedone dismissed the indictment as \"boilerplate.\"",
      "\"If you look at it, it is a cut and paste indictment,\" she said. \"At OneTaste, we were rooted 100% in consent. If I talk to you about the practice, from the very moment I would say to you, 'You can say yes or no,' and no is a perfectly acceptable answer throughout the practice itself. It\u2019s all based in consent. We had an ethics committee. ... This is the antithesis of what this company was.\"",
      "When asked about her former company being called a sex cult in the media and being compared to convicted\u00a0NXIVM\u00a0cult leader Keith Raniere, Daedone said she\u2019s not surprised.",
      "\u201cThe most honest thing I can say is, it makes sense to me on the one hand. And what I mean by that is, we do not have a culture that understands women\u2019s power, women\u2019s relationship to sexuality, women owning their desire,\u201d she said.",
      "Daedone sold the company, now called The Institute of OM, in 2017. She said she is not involved with the day-to-day running of the business but still teaches classes and lectures about orgasmic meditation.",
      "Daedone's attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, who also represents high- profile clients like Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby and R. Kelly, said that her client was swept up in the MeToo movement.",
      "\"I do not think anyone would be interested in what Nicole\u2019s life practice was, what OneTaste was doing, without the MeToo movement,\" Bonjean said. She added that she believes interest in Daedone \"was driven by media coverage that was not fair, that was not vetted, that was salacious, that was designed to rile people up.\"",
      "She also blames the Netflix documentary for the charges being filed.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake about it, without the tabloid sensational coverage, there would be no indictment. I will stand on that,\u201d she said.",
      "Netflix did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Although Bonjean would not reveal plans for the trial, she said they have a strong defense.",
      "\"Make no mistake about it, there are people who are saying, 'Huh, yeah, what I did was completely consensual, but now looking back, I think maybe I wasn\u2019t so happy, and maybe I really didn\u2019t want to do it,'\" Bonjean said. \"We have about 100 witnesses, frankly. And listen, the government has a select few people who have some type of sour grapes about things that went on, really in their own lives, frankly.\"",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, which brought the charges, declined to comment on the case.",
      "Daedone faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know that you can necessarily prepare\" for jail time, she said. \"I do know that I have the inner strength, resilience and, most importantly, what I have is a conviction of purpose.\"",

      "New Jersey\u2019s governor issued a drought warning Wednesday and said the state could implement mandatory water restrictions if conditions worsen.",
      "A record dry spell has led to the driest conditions New Jersey has had in nearly 120 years, prompting a staggering increase in the number of wildfires, state officials said at a news conference.",
      "The New Jersey Forest Fire Service has responded to 537 blazes since early October, which have burned thousands of acres, Gov. Phil Murphy said. That\u2019s 500 more fires than during the same period last year, he said.",
      "Murphy urged residents to take the drought warning seriously and reduce water use voluntarily.",
      "\u201cEvery one of us needs to do everything we can to conserve water,\u201d he said.",
      "Tim Eustace, executive director of the North Jersey District Water Supply Commission, said he thinks the state did not go far enough and should have declared a drought emergency, which generally comes with restrictions on nonessential outdoor water use.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always been opposed to using drinking water to water your lawns. It\u2019s a crazy waste of resources,\u201d Eustace said.",
      "His commission provides water to about one-third of New Jersey, and its main reservoir, the Wanaque Reservoir, was at 45% capacity Wednesday.",
      "The Manasquan Reservoir, another major one in the state, was at 51% of capacity, and the Passaic River \u2014 which supplies drinking water \u2014 was at about 14% of normal levels, though that\u2019s still enough to meet demand, officials said.",
      "New Jersey American Water, which serves about 2.9 million people in the state, issued a conservation notice to its customers Wednesday. The company described the notice as \u201cmandatory\u201d to convey urgency, but it does not have enforcement power over violators, said Mark McDonough, president of New Jersey American Water.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d like you to restrict yourselves if you can, but I don\u2019t have authority to issue tickets or go door to door asking people if they\u2019re watering their lawn,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cWe can have a tremendous impact if we get our customers focused on conserving water.\u201d",
      "Murphy said the winter forecast predicts more dry weather, though the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s seasonal outlook predicted above-average temperatures with equal chances of precipitation above or below average levels.",
      "The dry conditions plaguing New Jersey are part of a broader drought across the Northeast. In October, cities such as Newark, New Jersey; Wilmington, Delaware; and Norfolk, Virginia, recorded no rain at all, according to the Southeast Regional Climate Center, which collects precipitation data across the country. Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., set records for the number of consecutive days without measurable rainfall.",
      "In the U.S. overall, October was one of the driest months on record, according to NOAA. U.S. Drought Monitor data indicates that more than half of the continental U.S. is experiencing some level of drought, including 56% of the Northeast.",
      "In New Jersey, rain is usually distributed evenly over the months, state climatologist Dave Robinson said. But some areas have not received measurable rainfall in 40 days, the first time that has happened since records began about 150 years ago.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had longer droughts before, but in terms of just how exceptional the dry weather has been, we\u2019ve not seen something like this,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "He said New Jersey often gets a dose of heavy rain in October from the remnants of hurricanes or tropical storms or from Nor\u2019easters \u2014 low pressure systems that develop in the mid-Atlantic.",
      "This fall, \u201cwe were shut out\u201d for both, Robinson said. Instead, a ridge of high pressure has been parked over New Jersey and other parts of the Northeast for weeks.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a major storm to punch this ridge in the chest and knock it out. It\u2019s been more of a slow, exasperating process,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThere are some signs the center part of the country, which had been quite dry, is getting wetter. \u2026 It seems to be shifting slowly eastward.\u201d",
      "So far, November is New Jersey\u2019s 12th consecutive month with above-average temperatures. A warmer atmosphere can both worsen drought and increase the likelihood of extreme rainfall.",
      "\u201cWith a more energized, warmer climate system, you can hold more moisture in the atmosphere. \u2026 If you can\u2019t tap that moisture source, you\u2019ve got warmer conditions that can exacerbate drying and can lead to more drought,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThe system has become more variable.\u201d",
      "Given the persistent dry weather in New Jersey since mid-August, ending the drought conditions would require several months of at least average rainfall, if not substantially more, said Shawn LaTourette, the state\u2019s commissioner of environmental protection.",
      "About a quarter-inch of rain fell in some areas Sunday, but Murphy said that was \u201cnowhere near enough.\u201d",
      "New Jersey last declared a drought emergency in March 2002 and lifted it in January 2003. The state\u2019s last drought warning was in 2016, and it lasted more than half a year, LaTourette said.",
      "Greg McLaughlin, administrator of the New Jersey Forest Fire Service\u2019s office of forest and natural lands, said that on a scale that measures dryness of materials on the forest floor, conditions have reached 748 out of 800.",
      "\u201cThese numbers have never been seen by the Forest Fire Service in our 118-year history,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cThe impact of this dryness on wildfires cannot be overstated.\u201d",
      "The Jennings Creek Wildfire, along the New York-New Jersey border, continued to burn Wednesday and was about 30% contained. It has burned at least 5,000 acres across the two states. On Saturday, an 18-year-old New York Parks employee was killed by a falling tree while he was battling the fire in New York\u2019s Orange County.",
      "\u201cWe are incredibly grateful for his service and for his willingness to protect the people of both New York and New Jersey from these deadly fires,\u201d Murphy said."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, the Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was briefly detained after an interaction with police at Dulles International Airport near Washington, D.C., a spokesperson for the congressman told NBC News.",
      "The spokesperson said that McCaul was not arrested and was not threatening to anyone, but police approached him because he appeared to be drunk and needed help. McCaul was then able to phone a family member to pick him up from the airport to bring him back to Washington.",
      "A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority Police said that McCaul was charged with being drunk in public around 9 p.m. on Nov. 4 and released to a driver who picked him up.",
      "McCaul's spokesperson said the congressman, who is a nervous flyer, took the drug Ambien to help him sleep on a flight back home to Texas and inadvertently missed his flight.",
      "While he was working to rebook his flight, the Ambien, which he had mixed with several alcoholic drinks, made him disoriented and he locked himself out of his phone, the spokesperson said.",
      "That led to his encounter with police, who initially thought he was just drunk and detained him, the spokesperson said. After McCaul explained the situation, the police helped him to use one of their phones to call a family member who picked him up from the airport.",
      "The spokesperson said McCaul was respectful of police throughout the encounter.",
      "\u201cTwo weekends ago, I made a mistake \u2014 one for which I take full responsibility. I missed a flight to Texas and found myself disoriented in the airport. This was the result of a poor decision I made to mix an Ambien\u2014which I took in order to sleep on the upcoming flight\u2014with some alcohol,\" McCaul said in a statement to NBC News.",
      "He added, \u201cLaw enforcement officers briefly detained me while I waited for a family member to pick me up. I have nothing but respect and gratitude for the officers who intercepted me that evening. This incident does not reflect who I am and who I strive to be. As a human, I am not perfect. But I am determined to learn from this mistake and, God-willing, make myself a better person.\u201d",
      "McCaul oversees one of the most powerful committees in the House of Representatives and often travels around the world on behalf of the House speaker to meet with foreign leaders and dignitaries.",
      "Republicans have a term limit policy for chairs and ranking members of committees and McCaul is set to hit that limit at the end of his current term. In order for him to continue on as chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, he must seek and receive a waiver from the House Steering Committee, something McCaul has said he plans to request.",
      "McCaul was just easily re-elected to his 11th term in the House and previously served as chair of the House Homeland Security Committee.",

    "summary": "Children\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine nonprofit group founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., recorded a more than 30% drop in revenue last year, according to recent tax filings.",
    "story": [
      "After years of financial growth, Children\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine nonprofit group founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., recorded a more than 30% drop in revenue last year, to $16 million, according to recent tax filings.",
      "The pandemic boosted the profiles and pocketbooks of anti-vaccine organizations and activists, but none more than Children\u2019s Health Defense and Kennedy. The nonprofit doubled its revenue in 2020 to $6.8 million, then grew again to $16 million in 2021 and $23.5 million in 2022. Last year was the first substantial loss in the organization\u2019s history, of about $3 million, driven by a reduction in contributions, according to the filings.",
      "Children\u2019s Health Defense, which describes itself as a \u201cchild health protection and advocacy group,\u201d provided its tax filings to NBC News. Neither Children\u2019s Health Defense nor Kennedy, who could take on a public health role in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s new administration, responded to a request for comment.",
      "Amid unfounded fears over vaccines during the pandemic, Children\u2019s Health Defense expanded its reach beyond the parents of small children and grew beyond its website, which for years had been a hub for health misinformation. Along with growing chapters across the U.S., Canada and Europe, it now boasts an online TV network, a book publishing house and a movie studio.",
      "The decline in revenue coincides with one notable change within the group last year: the absence of its most prominent advocate. Kennedy had led Children\u2019s Health Defense since 2015, serving as both chairman and chief litigation counsel until April 2023, when the group announced he was going \u201con leave\u201d to run for president. Kennedy was always a long-shot candidate, running as a Democrat, then an independent, before dropping out to join the Trump campaign in August. Kennedy promoted his new allyship at rallies, urging his supporters to vote for Trump and \u201cMake America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "The spin on Trump\u2019s MAGA motto was quickly turned into a super PAC (MAHA Alliance) and a nonprofit organization (MAHA Action), both helmed by Del Bigtree, a former Kennedy campaign communications director and head of another anti-vaccine group, the Informed Consent Action Network.",
      "Kennedy is still on leave from Children\u2019s Health Defense and contributing to Trump\u2019s transition team, with speculation that he will officially join the White House, though whether in a Cabinet position, as a \u201cczar\u201d or some other way is unclear. Trump has said he will let Kennedy \u201cgo wild on health.\u201d",
      "The tax filings show that Children\u2019s Health Defense increased its spending on salaries in 2023, from $5.6 million in 2022 to $9.8 million in 2023. Kennedy was the highest-paid employee, earning $326,000 for his 15 weeks of work as chairman, more than half of his 2022 salary of $510,000.",
      "As noted by employees in recent videos celebrating Kennedy\u2019s potential role in the Trump administration, IRS rules prohibit nonprofits from directly or indirectly supporting political campaigns. Still, the Kennedy campaign and Children\u2019s Health Defense kept close ties. The nonprofit\u2019s CEO, Mary Holland, who earned $180,000 in 2023, also went on leave to serve as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s director of volunteers. Children\u2019s Health Defense employees were among the earliest campaign volunteers: selling Kennedy merchandise at rallies. A super PAC that raised $50 million supporting Kennedy was run by donors and former and current Children\u2019s Health Defense staff.",
      "While on leave, Kennedy has continued to participate in Children\u2019s Health Defense events. The tax filings show the group spent $138,000 on falconry in 2023; that November a donation contest winner reportedly won a day to \u201clearn the art of falconry\u201d with Kennedy. Kennedy was also the headliner for the group\u2019s annual convention last year, where he accepted the \u201cDefender Award,\u201d and was recognized for \u201ccourage and steadfast commitment to truth and liberty.\u201d",
      "While Children\u2019s Health Defense does not disclose individual donors, tax documents filed last year show several large donations from family foundations and donor-advised funds, a kind of philanthropic middleman, which in effect anonymizes donations. Over half a million dollars came from the Vanguard Charitable Endowment Program, a donor-advised fund. The William H. Donner Foundation, which describes itself as \u201ca family foundation that invests in creative solutions to critical problems,\u201d made two $100,000 donations, according to tax filings, specifically to fund lawsuits brought by Children\u2019s Health Defense.",
      "One of the lawsuits (dismissed by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals) alleged that the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s issuance of emergency use authorizations for Covid vaccines recommended to children violated parents\u2019 rights. The other donation funded the defense of a doctor, Meryl Nass, in a disciplinary case brought by a Maine medical board. The state suspended her license because of a failure to meet standards of care while treating Covid patients and spreading vaccine misinformation; Children\u2019s Health Defense livestreamed the proceedings.",
      "Even with the drop in funding, Children\u2019s Health Defense remains a force in the anti-vaccine movement, and Kennedy\u2019s new position in Trump\u2019s circle propels the mission.",
      "Giorgio Zeolla, the senior development officer, noted on the online show \u201cGood Morning CHD\u201d after the election last week that the organization expects to come under attack, \u201cbecause we are stronger than we\u2019ve ever been, because the opportunities are greater than they\u2019ve ever been.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody who doesn\u2019t realize that that opportunity is now there. It\u2019s ours to make something of it.\u201d"

    "summary": "Trump adviser Carlos Trujillo said that the incoming administration will likely have to expand its focus beyond Mexico and the Northern Triangle to stem migration.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump used different strategies to tackle the flow of migration to the U.S. during his first term, and that will increase in his second, according to an adviser to the incoming president and former administration official.",
      "\u201cThere will be a lot of emphasis on controlling the border and working with Central American and South American countries to do so,\u201d Carlos Trujillo, who was ambassador to the Organization of American States in the first Trump term, said in an interview.",
      "Border crossings hit record numbers in the first three years of the Biden administration after pandemic-era restrictions were lifted. Over the summer, the administration put in place strict asylum restrictions that led to an over 50% drop in the daily number of people encountered by Border Patrol, to the lowest level since 2020.",
      "When it comes to migration, \u201cyou have to negotiate with many, many countries. It\u2019s not just one or two,\u201d said Trujillo. \u201cBefore, we would focus on the Northern Triangle as well as Mexico. I think now the migratory flows are just so overwhelming that there are a lot more players in the human trafficking business.\u201d",
      "He said the administration will likely review many different options to achieve their goals.",
      "\"I think he\u2019s going to review whatever policies or opportunities help him accomplish that,\u201d said Trujillo. \u201cSome of the options might be economic options. Some of the options might be blockade options. Some of the options might be direct diplomacy. There are multiple options.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump threatened to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras \u2014 the Northern Triangle  \u2014 if they didn\u2019t stop their citizens from seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. He also signed the Asylum Cooperative Agreements with the three countries allowing U.S. immigration officials to send asylum-seekers back to those countries before applying for refuge in the U.S. The Biden administration ended those agreements but implemented other policies to restrict the flow of asylum-seekers, such as requiring asylum application through the CBP One app and the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela (CHNV) parole program.",
      "NBC News has reported that the Trump administration plans to end Biden's programs, possibly making those who have not yet received asylum eligible for deportation.",
      "Since then, Nicaragua has become a popular hub for migrants from Latin America and Africa trying to reach the U.S. They charge visa fees upon arrival and require them to leave within 96 hours.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they [Nicaragua] have a choice,\u201d said Trujillo. \u201cI don\u2019t think they can compromise our national security and our safety with impunity.\u201d",
      "Mexico",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, asylum-seekers were forced to wait out their asylum claims in Mexico. Then-President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador ceded to many of Trump\u2019s immigration demands. During this year\u2019s campaign, Trump vowed to place 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico unless they halted the flow of migrants as well as drugs to the U.S.",
      "Trujillo touted the Trump administration's threats of tariffs and a subsequent migration deal with Mexico, saying that \u201cit was a very effective strategy that has a track record of success.\"",
      "Mexico\u2019s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, was among the first world leaders to call Trump last week to congratulate him after the election. But it remains to be seen whether Sheinbaum will be as cooperative as L\u00f3pez Obrador was when it comes to the new Trump administration's demands.",
      "Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard recently suggested that his government could retaliate with its own tariffs on U.S. imports if the Trump administration imposes tariffs on Mexican exports.",
      "Venezuela",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, Venezuela was at the forefront of his  Latin America policy. He waged a campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d against President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and backed opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 in an effort to depose the authoritarian leader. Biden attempted to negotiate with Maduro to hold free and fair elections while offering some sanctions relief.  Despite these strategies, Maduro remains in power.",
      "Trump may focus more on migration than trying to democratize the government. Venezuelans account for a large portion of migrants coming to the U.S.",
      "\u201cI think the policy is going to be focused \u2014 I don\u2019t think exclusively, but strongly \u2014 on curbing illegal migration, especially from Venezuela,\" Trujillo said.",
      "Cuba",
      "Trump reversed many of Barack Obama\u2019s executive orders liberalizing trade and travel to Cuba, banning U.S. flights to most Cuban cities and limiting remittances. Just prior to leaving office, Trump designated Cuba a state sponsor of terrorism. Biden lifted the ban on flights and remittances and kept the rest intact.",
      "\u201cYou have to address Cuba\u2019s impact on migration across the region,\u201d said Trujillo, who is Cuban American.",
      "He also said there is going to be a lot more pressure on stopping \u201cacts of aggression in our hemisphere, especially directed at the United States\u201d from China and Russia.",
      "There have been reports that Beijing and Havana have discussed a new joint military training facility on the island. The Biden administration has said that China has had a listening post in Cuba for years, something the Cuban government denies. And over the summer Russian warships docked in the port of Havana for several days as a show of strength.",
      "Cuba has been reeling from near catastrophic conditions. An economic crisis caused by their state-dominated economic model, decades-old sanctions which were tightened by the Trump administration and the effects of the pandemic on tourism have resulted in shortages of food, medicine and fuel. The island was recently hit by two hurricanes, an earthquake and major power grid failures that left the entire island in the dark.",
      "Some countries rushed to help Cuba. Mexico sent nearly half a million barrels of crude oil and diesel in a matter of days. Russia pledged to send more. The United Nations and European Union sent 94 tons of aid, while Venezuela sent an additional 300 tons.",
      "At a recent news briefing, Sheinbaum said, \u201cWe are going to support Cuba. ... Even if they criticize it, we are going to show solidarity.\u201d",
      "By contrast, Trujillo touted Trump's hard-line stance. \u201cIf you look at what\u2019s happened in Cuba, the complete collapse of their economy was all driven by the pressure that President Trump implemented. I thought it was a much better policy than just acquiescing to the Cuban Communist Party.\u201d"

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 10:01:41 GMT",
    "summary": "The New York Yankees slugger is expected to sign a deal north of $600 million that will come close to the real-dollar value of Shohei Ohtani's $700 million pact.",
    "story": [
      "By Opening Day 2025, one Major League Baseball team will have superstar slugger Juan Soto in tow, threatening to fill up box scores with home runs and RBIs \u2014 all while adding a series of zeros to his checking account.",
      "Soto, 26, is hands down this winter\u2019s most highly sought-after free agent, valued as much for his elite baseball skills as for his birth date.",
      "And his workplace choice could very well tip the balance of MLB power for years.",
      "If he stays with the Yankees, the defending American League champions, or ventures to Los Angeles to join the World Series-winning Dodgers, Soto might\u00a0cement those big-market, star-laden clubs as perennial October players.",
      "He could also\u00a0land with recent playoff contenders like the New York Mets or his onetime employer the San Diego Padres and push them closer to the very top.",
      "Or he might opt for a larger club desperately seeking to regain relevance, such as the Boston Red Sox, the Toronto Blue Jays or the San Francisco Giants.",
      "Soto blasted a career-high 41 home runs this season to go along with 109 RBIs, fourth and sixth most, respectively, in those two traditional MLB categories.",
      "He is also one of the most disciplined and patient hitters in baseball, drawing walks in 18.1% of his plate appearances, compared with the overall MLB rate of 8.4%, in 2024. And in an age of swing-for-the-fences baseball, Soto struck out just 16.7% of the time, while the league whiffed at a 22.2% clip this season.",
      "The stars are aligned for a \"long, massive bid out\" among baseball's richest clubs, MLB Network analyst and former pitcher Al Leiter said.",
      "\"Can you imagine how perfect the world is when you have the Mets, Yankees, Red Sox and Blue Jays all vying for your client's services?\" Leiter said Tuesday. \"Yeah, thank you, thank you universe.\"",
      "It\u2019s expected that the Soto Sweepstakes will be won by a club shelling out at least $600 million over 10 years.",
      "Such a contract would, at first glance, fall short of the 10-year, $700 million deal that took worldwide superstar Shohei Ohtani across Southern California to the Los Angeles Dodgers. But Soto\u2019s new agreement, even if it comes in south of the $700 million mark, could be considered equal to or greater than Ohtani\u2019s.",
      "That\u2019s because Ohtani, the Dodgers DH and pitcher, is making a paltry $2 million per season over the next 10 years.\u00a0He will make $68 million annually in deferred payments in years 11 through 20, however, greatly diminishing his actual take-home pay.",
      "Soto, represented by hard-driving super agent Scott Boras, has shown no indication of offering charity to his new employer like Ohtani did.",
      "Free agency is \u201cgoing to be exciting,\u201d Soto told reporters moments after the Yankees lost Game 5 of the World Series, ending the baseball season. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a good experience. I think every player in the big league wants to experience this. So it\u2019s exciting to see how it\u2019s going to be.\u201d",
      "Soto just turned 26 late last month, putting him in prime-of-his-career position to cash in on the open market.",
      "Players have to log six years of MLB service time before they are allowed to fully test free agency. Those half-dozen years of club control, at less-than-free-market salaries, act as a slight disincentive to sign free agents who might be approaching or already past their athletic peaks at around age 30.",
      "Ohtani, 30, is the odds-on favorite to be named NL MVP, while Soto's New York teammate Aaron Judge, 32, is expected to be the AL's top honoree.",
      "Teams that do sign high-priced older free agents go into it knowing they'll be overpaying for aging, less-than-productive stars on the back end. If Soto remains healthy, though, he should have several more monster seasons that could take the sting out of any late-career slide.",
      "More from Sports",
      "Shane Waldron fired as Chicago Bears' offensive coordinator as team struggles The Jets fired their coach to save their season. Except he wasn't the problem. The Super Bowl contender hiding in plain sight",
      "Shane Waldron fired as Chicago Bears' offensive coordinator as team struggles",
      "The Jets fired their coach to save their season. Except he wasn't the problem.",
      "The Super Bowl contender hiding in plain sight",
      "Philadelphia Phillies star Bryce Harper signed a 13-year, $330 million contract in early 2019 in what was a record deal at the time. The Phillies paid him a premium because he was just 26.",
      "Harper, now 32 and entering his seventh season in South Philly, is still one of baseball's elite performers. He hit 30 home runs last year and had a Wins Above Replacement (WAR) value of 5.2, 20th best among 1,454 MLB players, according to FanGraphs.",
      "Soto, who went to the Yankees from San Diego in a trade 11 months ago, said he has enjoyed playing in New York, but he stopped well short of committing to the Big Apple.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really happy with the city, with the team, but at the end of the day we will see,\u201d he said.",
      "And this season proved what should be obvious: Large payrolls are a near-necessity for success.",
      "The AL champion Yankees had the second-highest MLB payroll, at $309.8 million for their 40-man roster, according to Baseball Prospectus.",
      "The NL runners-up Mets were No. 1 at $341.8 million, while the World Series champion Dodgers spent $288.8 million with a deceptively low No. 3 ranking because of Ohtani's sweetheart deal.",
      "The Cleveland Guardians were MLB's only low-spending final four team, with the No. 23 payroll of $106.2 million.",
      "There's no telling when Soto or other any free agents will come to terms with their 2025 teams.",
      "The Dodgers announced their signing of Ohtani on Dec. 11, while the San Francisco Giants didn't pick up Cy Young Award-winning pitcher Blake Snell until March 19, less than two weeks before Opening Day.",
      "And who makes Soto's announcement holds even more intrigue.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to look at every situation, every offer that we get,\" Soto said. \"I don\u2019t know what teams want to come after me, but definitely I\u2019ll be open to listen to every single team. I don\u2019t have any doors closed or anything like that, so we\u2019re going to be available for all 30 teams.\u201d"

      "The \"Fuller House\" star, who famously played Uncle Joey, noticed his first symptoms a little over a month ago, when he came down with a cold. In the past, he'd noticed the lymph nodes in his neck or armpits would swell when he was sick. This time, though, he felt surprised to discover a golf-ball sized lump in his groin within a week of falling ill.",
      "\u201cIt swelled up immediately,\" Coulier, 65, tells TODAY.com in a phone interview. \u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m either really sick, or my body\u2019s really reacting to something.\u2019\u201d",
      "Worried, he visited his doctors who ran a variety of tests, including bloodwork, EKG, and PET and CT scans. While everything appeared to be normal, the doctors biopsied the lymph node just to be safe. Coulier soon learned why his lymph node became so enlarged.",
      "\u201c(My doctors) said, \u2018Hey, we wish we had better news, but you have non-Hodgkin lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma,\u2019\u201d Coulier recalls. \u201cIt was a shock.\u201d",

      "Coulier visited his doctor, who ordered a battery of tests.",
      "\u201cThey said, \u2018Yeah, we need to take a serious look at this.\u2019 And so, we did blood tests,\u201d he says. \u201cBlood tests came back great. My EKG, everything great. Heart, everything perfect.\u201d",
      "But his doctors felt worried by how quickly the lump grew and ordered more advanced imaging before eventually wanting a sample of it for testing.",
      "\u201c\u2018We\u2019d like to either remove this or biopsy it,\u2019\u201d Coulier recalls his doctors telling him. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t we just remove it and biopsy it at the same time?\u2019\u201d",
      "Three days later, Coulier received the news from his doctor that he had B-cell lymphoma, a type of cancer that develops in B-lymphocytes, according to the American Cancer Society. B-cell lymphomas account for the vast majority of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Every year, more than 80,000 Americans are diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.",
      "\u201cThe first thing I said to them was, \u2018Wait a minute \u2014 cancer?\u2019\u201d he Coulier. \u201c(I was) feeling like I got punched in the stomach because it never happens to you. You always hear about it happening to someone else.\u201d",

      "\u201cI was just contemplating, \u2018How do I tell her?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I told her, of course, she thought I was joking.\u201d",
      "After he reassured her that he was not joking, Melissa \u201corganized (his) entire life, from nutrition to the doctor\u2019s appointments to the pills.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s got stuff color-coded,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty great.\u201d",

      "Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma means the cancer has not spread outside the lymphatic system, according to the American Cancer Society. The five-year survival rate for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has not spread widely is about 74%, per ACS.",
      "\u201c(Stage 3) doesn\u2019t sound great,\" Coulier says, but because it hasn't spread to his bone marrow, doctors told him his curability rate is upwards of 90%.",
      "\"It's very treatable,\" he said on TODAY.",
      "Starting chemotherapy",
      "Doctors wanted Coulier to start chemotherapy promptly, and he underwent another surgery to have his chemotherapy port, which delivers the medication, placed.",
      "Leading up to his first treatment, Coulier faced his fear of the unknowns of cancer.",
      "\u201cYou hear chemo, and it scares the daylights out of you,\u201d he says. \u201cThe first round was pretty intense because you don\u2019t know what to expect. You don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to feel. Is this going to hit me immediately? Is it going to be devastating? Am I going to walk out of here?\u201d",
      "He felt better than expected after his first round of chemotherapy. In total, he\u2019ll have six rounds every 21 days and should be finished with treatment by February 2025. Following treatment, he expects a \u201ctotal remission.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a bit of a roller coaster. There (are) days where I feel unbelievable,\u201d he says. \u201cThen there\u2019s other days where \u2026 I\u2019m just going to lay down and let this be what it\u2019s going to be.\u201d",
      "Still he's been able to maintain a positive outlook as he navigates treatment.",
      "\u201cThis is a journey,\u201d Coulier told Hoda. \u201cThis is a bit of a battle and you\u2019re going to need to be on your game.\u201d",
      "When Coulier feels good, he takes advantage of it. He\u2019s been recording episodes of the podcast \u201cFull House Rewind\u201d with his new co-host Marla Sokoloff, who played Gia Mahan on \u201cFull House\u201d and \u201cFuller House.\u201d And he recently skated with the Detroit Red Wings alumni \u2014 though he can\u2019t play hockey as it could damage his chemotherapy port. At the end of this week, John Stamos will visit him following his second round of chemotherapy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have so many laughs. We\u2019re going to have so much fun,\u201d Coulier says. \u201cI said, \u2018It could be \u2018Weekend at Bernie\u2019s\u2019 if I\u2019m just out of it.\u2019 And (Stamos) said, \u2018That\u2019s OK. I\u2019ll carry you around.\u2019\u201d",
      "Coulier feels grateful for his \u201cincredible wife\u201d and \u201cincredible friends\u201d supporting him through his cancer diagnosis and treatment.",
      "\u201cThey all rallied around this, and a couple of comments that I\u2019ve heard are, \u2018Dave, you\u2019re not letting us worry about this very much,\u2019\u201d Coulier says. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to. I want us to have happy times and we\u2019ll get through this.\u201d",
      "Raising awareness",
      "Sadly, Coulier has plenty of experience with cancer.",
      "\u201cI lost my sister Sharon at 36 years old, breast cancer. I lost my niece Shannon at 29 years old, breast cancer,\u201d he says. \u201cI lost my mom, and now my sister Karen has cancer. So, over the years I\u2019ve seen what the women in my family have gone through, and it\u2019s been not only an awakening but a learning process.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s been tough watching cancer affect his family so dramatically, the actor has grown from it.",
      "\u201cWhen I was diagnosed, all of those memories came back of what they went through and so many hospital visits and sitting bedside and talking and having conversations and watching them leave the planet,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat they went through is 10 times harder than what I\u2019m going through. So, if I can be one-tenth as strong as they were, I\u2019m going to be fine.\u201d",
      "His family also taught him to embrace joy, and that has helped him maintain a positive outlook.",
      "\u201cMy mom, my sister and my niece were laughing until the day they died,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a real inspiration for me to just remember that there\u2019s a lot of happiness.\u201d",
      "Coulier\u2019s looking forward to the future. His son, Luc, and his wife, Alex, are expecting a baby boy in March, and Coulier\u2019s excited to become a grandfather and anticipates lots of flights from Michigan to Los Angeles to spend time with his family.",
      "Coulier felt compelled to share his story to raise awareness of cancer and encourage others to undergo screening for it.",
      "\u201cThe one thing that just kept presenting itself to me was to tell other people about it. Talk to them about getting something as simple as pre-screening or a breast exam, mammogram, a colonoscopy or a prostate exam,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a really simple thing to do and it can add years to your life.\u201d"

    "summary": "As part of performing on TODAY's Citi Concert Series, Grammy winner Keith Urban sits down to answer eight questions for TODAY's \"8 Before 8\" original series.",
    "story": [
      "Despite the chilly weather, Keith Urban brought a dose of Australian sunshine to the TODAY plaza.",
      "Just days after his 57th birthday, Urban visited TODAY on Oct. 30 to close out the Citi Concert Series with a high-energy set filled with guitar solos, new hits and crowd-pleasing classics.",
      "Since he moved to Nashville in 1992 to pursue his country music dreams, Urban has released hit albums like clockwork, and he isn't slowing down anytime soon.",
      "His 11th studio album, \u201cHigh,\u201d came out Sept. 20, and in December, Urban will embark on a tour that spans from Las Vegas to South Australia.",
      "The road to his latest album wasn't entirely straightforward: Urban wrote an album titled \"615\" before shelving the project and going back to the drawing board for \"High.\"",
      "When asked by TODAY.com why he chose to scrap \"615,\" his answer is simple: \"I didn't like it.\"",
      "In contrast to the more somber tone of \u201c615,\u201d Urban describes his new music on \"High\" as \u201ceuphoric.\"",
      "The album's title has a variety of interpretations, but Urban links it to the energy he feels when performing onstage.",
      "\"Playing live is such a high for me,\" Urban told the TODAY co-hosts. \"Even out on the plaza this morning \u2014 it was amazing energy.\"",
      "Onstage at the plaza, his enthusiasm was contagious.",
      "\u201cAll right, let\u2019s play a little!\u201d he said to the crowd, eliciting cheers.",
      "His four-song set on TODAY had something for every fan, including the upbeat tune \"Chuck Taylors,\" soulful ballad \"Messed Up As Me,\" and one of his greatest hits \u2014 \u201cSomewhere In My Car.\u201d",
      "Offstage, Urban is equally as known for his charm as he is for his performing prowess. Savannah Guthrie called him one of the \u201cbest, nicest, coolest guests that we have\u201d during the singer's spot on the show.",
      "Urban maintained his good humor throughout a series of early morning interview questions for TODAY\u2019s original video series \u201c8 before 8.\"",
      "Here's what Urban had to say about his latest album, his personal guitar heroes and his favorite Australian animal.",
      "What inspired you to title your new album \"High\"?",
      "I called the latest album \u201cHigh\u201d because it was a good, strong, simple, euphoric word that has a lot of interpretations, which I also liked. Everybody gets to that place differently, but it\u2019s definitely the destination, and the record has a feeling of euphoria.",
      "Do you see yourself releasing any of the scrapped songs from \u201c615\u201d in the future?",
      "So, I made an album called \u201c615,\u201d and there were four songs that I took off that record which made it onto \u201cHigh.\u201d The rest of them, right now, they\u2019re out in the front yard, up on blocks with grass growing around them. So we\u2019ll see what happens.",
      "Who would you put on your Mount Rushmore of guitarists?",
      "Well, first of all, I\u2019m going to need more than four faces, probably. (Jimi) Hendrix, No. 1 for sure. No. 2 is always hotly contested: Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Angus Young. I could go on and on. It\u2019s too many, way too many.",
      "Where is the most unusual place you've performed?",
      "The most unusual place I\u2019ve performed? On the baggage carousel at an airport on the little carpeted strip in between where the bags go around. Yeah, totally humiliating.",
      "What\u2019s your most fun song to perform onstage?",
      "All of them, because I feel really grateful that I don\u2019t have to do a song that I don\u2019t like. I feel really, really lucky that that\u2019s happened to me: to have such a long career and have certain songs like \u201cBlue Ain\u2019t Your Color,\u201d or \u201cSomebody Like You,\u201d or some of these songs, that I couldn\u2019t not do them. But I love them just as much as I did when I recorded them.",
      "When did your iconic hairstyle become part of your look?",
      "I've never decided to make hair a part of my look. God bless my mom. I got my mom\u2019s hair, and my dad really didn\u2019t have much, and I\u2019m grateful that I got her gene. Go, mom.",
      "From LL Cool J: How have you maintained your long career?",
      "That's a great question. First of all, right back at you, dude \u2014\u00a0been around a long time, high level. Same answer you\u2019d probably have: passion, hunger, curiosity.",
      "I love playing music just as much as I did when I was sitting in my bedroom at 6 years old learning to play guitar. I don\u2019t feel any different. I\u2019m just as excited to write the next song, put on the next tour, make another album \u2014 like, literally giddy with excitement to do that. That\u2019s never changed. And that could have worked or not worked, as far as staying relevant or being able to have songs that connect. I\u2019ve just been really blessed and lucky, and the harder I\u2019ve worked, the luckier I\u2019ve become.",
      "Rapid fire round:",
      "There\u2019s too many! I do love In-N-Out. I do love Chick-fil-A. ... I'm going to say In-N-Out is my favorite. Yeah, period.",
      "Oh, Sydney summer. Nashville winters are brutal. January is like Monday. February is like Tuesday. March is like a Wednesday. And slowly, as you can see, you\u2019re getting towards the weekend in Nashville, and the summer is like Friday, Saturday, Sunday \u2014 perfect.",
      "Electrifying.",
      "A wombat! I love wombats."

    "story": [
      "David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson acknowledged there was \"a lot of tension\" between them on \"The X-Files\" that resulted in the co-stars not speaking for weeks off camera while working on the hit show.",
      "Anderson, 56, spoke to Duchovny, 64, on the Nov. 12 episode of his \"Fail Better\" podcast, with the two revisiting their time together on the hit Fox show that ran from 1993-2002, spawned two movies, and revivals in 2016 and 2018. Duchovny played FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder, and Anderson played his partner, Special Agent Dana Scully, in the science fiction series about unsolved cases involving the paranormal.",
      "Anderson said she came on Duchovny's podcast to have \"a conversation that I don't feel like we ever had,\" which led to him reflecting on shooting the show together during the height of its popularity in the '90s.",
      "\"The part of this conversation that is the trickiest part for me is, I guess I would talk about like my failure of friendship, or my failure of companionship,\" Duchovny said.",
      "\"There was a long time working on the show where we were just not even dealing with one another off camera,\" he added. \"And there was a lot of tension, which didn\u2019t matter, apparently, for the work, because we\u2019re both f------ crazy, I guess, that we could just go out there and do what we needed to do.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s crazy that we were able to present on camera the various feelings and emotions and attraction and all that kind of stuff, but then not speak to each other for weeks at a time or whatever,\" Anderson said.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know, but I could have handled myself better,\" Duchovny said.",
      "Duchovny also opened up about leaving the show in the early 2000s and his emotions after Anderson left \"The X-Files\" following its revival in 2018.",
      "\"I never apologized to you for that,\" he told Anderson about his original departure from the show. \"I don\u2019t know that I even talked to you about it, and then you said you weren\u2019t going to do the show anymore, like, the last time we did it (in 2018). And I know that hurt my feelings.\"",
      "\"Oh, I didn't know,\" Anderson said.",
      "\"I get it, you know, like, OK, and I support it, whatever it is you want to do, but I was like, 'Oh, she\u2019s quitting me,' you know?\" Duchovny said. \"She doesn\u2019t like working with me anymore. It was like, that little kid inside is going, 'Hey!' And then I was like, but I didn\u2019t say anything to her back in the day.\"",
      "Later in their conversation, Anderson returned to the moment Duchovny left in 2001.",
      "\"We never talked about it,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t think I ever blamed you. ... I don\u2019t think I blamed you at all. I don\u2019t think I was upset.\"",
      "\"Well, thanks a lot,\" Duchovny said.",
      "After Duchovny departed, Anderson considered following him out the door.",
      "\"There was a point, I mean, for me at that time, it was, 'Can I too?'\" she said. \"At first I thought, 'Well, then we\u2019re both going to because clearly I can\u2019t go on without him, so surely I\u2019ll be able to.' And then they started talking about, 'Well, if you stay on, you can actually make some good money.'\"",
      "Duchovny also recalled a \"dysfunctional\" moment between the two in the midst of their stardom on the show.",
      "\"It was some Emmys, and it was the day after, and I had a private plane, and I was giving you a ride,\" he said. \"And you were late, and I was so angry. And then we sat on this private plane, flying to Vancouver from LA, not talking.",
      "\"And you wrote me a letter,\" he continued. \"So you\u2019re just like 6 feet away from me, writing a letter to me, and it\u2019s a beautiful letter. I don\u2019t remember it exactly, but it was appreciative, and it was like it was all the things that I wanted to hear. But it\u2019s just amazing that we couldn\u2019t just have that conversation. The fact that it\u2019s a private plane, it\u2019s just all ridiculous.\"",
      "\"I had no memory that we were even on a private plane together, let alone, yeah, I wrote you a letter on one,\" Anderson said. \"Interesting.\"",
      "Duchovny also remembered a moment with \"The X-Files\" creator Chris Carter amid some tension in the first season.",
      "\"I think we were kind of butting heads so early on in the first season that Chris asked us if we would go into fake couples (therapy). Like, would we go into TV character couple therapy? I remember sitting in his office with you, and Chris is like, 'Yeah, do you guys want to go into therapy.' And I was like, 'You mean as Mulder and Scully?' I\u2019m confused. I remember that.\"",
      "Another source of strife came in 2016 when Anderson fought for pay equity with Duchovny for the revival of the show. She told The Daily Beast at the time that she was only offered half the salary of Duchovny for the 2016 return and had spent three years during the original run of \"The X-Files\" trying to achieve pay equity with her co-star.",
      "\"That whole pay equity thing, that\u2019s in our past as well,\" Duchovny said. \"I was part of that.",
      "\"Selfishly, back then, I thought I was like being attacked,\" he continued. \"I thought, 'Oh, I\u2019m being attacked for being offered more money.'\"",
      "\"Attacked by who?\" Anderson asked.",
      "\"The world,\" Duchovny said.",
      "\"What, that they blamed you in some way?\" Anderson said.",
      "\"In a way,\" Duchovny said.",
      "\"Oh really, I didn\u2019t know that,\" Anderson said. \"I'm sorry. That's interesting that I wasn't paying attention to that side of it.\"",
      "\"Well, I didn't make you pay attention to it,\" Duchovny said.",
      "During their talk, the two also delved into Anderson's childhood and latest ventures, including her new book, \"Want,\" a collection of anonymous sexual fantasies submitted by women from around the world."

The special dolls were based on beloved characters, like Grande\u2019s Glinda, and the back of the packaging encouraged consumers to visit the film\u2019s website to learn more.",
      "But, a labeling error on the packaging directed fans to an adult film website instead of the official \u201cWicked\u201d movie link, www.wickedmovie.com.",
      "The dolls in the incorrect packaging have been pulled from Target's and Walmart's online storefronts and taken down from Amazon's site as of Nov. 11, according to CNBC.",
      "The mistake was pointed out by multiple social media users. X user Sarah Genao tweeted a picture of the Glinda doll Nov. 9 and included a photo of the incorrect link to the pornography site on the back of the box.\u00a0The post went viral, receiving over 21 million views.",
      "TODAY.com confirmed at a Target in Connecticut that the \u201cWicked\u201d dolls sold there were mislabeled.",
      "TODAY.com reached out to Target for comment but did not immediately hear back.",
      "Dolls in the mislabeled packaging have flooded eBay, with sellers seeking hundreds of dollars for the items. The dolls normally sell for between $20 and $40 depending on the accessories.",
      "In a statement to TODAY.com on Nov. 10, Mattel confirmed the mislabeling. The toy company said it \u201cwas made aware of a misprint on the packaging of the Mattel Wicked collection dolls, primarily sold in the U.S., which intended to direct consumers to the official WickedMovie.com landing page.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe deeply regret this unfortunate error and are taking immediate action to remedy this,\u201d Mattel said.",
      "The company also included a message to parents who have already purchased the item.",
      "\u201cParents are advised that the misprinted, incorrect website is not appropriate for children. Consumers who already have the product are advised to discard the product packaging or obscure the link and may contact Mattel Customer Service for further information,\u201d Mattel said in the statement.",
      "The packaging issue surfaced less than two weeks before the highly anticipated film hits theaters on Nov. 22.",
      "Grande, Erivo, Bailey and more stars from the Universal Pictures movie, including Michelle Yeoh, Ethan Slater and Jeff Goldblum, recently attended the Nov. 9 \u201cWicked\u201d premiere in Los Angeles.\u00a0Director Jon M. Chu\u00a0missed the premiere to be by his wife\u2019s side as they welcomed a baby girl, their fifth child.",

      "After nearly a two year hiatus, Paramount+'s riveting Western series, \u201cYellowstone,\u201d finally returns to give its dramatic conclusion.",
      "The popular Paramount+ show has captured audiences since 2018 with the ups and downs of the Dutton family, the owners of Montana's Yellowstone Dutton Ranch \u2014 the largest ranch in the United States.",
      "Six years later, \u201cYellowstone\u201d is set to air its final episodes, but without the show's favorite land magnate, John Dutton, played by Kevin Costner. His last appearance on the show was during the first part of Season 5, which\u00a0was released in 2022.",
      "After reports emerged of scheduling issues and drama between Costner and \u201cYellowstone\u201d creator Taylor Sheridan, Costner confirmed in a June Instagram video that he would not be returning to the show.",
      "So what happens to his John Dutton character, and will Costner make an appearance in Season 5, Part 2 of \u201cYellowstone\u201d?",
      "Read on to learn what happens in the Season 5, Part 2's premiere episode of \u201cYellowstone\u201d and how the show writes off Costner's character of John Dutton.",
      "What happens in first episode of Season 5, Part 2 of 'Yellowstone'?",
      "The first episode finds viewers in the middle of major drama as emergency services and caution tape surround John Dutton\u2019s mansion. As Beth Dutton (Kelly Reilly) runs to the house with Kayce Dutton (Luke Grimes) not far behind her, it becomes imminently clear that something is wrong with their father.",
      "As the siblings enter the home, viewers find that Governor Dutton has supposedly died by suicide. Beth immediately accuses Jamie (Wes Bentley) of having killed their father. While this opener is a jarring way to start off the second half of Season 5 \u2014 the episode quickly pivots to another scene.",
      "Viewers are now taken back to six weeks prior to Dutton's death as they follow Beth, Kayce, and their families in the days leading up to the tragedy. During the episode, time jumps back and forth between what led up to John Dutton\u2019s death and its aftermath.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Wendy Moniz, who plays Governor Lynelle Perry, says she believes the series handled John Dutton's storyline \"beautifully.\"",
      "\"What I know of the story telling \u2014 because it was redacted and we only know certain parts \u2014 is brilliant, because Taylor's [Sheridan] writing is that,\" she said.",
      "She added that \"the story that he had from the beginning is the story that he wanted to tell.\"",
      "Is Kevin Costner involved in Season 5, Part 2 of 'Yellowstone'?",
      "Despite his character being a central figure in the episode \u2014 we never actually see Costner. When Beth and Kayce enter the gruesome scene where John Dutton was believed to have shot himself, the audience only sees a limp hand, and a pool of blood.",
      "How do they write off Kevin Costner\u2019s character in 'Yellowstone'?",
      "As the first episode unravels, viewers quickly learn that John Dutton's death was not in fact suicide. Rather, it was a murder-for-hire scheme set forth by Sarah Atwood (Dawn Olivieri) who was in cahoots with Jamie Dutton. Sarah, a lawyer who has been an issue for John in previous episodes, says that she and Jamie agreed on the plan, but Jamie says he wasn't on board.",
      "While  John Dutton\u2019s death is made clear in the first few minutes of the episode \u2014 viewers soon learn that his presence still looms in the minds of the Dutton family.",
      "But, will we see actor Kevin Costner is one last scene? That is yet to be determined.",
      "Is this really the end for 'Yellowstone'?",
      "Paramount+ confirmed that this would be the final season for the Dutton family \u2014 but fans, and some of the show's stars, think that there could be room for more.",
      "When asked if this was the last season for \"Yellowstone\" by TODAY.com, Ian Bohen, who plays Ryan, a Dutton family ranch hand, teases \"it may not\" be the end.",
      "\"I feel satisfied, and very happy with what we've done. You know stories can't go on forever,\" he says. \"We're going to position it to have some sort of conclusion in some of the relationships and this and that. But not necessarily over.\"",
      "What are the 'Yellowstone' spinoffs?",
      "The expanding \"Yellowstone\" universe already has two popular spinoffs within the franchise and more on the way. The various shows travel throughout time, chronicling the same family over the course of hundreds of years.",
      "This prequel was packed with star power, including country stars Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, and actor Sam Elliot. The show traveled back in time to chronicle how the Dutton family first settled in Montana.",
      "Oscar winner Helen Mirren and legendary actor Harrison Ford led the cast of this prequel, which showed the next generation of Dutton family. Season 2 is currently in production.",
      "Another prequel series, this \"1944\" edition is greenlit for production. Further details, including a release date, are unknown.",
      "Formerly titled \"2024,\" this series will star Michelle Pfeiffer, and is set to follow the story of a New York family that moves to Montana. Currently, we don't know how the story will intertwine with the current characters of the Yellowstone universe.",
      "Another series featured in the \"Yellowstone\" universe is \"6666,\" pronounced \"Four Sixes,\" based on the real Four Sixes ranch in Texas, which Sheridan now himself owns.",
      "This spinoff will follow storylines on that ranch, however as of June that series was on hold. Sheridan told The Hollywood Reporter that because it's a real ranch with real families, it needs a \"unique level of special care.\""

    "story": [
      "PARIS \u2014 Demonstrations of a few dozen to several hundred people erupted at multiple locations across Paris on Wednesday night to protest a pro-Israel gala that had included Israel\u2019s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich as the evening\u2019s featured speaker.",
      "Smotrich canceled his trip to France to speak at the gala, a spokesperson for his party, Tzionot Datit, or Religious Zionism, told NBC News.",
      "In the streets near Paris\u2019 Saint Lazare station, dozens of demonstrators had gathered waving Palestinian flags and lighting flares.",
      "By about 8 p.m., tear gas appeared to have been deployed against the crowd, with police in shields and riot gear pushing up against the protesters.",
      "Smotrich is known for his incendiary statements and lives in a settlement in the occupied West Bank. On Monday he sparked widespread outrage after publicly suggesting Israel could look to\u00a0annex the West Bank next year, with Donald Trump expected to take office in January.",
      "He has also publicly spoken at events advocating for the resettlement of Gaza once Israel\u2019s offensive in the enclave comes to an end, and has also been widely criticized for his anti-Arab comments, including suggestions that Palestinians \u201cvoluntarily\u201d emigrate from the territories and that Arabs and Jews use separate maternity wards.",
      "About two miles away, at Place de la R\u00e9publique, another couple hundred people were gathered. Palestinian and Lebanese flags were raised as people chanted \u201cFree Palestine\u201d in a chorus led by three demonstrators who had climbed the Monument \u00e0 la R\u00e9publique.",
      "Police vehicles barricaded the streets surrounding the monument, with a flashing sea of blue lights nearby.",
      "Among the protesters was Ramy Shaath, 53, a political activist and co-founder of the French organization, Urgence Palestine. He said plans to host a gala in Paris with Smotrich, whom he called \u201cone of the worst terrorists in the world,\u201d felt \u201ctoo flagrant \u2014 and it will not pass.\u201d",
      "Ellen Groves, 43, who is Irish and British but has lived in Paris for 20 years, said she quit her job as a copywriter after the war started to focus on speaking out about the plight of Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "\u201cI just cannot believe we live in a world where we kill children every day for 14 months and that we would knowingly bomb a trapped population,\u201d she said, calling the war \u201ca genocide of children in front of the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe violence we are being made to witness is the ultimate terrorism,\u201d Groves said.",
      "Another protest organized by Collectif Golem, a group that describes itself as a leftist Jewish movement seeking to raise awareness on antisemitism, was attended by another few dozen people, and about as many police officers.",
      "Anna Gallet, who is studying for her master's degree in economic, social and ecological transition, said Smotrich\u2019s invitation was tantamount to incitement.",
      "\u201cWe think speech about a lot of hate and incitement of hate should not have a place like that here,\u201d said the 22-year-old from Montpellier, in the south of France. \u201cWe are for Jewish, Arab, Muslim people. We want peace for everyone.\u201d",
      "That protest ended about an hour after it began, with organizers saying local authorities shut the event down.",
      "French human rights organizations denounced the event, whose location was not publicly disclosed, in an open letter issued last week, calling it a \u201crevolting gala.\u201d Holding it in Paris constitutes \u201can insult to international law and a mark of contempt\u201d for the United Nations, the letter added, citing the ruling by the International Court of Justice, that included calling on Israel to prevent acts of \u201cgenocide\u201d in Gaza.",
      "The gala was organized by a French charity called \u201cIsrael is Forever.\u201d According to France 24, the group\u2019s leader, French-Israeli lawyer Nili Kupfer-Naouri, has said she believes no one in Gaza is \u201cinnocent\u201d and has been accused of participating in an attempt to block the entry of humanitarian aid into the enclave. She has spoken publicly about the need to \u201craze Gaza,\u201d and \u201cthe mass immigration of the Arabs\u201d from the land.",
      "According to Israel is Forever\u2019s flier, the gala was meant to celebrate the \u201cpower and history of Israel,\u201d as the country has faced mounting international backlash and isolation over its deadly war in Gaza, which was launched following Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 terror attacks on Israel, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 others taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "In Gaza, more than 43,000 people have been killed, and over 100,000 injured, according to local health officials. The U.N. said over the weekend that women and children accounted for around 70% of those who have been killed in Gaza since the war began.",
      "Several organizations, along with unions and political parties, planned two demonstrations in the French capital on Thursday. The first began at 6 p.m. (1 p.m. ET) from Paris\u2019 Saint-Lazare station Place de la R\u00e9publique. \u201cNo gala for those who advocate genocide,\u201d the organizers\u2019 leaflet read.",
      "The gala is being held on the eve of a soccer match between Israel and France at Paris\u2019 Stade de France on Thursday, as tensions remain heightened following violence in Amsterdam involving Israeli soccer fans.",
      "Helena Muzi Cohen, a coordinator with the Jewish leftist organization Collectif Golem, said the group wanted to show that Smotrich\u2019s views and those of Israel is Forever do not \u201crepresent Jewish people on a global scale.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are totally against everything that\u2019s happening in Gaza,\u201d Muzi Cohen said, noting that her organization, which was founded roughly one year ago, has advocated for a cease-fire and the release of hostages who remain held by Hamas in the enclave.",
      "During a previous Israel is Forever gala in March 2023, Smotrich asserted that \u201cthere is no such thing as a Palestinian people.\u201d",
      "The statement drew widespread rebuke at the time, including from National Security spokesperson John Kirby, who said, \u201cWe utterly object to that kind of language,\u201d and the Palestinian Authority, who called it \u201cracist\u201d and \u201can attempt to falsify history.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 Chinese authorities scrambled Wednesday to quell public outrage over the country\u2019s deadliest mass killing in a decade, as well as the delay in reporting it.",
      "Flowers and other offerings were removed almost as soon as they were laid at a makeshift memorial in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai, where 35 people were killed Monday evening when a car rammed into a crowd of people exercising outside a sports center.",
      "The initial statement from authorities said the driver had been detained at the scene and that those who were injured had been taken to the hospital, and the incident was downplayed in Chinese state media. It wasn\u2019t until almost 24 hours later, on Tuesday night, that authorities reported the death toll in the attack, which also injured 43 others.",
      "Chinese state media reported that President Xi Jinping had ordered \u201call-out efforts\u201d to treat the injured and that the perpetrator be \u201cseverely punished in accordance with the law.\u201d",
      "Amid a growing public outcry, discussion of the attack appeared to be suppressed on heavily censored Chinese social media platforms, with videos and other posts continuously deleted.",
      "It is the latest in what appears to be a spike in violent crime in China, though it is difficult to know because there is no publicly available data.",
      "In a country where there are limited avenues for expressing dissent, such attacks can be unnerving for the ruling Chinese Communist Party, which prizes social stability perhaps more than anything else and may worry that they reflect the toll of an economic slowdown it is struggling to address.",
      "The suspect in the Zhuhai attack, a 62-year-old man identified only by his surname of Fan, was said to be upset by the division of property after his divorce. He was in a coma after he harmed himself with a knife in his car, police said, and could not be questioned.",
      "Lynette Ong, a distinguished professor of Chinese politics at the University of Toronto, said it would not be surprising if local officials in Zhuhai were punished or removed from office, \u201cbecause incidents like this are classified as destabilizing, a threat to social stability.\u201d",
      "She said\u00a0the attacks were symptoms of a \u201cpent-up society\u201d that is more tightly controlled under Xi, who has increased online censorship and kept the country under strict \u201czero-Covid\u201d measures for three years.",
      "Combined with personal trauma and growing economic hardship, \u201cpeople reach boiling point and they go out and commit something extraordinary, big violent crimes,\u201d said Ong, who is also a senior fellow at the Asia Society.",
      "The attack in Zhuhai, a city of 2.5 million, took place on the eve of a major air show that is held there every two years and where China debuted a new stealth fighter jet on Tuesday. There is no indication that the two events are connected.",
      "But the sensitive timing of the attack may have been one reason for the delay in reporting the death toll, said Fang Kecheng, an assistant professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who studies Chinese media and censorship. Local officials may have been waiting for directives from Beijing, he said.",
      "Posts related to the attack appeared to be censored on Weibo, China\u2019s X-like platform, where it ranked only 11th among trending topics as the death toll was reported on Tuesday. By Wednesday evening local time, it was not listed among trending topics at all.",
      "Censorship is \u201cvery common\u201d after such incidents, Fang said.",
      "\u201cThe government wants to control the narrative and ensure that the public support for the regime won\u2019t be affected,\u201d he said.",
      "Many commenters lamented the driver\u2019s actions.",
      "\u201cThose who lash out at society are truly wicked. If you have a grudge, confront the person directly. Why harm innocent bystanders?\u201d read one comment on Weibo.",
      "While the identities of the victims in the Zhuhai attack have not been disclosed, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that there were no foreign nationals among the casualties."

    "story": [
      "A call from Israel\u2019s ultranationalist finance minister to use Donald Trump\u2019s election win as an opportunity to annex parts of the occupied West Bank has drawn international condemnation and fueled fears about the U.S. ally\u2019s plans.",
      "Bezalel Smotrich said Monday that \u201cthe time has come\u201d to extend Israeli sovereignty over settlements in the area \u2014 land recognized by the international community as belonging to Palestinians in their quest for a future state.",
      "The Israeli minister welcomed the president-elect\u2019s victory and said he would seek Trump's support for the move.",
      "\u201cI intend, with God\u2019s help, to lead a government decision that says that the government of Israel will work with the new administration of President Trump and the international community to apply Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria,\u201d he said, using a name employed by many Israelis for the West Bank.",
      "Discussions on plans to annex parts of the West Bank were held between Israel and Washington during Trump\u2019s first term, and Smotrich said that he would push his government to engage with the incoming administration to gain support.",
      "\u201cWe will apply the sovereignty, together with our American friends,\u201d he added.",
      "Smotrich added that he would seek international recognition for sovereignty over the West Bank, but his announcement quickly drew global condemnation.",
      "A State Department spokesperson called the comments \u201cdisturbing\u201d and \u201cnot conducive to building an enduring peace.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration has \u201creiterated consistently the clear position of the United States in support of a two-state solution as part of a negotiated process that provides for an independent Palestinian state, with security guarantees for Israel,\u201d the spokesperson said.",

      "LONDON \u2014\u00a0 The \"r\" in royal will soon exclusively be lowercase \u2014 in spirit, at least.",
      "That's if Prince William gets his way.",
      "The older son of King Charles III and the late Princess Diana, and the heir to the British throne, has revealed he wants to approach official duties with \u201ca smaller r in the royal,\u201d perhaps the clearest hint yet of how he thinks the British monarchy should evolve as it seeks to navigate its place in the world after the death of Queen Elizabeth II.",
      "\u201cI can only describe what I\u2019m trying to do and that\u2019s trying to do it differently and I\u2019m trying to do it for my generation,\u201d William, 42, told Sky News on Saturday as he wrapped up a weeklong tour of South Africa in the legislative capital, Cape Town.",
      "Elaborating on what that meant to him, he said that \u201cit\u2019s more about impact philanthropy, collaboration, convening and helping people.\"",
      "William added: \u201cAnd I\u2019m also going to throw empathy in there as well, because I really care about what I do. It helps impact people\u2019s lives. And I think we could do with some more empathetic leadership around the world.\u201d",
      "William has thought about how he might make his mark and approach things differently in both his current role as the Prince of Wales and, one day, as king, NBC\u00a0News royal commentator\u00a0Daisy McAndrew said.",
      "\u201cHe will be all too aware of how dangerous it is for the royal family to be seen to be out of touch or aloof and hence the emphasis on empathy and emotional intelligence,\u201d she said.",
      "British tabloids offered positive coverage, with The Mirror describing William's comments as a \"huge royal shake-up\" and The Sun splashing: \"MONARCHY WITH EMPATHY.\"",
      "But the comments have not received a universally warm response.",
      "Graham Smith, CEO of the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, told NBC News of the heir to the throne: \u201cHis \u2018r\u2019 couldn\u2019t get any smaller, to be honest. He barely does anything at all. He\u2019s an incredibly lazy man who manages to get a pretty small splashing of engagements to look like he is busy.\u201d",
      "Prince Harry\u2019s decision to step away from royal duties and his subsequent move to the United States has fueled a public conversation about the monarchy's relevance and future in Britain.",
      "\u201cWhat Harry has done is shown that royals can walk away and do the right thing under their own steam. They can fund their own lifestyles and get celebrity endorsements and do just fine,\u201d Smith said.",
      "\u201cSo why his brother feels that he needs to hang on to the titles and the status and the public money, I think, is a question that is only highlighted by Harry\u2019s departure,\u201d he added.",
      "Kensington Palace did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Dressing down",
      "William\u2019s effort to appear less formal even extends to his choice of clothes, McAndrew suggested.",
      "He sparked a debate on social media during his South Africa trip when he wore white trainers and an open-necked shirt.",
      "Royal fashion is a subject of intense scrutiny, so \u201cbeing out of touch also extends to actions as well as words and even to what clothes the royals wear,\u201d McAndrew said.",
      "\u201cDressing down ticks two boxes \u2014 less extravagant and more \u2018normal\u2019. But, some members of the public actively want their royals to be as glamorous\u00a0as possible, so it\u2019s a fine line,\u201d she added.",
      "But for Smith, this highlights a broader contradiction.",
      "Because their status comes from the institution itself, the public\u2019s interest in the royals isn\u2019t about seeing them as regular people, he  said.",
      "\u201cI guess what he\u2019s trying to say is he wants to look less royal. But, you know, if you look less royal, then what\u2019s the point of being a royal?\u201d Smith said.",
      "William's comments about changing the royals' approach follow a particularly difficult time for the family.",
      "He also spoke last week about how \u201cbrutal\u201d the past year has been, with his wife and his father diagnosed with cancer.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been dreadful. It\u2019s probably been the hardest year in my life,\u201d he told Sky News.",
      "Charles led Remembrance Day commemorations in London on Sunday as the\u00a0United Kingdom remembered British and Commonwealth service members who have\u00a0lost their lives in conflicts.",

      "Centuries on and it turns out that long-held assumptions about some of the people of Pompeii should not have been set in stone.",
      "New DNA analysis of skeletal remains in the doomed Roman town has revealed that some of the victims of Mount Vesuvius\u2019s eruption in A.D. 79 have been wrongly identified, highlighting how much modern day thinking has been projected onto the ancient world.",
      "\u201cWe show that the individuals\u2019 sexes and family relationships do not match traditional interpretations,\u201d wrote the authors of the research published Thursday in the journal Current Biology. \u201cModern assumptions about gendered behaviors may not be reliable lenses through which to view data from the past,\u201d they added.",
      "Pompeii's victims were later immortalized by archaeologists who used plaster to fill the voids left by their bodies and observers have long created stories based on these casts, one of which was long assumed to be a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they died.",
      "But the DNA analysis has shown the person thought to be the mother was actually a man who was unrelated to the child, according to the new research.",
      "And at least one of the people locked in the embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter \u2014 was a man.",
      "\u201cThe genetic results encourage reflection on the dangers of making up stories about gender and family relationships in past societies based on present-day expectations,\u201d one of the study\u2019s authors, professor David Reich, said in interview Thursday with the Harvard Medical School, where he lectures.",
      "Researchers from Italy's University of Florence and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in the German city of Leipzig also took part in the study, which examined 14 casts undergoing restoration in a bid determine the victims\u2019 sex, ancestry and genetic relationships using genetic material preserved for almost 2,000 years.",
      "Their findings also revealed that residents of the seaside resort favored by wealthy Romans had diverse backgrounds, primarily tracing their ancestry to eastern Mediterranean immigrants, highlighting the mobility of people and the multicultural nature of the Roman Empire.",
      "Before the eruption, which lasted for more than 24 hours and had the\u00a0power of thousands\u00a0of nuclear bombs, Mount Vesuvius\u00a0had been mostly dormant for centuries.",
      "An estimated 20,000 people lived in Pompeii at the time and many were consumed by a wave of ash, pumice and mud, freezing them in place beneath a fresh layer of volcanic sediment.",
      "Over the centuries, Pompeii and the dead were forgotten, remaining buried for almost two millennia until a farmer found part of the city beneath a vineyard in 1748.",
      "In the 19th century, archaeologists pioneered the technique of pouring plaster into voids left by decomposed bodies, creating lifelike casts.",
      "Since then, more than 100 of these casts have been produced, capturing the victims' forms along with any surviving bones preserved through the centuries, according to the Archaeological Park of Pompeii.Research at Pompeii continues to reveal new details about the ancient city and its people, with fresh discoveries made all the time.",
      "Earlier this year, three researchers were awarded a $700,000 prize for employing artificial intelligence to decipher a 2,000-year-old scroll that had been charred in the eruption.",
      "And last year, excavations revealed people had died as a result of an earthquake as well as the eruption and an opulent house was unveiled two decades after restoration began."

    "summary": "Trump adviser Carlos Trujillo said that the incoming administration will likely have to expand its focus beyond Mexico and the Northern Triangle to stem migration.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump used different strategies to tackle the flow of migration to the U.S. during his first term, and that will increase in his second, according to an adviser to the incoming president and former administration official.",
      "\u201cThere will be a lot of emphasis on controlling the border and working with Central American and South American countries to do so,\u201d Carlos Trujillo, who was ambassador to the Organization of American States in the first Trump term, said in an interview.",
      "Border crossings hit record numbers in the first three years of the Biden administration after pandemic-era restrictions were lifted. Over the summer, the administration put in place strict asylum restrictions that led to an over 50% drop in the daily number of people encountered by Border Patrol, to the lowest level since 2020.",
      "When it comes to migration, \u201cyou have to negotiate with many, many countries. It\u2019s not just one or two,\u201d said Trujillo. \u201cBefore, we would focus on the Northern Triangle as well as Mexico. I think now the migratory flows are just so overwhelming that there are a lot more players in the human trafficking business.\u201d",
      "He said the administration will likely review many different options to achieve their goals.",
      "\"I think he\u2019s going to review whatever policies or opportunities help him accomplish that,\u201d said Trujillo. \u201cSome of the options might be economic options. Some of the options might be blockade options. Some of the options might be direct diplomacy. There are multiple options.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump threatened to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras \u2014 the Northern Triangle  \u2014 if they didn\u2019t stop their citizens from seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. He also signed the Asylum Cooperative Agreements with the three countries allowing U.S. immigration officials to send asylum-seekers back to those countries before applying for refuge in the U.S. The Biden administration ended those agreements but implemented other policies to restrict the flow of asylum-seekers, such as requiring asylum application through the CBP One app and the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela (CHNV) parole program.",
      "NBC News has reported that the Trump administration plans to end Biden's programs, possibly making those who have not yet received asylum eligible for deportation.",
      "Since then, Nicaragua has become a popular hub for migrants from Latin America and Africa trying to reach the U.S. They charge visa fees upon arrival and require them to leave within 96 hours.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they [Nicaragua] have a choice,\u201d said Trujillo. \u201cI don\u2019t think they can compromise our national security and our safety with impunity.\u201d",
      "Mexico",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, asylum-seekers were forced to wait out their asylum claims in Mexico. Then-President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador ceded to many of Trump\u2019s immigration demands. During this year\u2019s campaign, Trump vowed to place 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico unless they halted the flow of migrants as well as drugs to the U.S.",
      "Trujillo touted the Trump administration's threats of tariffs and a subsequent migration deal with Mexico, saying that \u201cit was a very effective strategy that has a track record of success.\"",
      "Mexico\u2019s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, was among the first world leaders to call Trump last week to congratulate him after the election. But it remains to be seen whether Sheinbaum will be as cooperative as L\u00f3pez Obrador was when it comes to the new Trump administration's demands.",

      "During Trump\u2019s first term, Venezuela was at the forefront of his  Latin America policy. He waged a campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d against President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and backed opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 in an effort to depose the authoritarian leader. Biden attempted to negotiate with Maduro to hold free and fair elections while offering some sanctions relief.  Despite these strategies, Maduro remains in power.",
      "Trump may focus more on migration than trying to democratize the government. Venezuelans account for a large portion of migrants coming to the U.S.",
      "\u201cI think the policy is going to be focused \u2014 I don\u2019t think exclusively, but strongly \u2014 on curbing illegal migration, especially from Venezuela,\" Trujillo said.",
      "Cuba",
      "Trump reversed many of Barack Obama\u2019s executive orders liberalizing trade and travel to Cuba, banning U.S. flights to most Cuban cities and limiting remittances. Just prior to leaving office, Trump designated Cuba a state sponsor of terrorism. Biden lifted the ban on flights and remittances and kept the rest intact.",
      "\u201cYou have to address Cuba\u2019s impact on migration across the region,\u201d said Trujillo, who is Cuban American.",
      "He also said there is going to be a lot more pressure on stopping \u201cacts of aggression in our hemisphere, especially directed at the United States\u201d from China and Russia.",
      "There have been reports that Beijing and Havana have discussed a new joint military training facility on the island. The Biden administration has said that China has had a listening post in Cuba for years, something the Cuban government denies. And over the summer Russian warships docked in the port of Havana for several days as a show of strength.",
      "Cuba has been reeling from near catastrophic conditions. An economic crisis caused by their state-dominated economic model, decades-old sanctions which were tightened by the Trump administration and the effects of the pandemic on tourism have resulted in shortages of food, medicine and fuel. The island was recently hit by two hurricanes, an earthquake and major power grid failures that left the entire island in the dark.",
      "Some countries rushed to help Cuba. Mexico sent nearly half a million barrels of crude oil and diesel in a matter of days. Russia pledged to send more. The United Nations and European Union sent 94 tons of aid, while Venezuela sent an additional 300 tons.",
      "At a recent news briefing, Sheinbaum said, \u201cWe are going to support Cuba. ... Even if they criticize it, we are going to show solidarity.\u201d",
      "By contrast, Trujillo touted Trump's hard-line stance. \u201cIf you look at what\u2019s happened in Cuba, the complete collapse of their economy was all driven by the pressure that President Trump implemented. I thought it was a much better policy than just acquiescing to the Cuban Communist Party.\u201d"

Others in the study were taking older GLP-1 drugs, including liraglutide and dulaglutide, and also had fewer hospitalizations.",
      "Using hospitalization to determine the drugs\u2019 effects on alcohol use disorder is an imperfect measure, but experts said it is a good place to start.",
      "\u201cAlcohol withdrawal or poisoning would be why someone would require hospitalization, which is a pretty extreme outcome,\u201d DiFeliceantonio said.",
      "But hospital data is widely available, and it can help researchers determine which drugs may work for different types of addiction and which clinical trials they should run first, she added.",
      "Mounting research shows GLP-1 agonists warrant a closer look, especially for alcohol addiction.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve known for some time from animal studies that GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce alcohol intake and motivation to consume alcohol,\u201d said Christian Hendershot, director of clinical research at the University of Southern California Institute for Addiction Science.",
      "The fact that the new study included only people who have alcohol use disorder gives better information about how effective the drugs may be for people with substance addiction, he added.",
      "How a diabetes drug might treat addiction is still a mystery.",
      "One theory is that its effects may have something to do with the drugs\u2019 ability to induce the feeling of satiation. That may reduce cravings for drugs and alcohol the same way the drugs work on food cravings, Hendershot said.",
      "\u201cThey may also reduce the rewarding effects of drugs,\u201d he said.",
      "There are other theories, too. L\u00e4hteenvuo said it may have something to do with the sugar in alcohol. GLP-1 drugs, he said, make sugary beverages less appealing.",
      "Newer GLP-1 drugs, such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, enter the brain in different ways from older versions that have been studied, and moving forward, it will be important to test both, DiFeliceantonio said.",
      "Hendershot said that although the drugs are very safe for people with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, they could present big safety risks for people without obesity or Type 2 diabetes, particularly because of the weight loss they induce.",
      "Early research has also explored GLP-1 drugs for nicotine and opioid addiction, with mixed results. So far, the clearest results have come from studies on alcohol addiction \u2014 but there is still a lot to understand.",
      "\u201cRight now we only have three FDA-approved medications to treat alcohol use disorder. This pales in comparison to medications approved to treat other diseases,\u201d Hendershot said. \u201cAnything we can do to study other medications, including GLP-1 agonists, is critically important for our field.\u201d"
