    "story": [
      "The new Netflix documentary \u201cDevo\u201d explores the Ohio-born art-rock band known for their quirky style and misunderstood message",
      "NEW YORK -- You know the band Devo, right? The guys with the funny red plastic hats and jumpsuits? The New Wave musicians behind the silly \u201cWhip It\u201d video? They had that odd, spiky '80s vibe? Well, it turns out you may not know as much as you think.",
      "The new Netflix documentary \u201cDevo\u201d is an eye-opening examination of an Ohio-born art-rock band that argues they were perhaps the most misunderstood band on the face of the planet. It debuts on the streaming service Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe were trivialized and pigeonholed,\u201d co-founder Gerald Casale tells The Associated Press. \u201cThis documentary allows us to talk about what we were thinking and what we are motivated by to create what we created.\u201d",
      "Directed by Chris Smith, \u201cDevo\u201d uses archival footage and interviews to trace the band's beginnings, rise and fall, with cameos from fans like David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Neil Young.",
      "Devo introduced themselves to the world in 1977 by making a frenetic version of the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cI Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction,\u201d which earned them a crucial slot on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d On stages, they would wriggle like worms or dress like the guys from \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d",
      "They released their Brian Eno-produced debut, \u201cQ: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!,\u201d in 1978 and reached platinum status with 1980\u2019s \u201cFreedom of Choice,\u201d which featured \u201cWhip It,\u201d a hit just as their label was getting ready to drop them.",
      "But behind the odd neck braces and knee pads were powerful art and literary ideas about where the country was going. They named themselves after the idea that modern society was entering a process of \u201cdevolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were seeing a world that was the antitheses of the idealized, promised future ginned up in the \u201950s and \u201960s.\u201d Casale says in the movie. \u201cWhat we saw was regression.\u201d",
      "The nucleus of the band was formed from tragedy: Casale and Mark Mothersbaugh met at Kent State University, where they lived through the 1970 killing of four unarmed anti-war student protesters by the National Guard.",
      "That tragedy forged in the pair an antiestablishment, anti-capitalist protest, mixing lofty art history with pop culture. They admired Dadaism and Andy Warhol. The factories of Akron inspired their gray overalls and clear plastic face masks \u2014 portraying cogs in a machine like in the art movie \u201cMetropolis.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had a meta-approach,\u201d Casale tells the AP. \u201cIt was a multimedia, big idea approach. Music was an element, a layer, a dimension, but it was connected to this big worldview.\u201d",
      "Part of Devo's strength was its visual component and their videos were drenched with political commentary. The upbeat \u201cBeautiful World\u201d featured footage of police violence, the KKK and bombings, while \u201cFreedom of Choice\u201d warned against the dangers of conformity.",

      "Members of Devo \u2014 which also included Mark's brother, Bob, Gerald's brother, Bob, and Alan Myers \u2014 performed on TV and chatted with talk show hosts like David Letterman but their satire never seemed never to break through.",
      "\u201cNobody wanted to hear us talking about the duality of human nature and the dangers of groupthink and the atrophication of people being able to think logically and think critically,\u201d Casale says. \u201cIt was like, \u2018That\u2019s a bummer. Just tell us about drugs and sex.\u2019\u201d",
      "Rock has always needed bands like Devo, a corrective to the corporate machine. You can see an echo of Devo when M.I.A. raised her middle finger during the Super Bowl halftime show in 2012. The members of Devo cite such bands as Rage Against the Machine and System of a Down as keeping the flame alive.",
      "\u201cThe only thing you can hope is that it will create an awareness and get rid of complacency, but it doesn\u2019t seem to have done that in the past,\u201d Mothersbaugh tells the AP.",

      "There are signs of optimism when members of Devo play live these days. Mothersbaugh says he sees a lot of young people, who have used their smartphones to bypass media gatekeepers.",
      "\u201cWe see a lot of people that look like us, with gray hair out there in the audience. But there\u2019s also, there\u2019s also a lot kids, which is kind of surprising to me, but I think it\u2019s only because they have this thing in their hand that they sometimes use to their advantage.\u201d",
      "Devo are set to hit the road later this year in a co-headlining tour with the B-52's. The Cosmic De-Evolution Tour will kick off Sept. 24 in Toronto and wraps Nov. 2 in Houston.",
      "You may think of Devo as New Wave or early electronica or synth-pop. but they see themselves differently: \u201cWe were true punk, meaning we questioned illegitimate authority and we stayed in our own lane and did our thing, remaining true to our vision,\u201d says Casale. \u201cThat\u2019s punk.\u201d",

      "His six decades in the business were peppered with highlights, including his touching portrayal of the transsexual Bernadette in 1994's \u201cThe Adventure of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,\" the second of his two BAFTA nominations.",
      "But it will be his portrayal of the bearded Zod in 1978's \u201cSuperman\u201d and its sequel \u201cSuperman II\u201d two years later that most people associate with Stamp. As the Kryptonian arch enemy to Christopher Reeve's Man of Steel, Stamp introduced a darker, charming and vulnerable \u2014 more human \u2014 element to the franchise, one that's been replicated in countless superhero movies ever since.",
      "Edgar Wright, who directed Stamp in his final feature film, 2021\u2019s \u201cLast Night in Soho,\u201d remembered the actor in an Instagram post as \u201ckind, funny, and endlessly fascinating.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe closer the camera moved, the more hypnotic his presence became. In close-up, his unblinking gaze locked in so powerfully that the effect was extraordinary. Terence was a true movie star: the camera loved him, and he loved it right back,\u201d Wright said.",
      "Bill Duke, who starred with Stamp in director Steven Soderbergh\u2019s 1999 crime drama \u201cThe Limey,\u201d said he was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d to hear of his death.",

      "Stamp started his acting career on stage in the late 1950s, where he acted in repertory theatre and met Michael Caine, who was five years older than himself. The pair lived together in a flat in central London while looking for their big break.",
      "He got his break with \u201cBilly Budd\u201d and Stamp embarked on a career that would see him in the early 1960s be part of the \u201cangry young men\u201d movement that was introducing an element of social realism into British moviemaking.",

      "\u201cAugust came on strong last year, so it makes comparisons tough,\u201d Dergarabedian said, noting the box office success of movies like \u201cDeadpool and Wolverine\u201d and the horror sci-fi \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d that premiered this time last year.",

Smith said he and Johnson were \u201clooking for somebody\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know who we were going to catch.\u201d",
      "They knew that Young Dolph and some of the artists on his label were participating in the turkey giveaway, so they were heading in that direction when they saw Young Dolph\u2019s car. They followed him to the cookie shop and opened fire in broad daylight, Smith said. Young Dolph was hit 22 times and died at the scene.",
      "At the earlier trials, prosecutor Paul Hagerman told trial jurors that Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down. Young Dolph later wrote diss tracks directed at the label, its artists and its \u201cNo. 2 person,\u201d Big Jook. Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant earlier this year.",
      "Smith testified he received $800 before he was arrested and his defense attorney later received another $50,000.",
      "In addition to Smith\u2019s testimony, prosecutors presented a large amount of circumstantial evidence, including from surveillance cameras and Johnson\u2019s cellphone. The evidence includes calls between Smith and Johnson shortly before the killing and a call between Johnson and Big Jook immediately after.",
      "Smith is also charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder and has pleaded not guilty. A trial date has not been set for him.",

      "Tristan Rogers, who played legacy character Robert Scorpio on ABC's \u201cGeneral Hospital,\u201d died Friday, less than one month after he made a special appearance on the soap opera. He was 79.",
      "\u201cThe entire \u2018General Hospital\u2019 family is heartbroken to hear of Tristan Rogers' passing,\u201d said Frank Valentini, the show's executive producer, in a statement. \u201cTristan has captivated our fans for 45 years and Port Charles will not be the same without him (or Robert Scorpio).\u201d",
      "Born in Melbourne, Australia, Rogers' first foray into performing was in his early twenties and playing drums in a rock band with a group of friends. They weren't successful so Rogers turned to commercial work and modeling to earn some money. When the band dissolved, Rogers decided to give acting a try. After various roles in Australia, he also worked as a DJ and eventually moved to Los Angeles to try to break into Hollywood. He said casting directors were initially turned off by his accent but he eventually landed a two-day role on \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d in 1980.",
      "\u201cI had no idea at the point how big the show was,\u201d Rogers told fellow \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d actor Maurice Benard on the YouTube show, \u201cState of Mind with Maurice Benard\u201d in 2022.",
      "\u201cI had no name. I was brought in expressly to beat up the hero, Luke, (played by Anthony Geary), and then disappear,\u201d Rogers said. His first day was half-over when then-executive producer Gloria Monty asked if he would like to stay on. They had no character written for him so for three weeks Monty asked him to just appear in scenes \u201clooking furtive, looking suspicious\u201d until they came up with a storyline. It was decided he would play a spy known as \u201cCK8\u201d and eventually he was given the name Robert Scorpio. The character would remain a fixture in Port Charles for the rest of Rogers' life, even when he wasn't a current cast member.",
      "Scorpio's on again/off again romance with Emma Samms' character, Holly Sutton, remained a favorite among fans. Scorpio also had a romance, and many storylines with another spy, Anna Devane, played by Finola Hughes. Scorpio and Devane shared a daughter, Robin, played by Kimberly McCullough. Samms returned to the show for a stint last fall where it was revealed that Scorpio was the father of her adult daughter, Sasha Gilmore (played by Sofia Mattson.)",

      "Filmmaker Kate Beecroft points her lens toward the real cowgirls of the Badlands in the lyrical new film \u201cEast of Wall.\u201d",
      "The film blends fact and fiction to tell a story about the working women of South Dakota, skilled riders and trainers with ranching and rodeo in their blood who also can't seem to catch a break. There are a few Hollywood actors in the mix, including Jennifer Ehle as a hard living grandmother with a lifetime of regrets as well as some nuggets of wisdom and Scoot McNairy as an out-of-towner who wants to acquire the land, but most of the cast are non-actors playing themselves. The film won an audience award earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival.",
      "At the heart of \u201cEast of Wall,\u201d now playing in select theaters, is Tabatha Zimiga, a South Dakota native whose ability to tame wild horses is the stuff of legend in the area. In the film, the horses she rescues and rehabilitates are sold at auctions and often accepted for far less than what they\u2019re worth. She needs the money. There are bills to pay on the ranch and many mouths to feed (not just her own kids, but others from around the town who come to her for safety and shelter when their own caretakers stop providing).",
      "Tabatha is also living with new and old traumas, from the generational agony of abuse to the more recent death of her husband, the shocking circumstances of which are withheld for some time. But the effects of the loss are still felt, especially for their daughter Porshia (played by her real-life daughter Porshia Zimiga), whose grief is threatening to turn into hate of her mother. Teenage Porshia provides the poetic voiceovers, in which she talks about riding, her mother and, most effectively, the land. It's reminiscent of Linda Manz\u2019s narration in \u201cDays of Heaven.\u201d",
      "\u201cEast of Wall\u201d is best when it\u2019s capturing the landscapes and the girls in action, riding and filming energetic TikToks of their friends racing cars on horseback. Some have suggested that \u201cEast of Wall\u201d might have been stronger as a documentary. These women are vibrant and authentic and don't look like anyone we see in the movies these days, with real bodies and imperfect skin, heads half-shaved, tattoos everywhere and the ability to really, really ride \u2014 no stunt team required. And they have stories to tell, many of them unhappy, as we see in one of the most moving non-action scenes involving a group of mothers speaking candidly about their lives and their regrets.",
      "The real-life drama of financial instability is compelling and likely rooted in truth; however, the introduction of McNairy\u2019s suspect Texan feels like a narrative contrivance and drama for drama\u2019s sake. He offers to buy the ranch and let them live and work as usual, just for him now instead of themselves. These are the kind of scenes that remind you that the filmmakers, despite all their best intentions and care, are, in essence, also interlopers in this world.",

      "Manhattan Judge Curtis Farber said Wednesday he could sentence Weinstein on Sept. 30 \u2014 but only if there\u2019s no retrial on a rape charge that the last jury failed to reach a verdict on.",

      "At the same time, the jury acquitted him of forcing oral sex on another woman, one-time model Kaja Sokola, but couldn\u2019t decide a charge that he raped hairstylist and actor Jessica Mann in 2013.",

      "Mann is on board to testify again, they said.",
      "Prosecutors requested a January trial date, citing witness availability and their own caseload. Farber balked at that, saying a January date is too far away and conflicts with another, unrelated trial he\u2019s already scheduled. He proposed having the trial in the fall.",

    "story": [
      "After getting out of the scripted TV business in 2021 for reality TV and sports coverage, USA Network is returning to air scripted originals with the legal drama \u201cThe Rainmaker.\"",
      "Since 2021, the USA Network had stacked its lineup with reality shows and sports, entirely forgoing original, scripted programming. Fans of \"Suits\u201d, \u201cWhite Collar\u201d and \u201cMonk\u201d were left with only memories of those shows' case-of-the-week storytelling. But on Friday, the network returns to scripted TV with the legal thriller \u201cThe Rainmaker.\u201d",
      "If the title sounds familiar, it's because it\u2019s based on the 1995 novel by John Grisham, which was first adapted into the 1997 Matt Damon-starring film directed by Francis Ford Coppola. In this \u201cRainmaker,\u201d British actor Milo Callaghan plays Rudy Baylor. It's the first leading role for Callaghan, who had previously played recurring characters in shows like HBO's \u201cDune: Prophecy\" and Starz\u2019s \u201cThe Spanish Princess.\u201d",
      "Baylor is fresh out of law school and about to start working at the largest law firm in the state, run by Leo F. Drummond (John Slattery). On his first day, Baylor gets fired after challenging Drummond in a meeting. Desperate for work, he takes a job at a small ambulance-chasing firm that works out of a former taco joint. His boss is Jocelyn \u201cBruiser\u201d Stone (Lana Parrilla, in a gender swap from the film where Mickey Rourke had the role). She\u2019s smart, confident and not afraid to use her sex appeal to get what she wants. Rudy\u2019s first big case pits him against the big, fancy law firm that let him go \u2014 and his girlfriend who still works there.",
      "Callaghan told The Associated Press about learning legalese while doing a Memphis accent and familiarizing himself with the source material. Answers are edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "CALLAGHAN: I watched it when I got cast. Matt Damon is somebody that every young actor would look up to. I wanted to be aware of the work that he did. I mean, it was a Coppola movie as well, so I was excited to see it. And then I gave it maybe like 20 minutes' thought and focused on the script because it is different and I think we have 10 hours of television to explore this character. We go on a windier road than the movie.",
      "CALLAGHAN: Yes. It\u2019s a slow-paced thriller, really, but fantastic. And there\u2019s this chunk, it must be about 100 pages, of him just preparing for this case for months and months and months. So I never wanted it to feel like it was off-the-hand genius. It felt like this is a situation that has to be honored to a certain extent. Like, you can be a fantastic lawyer, but you don\u2019t get there without grinding and grafting. We had great scenes where we were working late into the night.",

      "CALLAGHAN: Consistent work with a great dialogue coach. I remember I got there on my first day and I was running lines with P.J. Byrne, who plays Deck, and he\u2019s kind of looking at me funny. He\u2019s like, \u201cWhy are you talking like that?\u201d I was like, \"What do you mean?

      "CALLAGHAN: \u201cNorth City Hospital.\u201d It was the hardest thing. I was like, 'Why did you call it this?\" I got all this legalese down and then \u201cNorth City Hospital\u201d would shoot me in the foot every time.",
      "CALLAGHAN: I went through major trials, like the whole O.J. Simpson murder trial and the Gwyneth Paltrow trial. And also obscure trials. I studied attorneys and their patterns of speech and the way they address the court. We don't really have the same kind of pop star element to the legal system of like, \u201cThat\u2019s the guy who represented this person and that person.\u201d Studying that is fascinating.",

      "Pollution isn't the only problem. Plastics, made almost entirely from fossil fuels, are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Plastics generated 3.4% \u2014 or 1.8 billion tons \u2014 of planet-warming emissions across the globe in 2019, the United Nations says.",
      "Not very.",
      "It's notoriously difficult to recycle plastics; only 6% of what's made gets recycled, according to the OECD. That's largely because different kinds of plastic cannot be recycled together. They have different chemical compositions, making it costly and time-consuming, and requiring a lot of manual sorting.",
      "\u201cThere are many different colors of plastics, many different types of plastics called polymers, and 16,000 to 17,000 different chemicals used to make plastics, so by design, plastics are not easily recyclable,\" said Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics, an organization that works to cut plastic pollution.",
      "Experts say plastic is different from materials like paper, cardboard, metal and glass, which all get reused at much higher rates. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates glass recycling at about 31%, and things like steel cans at about 71%. As much as 64% of paper and 74% of cardboard get recycled, according to the American Forest & Paper Association.",
      "But \u201cIf you just think of your own home or apartment, you might have a bright orange hard plastic detergent container on top of your washing machine, and then you might have a plastic bag,\u201d Enck said. \u201cThose two things cannot get recycled together.\"",
      "The plastics industry says innovations in material science are helping to incorporate more recycled plastics into products and enable more plastic products to be recyclable. Ross Eisenberg, president of America\u2019s Plastic Makers, noted the need for an \u201call-of-the-above approach.\u201d",
      "He said this also includes upgrading recycling infrastructure or improving sorting to capture more used plastics. This also means making recycling more accessible and helping consumers know what can and can\u2019t go in the recycling bin.",
      "But there are a lot of limitations to this.",
      "Depending on consumers for accurate pre-sorting is a lot to ask. And cities may hesitate to make costly infrastructure improvements to their recycling programs if there is little financial incentive or market for the recycled material.",
      "\"Local recycling facilities, or markets for the recycled material, don\u2019t always exist. Where the collection and processing infrastructure does exist, the recycling plants are essentially plastic production facilities, with the same air, water, and soil pollution problems that are harmful to local residents,\" said Holly Kaufman, director of The Plastics & Climate Project and senior fellow at World Resources Institute.",

      "California is currently suing oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil, alleging deception about the possibilities of plastic recycling.",
      "Because of this, Kaufman says, \u201cThe aim should be to significantly reduce plastic production, use, and waste, not recycle more.\u201d",
      "\u201cReuse means creating packaging or products designed to be used multiple times, like refillable containers, or more durable zippered bags that can be washed and refilled many times, extending their lifespan and reducing waste,\u201d Eisenberg, of America's Plastic Makers, said.",
      "Experts say reuse is extremely important, but reusable products shouldn\u2019t necessarily be used for consumables because of the risk of microplastics.",
      "Redesigning plastic often means making it easier to recycle. That can be using one material in packaging instead of several, or printing labels directly onto a container rather than using a separate one that is glued on, but that is more complex.",
      "Alternatives to plastics could also be made out of sustainable, less harmful and even regenerative materials, such as seaweed, Kaufman said. There has been progress on this front, but most solutions have not scaled up yet.",

      "Republican lawmakers are blaming Canada for not preventing and containing wildfires, whose smoke has fouled the air in several states this year",
      "The sternly worded statements and letters are filled with indignation and outrage: Republican U.S. lawmakers say Canada has done too little to contain wildfires and smoke that have fouled the air in several states this summer.",
      "\u201cInstead of enjoying family vacations at Michigan\u2019s beautiful lakes and campgrounds, for the third summer in a row, Michiganders are forced to breathe hazardous air as a result of Canada\u2019s failure to prevent and control wildfires,\u201d read a statement last week from the state\u2019s GOP congressional delegation, echoing similar missives from Republicans in Iowa, New York, North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin.",
      "They\u2019ve demanded more forest thinning, prescribed burns and other measures to prevent fires from starting. They've warned the smoke is hurting relations between the countries and suggested the U.S. could make it an issue in tariff talks.",
      "But what they haven't done is acknowledge the role of climate change \u2014 a glaring and shortsighted omission, according to climate scientists. It also ignores the outsized U.S. contribution to heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas that cause more intense heat waves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires, scientists say.",
      "\u201cIf anything, Canada should be blaming the U.S. for their increased fires,\u201d said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.",
      "On Tuesday, the Canadian government announced almost $46 million in funding for wildfire prevention and risk assessment research projects. But Corey Hogan, parliamentary secretary to the federal energy and natural resources minister, said international cooperation is needed.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no people that want to do more about wildfires than Canadians,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cBut I think this also underlines the international challenges that are brought on by climate change ... we need to globally tackle this problem.\u201d",
      "The country has \u201cbeen fighting wildfires in this country at unprecedented rates since 2023,\u201d when Canada saw its largest wildfire on record, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs. This year\u2019s first fire started in April, one of the earliest on record, and 2025 is now the second-worst year.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 700 wildfires were burning across the country, two-thirds of them out of control, with more than 28,000 square miles (72,520 square kilometers) burned in 4,400 wildfires so far this year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. That's almost five times the surface area that's burned so far in the U.S. this year. Most wildfires are started by people, sometimes on purpose but mostly by mistake, though McMullen said lightning is the culprit in many of Canada's fires, especially in remote areas.",
      "McMullen said he has no interest in debating the role of climate change, but data show that something has changed. Sloughs and basins have dried up and water that once lapped at people\u2019s back doors in Canada\u2019s lake communities now is often hundreds of feet away.",
      "\u201cPeople can make up their own mind as to why that is,\u201d he said. \u201cBut something clearly has changed.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax \u2014 a belief echoed by many in the GOP \u2014 and his administration has worked to dismantle and defund federal climate science and data collection, with little to no pushback from Republicans in Congress.",
      "He\u2019s proposed to revoke the scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare \u2014 the central basis for U.S. climate change action. He's declared a national energy emergency to expedite fossil fuel development, canceled grants for renewable energy projects and ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels.",

      "South Korea and the United States began their annual large-scale joint military exercise on Monday to better cope with threats by nuclear-armed North Korea",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea and the United States began their annual large-scale joint military exercise on Monday to better cope with threats by nuclear-armed North Korea, which has warned the drills would deepen regional tensions and vowed to respond to \u201cany provocation\u201d against its territory.",
      "The 11-day Ulchi Freedom Shield, the second of two large-scale exercises held annually in South Korea, after another set in March, will involve 21,000 soldiers, including 18,000 South Koreans, in computer-simulated command post operations and field training.",
      "The drills, which the allies describe as defensive, could trigger a response from North Korea, which has long portrayed the allies\u2019 exercises as invasion rehearsals and has often used them as a pretext for military demonstrations and weapons tests aimed at advancing its nuclear program.",
      "In a statement last week, North Korean Defense Minister No Kwang Chol said the drills show the allies\u2019 stance of \u201cmilitary confrontation\u201d with the North and declared that its forces would be ready to counteract \u201cany provocation going beyond the boundary line.\u201d",
      "Ulchi Freedom Shield comes at a pivotal moment for South Korea\u2019s new liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who is preparing for an Aug. 25 summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington. Trump has raised concerns in Seoul that he may shake up the decades-old alliance by demanding higher payments for the American troop presence in South Korea and possibly reducing it as Washington shifts its focus more toward China.",
      "Tensions on the Korean Peninsula remain high as North Korea has brushed aside Lee\u2019s calls to resume diplomacy with its war-divided rival, with relations having soured in recent years as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un accelerated his weapons program and deepened alignment with Moscow following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWhat's needed now is the courage to steadily take steps toward easing tensions, grounded in a firmly maintained state of ironclad security readiness,\u201d Lee said during a Cabinet meeting on Monday. South Korea also on Monday began a four-day civil defense drill involving thousands of public workers, often scheduled alongside the allies\u2019 summertime military exercises.",
      "Seoul\u2019s previous conservative government responded to North Korean threats by expanding military exercises with the United States and seeking stronger U.S. assurances for nuclear deterrence, drawing an angry reaction from Kim, who last year renounced long-term reconciliation goals and rewrote the North\u2019s constitution to label the South a permanent enemy.",
      "In his latest message to Pyongyang on Friday, Lee, who took office in June, said he would seek to restore a 2018-inter-Korean military agreement designed to reduce border tensions and called for North Korea to respond to the South\u2019s efforts to rebuild trust and revive talks.",

      "But South Korea suspended the deal in 2024, citing tensions over North Korea\u2019s launches of trash-laden balloons toward the South, and moved to resume frontline military activities and propaganda campaigns. The step came after North Korea had already declared it would no longer abide by the agreement.",
      "When asked whether the Lee government\u2019s steps to restore the agreement would affect the allies\u2019 drills, the South\u2019s Defense Ministry said Monday that there are no immediate plans to suspend live-fire training near the Koreas\u2019 disputed western maritime border.",
      "While the allies have postponed half of Ulchi Freedom Shield\u2019s originally planned 44 field training programs to September, U.S. military officials denied South Korean media speculation that the scaled-back drills were meant to make room for diplomacy with the North, citing heat concerns and flood damage to some training fields.",
      "Dating back to his first term, Trump has regularly called for South Korea to pay more for the 28,500 American troops stationed on its soil. Public comments by senior Trump administration officials, including Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby, have suggested a push to restructure the alliance, which some experts say could potentially affect the size and role of U.S. forces in South Korea.",
      "Under this approach, South Korea would take a greater role in countering North Korean threats while U.S. forces focus more on China, possibly leaving Seoul to face reduced benefits but increased costs and risks, experts say.",
      "In a recent meeting with reporters, Gen. Xavier Brunson, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, stressed the need to \u201cmodernize\u201d the alliance to address the evolving security environment, including North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions, its deepening alignment with Russia, and what he called Chinese threats to a \u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific.\u201d",

      "Quiroga congratulated Paz on his lead.",
      "\u201cWhat happened is unprecedented,\u201d he said. \u201cBolivia told the world that we want to live in a free nation.\u201d",

      "The official MAS candidate, Eduardo del Castillo, finished sixth with 3.2% of the vote. A candidate considered to be the party\u2019s best hope, 36-year-old Senate president Andr\u00f3nico Rodr\u00edguez, captured 8% of the vote.",
      "During his almost 14 years in power, Morales expanded the rights of the country\u2019s Indigenous majority, defended coca growers against U.S.-backed eradication programs and poured natural gas profits into social programs.",
      "But the maverick leader\u2019s increasingly high-handed attempts to prolong his presidency \u2014 along with allegations of sexual relations with underage girls \u2014 soured public opinion against him.",

      "ISLAMABAD -- Cloudbursts are causing chaos in mountainous parts of India and Pakistan, with tremendous amounts of rain falling in a short period of time over a concentrated area. The intense, sudden deluges have proved fatal in both countries.",
      "As many as 300 people died in one northwestern Pakistani district, Buner, after a cloudburst. The strength and volume of rain triggered flash flooding, landslides and mudflows. Boulders from steep slopes came crashing down with the water to flatten homes and reduce villages to rubble.",
      "The northern Indian state of Uttarakhand had a cloudburst earlier this month. Local TV showed floodwaters surging down a mountain and crashing into Dharali, a Himalayan village. In 2013, more than 6,000 people died and 4,500 villages were affected when a similar cloudburst struck the state.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about cloudbursts:",
      "A cloudburst occurs when a large volume of rain falls in a very short period, usually more than 100 millimeters (about 4 inches) within an hour over a localized area, around 30 square kilometers (11.6 square miles).",
      "Cloudbursts are sudden and violent, with devastating consequences and widespread destruction, and can be the equivalent of several hours of normal rainfall or longer. The event is the bursting of a cloud and the discharge of its contents at the same time, like a rain bomb.",
      "Several factors contribute to a cloudburst, including warm, moist air rising upward, high humidity, low pressure, instability and convective cloud formation.",
      "Moist air is forced to rise after encountering a hill or mountain. This rising air cools and condenses. Clouds that are large, dense and capable of heavy rainfall form.",
      "Hills or mountains act like barriers and often trap these clouds, so they cannot disperse or move easily. Strong upward currents keep moisture suspended inside the clouds, delaying rainfall.",
      "When the clouds cannot hold the accumulated moisture anymore, they burst and release it all at once.",
      "Cloudbursts thrive in moisture, monsoons and mountains. Regions of India and Pakistan have all three, making them vulnerable to these extreme weather events.",
      "The Himalayas, Karakoram and Hindu Kush mountain ranges are home to the world\u2019s highest and most famous peaks, spanning multiple countries including India and Pakistan.",
      "The frequency of cloudbursts in these two South Asian nations has been steadily rising due to a warming atmosphere, because a warmer air mass can hold more moisture, creating conditions for sudden and intense downpours.",
      "The South Asian region has traditionally had two monsoon seasons. One typically lasts from June to September, with rains moving southwest to northeast. The other, from roughly October to December, moves in the opposite direction.",
      "But with more planet-warming gases in the air, the rain now only loosely follows this pattern.",
      "This is because the warmer air can hold more moisture from the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean, and that rain then tends to get dumped all at once. It means the monsoon is punctuated with intense flooding and dry spells, rather than sustained rain throughout.",

      "It recommends afforestation to reduce surface runoff and enhance water absorption, and regular clearing and widening of riverbanks and drainage channels.",
      "Experts say cloudbursts have increased in recent years, partly due to climate change, while damage from associated storms has also increased due to unplanned development in mountain areas.",
      "Climate change has directly amplified the triggers of cloudbursts in Pakistan, especially. Every 1\u00b0C rise allows the air to hold about 7% more moisture, increasing the potential for heavy rainfall in short bursts.",
      "The warming of the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea pushes more moisture into the atmosphere. Melting glaciers and snow alter local weather patterns, making rainfall events more erratic and extreme. Environmental degradation, in the form of deforestation and wetland loss, reduces the land\u2019s ability to absorb water, magnifying flash floods.",

      "It was not an isolated case, but part of a broader shift in the war where medical evacuation has become increasingly difficult.",
      "\u201cBecause of drones ... that can reach far, the danger is there for the wounded themselves and now for the crews working to get them out,\u201d said Daryna Boiko, the anesthesiologist from the \u201cUlf\u201d medical service of the 108th Da Vinci Wolves Battalion. \u201cThat\u2019s why the main difficulty now is transport.\u201d",

      "Now, the heavy use of first-person-view (FPV) drones, which let an operator see the target before striking, has turned areas up to 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the front line into kill zones. Medics say they have not treated gunshot wounds for months, and most injuries now come from FPVs.",
      "The drones are the most feared weapon, both because of their precision and because they reduce survival chances for those already injured by complicating the evacuation.",
      "For Ukraine\u2019s outnumbered army, that makes preserving crew even harder.",
      "The growing use of FPVs has also made moving the wounded between points more difficult, said the commander of the 59th Brigade medical unit with call sign Buhor, who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons.",
      "\u201cEverything is getting harder \u2014 the work has to be more mobile, the way we operate changes and the level of safety changes,\u201d he said.",
      "Asked whether those conditions have increased mortality among the wounded, he replied: \u201cSignificantly. There\u2019s nothing you can do. Everything burns from those FPVs \u2014 everything, even tanks.\u201d",
      "He explained that the munitions carry a charge from a rocket-propelled grenade \u2014 a shoulder-fired weapon that launches an explosive designed to pierce armored vehicles. When it blasts, a jet of molten metal and fragments penetrate the cabin at extreme temperatures. The impact can cause anything from minor cuts and burns to severe wounds, including amputations, depending on where the fragments hit and their size.",
      "Buhor said self-aid and self-evacuation are now heavily emphasized during training, but the existence of the kill zone means soldiers can be stuck in position for days or weeks \u2014 especially if a wound is not immediately life-threatening.",
      "When Artem Fursov arrived at the stabilization post late one night with three other soldiers, Buhor inspected his wounds and praised the bandage on his arm, asking who had done it. It was the work of a fellow soldier \u2014 and an example of effective self-aid, Buhor said.",
      "Fursov, 38, was wounded on Aug. 4 by an explosive dropped from a drone, but he didn\u2019t reach a medical post until five days later. To get to safety, he had to walk several kilometers. A small wooden cross he wore under his clothes the whole time now hangs against his chest.",

      "Two of their children had already made the crossing, via the Gulf of Aden and then war-torn Yemen. Yosef\u2019s brother is now in jail in Yemen for entering that country illegally. His sister made it to Saudi Arabia, also illegally, which means it will be difficult for her to leave.",
      "On August 3, 2025, Yosef and five friends from his town of Adi Qeyih boarded a boat bound for Yemen. That night, it capsized. Only 56 people of the nearly 200 people on board survived. Yosef was not one of them.",
      "\u201cHis parents are in deep shock and grief,\u201d his uncle, Redae Barhe, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey can\u2019t even voice their sorrow.\u201d",

      "The families they leave behind know that there are high odds of misfortune. Boats are often overcrowded, unable to withstand rough seas. Once on dry land, there are other dangers. Migrants are vulnerable, with few resources or protection, making them easy prey for human traffickers and kidnappers.",
      "Senait Tadesse says that her 27-year-old daughter made it to Yemen, only to be held captive by kidnappers who communicated with Tadesse through Facebook, demanding a US$ 6,000 ransom to release her only child.",
      "Tadesse said in an interview with The Associated Press in the capital, Addis Ababa, that she sold her car and all her jewelry to raise the cash and deposited the money in an Ethiopian bank account.",
      "But the kidnappers demanded more. She sold all her belongings; they still wanted more. Not knowing what else to do, she went to the police, armed with the local bank account number that the kidnappers had been using.",
      "Meanwhile, she was on Facebook, trying to get news of her daughter. Eventually, a post from a survivor confirmed that Tadesse\u2019s daughter had been killed. To date, no arrests have been made.",
      "Although Ethiopia has been relatively stable since the war in the country\u2019s Tigray region ended in 2022, youth unemployment is high and there are still pockets of unrest.",
      "\u201cMany young people no longer see a future for themselves within a nation that does not prioritize their needs,\u201d explained Yared Hailemariam, an Ethiopian human rights advocate based in Addis Ababa. \u201cThe cause of this migration is lack of economic opportunities and growing conflicts. Young people are faced with a choice of either taking up arms to fight in endless conflicts, or providing for their families.\u201d",
      "The war in Tigray was the reason why Nigus Yosef never finished school. When the conflict started in 2020, he was in 7th Grade, and he dropped out to join the Tigray armed forces. When the ceasefire was signed in 2022, he came back home, but couldn\u2019t find a job. After three years, he was desperate.",
      "Residents in the region say that traffickers seize on that desperation, and that their networks extend even into remote areas and rural villages.",
      "Eden Shumiye was just 13 when she left Adi Qeyih with Yosef and his friends. Her parents say that she was preyed on by people smugglers during the town\u2019s public market day, and that they convinced her to leave with the group. Her parents heard nothing from her until one of the other migrants called them when they reached Wuha Limat, near the Ethiopia-Djibouti border. The news left them sick with worry.",
      "After the boat capsized, a relative of one of the survivors managed to send a voice message to them from Saudi Arabia via the messaging app Imo, confirming that Eden\u2019s dead body had been recovered. Of the six young people who left Adi Qeyih, only two survived.",

      "Even at this late stage, a remarkable 30% or so of voters remain undecided. Polls show the two leading right-wing candidates, multimillionaire business owner Samuel Doria Medina and former President Jorge Fernando \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga, locked in a virtual dead heat.",
      "But a right-wing victory isn't assured. Many longtime voters for the governing Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party, now shattered by infighting, live in rural areas and tend to be undercounted in polling.",

      "\u201cA victory for either right-wing candidate could have grave repercussions for Bolivia\u2019s Indigenous and impoverished communities,\u201d said Kathryn Ledebur, director of the Andean Information Network, a Bolivian research group. \u201cBoth candidates could bolster security forces and right-wing para-state groups, paving the way for violent crackdowns on protests expected to erupt over the foreign exploitation of lithium and drastic austerity measures.\u201d",
      "All 130 seats in Bolivia\u2019s Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Parliament, are up for grabs, along with 36 in the Senate, the upper house.",
      "If, as is widely expected, no one receives more than 50% of the vote, or 40% of the vote with a lead of 10 percentage points, the top two candidates will compete in a runoff on Oct. 19 for the first time since Bolivia's 1982 return to democracy.",

      "Bolivians are voting for a new president and parliament in elections.",
      "LA PAZ, Bolivia -- Bolivia's presidential vote headed to an unprecedented runoff after elections Sunday that ended more than two decades of left-wing dominance in the Andean nation but signaled voters' trepidation about a major lurch to the right.",
      "A dark horse centrist, Sen. Rodrigo Paz, drew more votes than the right-wing front-runners, although not enough to secure an outright victory, early results showed.",
      "Paz, a former mayor who has sought to soften the edges of the opposition\u2019s push for tough austerity to rescue Bolivia from a looming economic collapse, will face off against right-wing former President Jorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga, who finished second. Bolivia holds the presidential runoff \u2014 its first since its 1982 return to democracy \u2014 on Oct. 19.",
      "\u201cThis economic model must change,\" Paz declared to crowds who cheered and chanted, \u201cRenewal!\"",
      "Paz\u2019s campaign gained unexpected traction in recent weeks as he teamed up with Edman Lara, a social media savvy ex-police captain with evangelical backing whose supporters see him as a bold leader willing to stand up to corruption in the security forces.",
      "With over 91% of the ballots counted Sunday, Paz received 32.8% of the votes cast. Quiroga secured 26.4%. Candidates needed to surpass 50%, or 40% with a 10-point margin of victory, to avoid a runoff.",
      "Addressing fans and flanked by family as confetti hearts sprayed from the ceiling, Quiroga congratulated Paz on his lead.",
      "\u201cWhat happened is unprecedented,\u201d he said. \u201cBolivia told the world that we want to live in a free nation.\u201d",
      "The results delivered a stunning blow to Bolivia's hegemonic Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party, which has governed Bolivia almost uninterrupted since its founder, charismatic ex-President Evo Morales, rose to power as part of the \u201cpink tide\u201d of leftist leaders that swept into office across Latin America during the commodities boom of the early 2000s.",
      "The official MAS candidate, Eduardo del Castillo, finished sixth with just 3.2% of the vote. A leftist candidate considered to be the party's best hope, 36-year-old Senate president Andr\u00f3nico Rodr\u00edguez, captured 8% of the vote.",
      "During his almost 14 years in power, Morales expanded the rights of the country\u2019s Indigenous majority, defended coca growers against U.S.-backed eradication programs and poured natural gas profits into social programs.",
      "But the maverick leader\u2019s increasingly high-handed attempts to prolong his presidency \u2014 along with allegations of sexual relations with underage girls \u2014 soured public opinion against him.",
      "Simmering discontent turned into a tidal wave of outrage as Bolivia\u2019s once-stable economy imploded under Morales\u2019 prot\u00e9g\u00e9-turned-rival, President Luis Arce.",
      "Annual inflation rate has soared from 2% less than two years ago to 25% as of last month. A scarcity of fuel has paralyzed the country. A desperate shortage of U.S. dollars needed to pay for essential imports like wheat has crippled the economy.",
      "As the crisis accelerated, MAS leaders traded blame. A power struggle between Morales and Arce fractured the bloc and handed the opposition its first real shot at victory in decades even as its uncharismatic candidates failed to unite.",
      "In perhaps the most visible sign of how fed up Bolivians are with the party, leftist politicians casting their ballots across Bolivia on Sunday faced barrages of boos, insults and thrown objects.",
      "Blocked from running by a court ruling on term limits, Morales has been holed up in his tropical stronghold of Chapare for months evading an arrest warrant for allegedly impregnating a 15-year-old girl while president.",
      "He has branded Rodr\u00edguez a traitor for competing and encouraged his supporters to register their anger at his exclusion by casting null-and-void ballots.",
      "His followers appeared to heed his calls: An unusually high proportion of votes, 19%, were deemed invalid. Usually the share of blank and null votes doesn't exceed 6%.",

      "He's the son of former President Jaime Paz Zamora, who began his political career as a co-founder of the Revolutionary Left Movement, a radical party persecuted under the bloody military dictatorship of Hugo Banzer in the 1970s, before striking a pact with Banzer\u2019s right-wing party in order to become president from 1989 to 1993.",

      "\u201cThe Prophet himself says a man who does not help support his wife and children is not a good Muslim,\u201d the 53-year-old said, as he described bathing his baby and helping his wife with other duties.",
      "Some of the 14 men chuckled, not quite sold. Others applauded.",
      "Diane was taking part in a \u201cschool for husbands,\u201d a United Nations-backed initiative where respected male community members learn about \u201cpositive masculinity\u201d in health and social issues and promote them in their communities.",
      "In Senegal, as in many other West African countries with large rural or conservative populations, men often have the final say in major household decisions, including ones related to health.",
      "Women may need their permission for life-changing decisions on accessing family planning or other reproductive health services, along with hospital deliveries or prenatal care.",
      "Following his sessions at the school for husbands, Diane regularly holds sermons during Friday prayers where he discusses issues around gender and reproductive health, from gender-based violence to fighting stigma around HIV.",
      "\u201cMany women appreciate my sermons,\" he said. \u201cThey say their husbands' behavior changed since they attended them.\" He said some men have told him the sermons inspired them to become more caring husbands and fathers.",
      "Habib Diallo, a 60-year-old former army commando, said attending the sermons and discussions with the imam taught him about the risks of home births.",
      "\u201cWhen my son\u2019s wife was pregnant, I encouraged him to take her to the hospital for the delivery,\u201d Diallo said. \u201cAt first, he was hesitant. He worried about the cost and didn\u2019t trust the hospital. But when I explained how much safer it would be for both his wife and the baby, he agreed.\u201d",
      "The program launched in Senegal in 2011 but in recent years has caught the attention of the Ministry of Women, Family, Gender and Child Protection, which sees it an effective strategy to combat maternal and infant mortality.",
      "\u201cWithout men\u2019s involvement, attitudes around maternal health won\u2019t change,\" said 54-year-old Aida Diouf, a female health worker who collaborates with the program. Many husbands prefer their wives not be treated by male health workers, she said.",
      "The classes for husbands follow similar efforts in other African countries, particularly Niger, Togo, and Burkina Faso, where the United Nations Population Fund says it improved women\u2019s access to reproductive health services by increasing male involvement, growing the use of contraceptives by both men and women and expanding access to prenatal care and skilled birth attendants.",
      "Discussions for men also have focused on girls\u2019 rights, equality and the harmful effects of female genital mutilation.",
      "The program now operates over 20 schools in Senegal, and over 300 men have been trained.",
      "In some communities, men who once enforced patriarchal norms now promote gender equality, which has led to a reduction in the number of forced marriages and more acceptance of family planning, according to Senegal\u2019s ministry of gender.",

      "With three months remaining until the election, polls show Kast and Jara vying for the top two spots. This scenario suggests they would face each other in a second-round runoff on Dec. 14.",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve spent my entire life breaking down prejudices, as an actor, as a worker and as a citizen,\u201d he said last month when announcing his plans to run as an independent candidate. \u201cWe all deserve the same opportunities.\u201d",

      "The suspect, Usman Qazi is claimed to have links with the outlawed Majeed Brigade, the suicide squad of the Balochistan Liberation Army, according to the province\u2019s Chief Minister, Sarfraz Bugti.",
      "During a press conference in the city of Quetta, Bugti showed video footage with Qazi admitting to planning the thwarted attack as well as aiding militants in recent years. It was unclear whether Qazi made those remarks under duress.",
      "Bugti did not clarify when the arrest was made, and only said the man was still being questioned.",
      "The arrest comes a week after the U.S. State Department designated BLA and the Majeed Brigade a foreign terrorist organization. The group is already banned at home.",

      "The Bayeux Tapestry, a medieval masterpiece depicting the 1066 Norman conquest of England, is set for a new chapter",
      "BAYEUX, France -- For centuries, the storytelling masterpiece has been a source of wonder and fascination. In vivid and gruesome detail, the 70-meter (230-foot) embroidered cloth recounts how a fierce duke from France conquered England in 1066, reshaping British and European history.",
      "The Bayeux Tapestry, with its scenes of sword-wielding knights in ferocious combat and King Harold of England's famous death, pierced by an arrow to an eye, has since the 11th century served as a sobering parable of military might, vengeance, betrayal and the complexity of Anglo-French relations, long seeped with blood and rivalry but also affection and cooperation.",
      "Now, the medieval forerunner of today's comic strips, commissioned as propaganda for the Normandy duke William known as \u201cthe Conqueror\u201d after he took the English throne from Harold, is being readied for a new narrative mission.",
      "Next year, the fragile artistic and historic treasure will be gingerly transported from its museum in Bayeux, Normandy, to star in a blockbuster exhibition in London's British Museum, from September 2026 to July 2027.",
      "Its first U.K. outing in almost 1,000 years will testify to the warming latest chapter in ties across the English Channel that chilled with the U.K.'s acrimonous departure from the European Union in 2020. The loan was announced in July when French President Emmanuel Macron became the first EU head of state to pay a state visit to the U.K. since Brexit.",
      "Bayeux Museum curator Antoine Verney says the cross-Channel trip will be a home-coming of sorts for the tapestry, because historians widely believe that it was embroidered in England, using woolen threads on linen canvas, and because William's victory at the Battle of Hastings was such a major juncture in English history, seared into the U.K.'s collective consciousness.",
      "\u201cFor the British, the date \u2014 the only date \u2014 that all of them know is 1066,\u201d Verney said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Moving an artwork so unwieldy \u2014 made from nine pieces of linen fabric stitched together and showing 626 characters, 37 buildings, 41 ships and 202 horses and mules in a total of 58 scenes \u2014 is further complicated by its great age and the wear-and-tear of time.",
      "\u201cThere is always a risk. The goal is for those risks to be as carefully calculated as possible,\u201d said Verney, the curator.",
      "Believed to have been commissioned by Bishop Odo, William the Conqueror\u2019s half-brother, to decorate a new cathedral in Bayeux in 1077, the treasure is thought to have remained there, mostly stored in a wooden chest and almost unknown, for seven centuries, surviving the French Revolution, fires and other perils.",
      "Since then, only twice is the embroidery known to have been exhibited outside of the Normandy city: Napoleon Bonaparte had it shown off in Paris' Louvre Museum from late 1803 to early 1804. During World War II, it was displayed again in the Louvre in late 1944, after Allied forces that had landed in Normandy on D-Day, June 6th, of that year had fought onward to Paris and liberated it.",

      "The work, seen by more than 15 million visitors in its Bayeux museum since 1983, \u201chas the unique characteristic of being both monumental and very fragile,\u201d Verney said. \u201cThe textile fibers are 900 years old. So they have naturally degraded simply due to age. But at the same time, this is a work that has already traveled extensively and been handled a great deal.\u201d",
      "During the treasure's stay in the U.K., its museum in Bayeux will be getting a major facelift costing tens of millions of euros (dollars). The doors will close to visitors from Sept. 1 this year, with reopening planned for October 2027, when the embroidery will be re-housed in a new building, encased on an inclined 70-meter long table that Verney said will totally transform the viewing experience.",

      "The U.S. Postal Service is facing congressional attempts to strip billions in federal EV funding",
      "WASHINGTON -- A year after being lauded for its plan to replace thousands of aging, gas-powered mail trucks with a mostly electric fleet, the U.S. Postal Service is facing congressional attempts to strip billions in federal EV funding.",
      "In June, the Senate parliamentarian blocked a Republican proposal in a major tax-and-spending bill to sell off the agency's new electric vehicles and infrastructure and revoke remaining federal money. But efforts to halt the fleet\u2019s shift to clean energy continue in the name of cost savings.",
      "Donald Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers\u2019 Association, said canceling the program now would have the opposite effect, squandering millions of dollars.",
      "\u201cI think it would be shortsighted for Congress to now suddenly decide they\u2019re going to try to go backwards and take the money away for the EVs or stop that process because that\u2019s just going to be a bunch of money on infrastructure that\u2019s been wasted,\" he said.",
      "Beyond that, many in the scientific community fear the government could pass on an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming when urgent action is needed.",
      "A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks. That's a fraction of the more than 6,000 million metric tons emitted annually in the United States, said professor Gregory A. Keoleian, co-director of the university's Center for Sustainable Systems. But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re already falling short of goals for reducing emissions,\u201d Keoleian said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making progress, but the actions being taken or proposed will really reverse decarbonization progress that has been made to date.\u201d",

Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said \u201cit didn't make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force.\" She said she will pursue legislation to rescind what is left of the $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act allocated to help cover the $10 billion cost of new postal vehicles.",
      "Ernst has called the EV initiative a \u201cboondoggle\u201d and \"a textbook example of waste,\u201d citing delays, high costs and concerns over cold-weather performance.",
      "\u201cYou always evaluate the programs, see if they are working. But the rate at which the company that\u2019s providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract,\" Ernst said during a recent appearance at the Iowa State Fair, referring to Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense.",
      "\u201cFor now,\u201d she added, \"gas-powered vehicles \u2014 use some ethanol in them \u2014 I think is wonderful.\u201d",

      "The Postal Service maintains that the production delay of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDVs, was \u201cvery modest\" and not unexpected.",
      "\u201cThe production quantity ramp-up was planned for and intended to be very gradual in the early months to allow time for potential modest production or supplier issues to be successfully resolved,\u201d spokesperson Kim Frum said.",
      "The independent, self-funded federal agency, which is paid for mostly by postage and product sales, is in the middle of a $40 billion, 10-year modernization and financial stabilization plan. The EV effort had the full backing of Democratic President Joe Biden, who pledged to move toward an all-electric federal fleet of car and trucks.",

      "Small-scale solar panels about the size of a door are poised to be plugged into more U.S. homes and apartments as homeowners and renters who want to harness the sun\u2019s energy look for cheaper alternatives to rooftop installations",
      "When Terrence Dwyer received a knock on his door and a flyer for a solar panel system small enough to fit on his deck, he was quickly sold. Solar systems that plug into regular wall outlets have been popular in Europe for years and are gaining traction in the U.S. for their affordability and simple installation.",
      "\u201cWe thought absolutely, let\u2019s do this right away,\u201d said Dwyer, who lives in Oakland, California.",
      "These small-scale solar systems could become attractive to more homeowners now that President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping budget-and-policy package will scrap residential rooftop solar tax credits and may shift interest to cheaper alternatives. Even before the GOP bill passed, manufacturers of the smaller systems known as plug-in or balcony solar were seeing increased demand and other positive signs such as a new Utah law streamlining regulations for homeowners to buy and install them. The systems about the size of a door haven\u2019t been as widely adopted in the U.S. as in Europe because of lack of awareness, patchwork utility rules and limited availability.",
      "The $2,000 plug-in solar system installed on Dwyer's backyard deck in March consists of two 400 watt panels, an inverter, a smart meter and a circuit breaker. It saves him around $35 per month on his power bill because he is consuming less energy from the grid, but he said reducing his carbon footprint was his primary motivation.",
      "\u201cWe like the environmental benefits of solar and wanted to engage with solar in some fashion,\u201d Dwyer said.",
      "Had Dwyer opted for rooftop solar, he would have paid $20,000 for the system and $30,000 to upgrade his roof to support the panels.",
      "Installing a plug-in solar system requires some homework. What power companies let customers do with energy-generating equipment varies, which is why prospective purchasers should check their utility\u2019s policies first. Building permits might be required depending on the municipality. Some systems can be self-installed, while others may require an electrician. For example, some kits have meters that must be wired into a home's circuit breaker.",
      "Dwyer bought his system from Bright Saver, a nonprofit company in California that advocates for plug-in solar. In addition to the type Dwyer bought, the company also offers a smaller model costing $399 that recently sold out in six days.",
      "\u201cThe interest and demand have been overwhelming,\u201d said Cora Stryker, a founder of Bright Saver. \u201cIt is clear that we are hitting a nerve \u2014 many Americans have wanted solar for a long time but have not had an option that is feasible and affordable for them until now.\u201d",
      "Kevin Chou, another founder of Bright Saver, said wider adoption of the systems in the U.S. has been hindered by utility policies that create uncertainty about whether they're allowed and a lack of state and local policies to make clear what rules apply.",
      "Some utilities contacted by The Associated Press say plug-in solar systems require the same interconnection applications as rooftop panels that send electricity back to the wider network. But Steven Hegedus, an electrical engineering professor at University of Delaware, said he doesn't understand why a utility would need to require an interconnection agreement for plug-in solar because, unlike rooftop systems, they are designed to prevent energy from flowing to the grid.",
      "Still, if in doubt, a customer should follow their utility's policy.",
      "During the early days of plug-in solar's growth, some opposition from utilities is likely since customers are buying less energy, said Robert Cudd, a research analyst at the California Center for Sustainable Communities at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cUtilities really prefer everyone being a predictable and generous consumer of the electricity they sell,\u201d Cudd said.",
      "This year, Utah enacted a novel law supporting plug-in solar by exempting certain small-scale systems from interconnection agreements and establishing safety requirements such as being certified by a nationally recognized testing organization such as Underwriters Laboratories. It appears to be the only state that's passed legislation supporting plug-in solar, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Republican state Rep. Raymond Ward, who sponsored the legislation, said the smaller systems allow people to better manage where their energy comes from and what they pay.",
      "\u201cEurope has these things. You can go buy them and they work and people want them. There is no reason why we shouldn\u2019t have them here in the United States,\u201d Ward said.",

      "Some questions remain about how much customers could save. Severin Borenstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business, said the cost of some portable solar systems in the U.S. would make it hard for customers to come out ahead on their utility bills over the time they own them. He estimates the price of a $2,000 system in the U.S. works out to paying about $0.20 a kilowatt-hour over a 25-year period, which only saves people money if they have high utility costs. By comparison, Borenstein said the cost of systems sold in Europe, typically around $600, is equivalent to paying about $0.05 or $0.06 per kilowatt-hour over 25 years.",
      "Baltimore resident Craig Keenan said saving money was only part of why he installed one of the smaller Bright Saver models on his balcony in July.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m interested in renewable energy because the amount of carbon emissions that we produce as a species is very, very unsustainable for our world,\u201d he said.",

The company's basic kits contain a solar panel that can fit in a backyard or other sunny space, along with equipment to maintain and regulate the flow of energy including an inverter and smart meter.",
      "Kenneth Hutchings, Craftstrom\u2019s chief revenue officer, said their U.S. sales rose this year even before the passage of the GOP tax bill, and he expects demand for plug-in solar to increase further as federal rooftop solar credits expire.",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average flirted with its own record, which was set in December, before ending just below the mark with a rise of 34 points, or 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite dipped 0.4%, though it\u2019s still near its record set on Wednesday.",
      "The U.S. stock market reached all-time highs this past week as expectations built that the Federal Reserve  will deliver a cut to interest rates at its next meeting in September.

      "A disappointing report about inflation at the U.S. wholesale level made traders pare back bets for coming cuts to interest rates on Thursday, but they\u2019re still overwhelmingly expecting them. Such anticipation has sent Treasury yields lower in the bond market, though they inched higher Friday following some mixed updates on the economy.",

      "The U.S. has seen a record increase in tariff income, with a 273% rise in customs revenue from last year",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. budget deficit in July climbed 20% this fiscal year compared to the last despite the U.S. taking in record income from President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, according to Treasury Department data released Tuesday.",
      "The U.S. saw a 273% increase \u2014 or $21 billion \u2014 in customs revenue in July over the same period last year, the data showed.",
      "A Treasury official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the data said overall increased spending is in part due to a mix of expenditures, including growing interest payments on the public debt and cost-of-living increases to Social Security payouts, among other costs. This comes as the federal government\u2019s gross national debt creeps up to the $37 trillion mark.",
      "Even as Trump talks about America becoming rich because of his import tax hikes, federal spending keeps outpacing the revenues collected by the government. That financial picture might change as companies exhaust their pre-tariff inventories, forcing them to import more goods and generate even more in tax revenues that could whittle away at the deficit without meaningfully reducing it as promised.",
      "If tariffs fail to deliver on Trump's pledge to improve the government's balance sheet, the American public could be faced with fewer job options, more inflationary pressures and higher interest rates on mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. The budget deficit is the annual gap between what the U.S. government raises in taxes and what it spends, over time feeding into the overall national debt.",
      "While organizations like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget say that tariff income can be a stream of meaningful revenue \u2014 estimated to generate about $1.3 trillion over the course of President Trump\u2019s four-year term in office; some economists like Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Penn Wharton Budget Model say tariffs are likely to result \u201c in only modest reductions in federal debt.\u201d",
      "In June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall. But revenue estimates are also difficult to predict as the president has changed his tariff rates repeatedly and the taxes declared as part of an economic emergency are currently under appeal in a U.S. court.",

      "\u201cI think I told Gibbons \u2018All right, let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got here right away,\u2019\u201d Mendoza said.",
      "The Mets might have themselves a keeper.",
      "The 24-year-old right-hander made a highlight reel double play to escape the third inning and earned the win in his major league debut on Saturday when he tossed 5 1/3 scoreless frames to help the Mets to a much-needed 3-1 victory over the Seattle Mariners.",
      "McLean allowed two hits, walked four and struck out eight in the longest scoreless outing by a Mets starter since June 11, when David Peterson shut out the Washington Nationals. New York\u2019s rotation entered Saturday averaging 4.96 innings per appearance.",
      "\u201cWe needed that \u2014 as a team, as an organization, given where we\u2019re at and how hard it\u2019s been for us,\u201d Mendoza said after the Mets won for just the third time in 17 games.",
      "McLean showed off a five-pitch arsenal that included a high-70s curveball, a high-80s sweeper, a 90-mph cutter and sinkers and fastballs both measured in the high 90s. He limited the Mariners to one hit in 10 plate appearances with a runner on base.",
      "The former two-way player \u2014 a third-round pick of the Mets out of Oklahoma State in 2023 \u2014 also displayed his athleticism in the third. McLean walked J.P. Crawford and Cole Young before Cal Raleigh\u2019s one-out single loaded the bases for Julio Rodr\u00edguez, who has 10 homers since the All-Star Break.",
      "But McLean made a no-look, behind-the-back grab of Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s comebacker and began the 1-4-3 double play. First baseman Pete Alonso grinned widely as he looked at the ball in his glove and McLean smiled while walking off the mound.",
      "\u201cI try to stay as athletic as possible,\u201d McLean said. \u201cBut I think that play was majority luck, honestly.\u201d",

      "Georgia teenager Mason Howell has won the U.S. Amateur final at The Olympic Club",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Georgia teenager Mason Howell capped a productive summer before his senior year of high school by winning the U.S. Amateur at The Olympic Club on Sunday just two months after competing in his first U.S. Open.",
      "Howell, who turned 18 in June, raced out to a big lead over Tennessee teenager Jackson Herrington on the opening 18 holes and went on to win the 36-hole final 7 and 6 to surpass Tiger Woods and become the third youngest U.S. Amateur champion ever. Only Byeong Hun An, who won at age 17 in 2009, and Danny Lee, who won a month after his 18th birthday in 2008, were younger.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all jumbled together,\u201d Howell said of his emotions. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a great week. To have my name next to these other names on this trophy is unbelievable. To be next to somebody named Tiger is an unreal feeling.\u201d",
      "Howell won it with a par to halve the 30th hole, ending the most-lopsided final since Bryson DeChambeau also beat Derek Bard 7 and 6 in 2015. The win earned Howell invitations to the Masters, U.S. Open and British Open next year. He also got a spot in the Walker Cup matches down the coast at Cypress Point in September.",
      "\u201cI felt like I always had it,\" Howell said of his play this summer. \"It\u2019s self-belief. I knew it was in me. I just needed to walk with some confidence and I think that would translate to good golf and staying positive.",
      "This was the first U.S. Amateur final featuring two teenagers since Matt Fitzpatrick bested Oliver Goss in 2013 and Howell showed the composure of a much more experienced golfer by repeatedly making clutch putts while Herrington made repeated mistakes.",
      "Howell won 11 holes, eight of them with pars. He also responded after all four holes he lost, winning the following hole each time.",
      "Howell burst onto the scene when he qualified for the U.S. Open this year with rounds of 63-63 from the Atlanta sectional. He failed to make the cut at Oakmont but used that experience this week at The Olympic Club.",
      "He was one of 17 players to advance from a 20-man playoff to make the match play portion of the tournament, where he won all six matches.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I have known how good he is for a long time,\u201d said his father, Robert Howell. \u201cHe\u2019s had a phenomenal breakout summer.\u201d",
      "Howell won five of six holes on the front nine of the opening 18 holes \u2014 including an eagle at No. 7 \u2014 to take a four-hole lead. He increased the lead to five with a birdie on the par-5 16th hole as his steady putting helped keep Herrington at bay.",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s one thing we really wanted to start off with today was get the lead through nine,\" Howell said. \"We got off to such a good start. I wanted to keep my foot on the gas, but I didn\u2019t want to do anything dumb. I knew if I hit it to a lot of the center of the greens and two-putted that would be good enough.\"",
      "Herrington closed the first 18 with a birdie on the par-5 18th to get back within four. But he then bogeyed the first three holes after the lunch break to fall down by six and never really threatened the rest of the way.",
      "\u201cHe played good, and I didn\u2019t play great,\u201d Herrington said. \u201cIt was unfortunate I was that way, but I learned a lot about myself.\u201d",
      "Howell now gets ready for his senior year of high school \u2014 which started this past week \u2014 before he is set to start college at the University of Georgia in 2026.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, I still have to go sit in a classroom for eight hours these coming months,\u201d Howell said. \u201cJust got to soak this up and really enjoy this one with friends and family.\u201d",
      "The 19-year-old Herrington is about to start his sophomore season in college at Tennessee.",
      "This is the fourth U.S. Amateur to be held at The Olympic Club. Charles Coe (1958), Nathaniel Crosby (1981) and Cole Knost (2007) won the others.",

      "Jaxson Dart shined in his preseason home debut for the New York Giants as they beat the Jets 31-12",
      "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Getting snaps with the first-team offense, then throwing for a touchdown and running for another with the backups, Jaxson Dart shined in his new home stadium debut for the New York Giants as part of a 31-12 victory against the Jets on Saturday night in each team's second preseason game.",
      "The rookie first-round pick whom the Giants envision as their long-term franchise quarterback got a chance to show a little bit of how he could contribute in the near future by subbing in for starter Russell Wilson mid-drive and connecting with Theo Johnson on a 30-yard pass. Dart capped a 71-yard second half-opening drive with a TD throw to Greg Dulcich and scored on a goal-line sneak to finish another after completing 13 consecutive passes.",
      "Dart was 14 of 16 for 137 yards, delivering on the hype under the lights at MetLife Stadium before giving way to Jameis Winston.",
      "\u201cI thought guys were making great plays for me,\u201d Dart said. \u201cI was just trying to distribute the ball to the playmakers.\u201d",
      "Wilson had his own highlight, throwing his so-called \u201cmoon ball\u201d to undrafted free agent Beaux Collins for an 80-yard gain.",
      "\u201cJust great vision by Russ to lay it up there,\u201d coach Brian Daboll said. \u201cWhat a great ball by Russ, right? An 80-yard bomb, he dropped it in the bucket.\u201d",
      "The 36-had another intercepted because of a miscommunication with Collins, his final throw of a 4 of 7, 108-yard performance.",
      "\u201cWe were on two different pages, I guess,\u201d said Wilson, who is glad to get some extended playing time with his new team. \u201cThe good thing is it happened in the preseason. You get to see it and talk about it, and that\u2019s why you play these games, man. You just get better, you learn and we all work together.\u201d",
      "While the Giants (2-0) got clicking, questions remain on offense for Justin Fields and the Jets (1-1). He left after two run-heavy series 1 of 5 for 4 yards, with Nick Folk's 38-yard field goal the only points the starters got on the board.",
      "\"We were sloppy, and the guys know that,\" first-year coach Aaron Glenn said. \u201cOverall, in general, it wasn\u2019t good enough. I don\u2019t care if it was the starting offense, I don\u2019t care if it was the second-team offense, the third-team offense.\u201d",
      "That performance came after Fields, signed to a two-year, $40 million deal to replace Aaron Rodgers, was 3 of 4 for 42 yards and a 13-yard TD run in the exhibition opener at Green Bay last Saturday. Fields said it \u201cwasn't up to our standards.\u201d",

      "With most of the starters sitting out for both teams Denver Broncos backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham threw a pair of touchdown passes to Troy Franklin in a 27-7 rout of the Arizona Cardinals",
      "DENVER -- Troy Franklin caught two touchdown passes from Jarrett Stidham and the Denver Broncos rolled over the Arizona Cardinals 27-7 on Saturday night in a matchup of mostly backups.",
      "With both teams sitting the majority of their starters following a productive and spirited joint practice on Thursday, Stidham followed up a spectacular preseason debut in relief of Bo Nix at San Francisco with another stellar performance.",
      "He completed 16 of 23 passes for 240 yards and TDs of 27 and 17 yards to Franklin before giving way to Sam Ehlinger in the second half. Ehlinger completed 14 of 16 passes for 162 yards.",
      "\u201cGot outplayed tonight,\u201d Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon said. \u201cThat was obvious by the score.\u201d",
      "Which could have been worse were it not for cornerback Elijah Jones punching the ball out of tight end Caden Prieskorn\u2019s arms at the 1 and linebacker Vi Jones smothering it in the end zone for a touchback.",
      "Denver's top-to-bottom defense had another solid outing, too. The Cardinals (1-1) converted just 2 of 13 third downs a week after the Broncos held San Francisco to 1 of 12.",
      "That's another indication the Broncos have progressed to the point there will be some difficult decisions on cut-down day.",
      "\u201cI'd rather be in that position than the position we were in two years ago at this time,\u201d Broncos coach Sean Payton said, adding, \"I think there are going to be some players that end up on other teams, playing. And that's part of the deal.\u201d",
      "Stidham's first drive covered 97 yards in just four plays. It featured a 58-yard catch and run by tight end Evan Engram and ended with an 8-yard touchdown run by rookie running back R.J. Harvey, a second-round selection by Denver (2-0).",
      "After Jacoby Brissett (6 for 8 for 57 yards) replied with a 16-yard TD toss to Simi Fehoko, Stidham hit Franklin for a 27-yard touchdown down the left sideline. His 17-yard strike to Franklin with 45 seconds left before halftime made it 24-7.",
      "Franklin's stellar summer has continued in the preseason, cementing his role as one of Denver's top-flight receivers.",
      "\u201cI think I'm just more comfortable, got a little bit more freedom to just go out there and play,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cAnd also just knowing the offense as a whole.\u201d",

      "Outer space has emerged as the world's next battlefield, demonstrated by recent cyberattacks on satellites blamed on Russia",
      "WASHINGTON -- As Russia held its Victory Day parade this year, hackers backing the Kremlin hijacked an orbiting satellite that provides television service to Ukraine.",
      "Instead of normal programing, Ukrainian viewers saw parade footage beamed in from Moscow: waves of tanks, soldiers and weaponry. The message was meant to intimidate, and it was also an illustration that 21st century war is waged not just on land, sea and air but also in cyberspace and the reaches of outer space.",
      "Disabling a satellite could deal a devastating blow without a single bullet, and it can be done by targeting the satellite's security software or disrupting its ability to send or receive signals from Earth.",
      "\u201cIf you can impede a satellite's ability to communicate, you can cause a significant disruption,\u201d said Tom Pace, CEO of NetRise, a cybersecurity firm focused on protecting supply chains. He served in the Marines before working on cyber issues at the Department of Energy.",
      "\u201cThink about GPS,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine if a population lost that, and the confusion it would cause.\u201d",
      "More than 12,000 operating satellites now orbit the planet, playing a critical role not just in broadcast communications but also in military operations, navigation systems like GPS, intelligence gathering and economic supply chains. They are also key to early launch-detection efforts, which can warn of approaching missiles.",
      "That makes them a significant national security vulnerability, and a prime target for anyone looking to undermine an adversary's economy or military readiness \u2014 or to deliver a psychological blow like the hackers supporting Russia did when they hijacked television signals to Ukraine.",
      "Hackers typically look for the weakest link in the software or hardware that supports a satellite or controls its communications with Earth. The actual orbiting device may be secure, but if it's running on outdated software, it can be easily exploited.",
      "As Russian forces invaded Ukraine in 2022, someone targeted Viasat, the U.S.-based satellite company used by Ukraine's government and military. The hack, which Kyiv blamed on Moscow, used malware to infect tens of thousands of modems, creating an outage affecting wide swaths of Europe.",
      "National security officials say Russia is developing a nuclear, space-based weapon designed to take out virtually every satellite in low-Earth orbit at once. The weapon would combine a physical attack that would ripple outward, destroying more satellites, while the nuclear component is used to fry their electronics.",
      "U.S. officials declassified information about the weapon after Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, issued a public warning about the technology. Turner has pushed for the Department of Defense to provide a classified briefing to lawmakers on the weapon, which, if deployed, would violate an international treaty prohibiting weapons of mass destruction in space.",
      "Turner said such a weapon could render low-Earth orbit unusable for satellites for as long as a year. If it were used, the effects would be devastating: potentially leaving the U.S. and its allies vulnerable to economic upheaval and even a nuclear attack.",
      "Russia and China also would lose satellites, though they are believed to be less reliant on the same kinds of satellites as the U.S.",
      "Turner compared the weapon, which is not yet ready for deployment, to Sputnik, the Russian satellite that launched the space age in 1957.",
      "\u201cIf this anti-satellite nuclear weapon would be put in space, it would be the end of the space age,\u201d Turner said. \u201cIt should never be permitted to go into outer space. This is the Cuban Missile Crisis in space.\u201d",

In Alabama, a rebuilt spit of land is shielding a historic town and providing wildlife habitat.",
      "Coastal communities nationwide are ramping up efforts to fend off rising seas, higher tides and stronger storm surges that are chewing away at coastlines, pushing saltwater farther inland and threatening ecosystems and communities.",
      "The need for coastal restoration has been in the spotlight this month after Louisiana officials canceled a $3 billion project because of objections from the fishing industry and concerns about rising costs. The Mid-Barataria project was projected to rebuild more than 20 square miles (32 square kilometers) of land over about 50 years by diverting sediment-laden water from the Mississippi River.",
      "But work continues on many other projects in Louisiana and around the country, including barrier islands, saltwater marshes, shellfish reefs and other natural features that provided protection before they were destroyed or degraded by development. Communities are also building flood walls, berms and levees to protect areas that lack adequate natural protection.",
      "The work has become more urgent as climate change causes more intense and destructive storms and leads to sea-level rise that puts hundreds of communities and tens of millions of people at risk, scientists say.",
      "\u201cThe sooner we can make these coastlines more resilient the better,\u201d said Doug George, a geological oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "In the U.S., perhaps nowhere is more vulnerable than the hurricane-prone Gulf Coast. Louisiana alone has lost more than 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) of coastline \u2014 more than any other state \u2014 over the past century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Historically, sediment deposited by the Mississippi and other rivers rebuilt land and nourished shore-buffering marshes. But that function was disrupted by the construction of channels and levees, along with other development.",
      "The dangers were magnified in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina breached flood walls and levees, submerging 80% of New Orleans and killing almost 1,400 people \u2014 followed closely by Hurricane Rita.",
      "Afterward, the state formed the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority to lessen risks from storm surges and stem land loss.",
      "Most of the almost $18 billion spent in the past 20 years was to shore up levees, flood walls and other structures, the authority said.",
      "Dozens of other projects are completed, planned or underway, including rebuilding marshes and other habitat with sediment dredged from waterways and restoring river flow to areas that have lacked it for years.",
      "On Louisiana\u2019s Chandeleur Islands, a barrier island chain, the state will pump in sand to help rebuild them, which will dampen storm surges and benefit sea turtles and other wildlife, said Katie Freer-Leonards, who leads development of the state\u2019s 2029 coastal master plan.",
      "The authority is digging a channel to allow water and sediment from the Mississippi River to flow into part of Maurepas Swamp, a roughly 218-square-mile forested wetland northwest of New Orleans that has been \u201cdying for over a century\u201d because of levees, project manager Brad Miller said.",
      "Sediment dredged from elsewhere also has been pumped into thousands of acres of sinking marshes to nourish them and raise their levels.",

      "In Bayou La Batre, Alabama \u2014 a fishing village built in the late 1700s \u2014 The Nature Conservancy built breakwaters offshore, then pumped in sediment and built ridges, now covered with vegetation. That created a \u201cspeed bump\u201d that has helped protect the town from erosion, said Judy Haner, the Alabama Nature Conservancy\u2019s coastal programs director.",

      "Habitat restoration, not climate change, was the primary consideration when planning began about 20 years ago to restore marshland along the south end of San Francisco Bay, destroyed when ponds were created to harvest sea salt.",

      "Federal officials say Arizona, Nevada and Mexico must again live with less Colorado River water as drought lingers in the West",
      "DENVER -- Arizona, Nevada and Mexico will again live with less water from the Colorado River as drought lingers in the West, federal officials announced Friday.",
      "The Colorado River is a critical lifeline to seven U.S. states, 30 Native American tribes, and two Mexican states. The cuts are based on projections for levels at federal reservoirs \u2014 chief among them Lake Powell and Lake Mead \u2014 released every August by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "Arizona will again go without 18% of its total Colorado River allocation, while Mexico loses 5%. The reduction for Nevada \u2014 which receives far less water than Arizona, California or Mexico \u2014 will stay at 7%. California won't face any cuts because it has senior water rights and is the last to lose in times of shortage.",
      "Decades of overuse and the effects of long-term drought worsened by climate change means there\u2019s far more demand for water than what actually flows through the river. Low reservoir levels at Lake Mead have triggered mandatory cutbacks every year since 2022, with the deepest cuts in 2023, which hit farmers in Arizona the hardest.",
      "Meanwhile, the states are working to reach agreement by next year on new long-term rules to govern the river in dry years. The Trump administration gave a mid-November deadline for states to reach a preliminary agreement, or risk federal intervention. Negotiations have faced delays as states push back against how much water they should each give up.",
      "The original 1922 Colorado River Compact was calculated based on an amount of water that doesn't exist in today's climate. That leaves the Upper Basin states of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and Utah to share far less water after the required amount is sent to the to the \u201cLower Basin\u201d states of Nevada, Arizona and California. Lots of water is also lost to evaporation and leaky infrastructure.",
      "Fairly splitting the river's water in the era of climate change has been vexing for years, with all of the major users hesitant to give anything up as they anticipate a drier future. There has to be enough water in the reservoirs to reach the tunnels that usher water downstream, and ideally, even more water for hydropower generation. Key infrastructure like the Hoover Dam rely on certain water levels in Lake Mead to generate electricity.",
      "Mandatory cuts and emergency water releases are \u201creactive,\" said John Berggren, a regional policy manager at Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit focused on climate change.",
      "\u201cIf we are going to be able to have a sustainable Colorado River and not just be responding to crisis after crisis, we need large amounts of flexibility built into this new set of guidelines,\" he said.",

Hamby, chairman of the Colorado River Board of California and a board member for the Imperial Irrigation District, the largest user of the river's water. Still, he knows California, like others, will likely have to give up more in the negotiations.",

      "The threatened species, which makes its habitat in warmer southern Gulf waters in places like Florida, was first seen July 26 off the southwestern coast of Cape Cod in the area of Nantucket Sound. Mashpee resident Jennifer Sullivan took a video of it swimming alongside paddle boarders in an inlet behind a marina surrounded by sea grass.",
      "She said on Monday that she found the manatee, which was as long and wide as her paddleboard, \u201cjust lazing around there in the grass going as slowly as possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was completely unfazed by us,\" said Sullivan, who went on to say she felt \u201cjust in awe of how graceful the creature was and to be so close in the wild to it.\u201d",
      "A few days later, the animal was seen stranded on the tidal flats in Mattapoisett. Bystanders who found the manatee beached on the flats around sunrise pushed it back into the water, said Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries Protected Species Program Manager Erin Burke.",
      "It hasn't been spotted since, Burke said, but a team with the International Fund for Animal Welfare is standing by to rescue the animal if it becomes necessary.",
      "The species prefers swimming in warmer waters, usually traveling only as far north as the Carolinas. If the manatee stays in water that is too cold for too long, it could suffer severe illness or death, said New England Aquarium Research Scientist Dr. Nadine Lysiak.",
      "Additionally, manatees are herbivores that sustain themselves on extensive seagrass beds and mangroves not typically found in New England.",
      "\u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t experience cold stunning, it may have some health declines associated with not having enough food, not having enough water,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s important to intervene as soon as it's sighted again to prevent health declines.\u201d",
      "Lysiak said it's unclear how and why the manatee found its way so far north. It may have followed the warm water Gulf Stream current system from Florida up past the Carolinas and eventually found its way to New England, she said.",
      "\u201cWe have kind of an average understanding of what a wild population does in terms of their range, or their habitat range, and some individuals will go beyond that and maybe wander or seek out other habitats or other food sources,\" she said. \"It\u2019s hard to know exactly why this manatee came to Cape Cod.\u201d",

      "Some cottontail rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, have been drawing attention because they have wart-like growths on their faces that look like horns",
      "DENVER -- A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there's no reason to be spooked \u2014 the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.",
      "The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.",
      "Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including \u201cFrankenstein bunnies,\u201d \u201cdemon rabbits\u201d and \u201czombie rabbits.\u201d But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.",
      "The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists' knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.",
      "The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.",
      "News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.",

      "\"People over-assign impact to actually pretty low-impact actions such as recycling, and underestimate the actual carbon impact of behaviors much more carbon intensive, like flying or eating meat,\" said Madalina Vlasceanu, report co-author and professor of environmental social sciences at Stanford University.",
      "The top three individual actions that help the climate, including avoiding plane flights, choosing not to get a dog and using renewable electricity, were also the three that participants underestimated the most. Meanwhile, the lowest-impact actions were changing to more efficient appliances and swapping out light bulbs, recycling, and using less energy on washing clothes. Those were three of the top four overestimated actions in the report.",
      "Vlasceanu said marketing focuses more on recycling and using energy-efficient light bulbs than on why flights or dog adoption are relatively bad for the climate, so participants were more likely to give those actions more weight.",

      "\u201cYou can see the bottle being recycled. That\u2019s visible. Whereas carbon emissions, that\u2019s invisible to the human eye. So that\u2019s why we don\u2019t associate emissions with flying,\u201d said Jiaying Zhao, who teaches psychology and sustainability at the University of British Columbia.",
      "Zhao added it's easier to bring actions to mind that we do more often. \u201cRecycling is an almost daily action, whereas flying is less frequent. It\u2019s less discussed,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result, people give a higher psychological weight to recycling.\u201d",
      "Of course, there is also a lot of misleading information. For example, some companies tout the recycling they do while not telling the public about pollution that comes from their overall operations.",

      "Dogs are big meat eaters, and meat is a significant contributor to climate change. That is because many of the farm animals, which will become food, release methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Beef is especially impactful, in part because around the world cattle are often raised on land that was illegally deforested. Since trees absorb carbon dioxide, the most abundant greenhouse gas, cutting them to then raise cattle is a double whammy.",
      "\u201cPeople just don\u2019t associate pets with carbon emissions. That link is not clear in people\u2019s minds,\u201d Zhao said.",

A round-trip economy-class flight on a 737 from New York to Los Angeles produces more than 1,300 pounds of emissions per passenger, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency.",
      "Skipping that single flight saves about as much carbon as swearing off eating all types of meat a year, or living without a car for more than three months, according to U.N. estimates.",
      "Switching to energy that comes from renewable sources, such as solar and wind, has a large positive impact because such sources don't emit greenhouse gases. Some of the biggest climate decisions individuals can make include how they heat and cool their homes and the types of transportation they use. Switching to renewable energy minimizes the impact of both.",
      "Recycling is effective at reducing waste headed for landfill, but its climate impact is relatively small because transporting, processing and repurposing recyclables typically relies on fossil fuels. Plus, less than 10% of plastics actually get recycled, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Other decisions with overestimated impact, including washing clothes in cold water and switching to more efficient light bulbs, are relatively less important. That is because those appliances have a relatively small impact compared to other things, such plane flights and dogs, so improving on them, while beneficial, has a much more limited influence.",

      "Farmer Richard Shika, 68, has had some close encounters. \u201cOne time, I was trying to chase away an elephant that was in my maize field, but it turned and charged me,\u201d Shika remembers. \u201cIt stopped when it was right in front of me, and I managed to jump out of the way.\u201d",
      "He feels lucky to be alive. Almost exactly two years ago, local media reported that a 3-year-old girl had been trampled to death by an elephant in Taita Taveta county, her mother injured.",
      "The area where Shika has his farm is almost surrounded by Kenya\u2019s biggest National Park. The border of Tsavo East National Park is less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) to the east, and Tsavo West curves around to the north, west and south. The parks have always been unfenced, allowing animals to migrate. Increasingly, that puts them in the path of humans.",
      "\u201cThe places and infrastructure that we humans develop hinder the migratory routes and paths which elephants used to take,\u201d explains Yuka Luvonga, who researches human-elephant coexistence for conservation organization Save The Elephants.",
      "Elephants eat about 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of vegetation a day, so keeping them off farms is tricky, especially if forage is scarce elsewhere. \u201cElephants are clever creatures,\u201d says Shika. \u201cThey will try touching a fence, and once they realize that it is not electrified, they charge through.\u201d",
      "If farmers try to chase them off, as Shika did, the elephants will sometimes turn and defend themselves. Kenya Wildlife Service and conservation organizations tracking human-elephant conflict estimate that 30-35 people are killed every year in elephant-related incidents across Kenya.",
      "Communities will sometimes retaliate by spearing or poisoning elephants, but there are other solutions, as farmers here have found.",
      "One of them is bees.",
      "\u201cElephants don\u2019t like getting stung by bees, so they keep away from areas where hives are,\u201d Shika says.",
      "With help from Save The Elephants, Shika is one of 50 farmers who have hung beehives from wires between poles around their farms. If an elephant touches the wire, the hives are rocked, disturbing the bees. It\u2019s an army of tiny security guards that keeps elephants well away from the farm.",
      "\u201cWith hives acting as a fence, I can continue crop-farming and also earn a livelihood from honey,\u201d Shika says. This year, he\u2019s made almost $250 selling honey.",

      "Delivery drones are supposed to be fast, yet the long-promised technology has been slow to take off in the United States",
      "Delivery drones are so fast they can zip a pint of ice cream to a customer\u2019s driveway before it melts.",
      "Yet the long-promised technology has been slow to take off in the United States. More than six years after the Federal Aviation Administration approved commercial home deliveries with drones, the service mostly has been confined to a few suburbs and rural areas.",
      "That could soon change. The FAA proposed a new rule last week that would make it easier for companies to fly drones outside of an operator's line of sight and therefore over longer distances. A handful of companies do that now, but they had to obtain waivers and certification as an air carrier to deliver packages.",
      "While the rule is intended to streamline the process, authorized retailers and drone companies that have tested fulfilling orders from the sky say they plan to make drone-based deliveries available to millions more U.S. households.",
      "Walmart and Wing, a drone company owned by Google parent Alphabet, currently provide deliveries from 18 Walmart stores in the Dallas area. By next summer, they expect to expand to 100 Walmart stores in Atlanta; Charlotte, North Carolina; Houston; and Orlando and Tampa, Florida.",
      "After launching its Prime Air delivery service in College Station, Texas, in late 2022, Amazon received FAA permission last year to operate autonomous drones that fly beyond a pilot's line of sight. The e-commerce company has since expand its drone delivery program to suburban Phoenix and has plans to offer the service in Dallas, San Antonio, Texas, and Kansas City.",
      "The concept of drone delivery has been around for well over a decade. Drone maker Zipline, which works with Walmart in Arkansas and the Dallas-Fort Worth area, began making deliveries to hospitals in Rwanda in 2016. Israel-based Flytrex, one of the drone companies DoorDash works with to carry out orders, launched drone delivery to households in Iceland in 2017.",
      "But Wing CEO Adam Woodworth said drone delivery has been in \u201ctreading water mode\u201d in the U.S. for years, with service providers afraid to scale up because the regulatory framework wasn\u2019t in place.",
      "\u201cYou want to be at the right moment where there\u2019s an overlap between the customer demand, the partner demand, the technical readiness and the regulatory readiness,\u201d Woodworth said. \u201cI think that we\u2019re reaching that planetary alignment right now.\u201d",
      "DoorDash, which works with both Wing and Flytrex, tested drone drop-offs in rural Virginia and greater Dallas before announcing an expansion into Charlotte. Getting takeout food this way may sound futuristic, but it's starting to feel normal in suburban Brisbane, Australia, where DoorDash has employed delivery drones for several years, said Harrison Shih, who leads the company's drone program.",
      "\u201cIt comes so fast and it's something flying into your neighborhood, but it really does seem like part of everyday life,\u201d Shih said.",
      "Even though delivery drones are still considered novel, the cargo they carry can be pretty mundane. Walmart said the top items from the more than 150,000 drone deliveries the nation's largest retailer has completed since 2021 include ice cream, eggs and Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups.",
      "Unlike traditional delivery, where one driver may have a truck full of packages, drones generally deliver one small order at a time. Wing\u2019s drones can carry packages weighing up to 2.5 pounds. They can travel up to 12 miles round trip. One pilot can oversee up to 32 drones.",
      "Zipline has a drone that can carry up to 4 pounds and fly 120 miles round trip. Some drones, like Amazon\u2019s, can carry heavier packages.",
      "Once an order is placed, it's packaged for flight and attached to a drone at a launch site. The drone automatically finds a route that avoids obstacles. A pilot observes as the aircraft flies to its destinations and lowers its cargo to the ground with retractable cords.",
      "Shakiba Enayati, an assistant professor of supply chain and analytics at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, researches ways that drones could speed the delivery of critical health supplies like donated organs and blood samples. The unmanned aircraft offer some advantages as a transport method, such as reduced emissions and improved access to goods for rural residents, Enayati said.",
      "But she also sees plenty of obstacles. Right now, it costs around $13.50 per delivery to carry a package by drone versus $2 for a traditional vehicle, Enayati said. Drones need well-trained employees to oversee them and can have a hard time in certain weather.",

      "Drones also can have mid-air collisions or tumble from the sky. But people have accepted the risk of road accidents because they know the advantages of driving, Enayati said. She thinks the same thing could happen with drones, especially as improved technology reduces the chance for errors.",
      "Woodworth added that U.S. airspace is tightly controlled, and companies need to demonstrate to the FAA that their drones are safe and reliable before they are cleared to fly. Even under the proposed new rules, the FAA would set detailed requirements for drone operators.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why it takes so long to build a business in the space. But I think it leads to everybody fundamentally building higher quality things,\u201d Woodworth said.",
      "Others worry that drones may potentially replace human delivery drivers. Shih thinks that\u2019s unlikely. One of DoorDash's most popular items is 24-packs of water, Shih said, which aren't realistic for existing drones to ferry.",
      "\u201cI believe that drone delivery can be fairly ubiquitous and can cover a lot of things. We just don't think its probable today that it\u2019ll carry a 40-pound bag of dog food to you,\" Shih said.",
      "DoorDash said that in the areas where it offers drone deliveries, orders requiring the services of human delivery drivers also increase.",
      "That\u2019s been the experience of John Kim, the owner of PurePoke restaurant in Frisco, Texas. Kim signed on to offer drone deliveries through DoorDash last year. He doesn\u2019t know what percentage of his DoorDash customers are choosing the service instead of regular delivery, but his overall DoorDash orders are up 15% this year.",
      "Kim said he\u2019s heard no complaints from drone delivery customers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very stable, maybe even better than some of the drivers that toss it in the back with all the other orders,\u201d Kim said.",
      "For some, drones can simply be a nuisance. When the FAA asked for public comments on Amazon\u2019s request to expand deliveries in College Station, numerous residents expressed concern that drones with cameras violated their privacy. Amazon says its drones use cameras and sensors to navigate and avoid obstacles but may record overhead videos of people while completing a delivery.",
      "Other residents complained about noise.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like a giant nagging mosquito,\u201d one respondent wrote. Amazon has since released a quieter drone.",
      "But others love the service. Janet Toth of Frisco, Texas, said she saw drone deliveries in Korea years ago and wondered why the U.S. didn\u2019t have them. So she was thrilled when DoorDash began providing drone delivery in her neighborhood.",
      "Toth now orders drone delivery a few times a month. Her 9-year-old daughter Julep said friends often come over to watch the drone.",
      "\u201cI love to go outside, wave at the drone, say \u2018Thank you\u2019 and get the food,\u201d Julep Toth said.",

      "The tests initially will only affect a sliver of YouTube's audience in the U.S., but it will likely become more pervasive if the system works as well at guessing viewers' ages as it does in other parts of the world. The system will only work when viewers are logged into their accounts, and it will make its age assessments regardless of the birth date a user might have entered upon signing up.",
      "If the system flags a logged-in viewer as being under 18, YouTube will impose the normal controls and restrictions that the site already uses as a way to prevent minors from watching videos and engaging in other behavior deemed inappropriate for that age.",
      "The safeguards include reminders to take a break from the screen, privacy warnings and restrictions on video recommendations. YouTube, which has been owned by Google for nearly 20 years, also doesn't show ads tailored to individual tastes if a viewer is under 18.",
      "If the system has inaccurately called out a viewer as a minor, the mistake can be corrected by showing YouTube a government-issued identification card, a credit card or a selfie.",

      "The future of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon has split the United States and its European allies with implications for security in the Middle East",
      "WASHINGTON -- The future of U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon has split the United States and its European allies, raising implications for security in the Middle East and becoming the latest snag to vex relations between the U.S. and key partners like France, Britain and Italy.",
      "At issue is the peacekeeping operation known as UNIFIL, whose mandate expires at the end of August and will need to be renewed by the U.N. Security Council to continue. It was created to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon after Israel\u2019s 1978 invasion, and its mission was expanded following the monthlong 2006 war between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah.",
      "The multinational force has played a significant role in monitoring the security situation in southern Lebanon for decades, including during the Israel-Hezbollah war last year, but has drawn criticism from both sides and numerous U.S. lawmakers, some of whom now hold prominent roles in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration or wield new influence with the White House.",
      "Trump administration political appointees came into office this year with the aim of shutting down UNIFIL as soon as possible. They regard the operation as an ineffectual waste of money that is merely delaying the goal of eliminating Hezbollah\u2019s influence and restoring full security control to the Lebanese Armed Forces that the government says it is not yet capable of doing.",
      "After securing major cuts in U.S. funding to the peacekeeping force, Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed off early last week on a plan that would wind down and end UNIFIL in the next six months, according to Trump administration officials and congressional aides familiar with the discussions.",
      "It\u2019s another step as the Trump administration drastically pares back its foreign affairs priorities and budget, including expressing skepticism of international alliances and cutting funding to U.N. agencies and missions. The transatlantic divide also has been apparent on issues ranging from Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza and the Russia-Ukraine conflict to trade, technology and free speech issues.",
      "Israel has for years sought an end to UNIFIL\u2019s mandate, and renewal votes have often come after weeks of political wrangling. Now, the stakes are particularly high after last year\u2019s war and more vigorous opposition in Washington.",
      "European nations, notably France and Italy, have objected to winding down UNIFIL. With the support of Tom Barrack, U.S. ambassador to Turkey and envoy to Lebanon, they successfully lobbied Rubio and others to support a one-year extension of the peacekeeping mandate followed by a time-certain wind-down period of six months, according to the administration officials and congressional aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic negotiations.",
      "Israel also reluctantly agreed to an extension, they said.",
      "The European argument was that prematurely ending UNIFIL before the Lebanese army is able to fully secure the border area would create a vacuum that Hezbollah could easily exploit.",
      "The French noted that when a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali was terminated before government troops were ready to deal with security threats, Islamic extremists moved in.",
      "With the U.S. easing off, the issue ahead of the U.N. vote expected at the end of August now appears to be resistance by France and others to setting a firm deadline for the operation to end after the one-year extension, according to the officials and congressional aides.",
      "French officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The final French draft resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, does not include a date for UNIFIL's withdrawal, which U.S. officials say is required for their support. Instead, it would extend the peacekeeping mission for one year and indicates the U.N. Security Council's \u201cintention to work on a withdrawal.\u201d",
      "But even if the mandate is renewed, the peacekeeping mission might be scaled down for financial reasons, with the U.N. system likely facing drastic budget cuts, said a U.N. official, who was not authorized to comment to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity.",

      "After calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, Trump wrote as he flew home from Friday's meeting in Alaska that it had been \u201cdetermined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up.\u201d",
      "It was a dramatic reversal that laid bare the challenges of dealing with Putin, a cunning adversary, as well as the complexities of a conflict that Trump had repeatedly boasted during his campaign that he could solve within 24 hours.",
      "Few details have emerged about what the two leaders discussed or what constituted the progress they both touted. The White House did not respond to messages seeking comment Saturday.",

      "Trump seemed to revel in particular in Putin echoing his oft-repeated assertion that Russia never would have invaded Ukraine if Trump had been in office instead of Democrat Joe Biden at the time.",
      "Before news cameras, Trump did not use the opportunity to castigate Putin for launching the largest ground invasion in Europe since World War II or human rights abuses he's been accused of committing. Instead, Putin was the one who spoke first, and invited Trump to join him in Moscow next.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump appears to have been played yet again by Vladimir Putin,\" said Democratic Sen.

      "It has been 150 years since miners first flocked to South Dakota's Black Hills in a gold rush that displaced Native Americans",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- A gold rush brought settlers to South Dakota's Black Hills roughly 150 years ago, chasing the dream of wealth and displacing Native Americans in the process.",
      "Now, a new crop of miners driven by gold prices at more than $3,000 an ounce are seeking to return to the treasured landscape, promising an economic boost while raising fears of how modern gold extraction could forever change the region.",
      "\u201cThese impacts can be long term and make it so that tourism and outdoor recreation is negatively impacted,\u201d said Lilias Jarding, executive director of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance. \u201cOur enjoyment of the Black Hills as a peaceful place, a sacred place, is disturbed.\u201d",
      "The Black Hills encompass over 1.2 million acres (485,622 hectares), rising up from the Great Plains in southwest South Dakota and extending into Wyoming. The jagged peaks are smaller than those of the Rocky Mountains, but the lush pine-covered hills are sacred to the Lakota Sioux people and serve as a destination for millions of tourists who visit Mount Rushmore and state parks.",
      "One gold mine now operates in the Black Hills, but companies have proposals before state and federal agencies for another one, plus exploratory drilling sites that they hope will lead to full-fledged mines. That has prompted opposition by Native American tribes and environmentalists who argue the projects are close to sacred sites, will contaminate waterways and permanently scar the landscape.",
      "Gold extraction has changed dramatically in the decades since prospectors first began panning for gold in the Black Hills. The industry now typically relies on massive trucks and diggers that create deep, multitiered pits and use chemicals like cyanide to extract the gold.",
      "The land can never return to its original state. The Homestake mine, once the largest and deepest gold mine in the Western Hemisphere, now sits barren in Lead, South Dakota, and is used for scientific research.",
      "Interest in Black Hills gold mining has soared along with the price of the metal. When the Homestake mine closed in 2002, gold sold for about $300 an ounce. Now it goes for about 10 times as much.",
      "Joseph Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council, attributes the price spike to global economic uncertainty.",
      "\u201cGold tends to be a stable asset,\u201d he said. \u201cThat actually performs well in inflationary times, and holds its value in recessionary times. That\u2019s why gold as an asset in investment.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump also boosted the industry by issuing an executive order in March to increase American mineral production, calling for expedited permitting and reviews.",
      "Colin Paterson, professor emeritus of geological engineering at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, notes that Black Hills gold is encased in rock. To extract it, the rock is crushed and then a chemical like cyanide is used to dissolve the mineral and remove it.",
      "Coeur Mining runs the single active mine in the Black Hills, but the company Dakota Gold has plans for an open pit mine to begin operating in 2029. The company is also targeting the area near the old Homestake site to build an underground mine where workers would descend hundreds or even thousands of feet into shafts.",

The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled the Sioux were entitled to compensation, but they have not accepted any and maintain their claim to the land.",
      "Tribes have largely opposed mining in the Black Hills.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a central truth about mining in the Black Hills in that it was never the most mineral rich place there ever was,\u201d said Taylor Gunhammer, local organizer with the Indigenous advocacy group NDN Collective and an Oglala Sioux, one of the Lakota people. \u201cIt\u2019s not even the actual mineral content of the Black Hills that is so attractive to mining companies.

      "Monday\u2019s meeting will likely be very tough for Zelenskyy, an official close to the ongoing talks said. That official spoke on condition of anonymity to speak openly about thinking within Ukraine and between allies.",
      "Zelenskyy needs to prevent a scenario in which he gets blamed for blocking peace talks by rejecting Putin\u2019s maximalist demand on the Donbas, the official said. It is a demand Zelenskyy has said many times he will never accept because it is unconstitutional and could create a launching pad for future Russian attacks.",
      "If confronted with pressure to accept Putin\u2019s demands, Zelenskyy would likely have to revert to a skill he has demonstrated time and again: diplomatic tact. Ukrainian leadership is seeking a trilateral meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump and Putin to discuss sensitive matters, including territorial issues.",
      "After enduring a public tirade by Trump and Vice President JD Vance in February, Zelenskyy worked to repair relations with the U.S.",

      "Ahead of Monday's meeting, France's Macron stressed the importance of building up Ukraine's military and the need to show Putin that Europe interprets his moves as a threat to other nations.",

      "Road safety activists and some states are pushing to depart from a longstanding rule that sets speed limits in the United States based largely on how fast drivers actually travel",
      "Rose Hammond pushed authorities for years to lower the 55 mph speed limit on a two-lane road that passes her assisted living community, a church, two schools and a busy park that hosts numerous youth sports leagues.",
      "\u201cWhat are you waiting for, somebody to get killed?\u201d the 85-year-old chided officials in northwest Ohio, complaining that nothing was being done about the motorcycles that race by almost daily.",
      "Amid growing public pressure, Sylvania Township asked county engineers in March to analyze whether Mitchaw Road's posted speed is too high. The surprising answer: Technically, it's 5 mph too low.",
      "The reason dates back to studies on rural roads from the 1930s and 1940s that still play an outsized role in the way speed limits are set across the U.S. \u2014 even in urban areas.",
      "Born from that research was a widely accepted concept known as the 85% rule, which suggests a road\u2019s posted speed should be tied to the 15th-fastest vehicle out of every 100 traveling it in free-flowing traffic, rounded to the nearest 5 mph increment.",
      "But after decades of closely following the rule, some states \u2014 with a nudge from the federal government \u2014 are seeking to modify if not replace it when setting guidelines for how local engineers should decide what speed limit to post.",
      "The concept assumes that a road's safest speed is the one most vehicles travel \u2014 neither too high nor too low. If drivers think the speed limit should be raised, they can simply step on the gas and \u201cvote with their feet,\u201d as an old brochure from the Institute of Transportation Engineers once put it.",
      "\u201cThe problem with this approach is it creates this feedback loop,\u201d said Jenny O'Connell, director of member programs for the National Association of City Transportation Officials. \u201cPeople speed, and then the speed limits will be ratcheted up to match that speed.\u201d",
      "The association developed an alternative to the 85% rule known as \u201cCity Limits,\u201d which aims to minimize the risk of injuries for all road users by setting the speed limit based on a formula that factors in a street's activity level and the likelihood of conflicts, such as collisions.",
      "The report points out the 85% rule is based on dated research and that \u201cthese historic roads are a far cry from the vibrant streets and arterials that typify city streets today.\u201d",
      "Amid a recent spike in road deaths across the country, the Federal Highway Administration sent a subtle but important message to states that the 85% rule isn't actually a rule at all and was carrying too much weight in determining local speed limits. In its first update since 2009 to a manual that establishes national guidelines for traffic signs, the agency clarified that communities should also consider such things as how the road is used, the risk to pedestrians, and the frequency of crashes.",
      "Leah Shahum, who directs the Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit advocating for street safety, said she wishes the manual had gone further in downplaying the 85% rule but acknowledges the change has already impacted the way some states set speed limits. Others, however, are still clinging to the simplicity and familiarity of the longstanding approach, she said.",
      "\u201cThe 85th percentile should not be the Holy Grail or the Bible, and yet over and over again it is accepted as that,\u201d Shahum said.",
      "Under its \u201c20 is Plenty\u201d campaign, the Wisconsin capital of Madison has been changing signs across the city this summer, lowering the speed limit from 25 mph to 20 mph on local residential streets.",
      "When Seattle took a similar step in a pilot program seven years ago, not only did it see a noticeable decline in serious injury crashes but also a 7% drop in the 85th percentile speed, according to the Vision Zero Network.",
      "California embraces the 85% rule even more than most states as its basis for setting speed limits. But legislators have loosened the restrictions on local governments a bit in recent years, allowing them to depart from the guidelines if they can cite a proven safety need. Advocates for pedestrians and bicyclists say the change helps, but is not enough.",

      "\u201cWe still have a long way to go in California in terms of putting value on all road users,\u201d said Kendra Ramsey, executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition. \u201cThere\u2019s still a very heavy mindset that automobiles are the primary method of travel and they should be given priority and reverence.\u201d",
      "But Jay Beeber, executive director for policy at the National Motorists Association, an advocacy organization for drivers, said following the 85% rule is usually the safest way to minimize the variation in speed between drivers who abide by the posted limit and those who far exceed it.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't really matter what number you put on a sign,\u201d Beeber said. \u201cThe average driver drives the nature of the roadway. It would be patently unfair for a government to build a road to encourage people to drive 45 mph, put a 30 mph speed limit on it, and then ticket everyone for doing what they built the road to do.\u201d",
      "Fears about oil prices prompted Congress in the 1970s to set a 55 mph national maximum speed limit, which it later relaxed to 65 mph before repealing the law in 1995 and handing the authority to states. Since then, speed limits have kept climbing, with North Dakota this summer becoming the ninth state to allow drivers to go 80 mph on some stretches of highway. There's even a 40-mile segment in Texas between Austin and San Antonio where 85 mph is allowed.",
      "Although high-speed freeways outside major population centers aren't the focus of most efforts to ease the 85% rule, a 2019 study from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety \u2014 a research arm funded by auto insurers \u2014 illustrates the risks. Every 5 mph increase to a state's maximum speed limit increases the chance of fatalities by 8.5% on interstate highways and 2.8% on other roads, the study found.",
      "\u201cMaybe back when you were driving a Model T you had a real feel for how fast you were going, but in modern vehicles you don't have a sense of what 80 mph is. You're in a cocoon,\u201d said Chuck Farmer, the institute's vice president for research, who conducted the study.",
      "If elected officials in Sylvania Township, Ohio, got their way, Mitchaw Road's posted speed limit would be cut dramatically \u2014 from 55 mph to 40 mph or lower. The county's finding that the 85% rule actually calls for raising it to 60 mph surprised the town's leaders, but not the engineers who ran the study.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t make decisions based on data, it\u2019s very difficult to make good decisions,\u201d Lucas County Engineer Mike Pniewski said.",
      "For now, the speed limit will remain as it is. That's because Ohio law sets maximum speeds for 15 different types of roadways, regardless of what the 85% rule suggests.",
      "And Ohio's guidelines are evolving. The state now gives more consideration to roadway context and allows cities to reduce speed limits based on the lower standard of the 50th percentile speed when there's a large presence of pedestrians and bicyclists. Authorities there recently hired a consultant to consider additional modifications based on what other states are doing.",
      "\u201cStates have very slowly started to move away from the 85th percentile as being kind of the gold standard for decision-making,\u201d said Michelle May, who manages Ohio's highway safety program. \u201cPeople are traveling and living differently than they did 40 years ago, and we want to put safety more at the focus.\u201d",
      "It's unclear whether any of these changes will ultimately impact the posted speed on Mitchaw Road. After years of futile calls and emails to state, county and township officials, Hammond says she isn't holding her breath.",
      "\u201cI just get so discouraged,\u201d she said.",

      "JOINT BASE ELMENDORF-RICHARDSON, Alaska -- President Donald Trump is meeting face-to-face with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin on Friday for a pivotal Alaska summit that could reshape both the war in Ukraine and relations between Moscow and Washington.",
      "The sit-down gives Trump a chance to prove to the world that he is both a master dealmaker and a global peacemaker. He and his allies have cast him as a heavyweight negotiator who can find a way to bring the slaughter to a close \u2014 something he used to boast he could do quickly.",
      "For Putin, a summit with Trump offers a long-sought opportunity to try to negotiate a deal that would cement Russia\u2019s gains, block Kyiv\u2019s bid to join the NATO military alliance and eventually pull Ukraine back into Moscow\u2019s orbit. Despite having so much at stake, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders aren't invited.",
      "There are significant risks for Trump. By bringing Putin onto U.S. soil \u2014 America bought Alaska from Russia in 1867 for 2 cents per acre \u2014 the president is giving him the validation he desires after his ostracization following his invasion of Ukraine 3 1/2 years ago. Zelenskyy's exclusion from Trump and Putin's first meeting is a heavy blow to the West\u2019s policy of \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\u201d and invites the possibility that Trump could agree to a deal that Ukraine does not want.",
      "Any success is far from assured because Russia and Ukraine remain far apart in their demands for peace. Putin has long resisted any temporary ceasefire, linking it to a halt in Western arms supplies and a freeze on Ukraine\u2019s mobilization efforts, which were conditions rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies.",
      "\"HIGH STAKES!!!\" Trump posted shortly before he boarded Air Force One for Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage.",
      "On his way to the meeting, Putin stopped in Magadan, in Russia\u2019s Far East, where he visited a factory producing omega-3 fish oil capsules, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Putin was reviewing materials on Ukraine, tensions with the U.S., economic cooperation and global affairs during his four-hour flight to Alaska, where he will be greeted at his plane by Trump, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russian state TV.",
      "Trump and Putin have shared closely watched handshakes before \u2014 but Friday's will be as scrutinized as any, as will any body language or hints about how each is feeling.",
      "Trump on Thursday said there was a 25% chance that the summit would fail, but he also floated the idea that if the meeting succeeds he could bring Zelenskyy to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting \u2014 a possibility that Russia hasn't agreed to.",
      "When asked after arriving in Alaska about Trump's estimate of a 25% chance of failure, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that Russia \u201cnever plans ahead.\u201d",
      "\"We know that we have arguments, a clear, understandable position. We will state it,\u201d he said in footage posted to the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s Telegram channel.",
      "Trump said in a Fox News radio interview Thursday that he didn't know if they would get \u201can immediate ceasefire\u201d but he wanted a broad peace deal done quickly. That seemingly echoes Putin\u2019s longtime argument that Russia favors a comprehensive deal to end the fighting, reflecting its demands, not a temporary halt to hostilities.",
      "The Kremlin said Trump and Putin will first sit down for a one-on-one discussion, followed by the two delegations meeting and talks continuing over \u201ca working breakfast.\u201d They are then expected to hold a joint press conference.",
      "In the days leading up to the summit, Trump described it as \u201c really a feel-out meeting.\u201d But he's also warned of \u201cvery severe consequences\u201d for Russia if Putin doesn't agree to end the war and said that though Putin might bully other leaders, \u201cHe\u2019s not going to mess around with me.\u201d",
      "Trump said Friday that his talks with Putin will include Russian demands that Ukraine cede territory as part of a peace deal. He said Ukraine has to decide, but he also suggested Zelenskyy should accept concessions.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The much-anticipated summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin began with a warm welcome and a flyover by screaming jets at a U.S. military base in Alaska but ended with a thud Friday after they conceded that they had failed to reach any agreements on how to end the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "After about 2 1/2 hours of talks at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, the two men appeared before reporters for what had been billed as a joint news conference \u2014 but they took no questions.",
      "\u201cWe had an extremely productive meeting and many points were agreed to, there are just a very few that are left,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.\u201d",
      "Putin, welcomed into the U.S. after being shunned by Western allies since early 2022 for ordering the invasion of Ukraine, thanked Trump for hosting the meeting and suggested with a chuckle that the next time the two sit down it could be in Moscow.",
      "Here are key takeaways from the summit:",
      "Putin got a red carpet welcome and even rode in Trump\u2019s presidential limousine from the tarmac to the summit venue. There, the pair were joined by two of their top aides: Secretary of State and national security adviser Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff for Trump and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and national security adviser Yuri Ushakov for Putin.",
      "Putin, who spoke first after the meeting concluded, lauded the historical relationship between the United States, Russia and the former Soviet Union, recalling joint missions conducted by the two countries during World War II.",
      "He said the U.S. and Russia share values, a standard talking point for Russian officials when trying to woo Trump and his aides. Putin also noted that Trump has frequently said the Ukraine war wouldn\u2019t have happened had he won the 2020 election.",
      "\"I think that would have been the case,\" the Russian leader said, a comment sure to please Trump.",
      "However, there is no indication and no way to prove that Moscow would have acted differently toward Ukraine had Democrat Joe Biden not been elected.",
      "Trump had gone into the meeting hoping to get Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine \u2014 or at least a commitment from Russia to enter into negotiations to reach one.",
      "Instead, Trump conceded that \u201cwe haven\u2019t quite got there\u201d and said he would be conferring with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO leaders about next steps.",
      "Trump said he and Putin had made some significant progress toward the goal of ending the conflict but gave no details on what that entailed and had to acknowledge that they had been unable to bridge substantial gaps.",
      "\u201cI believe we had a very productive meeting,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t quite got there, but we\u2019ve made some headway. So, there\u2019s no deal until there\u2019s a deal.\u201d",

      "Putin got a pleasant reception from the leader of the free world on U.S. soil and walked away hours later without either providing details on what they discussed, whether a ceasefire was any closer to reality or what the next steps would be.",
      "Putin praised Trump for the \u201cfriendly\u201d tone of the talks \u2014 Trump said nothing publicly about the killing of Ukrainian civilians in Moscow's attacks \u2014 and for \u201cunderstanding that Russia has its own national interests.\u201d",
      "Putin said Moscow and Washington should \u201cturn the page,\u201d with relations having sunk to the lowest point since the Cold War.",
      "Putin appearing in the U.S. for the first time in 10 years was celebrated as a sign that Moscow was no longer a pariah on the global stage. In a social media post, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told followers that the Western press would be on the verge of \u201closing their minds.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor three years, they talked about Russia\u2019s isolation, and today they saw the red carpet being rolled out to greet the Russian president in the United States,\u201d she said.",
      "Both men said the talks were \u201cproductive\u201d but the lack of any announcement of solid achievements was revealing.",
      "The news conference ended up being less than 15 minutes of rather standard diplomatic comments \u2014 and gave no indication that any concrete results were achieved \u2014 and offered little departure from their previous comments on the war in Ukraine.",
      "Trump has made it a feature of his second term to parry questions from reporters in front of world leaders, but in the clearest sign of his disappointment, the president abruptly cut short his plans to take questions.",
      "Trump had gone into the summit saying here was a 25% chance that the summit would fail and that it was meant to be a \u201cfeel-out meeting,\u201d but he had also floated the idea of bringing Zelenskyy to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting if things went well.

    "summary": "In California&rsquo;s Death Valley National Park, one of the hottest places on Earth, summer temperatures can soar into the 130s F",
    "story": [
      "In California\u2019s Death Valley National Park, one of the hottest places on Earth, summer temperatures can soar into the 130s F",
      "DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. -- Ray Estrada's 11-year-old grandson is used to Las Vegas' scorching summers, but he'd always wanted to experience the heat in one of the Earth's hottest places. So Estrada recently drove him to Death Valley National Park, with an umbrella, extra water and electrolytes in tow. That day, the thermometer soared to 118 F (47.78 C).",
      "\u201cWe have to be very careful when we go out there,\u201d Estrada told him. \u201cIf you start feeling dizzy or whatever... we\u2019re just gonna turn back and be safe so we can do this again another time.\u201d",
      "The extreme temperatures in this stretch of California desert attract visitors every year, some determined to finish a grueling, multiday race, others just curious about the sizzling heat and the landscape's vast beauty. Yet despite the warnings, the heat kills one to three people annually, and park rangers respond to overheated visitors multiple times per week, making communication about heat safety a priority for the National Park Service.",
      "But that's easier said than done.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to underestimate how dangerous heat is,\" said Abby Wines, the park's acting deputy superintendent. \u201cPeople are usually used to thinking of heat as something that makes them uncomfortable,\" and that they can tough it out.",
      "\u201cThis type of heat will kill,\u201d she said.",
      "Death Valley holds the record for the hottest temperature ever officially recorded \u2014 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 \u2014 although some experts have disputed it and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C) there in July 2021.",
      "In the U.S., heat kills more people than other weather events combined, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. If planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, which come from burning fuels like oil and coal, continue at their current pace, more places could experience broiling temperatures. That makes it crucial to communicate the dangers of extreme heat and safety precautions, as both can influence who lives and dies.",
      "Throughout this desert are stark warnings of the deadly heat: \u201cStop. Extreme heat danger. Walking after 10 a.m. not recommended,\u201d one sign says. \u201cHEAT KILLS!\u201d warns another. On bathroom walls there are reminders to hydrate in the form of charts displaying the color of pee \u2014 the darker the urine, the more you need to drink water.",
      "Another sign warns visitors that helicopters for medical emergencies can\u2019t safely fly amid extreme temperatures. Ambulances can often deploy in extreme heat but are not a guarantee. The safety of emergency responders is always considered.",
      "Baruch Fischhoff, professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies decision-making, said evidence shows that people generally underestimate risk when they have a sense of control. Information that explicitly says rescue might not be an option if it\u2019s too hot \u201ctakes away that sense of the control that can lead to underestimating risk.\u201d",
      "Failing to recognize those risks can be deadly. Last summer, a helicopter was unable to fly to a rescue because of 128 F (53.33 C) temperatures. A group of visitors were traveling on motorcycles when one died from the heat, and another was treated for severe heat illness and transported to a hospital.",
      "Rescue options are even more limited for hikers lost on a trail. Unless it\u2019s a short distance and rescuers know where the person is, they\u2019ll likely wait until sunset if it\u2019s above 115 F (46.11 C). \u201cDepending on their situation,\u201d Wines said, that's \u201cprobably too late.\u201d",
      "Two of the park's busiest months are in the summer, and it sees a small bump in visitors when temperatures are expected to hit the high 120s or 130s F (48.89s to 54.44s C). But it's the moderate temperatures that tend to get people into more trouble.",
      "\u201cWe actually have a harder time communicating our concerns about heat to the public when they visit and it\u2019s only 100 to 115,\" Wines said. The dryness evaporates sweat almost instantly, so many people don't realize how much they're actually sweating.",
      "Then there's the vastness. Death Valley has more than 50 entrances, so many visitors aren't seeing rangers who can relay important information. Instead, they place heat warning signs in the hottest and most popular spots. But they discovered that people responded less to heat warning signs that looked permanent compared to those that seemed temporary.",

      "Jennifer Marlon, senior research scientist at the Yale School of the Environment, has studied public perceptions of the health risks of extreme heat across the U.S. How people perceive heat and other climate risks varies by factors like age, race, gender, income level and where they live. Older white men, for instance, tend to have lower risk perceptions across the board, whereas women have higher risk perceptions than men.",
      "\u201cThe challenge, though, is that the level of worry or risk perception doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into action,\u201d Marlon said. Optimism bias could also falsely make a person believe the heat won\u2019t personally affect them. While studies show that experience with heat increases people\u2019s concern, it is short-lived.",
      "\u201cYou get a bump for like a year or so after a really big event and then it just goes right back to the baseline,\u201d she said.",
      "Marlon said to be specific. Don't just tell people that heat can be lethal, tell them what could happen to their bodies and what to do to stay safe.",
      "Death Valley park does this. On site and online, park officials tell visitors to avoid hiking at low elevations after 10 a.m., to stay on paved roads and near their cars. They say to drink and carry plenty of water, and to seek shade and hydrate if you feel dizzy, nauseous or have a headache.",
      "And while this isn't something the park would initiate, if scientists gave names to heat waves, similar to how hurricanes are named, that could better grab people\u2019s attention because human brains are attuned to novelty, Marlon said.",
      "The messenger is also important. If friends, family and neighbors are worried and nudging you to do something, that can be more powerful than reading information online. Community leaders modeling appropriate behavior \u2014 like saying they\u2019re evacuating their family ahead of a hurricane or that they carry extra water in their trunk \u2014 can also go a long way.",
      "Marlon also suggested communicating how extreme heat can impair the ability to think clearly. When communicating with images, show people drinking water, putting on cold wet towels or resting in shade.",
      "\u201cWhatever the recommended behavior is, show them pictures of that behavior because we\u2019re incredibly and fundamentally social animals, and body language is so much of how we communicate,\u201d Marlon said.",

      "As firefighters continued their work Friday to corral the stubborn flames, Brighty hit the road \u2014 strapped into the back of a pickup truck for a roughly five-hour journey that would take him from his home on the North Rim to the South Rim.",

      "There's no timeline for the effort, but fans on social media already are weighing in with support for returning the burro to his former glory. They talk about taking family pictures with the sculpture in the background and reading the children's book that's loosely based on the original burro's adventures traversing the canyon.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very special symbolic piece of history for a lot of people,\u201d park spokesperson Jo\u00eblle Baird told The Associated Press.",
      "An enduring symbol of life along the rugged canyon, the hefty statue represents a free-spirited burro who lived more than a century ago.

      "The U.S. plans to build a $750 million factory in southern Texas to breed billions of sterile flies to ramp up its efforts to keep flesh-eating maggots now in Mexico from damaging the American cattle industry",
      "The U.S. plans to build a $750 million factory in southern Texas to breed billions of sterile flies, ramping up its efforts to keep flesh-eating maggots in Mexico from crossing the border and damaging the American cattle industry.",
      "Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Friday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture hopes to be producing and releasing sterile male New World screwworm flies into the wild within a year from the new factory on Moore Air Base outside Edinburg, Texas, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the border. She also said the USDA plans to deploy $100 million in technology, such as fly traps and lures, and step up border patrols by \u201ctick riders\u201d mounted on horseback and train dogs to sniff out the parasite.",
      "In addition, Rollins said the U.S. border will remain closed to cattle, horse and bison imports from Mexico until the U.S. sees that the pest is being pushed back south toward Panama, where the fly had been contained through late last year through the breeding of sterile flies there. The U.S. has closed its border to those imports three times in the past eight months, the last in July, following a report of an infestation about 370 miles (595 kilometers) from the Texas border.",
      "American officials worry that if the fly reaches Texas, its flesh-eating maggots could cause billions of dollars in economic losses and cause already record retail beef prices to rise even more, fueling greater inflation. The parasite also can infest wildlife, household pets and, occasionally, humans.",
      "\u201cFarm security is national security,\u201d Rollins said during a news conference at the Texas State Capitol in Austin with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. \u201cAll Americans should be concerned. But it\u2019s certainly Texas and our border and livestock producing states that are on the front lines of this every day.\u201d",
      "The pest was a problem for the American cattle industry for decades until the U.S. largely eradicated it in the 1970s by breeding and releasing sterile male flies to breed with wild females. It shut down fly factories on U.S. soil afterward.",
      "The Mexican cattle industry has been hit hard by infestations and the U.S. closing its border to imports.",
      "Mexico\u2019s Agriculture ministry said in a statement Friday that Mexico Agriculture and Rural Development Secretary Julio Berdegu\u00e9 Sacrist\u00e1n and Rollins signed a screwworm control action plan. It includes monitoring with fly-attracting traps and establishing that livestock can only be moved within Mexico through government-certified corrals, the statement said.",
      "And on the X social media platform, Berdegu\u00e9 said, \u201cWe will continue with conversations that lead to actions that will permit the reopening of livestock exports.\"",

      "The new fly-breeding factory in Texas would be the first on U.S. soil in decades and represents a ramping up of the USDA's spending on breeding and releasing sterile New World screwworm flies. The sterile males are released in large enough numbers that wild females can't help but mate with them, producing sterile eggs that don't hatch. Eventually, the wild fly population shrinks away because females mate only once in their weekslong lives.",
      "In June, Rollins announced a plan to convert an existing factory for breeding fruit flies into one for breeding sterile New World Screwworm flies, as well as a plan to build a site, also on the air base near Edinburg, for gathering flies imported from Panama and releasing them from small aircraft. Those projects are expected to cost a total of $29.5 million.",
      "The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million flies a week, and the new Mexican fly factory is expected to produce up to 100 million more a week. Rollins said the new Texas factory would produce up to 300 million a week. She said President Donald Trump's administration wants to end the U.S. reliance on fly breeding in Mexico and Panama.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tactical move that ensures we are prepared and not just reactive, which is today what we have really been working through,\u201d Rollins said.",

      "A federal grand jury has indicted New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell after a long corruption investigation",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell was indicted Friday in what prosecutors called a yearslong scheme to hide a romantic relationship with her bodyguard, who is accused of being paid as if he was working even when they met alone in apartments and traveled to vineyards for wine tasting.",
      "Cantrell faces charges of conspiracy, fraud and obstruction, less than five months before she leaves office due to term limits. The first female mayor in New Orleans' 300-year history was elected twice but now becomes the city's first mayor to be charged while in office.",
      "\u201cPublic corruption has crippled us for years and years,\u201d Acting U.S. Attorney Michael Simpson said, referring to Louisiana's notorious history. \u201cAnd this is extremely significant.\u201d",
      "Cantrell's bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, was already facing charges of wire fraud and making false statements. He has pleaded not guilty. A grand jury returned an 18-count indictment Friday that added Cantrell to the case.",
      "They are accused of exchanging encrypted messages through WhatsApp to avoid detection and then deleting the conversations. The mayor and Vappie have said their relationship was strictly professional, but the indictment portrayed it as \u201cpersonal and intimate.\u201d",
      "The City of New Orleans said in a statement that it was aware of the indictment and that the mayor's attorney is reviewing it.",
      "\"Until his review is complete, the City will not comment further on this matter,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Cantrell hasn\u2019t sent out a message on her official social media feed on X since July 15, when she said the city was experiencing historic declines in crime.",
      "In a WhatsApp exchange, the indictment says, Vappie reminisced about accompanying Cantrell to Scotland in October 2021, saying that was \u201cwhere it all started.\u201d",
      "Cantrell and Vappie used WhatsApp for more than 15,000 messages, including efforts to harass a citizen, delete evidence, make false statements to FBI agents, \u201cand ultimately to commit perjury before a federal grand jury,\u201d Simpson said.",
      "They met in an apartment while Vappie claimed to be on duty, and she arranged for him to attend 14 trips, Simpson said. The trips, he added, were described by her as times \u201cwhen they were truly alone.\"",
      "New Orleans taxpayers paid more than $70,000 for Vappie\u2019s travel, the prosecutor said.",
      "Authorities cited a September 2022 rendezvous on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, a trip Cantrell took instead of attending a conference in Miami. Vappie\u2019s travel to the island was covered by the city to attend a separate conference. \u201cThe times when we are truly (traveling) is what spoils me the most,\u201d the mayor wrote to him that month.",

      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "The magnetic British actor Terence Stamp (July 22, 1938-Aug. 17, 2025) earned a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his first film appearance, in 1962's \"Billy Budd.\" But he was best known for playing the supervillain General Zod in \"Superman\" and \"Superman II.\" His other major film roles included a kidnapper in \"The Collector,\" a London criminal in \"The Limey,\" and a trans woman accompanying two drag queens in a romp across the Australian Outback in the comedy \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\"",
      "Born in London, Stamp worked in advertising before pursuing an acting career. Early on, he shared an apartment with fellow up-and-coming actor Michael Caine (they also shared the same suit for auditions). After making his screen debut as the title character in \"Billy Budd,\" Stamp appeared with Laurence Olivier in \"Term of Trial,\" Monica Vitti in \"Modesty Blaise,\" and Julie Christie in \"Far From the Madding Crowd.\" He appeared in several European films (\"Teorema,\" \"Hu-Man,\" \"The Divine Nymph\"), but he spent much of the '70s on a spiritual quest in India after years of unemployment, believing he has aged out of his early, youthful roles which had played off his dashing good looks.",
      "At a 2013 British Film Institute screening, Stamp said he was living in an ashram when he got a telegram offering him the part of Zod opposite Marlon Brando. \"And I thought, my life is about to change,\" he said.",
      "His performance as the ruthless exile from Krypton who wields the same superpowers as Superman was indelible, as was his desire to dominate the Earth. Stamp claimed \"Superman\" was the only successful film he'd ever been in, but it left its mark: \"I can rarely get through the day without somebody coming up to me and saying, 'Kneel before Zod!'\" he said.",
      "His film and TV credits included \"Meetings With Remarkable Men,\" \"The Hit,\" \"Legal Eagles,\" \"The Company of Wolves,\" \"Wall Street,\" \"Young Guns,\" \"Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace,\" \"Bowfinger,\" \"His Dark Materials,\" \"Unfinished Song,\" \"Wanted,\" \"The Adjustment Bureau,\" \"A Song for Marion,\" \"Bitter Harvest,\" and \"Last Night in Soho.\" He spent much of his later career playing darker, villainous (but still charismatic) characters.",
      "He published several memoirs, including \"Stamp Album,\" \"Coming Attractions,\" \"Double Feature,\" and \"The Ocean Fell into the Drop.\"",
      "In 1987,\u00a0Stamp told BBC Radio's \"Desert Island Discs\": \"I have a lot of things in my head. Obviously I'm kind of, there's a lot of time when I'm fueled by kind of high-up pain. As an actor, I get a chance to express all the different things that come up out of it. And so, it's a kind of release, it's like a safety valve. The big energy can be channeled into something productive. I think if I didn't have that outlet, then I would be somebody who vacillated from terrific ups to terrific downs, and I consider that psychotic.\" He added, \"I'm lucky because I can do something with all these things that occur to me, I can channel them.\""

    "story": [
      "Laufey's music may not be what you usually think of as \"pop,\" but if pop is short for popular, then she is indeed a pop star. The 26-year-old Icelander has earned a devoted following blending modern lyrics and music with classical and jazz. \"My music is such a combination of the sounds of my childhood,\" she said. \"It's just something that's become a part of me. I wanted to make things that made me happy.",
      "\"I loved Golden Age musicals,\" said Laufey. \"I'd watch 'Carousel' and 'Oklahoma' and 'American in Paris' and 'Sound of Music.' They were so beautiful and had these dance breaks and the dresses were floating and the colors \u2013 that feeling I got from that, I just wanted to create that feeling.\"",
      "The world she inhabits (in her work, anyway) is whimsical and romantic, full of windswept cliffs, frilly dresses and bows \u2026 and cello, almost always cello.",
      "Watch Laufey perform \"I Wish You Love\" with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra:",
      "She says the cello is \"as important to me as my voice. And I think it's really what makes a Laufey song a Laufey song.\"",
      "Laufey L\u00edn Bing J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir comes by it naturally. Her Icelandic father introduced her to jazz when she was a girl; her Chinese mother played classical violin. So does Laufey's identical twin sister.",
      "Growing up, she said, she felt different: \"Everyone was like, you know, going to play soccer after school or dance, and I was sitting down and playing music from the 17th century. And then on top that I was a twin, identical twin. I just feel, like, weird on top of weird, on top of weird.\"",
      "And things only got weirder when she started singing, as when she appeared on the TV competition \"Iceland's Got Talent\" singing Alicia Keys' \"If I Ain't Got You,\" at age 13: \"I remember going on singing competitions in Iceland when I was younger and they'd always be like, 'She sounds like a 40-year-old woman that's been divorced twice and she chain-smokes cigarettes,'' Laufey said. \"And I was, like, a 13-year-old girl standing on stage being like, okay, like, I just wanted to be a girl. So, yeah I was always a little bit like \u2026 felt a little bit like a circus act.\"",
      "But Laufey found her footing at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. She started posting original songs and jazz covers on social media during the pandemic, and they quickly went viral.",
      "Laufey performs \"I Love You (For Sentimental Reasons\") on guitar and cello:",
      "I asked, \"Were you surprised that people were responding to the jazz influences?\"",
      "\"I was so shocked, because I'd never seen any example of it before,\" Laufey replied. \"And I'd never seen a community of young people \u2026 that was the most shocking part, that it was young people responding to the music. But there was always a part of me that was like, of course, it's the best music in the world!\"",
      "Now she sells out just about every concert \u2013 like a recent one in Norfolk, Virginia, where one fan, Alissa, told us, \"When I first like showed, like, my parents that, they were like, 'This is what you guys listen to?' And I was like, 'Yeah, like, this is what, like, younger people are listening to!'\"",
      "Another fan, Logan, said, \"I feel like she takes just kind of more 'old people music' and pushes it into, like, a newer generation so that more people can enjoy it.\"",
      "Laufey's new album, \"A Matter of Time,\" comes out this week. A stadium tour will follow.",
      "Her songwriting usually starts on guitar, like her bossa nova-influenced \"From the Start.\"",
      "But she just as easily can weave in a little classical, as she did on her last album, \"Bewitched.\" Last year, \"Bewitched\" briefly knocked Frank Sinatra off the top of the jazz charts \u2013 and then, that album won a best traditional pop vocal Grammy Award, beating such artists as Bruce Springsteen.",
      "And then, Barbra Streisand asked Laufey to sing on her recent album of duets, performing a song Laufey wrote, \"Letter to My 13-Year-Old Self.\" \"It's one of those songs that I wrote just in my most intimate moments and could have been a song that I never put out,\" she said. \"It was a song for me to heal myself. But it's a very hopeful song. It's reaching back to tell your younger self that you're going to be okay.\"",
      "Don't you worry 'bout your curly hair Clothes that don't quite fit you anywhere Voices echo in the gym Another girl's had her first kiss Please don't think too much of it, darling",
      "I asked, \"What do you think your 13-year-old self would think of all of this?\"",
      "\"I think she'd be really excited,\" Laufey replied. \"I think she'd be really happy. There's not a single part of myself that has changed any of my artistic interests to follow some sort of trend. And I get to make exactly the music that I loved back then. So, I think I would've been really, really happy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Adam Scott was once a solid \"that guy\" \u2013 a steadily working actor you might recognize from any number of roles. He's been active since the early nineties, playing everything from Howard Hughes' press agent in \"The Aviator,\" to a pompous jerk in \"Step Brothers.\" He's acted in large ensemble television shows like \"Party Down\" and \"Parks and Recreation.\" But in 2022, when ads started popping up for a new Apple TV+ show called \"Severance,\" with his face front and center, it was a new experience for Scott.",
      "\"It was terrifying, like, truly,\" he said. \"As an actor, it's something you wait your entire career for, your entire life for. But when it happened, I was immediately terrified, and didn't quite know why. I guess I was afraid that it was just gonna end up being embarrassing, and people were gonna make fun of us, and make fun of me.\"",
      "Quite the opposite. \"Severance\" ended up becoming a critically acclaimed hit. The show's second season is nominated for more Emmys than any other show this year (27 in all), including outstanding drama series, and a lead actor nomination for Scott.",
      "Scott's character, Mark, works for a mysterious, seemingly sinister corporation. When he's off the clock, he has no memory of his work life. He is a \"severed\" employee \u2013 a device in his brain separates his office self from his home self.",
      "In this scene, Mark S. (Adam Scott) meets his non-office self, Mark Scout, through video recordings:",
      "I said, \"A lot of people relate to 'Severance' because of that sentiment of like, 'Wouldn't it be nice to turn your brain off from 9:00 to 5:00 and not do my mind-numbing job?'\u00a0 It sounds like you never really had a job like that, though. How do you tap into that?\"",
      "\"It's funny, because the things that ended up really sort of making a difference in my career were, like, 'Parks and Rec' and 'Party Down' and 'Severance,'\" said Scott. \"They are largely shows that are about work. And these are jobs that I've never actually had to participate in in real life, 'cause I was always in a play or doing a guest spot on 'NYPD Blue' or whatever. I guess I relate to these kind of feelings that these characters have because it's been sort of this long path for me in show business.\"",
      "Scott's path began in his hometown of Santa Cruz, California, where he'd spend hours in his room watching, and imitating, actors he saw on David Letterman.",
      "Did the idea of doing it professionally cross his mind? \"100%,\" said Scott. \"In fact, I used to practice on my bed. I would set it up like a couch. I would practice being on David Letterman. I remember I had a project that I would pretend I was promoting, where Harrison Ford and I were playing father-and-son cops. I'm sure I just looked like an insane person.\"",
      "\"For what it's worth I would watch that today,\" I said.",
      "\"I know, it sounds great!\"",
      "After some success in high school plays, Scott moved to Pasadena to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where he started thinking that \"Adam Scott\" didn't sound dramatic enough: \"When I was in theater school, I really fancied myself as a very serious actor in the vein of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. In fact, at one point I wanted to change my last name to Quardero. I remember writing on a piece of paper, 'Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Adam Quardero.' My mother's maiden name was Quartararo.\"",
      "Scott stuck with his last name and, after graduation, stuck it out through the high and lows of building an acting career. \"One thing I always felt that I knew about myself is that I was never going to leave,\" he said. \"I didn't have any other options. But I knew that I was just gonna stick around until something happened, something came together for me.\"",
      "Scott's five seasons on the NBC sitcom \"Parks and Recreation\" took his career to the next level, although it came with an unexpected downside: now that he was so well known for comedy, it was harder to get dramatic roles.",
      "Ben Stiller, one of the executive producers and the primary director of \"Severance,\" said of Scott, \"He'd done, you know, work that was dramatic before, it just wasn't things that, you know, people really hadn't seen as much of it as his comedy work.",
      "He believed Scott had the skills necessary to play what's essentially two roles \u2013 or at least, two parts of the same person \u2013 sometimes transitioning between his severed personalities in a single shot. \"The key to the effect working really is Adam's change of expression, and just how good he is as an actor technically,\" Stiller said. \"He has to get that timing right of the change with the camera effect, so it's not easy to do. He can take a note just, you know, adjust something, you know, minimally, that very few actors I work with can do as well as him.\"",
      "I asked Stiller, \"It seems like you saw that potential early on. Was it a tough sell for the studio to have him front the show?\"",
      "\"You know, they had a different idea in the beginning, but I said, 'Look, Adam, to me, I think he's the guy,\" Stiller replied.",
      "It's clear fans agree. As part of Apple's massive marketing push for \"Severance,\" viewers were invited to an event at the historic former Bell Labs building in Holmdel, New Jersey, which stands in for the headquarters of the show's fictional Lumon Industries.",
      "Scott said, \"Seeing the photos of this place, of the Bell Labs building, it started dawning on me just the scale of the show and what it was exactly that Ben had in mind.\"",
      "Outside of \"Severance,\" Scott's work life and home life revolve around his wife, Naomi. They produce podcasts, films, and TV shows together. They met in the late '90s, which means she's seen him through a number of career ups and downs. \"I kind of learned that there was a cycle of him, you know, picking himself up off the ground, and I did know how to nurture and encourage that,\" Naomi said. \"That, I knew how to do. But it was hard to watch.\"",
      "I asked, \"What's it been like to see people finally see what you've been seeing for all these years?\"",
      "\"Oh, it's very vindicating!\" she laughed. \"I knew it. It's great. I love it.\"",
      "Adam Scott had to audition for \"Severance,\" and fight for the role. Now, with season three already in the works, the actor who always knew he was in it for the long haul is finally getting his due. Though he recognizes that there is no \"Bank of Hollywood\" that is allowing him to cash in after making 30 years of deposits.\u00a0 \"No \u2013 you're entitled to nothing in show business, and I knew that,\" he said. \"But I also knew that there was something I could bring to it that nobody else could. And I knew that I would have to give all of myself to it in order to pull it off. I would have to use absolutely everything I've learned over 30 years if I was gonna do it right. And so, when I was lucky enough to get the job, that's exactly what I did.\"",

      "Taylor Swift's upcoming album release and her love of all things orange isn't lost on her fans \u2014 or brands that are seeking a ride on what has become an enormous economic tailwind.",
      "On Wednesday after Swift went on the \"New Heights\" podcast co-hosted by her boyfriend, NFL football star Travis Kelce, to announce the imminent release of her 12th studio album \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" major companies went into marketing overdrive.",
      "Numerous corporations, from United Airlines to Olive Garden, began posting orange-hued memes on their own social media accounts soon after the new album was announced. Shake Shack, FedEx, Buffalo Wild Wings, Cinnabon, Walmart and Netflix did, too.",
      "That's because Swift appeared onstage wearing orange numerous times toward the end of her Eras Tour, and discussed her feelings about the color on the Wednesday podcast.",
      "\"It feels like energetically how my life has felt,\" the 14-time Grammy winner tells co-host Jason Kelce.",
      "Many, it seemed, saw value in tying their brand to Swift.",
      "More than a dozen NHL teams, both\u00a0north\u00a0and\u00a0south\u00a0of the Canadian border, followed with posts on social media acknowledging Swift's new album.",
      "mb12 pic.twitter.com/HUz2MYpEMc",

      "Swift's tour appearances have become economic events. The singer's Eras Tour two years ago was the first such tour to cross the billion-dollar mark, according to Pollstar's 2023 year-end charts. Cities and their surrounding areas registered a sizeable economic boost after Swift appeared, with thousands of fans making the pilgrimage and spending money at hotels, restaurants and elsewhere.",
      "Swift also mentioned during the Wednesday podcast that she had Lasik eye surgery. In response, the X account for LASIK.com wasted no time promoting the fortuitous namedrop. The post had more than 450,000 views and 17,000 likes as of Friday.",
      "About 500,000 Americans undergo Lasik every year, CBS News recently reported. And while the American Refractive Surgery Council says the complication rate is less than 1%, side effects are not uncommon and should not be taken lightly by those considering the procedure.",
      "Swift's two-hour chat with the Kelce brothers marks the singer's first ever podcast interview, a milestone moment for the medium.",
      "By Thursday afternoon, Wednesday night's talk had already been seen more than 11.7 million times on YouTube. Clips distributed on Instagram, TikTok, X and elsewhere have received more than 400 million views, and the episode was also available for streaming on audio platforms.",
      "It has further to go to be a record-setter, though. The most-watched podcast episode ever on YouTube, and likely the most-consumed podcast ever, is by a company called Thmanyah, a Saudi Arabian Arabic podcast network and independent journalism platform, according to its website. The video has racked up 144 million views in two years.",
      "Swift, who infrequently gives interviews to journalists, revealed key information about her upcoming album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" and talked about her relationships with Travis Kelce and her family, and her joy of gaining full control of her past work \u2014 a yearslong quest.",

      "Here are more details Swift shared about the upcoming album:",
      "\"The Life of a Showgirl\" release date",
      "The album will be released on Friday, Oct. 3. Fans of Swift know the dates she chooses to announce and release music almost always have meaning and often have a 13, her lucky number, somewhere.",
      "\"Never not annoying,\" she said about herself on the podcast. \"Always going to try to force a 13 into the situation and this one was right there.\"",
      "Swift, Max Martin and Shellback produced the album",
      "Swift made \"The Life of a Showgirl\" with Max Martin and Shellback, producers she has worked with in the past but never for the entirety of an album.",
      "\"The three of us have made some of my favorite songs that I've ever done before,\" Swift said. Those songs include \"22,\" \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" \"Blank Space,\" \"Style,\" \"Shake It Off,\" \"\u2026Ready For It?\" and \"Delicate.\"",
      "The three hadn't produced music together in seven or eight years, but returning to work with them \"felt like catching lightning in a bottle,\" Swift said.",
      "\"By the time we came back together, I feel like we had so much more dexterity to what we do,\" she said. \"This was the time where it felt like all three of us in the room were carrying the same weight as creators and it was really special.\"",
      "Martin and Shellback have also worked with pop artists like Britney Spears, Ariana Grande, P!nk and more.",
      "\"The best ideas we've ever had\"",
      "Swift said she approached Martin, who she described as her mentor, about doing an album at her Eras Tour show in Stockholm in May 2024.",
      "\"I essentially said to him, 'I want to be as proud of an album as I am of the Eras Tour and for the same reasons,' and he was like, 'Do you understand what kind of pressure that is?'\" Swift said.",
      "But Swift is confident in the outcome.",
      "\"We knew that we had to bring the best ideas we've ever had, and I also know the pressure I'm putting on this record by saying that, but I don't care because I love it that much, and I'm so proud of it, and it just comes from like the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life, and so that effervescence has come through on this record,\" she said.",
      "\"The Life of a Showgirl\" theme",
      "Swift described the theme of \"The Life of a Showgirl\" as \"everything that was going on behind the curtain\" during the Eras Tour.",
      "Asked by Jason Kelce why she chose orange for the color scheme of the album, Swift said, \"I've just always liked it, Jason.\"",
      "\"It feels like kind of energetically how my life has felt, and this album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant,\" she said.",
      "There are 12 songs on the album",
      "Swift shared the titles of the 12 tracks on the album: \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" \"Elizabeth Taylor,\" \"Opalite,\" \"Father Figure,\" \"Eldest Daughter,\" \"Ruin The Friendship,\" \"Actually Romantic,\" \"Wi$h Li$t,\" \"Wood,\" \"Cancelled!,\" \"Honey\" and \"The Life of a Showgirl (Feat. Sabrina Carpenter).\"",
      "The pop star added that there are no additional songs, a departure from past albums. Her most recent release, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" had 31 songs.",
      "\"Every single song is on this album for hundreds of reasons. \u2026 It's just right,\" she said. \"That focus and that kind of discipline with creating an album and keeping the bar really high is something I've been wanting to do for a very long time.",
      "\"I tend to love to write lots and lots of music, so it's a temptation to release lots of music. I wanted to do an album that was so focused on quality and on the theme and everything fitting together like a perfect puzzle.\"",
      "Melodies and lyrics were key goals",
      "Swift opened up about the primary objectives she had making \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"",
      "\"My main goals were melodies that were so infectious that you're almost angry at it and lyrics that are just as vivid but crisp and focused and completely intentional,\" she said.",
      "Martin had made a point to tell Swift he didn't want her to leave behind the type of writing and storytelling she did on \"folklore\" (released in July 2020) even if the sound of this album was different. Swift said she replied, \"I couldn't if I tried.\"",
      "\"So it was really amazing that we were able to, without doing too much overthinking, we were able to get in there and it was just ideas flying and all of these ideas were like, we've been waiting years to come back together and make this project.\"",
      "The album art",
      "The cover of \"The Life of a Showgirl\" is a layered picture of Swift submerged in water.",
      "\"This represents the end of my night,\" she explained. \"When I'm on tour, I have the same day every single day \u2026 and my day ends with me in a bathtub.\"",
      "Swift wanted the cover to show something offstage to represent the theme of the album.",
      "\"This album isn't really about what happened to me on stage, it's about what I was going through offstage,\" she said. \"It's the life beyond the show.\"",
      "The images were captured by photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, who Swift previously worked with for the album art for her sixth studio album, \"reputation,\" released in 2017.",
      "\"I loved what they did with those photos, so I called them up for this one, and I'm so happy with the way that the photos came out for this one,\" she said.",
      "The album was recorded in Sweden during the Eras Tour",
      "Swift traveled to Sweden on her off days while touring Europe during the Eras Tour to work on the album.",
      "\"I would be playing shows, I'd do like three shows in a row. I'd have like three days off, I'd fly to Sweden,\" she said. \"I was physically exhausted at this point in the tour but I was so mentally stimulated and so excited to be creating.\"",
      "\"This album is going to make you dance\"",
      "Some additional details about \"The Life of a Showgirl\" came from Travis Kelce, who revealed he has heard the whole album.",
      "\"I know they're all 12 bangers,\" he said. \"It's a lot more upbeat, and it's a lot more like fun pop like excitement. \u2026 I think it's a complete 180 from a lot of the songs on 'Tortured Poets' for sure.\"",
      "Swift confirmed that was a good way to describe the album, adding, \"Life is more upbeat.\"",
      "Travis later told Jason, \"you are going to move.\"",

      "Swift said Wednesday that the gesture made her feel \"like I was in an '80s John Hughes movie, and he was just like, standing outside of my window with a boom box being like, 'I want to date you.'\"",
      "Swift also spoke about buying back the master recordings from her first six studio albums. Swift described how she had wanted to own all her music after signing a record deal at age 15. She revealed that she sent her mother and brother to Los Angeles to talk with private equity company Shamrock Capital, which owned the masters at the time, about buying them.",
      "\"A couple months after the Super Bowl in Kansas City, I get a call from my mom,\" Swift said. \"She's like, 'You got your music.' I very dramatically hit the floor for real. Bawling my eyes out, weeping, like 'Really!?' I said to myself, 'Go tell Travis in a normal way,' he was playing video games, and he put his headset down. I was like, 'I got my music back!'

      "\"I have parameters. There's do's and dont's,\" Swift said. \"It points to my music... It's something you don't know why I'm saying for a specific reason, but then you'll look back and go, 'Oh my God.'\"",
      "Swift revealed a recent Easter egg on the podcast about the descending orange door that appeared as a visual on the Eras Tour after the finale song, \"Karma.\"",

And that actually was an Easter egg. Basically the reason why I chose to exit that way is because I kind of wanted to give a little subliminal hint to the fans that I may be leaving the Eras Tour era, but I was also entering a new era.\"",

      "The Kennedy Center was designated by Congress as a living memorial to President John F. Kennedy in 1964.",
      "Along with efforts to reshape the center's governing body and performances, the president outlined during a visit to the famed opera house in March that \"we're going to make a lot of changes \u2014 including the seats, the decor \u2014 pretty much everything. It needs a lot of work.\" In July, House Republicans advanced a measure that would rename the Kennedy Center's opera house after first lady Melania Trump.",
      "The president said Wednesday that in the months since he became chairman, \"we have completely reversed the decline of this cherished national institution,\" claiming \"it was being run down\" and \"money wasn't spent properly.\"",
      "\"With a little fix-up and a little work, we can make it unbelievable,\" the president said of the space. \"The bones are so good.\"",
      "In a post on Truth Social on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said work is being done to bring the Kennedy Center \"back to the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment.\"",
      "The president, who broke with tradition during his first term by skipping the Honors shows after several award recipients criticized him, touted the \"GREAT Nominees for the TRUMP/KENNEDY CENTER, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER, AWARDS.\"",
      "The president on Wednesday also mentioned another project \u2014 a White House renovation \u2014 and his effort to \"fix up\" Washington, D.C., including the deployment of federal law enforcement and the National Guard in the District of Columbia this week to address crime.",

      "\"When he called me and asked me to do it, he said, 'I want Ivanka in the middle of this,'\" White said. \"So Ivanka reached out to me, and her and I started talking about the possibilities, where it would be and, you know, I put together all the renderings.\"",

      "Read on to learn more about the federal holiday, including what's open on Labor Day and what sales are to be had in 2025.",
      "When is Labor Day?",
      "This year, Labor Day falls on Monday, Sept.1.",
      "What is the history of Labor Day?",
      "Nowadays, Labor Day is more commonly associated with barbecues and beach days, but the federal holiday was created to celebrate the hard-won rights of American workers.",
      "Before early labor laws came into play in the 20th century, the average U.S. worker's schedule spanned 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, with low wages and little protections, according to\u00a0History.com.",

      "The civilian workforce in America is around 170 million people strong as of June 2025, data from Statista shows. While there's no cap on the number of hours Americans can work per week, federal law mandates that workers be paid a minimum wage.",
      "That wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009. However, many cities and states across the country have passed legislation to enforce higher minimums adjusted for today's cost of living. Most recently in July, the minimum wage was raised in 15 states and cities.",

      "Fast-food chains, including\u00a0Starbucks and\u00a0Taco Bell, will also be open to serve customers on Sept. 1. While some, like Starbucks, will be operating at regular hours, other chains recommend checking ahead for local store hours which may be limited on holidays.",

    "summary": "Incomes are still trailing inflation four years after the pandemic-era surge in prices, causing a financial pinch for many households.",
    "story": [
      "Wages still haven't caught up with inflation, four years after the pandemic caused prices to soar and created a cost-of-living crisis for many households, a new study finds.",
      "Americans on average are earning 1.2 percentage points below the rise in the cost of living over the past four years, which means that the typical worker's pay increases over that time haven't yet caught up to higher prices, according to Bankrate's 2025 Wage to Inflation Index.",
      "The findings come as Americans remain sour about the economy, with 55% rating it as either very or fairly bad, according to a July poll from CBS News. Three-quarters said their incomes haven't kept up with inflation, while a majority also said they've seen prices creep higher in recent weeks and also expect that to continue.",
      "But some professions are falling further behind than others, with educators seeing the biggest gap between income growth and inflation during the past four years, the study found. Teachers have long struggled with a \"wage gap,\" meaning that they typically earn less than college graduates working in other fields, due to issues such as constraints on school funding,\u00a0according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.",
      "\"Wage growth is often a reflection of who has the power in the labor market,\" Bankrate economic analyst Sarah Foster told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If there are more job openings than workers to fill them, businesses will often lift pay to retain or attract talent.\"",
      "She added, \"On the flip side, if there are too few job openings, companies don't have to work as hard to keep workers because they have nowhere to really go.\"",
      "Overall, the 1.2 percentage point gap between the typical workers' pay growth and inflation during the past four years signals that many households are continuing to feel financial strain, Foster added. Even before the pandemic, millions of Americans were\u00a0struggling to save for emergencies.",
      "\"Wages not keeping up with inflation translate to outright purchasing-power destruction,\" Foster said. \"These are funds that households could be using to stash away for their goals, like saving for retirement and a home, or building up their safety nets and emergency fund.\"",
      "The professions that have outpaced inflation include those that saw a spike in demand after the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality workers, she added. \"Health care, meanwhile, is driving job growth lately, accounting for 88% of private-sector payroll growth last month,\" Foster said.",
      "Wage dissatisfaction",
      "Only about 54% of Americans say they are satisfied with their current wages, according to a new analysis from Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That represents the lowest satisfaction level since the NY Fed began tracking the measure in 2014.",
      "Even high-income households, which contribute about\u00a0half of all consumer spending\u00a0and drive economic growth, are facing bigger financial hurdles, including surging delinquencies on credit cards and auto loans, according to recent research.",
      "For instance, the share of all new jobs that pay above-average wages has fallen to 7% this year, down from 38% prior to 2020, according to credit-scoring company VantageScore. That can make it tougher for professionals to find new jobs if they suffer a job loss, the group noted.",
      "Workers in white-collar industries like finance and business services \"speak of a frozen job market,\" Foster noted. \"Employed workers in the sector can't find anywhere else to go and unemployed workers struggle to find new work.\"",

      "How to spot a fake \"Lafufu\"",
      "Deeply discounted Labubu dolls can indicate that the products are inauthentic, according to the CPSC. Look for a holographic Pop Mart sticker and scannable QR code to identify real Labubu. Newer authentic Labubus also bear what the CPSC describes as a discrete UV stamp on one foot.",

      "The settlement, however, still has to be approved. According to the settlement website, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas will hold a final approval hearing on Dec. 3, 2025. In the meantime, impacted AT&T customers can file for compensation.",

    "summary": "Miners want to return to the treasured landscape, promising an economic boost while raising fears of how modern gold extraction could forever change the region.",
    "story": [
      "A gold rush brought settlers to South Dakota's Black Hills roughly 150 years ago, chasing the dream of wealth and displacing Native Americans in the process.",
      "Now, a new crop of miners driven by gold prices at more than $3,000 an ounce are seeking to return to the treasured landscape, promising an economic boost while raising fears of how modern gold extraction could forever change the region.",
      "\"These impacts can be long term and make it so that tourism and outdoor recreation is negatively impacted,\" said Lilias Jarding, executive director of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance. \"Our enjoyment of the Black Hills as a peaceful place, a sacred place, is disturbed.\"",
      "The Black Hills encompass over 1.2 million acres, rising up from the Great Plains in southwest South Dakota and extending into Wyoming. The jagged peaks are smaller than those of the Rocky Mountains, but the lush pine-covered hills are sacred to the Lakota Sioux people and serve as a destination for millions of tourists who visit Mount Rushmore and state parks.",
      "Dramatic landscape changes come with modern mining",
      "One gold mine now operates in the Black Hills, but companies have proposals before state and federal agencies for another one, plus exploratory drilling sites that they hope will lead to full-fledged mines. That has prompted opposition by Native American tribes and environmentalists who argue the projects are close to sacred sites, will contaminate waterways and permanently scar the landscape.",
      "Gold extraction has changed dramatically in the decades since prospectors first began panning for gold in the Black Hills. The industry now typically relies on massive trucks and diggers that create deep, multitiered pits and use chemicals like cyanide to extract the gold.",
      "The land can never return to its original state. The Homestake mine, once the largest and deepest gold mine in the Western Hemisphere, now sits barren in Lead, South Dakota, and is used for scientific research.",
      "Interest in Black Hills gold mining has soared along with the price of the metal. When the Homestake mine closed in 2002, gold sold for about $300 an ounce. Now it goes for about 10 times as much.",
      "Joseph Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council, attributes the price spike to global economic uncertainty.",
      "\"Gold tends to be a stable asset,\" he said. \"That actually performs well in inflationary times, and holds its value in recessionary times. That's why gold as an asset in investment.\"",
      "President Trump also boosted the industry by issuing an executive order in March to increase American mineral production, calling for expedited permitting and reviews.",
      "Colin Paterson, professor emeritus of geological engineering at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, notes that Black Hills gold is encased in rock. To extract it, the rock is crushed and then a chemical like cyanide is used to dissolve the mineral and remove it.",
      "Mining brings revenue, but renews Black Hills fight",
      "Coeur Mining runs the single active mine in the Black Hills, but the company Dakota Gold has plans for an open pit mine to begin operating in 2029. The company is also targeting the area near the old Homestake site to build an underground mine where workers would descend hundreds or even thousands of feet into shafts.",
      "According to data provided by Dakota Gold, they believe the net present value for the deposits could range from $1.6 billion to $2.1 billion, CBS affiliate KELO-TV reported last month.",
      "Jack Henris, president and chief operating officer of Dakota Gold, estimated the open pit mine would create up to 250 jobs and result in the company paying the state up to $400 million in taxes over the life of the mine. Dakota Gold will conduct an environmental study and surveys of soil and vegetation to ensure safe operation, Henris said.",
      "\"Most of the people that work here are from this area and just love to live here,\" he said. \"So we're a big part of the Hills and we love them just as much as other folks.\"",
      "To a great extent, gold mining helped create the modern Black Hills region.",
      "The U.S. government signed a treaty in 1868 that recognized the Sioux Nation's right to the Black Hills, but the government seized the land after the discovery of gold and allowed settlers into the region. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled the Sioux were entitled to compensation, but they have not accepted any and maintain their claim to the land.",
      "Tribes have largely opposed mining in the Black Hills.",
      "\"There's a central truth about mining in the Black Hills in that it was never the most mineral rich place there ever was,\" said Taylor Gunhammer, local organizer with the Indigenous advocacy group NDN Collective and an Oglala Sioux, one of the Lakota people. \"It's not even the actual mineral content of the Black Hills that is so attractive to mining companies. It's the permissive nature of the officials who oversee mining.\"",
      "Some proposed projects, such as Dakota Gold's mine, are on private land and only subject to state rules, not the U.S. Forest Service regulations required for projects on public acreage.",
      "Environmentalists have focused their opposition on the possibility of chemicals leaks. They note that Coeur's Wharf mine has had nearly 200 spills and that the former Homestake mine was closed because it contaminated a nearby creek.",
      "Coeur's environmental manager, Jasmine McCauley, said in a statement that each spill was \"thoroughly investigated, mitigated, and corrective actions are put in place to prevent reoccurrence.\" The company is always improving its processes, she added.",
      "Lakota People's Law Project\u00a0and the\u00a0Black Hills Clean Water Alliance have also voiced opposition to the proposed drilling and mining for gold in the area, KELO-TV reported.",
      "Jarding, of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance, said she remains concerned about the number of projects in the works.",
      "\"It's really important that people understand the exponential growth in mining activity that's been happening in the Black Hills over the last five years or so,\" Jarding said. \"There are currently active mining claims on 271,000 acres in the Black Hills. That's 20% of the whole Black Hills that is potentially going to be subject to mining.\"",

Researchers found a dramatic shift in the attainment of these milestones in recent decades.",
      "The reason for this, according to the paper, is that more young adults between the ages of 25 and 34 are facing economic barriers compared with previous generations. Changing societal attitudes around family formation are also contributing to the sharp decline in the share of young people reaching what the U.S. Census Bureau considers to be \"key milestones.\"",
      "According to the working paper, \"Changes in Milestones of Adulthood,\" almost half of all young adults in 1975 had reached four milestones associated with adulthood: moving out of one's parents' home, getting a job, getting married and having a child.",
      "Five decades on, that progression has changed dramatically. The share of young adults that have followed the traditional pathway to adulthood has dropped to less than a quarter, according to the paper.",
      "\"...Living arrangements, economic opportunities and attitudes toward family formation have not been experienced in the same fashion across generations of young adults,\" the working paper reads. \"Increases in job turbulence and economic downturns, for example, have resulted in some young adults navigating more volatile and uncertain economic environments.\"",
      "Economic conditions, combined with changing cultural norms, \"have implications for how young people develop their identity as adults,\" the paper states.",
      "This redefinition of young adulthood comes as the cost of everyday essentials, including housing, food, gas and daycare rises. As a result, more Americans are choosing to forego having a family, in some cases because they deem such choices unaffordable, the study finds.",
      "Researchers measured changes in the achievement of individual milestones, too. While one-quarter of young adults achieved all four milestones, 28% met two economic milestones \u2014 moving out of their parents' homes and finding jobs.",
      "Women in the workforce",
      "In the 1970s, getting married, having a child, and living independently, were the second-most common group of milestones young people achieved, next to the completion of all four.",
      "Women's gains in the workforce, along with changing cultural attitudes, however, have led this combination of milestones to become less popular, the report notes.",
      "The completion of education, another marker of adulthood, has overshadowed other milestones over the years as an increasing number of young adults enroll in college, according to the paper.",
      "\"These higher levels of educational attainment result in contemporary cohorts spending a longer portion of their young adult lives enrolled in higher education, potentially delaying other markers of adulthood such as entering the labor force or marriage,\" the working paper states.",
      "When it comes to perceptions of adulthood, having a job takes precedence over marriage, as young adults see economic achievements as more directly tied to adulthood than they do committing to a spouse.",
      "\"Marriage is increasingly viewed as a capstone of adulthood, something to pursue after achieving economic stability through completing formal education, establishing an independent household and becoming employed,\" the working paper states.",

      "Taylor Swift's upcoming album release and her love of all things orange isn't lost on her fans \u2014 or brands that are seeking a ride on what has become an enormous economic tailwind.",
      "On Wednesday after Swift went on the \"New Heights\" podcast co-hosted by her boyfriend, NFL football star Travis Kelce, to announce the imminent release of her 12th studio album \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" major companies went into marketing overdrive.",
      "Numerous corporations, from United Airlines to Olive Garden, began posting orange-hued memes on their own social media accounts soon after the new album was announced. Shake Shack, FedEx, Buffalo Wild Wings, Cinnabon, Walmart and Netflix did, too.",
      "That's because Swift appeared onstage wearing orange numerous times toward the end of her Eras Tour, and discussed her feelings about the color on the Wednesday podcast.",
      "\"It feels like energetically how my life has felt,\" the 14-time Grammy winner tells co-host Jason Kelce.",
      "Many, it seemed, saw value in tying their brand to Swift.",
      "More than a dozen NHL teams, both\u00a0north\u00a0and\u00a0south\u00a0of the Canadian border, followed with posts on social media acknowledging Swift's new album.",
      "mb12 pic.twitter.com/HUz2MYpEMc",
      "Even X got in on the action, declaring that it had a new profile pic: a\u00a0glittery orange X. The post soon garnered 5.5 million views.",
      "Google is using its search engine to celebrate the October release of Swift's \"The Life of a Showgirl.\" Users who search for \"Taylor Swift,\" are greeted with a shower of orange digital confetti, along with a flaming orange heart and the phrase, \"And, baby, that's show business for you.\"",
      "Swift's tour appearances have become economic events. The singer's Eras Tour two years ago was the first such tour to cross the billion-dollar mark, according to Pollstar's 2023 year-end charts. Cities and their surrounding areas registered a sizeable economic boost after Swift appeared, with thousands of fans making the pilgrimage and spending money at hotels, restaurants and elsewhere.",
      "Swift also mentioned during the Wednesday podcast that she had Lasik eye surgery. In response, the X account for LASIK.com wasted no time promoting the fortuitous namedrop. The post had more than 450,000 views and 17,000 likes as of Friday.",
      "About 500,000 Americans undergo Lasik every year, CBS News recently reported. And while the American Refractive Surgery Council says the complication rate is less than 1%, side effects are not uncommon and should not be taken lightly by those considering the procedure.",
      "Swift's two-hour chat with the Kelce brothers marks the singer's first ever podcast interview, a milestone moment for the medium.",
      "By Thursday afternoon, Wednesday night's talk had already been seen more than 11.7 million times on YouTube. Clips distributed on Instagram, TikTok, X and elsewhere have received more than 400 million views, and the episode was also available for streaming on audio platforms.",
      "It has further to go to be a record-setter, though. The most-watched podcast episode ever on YouTube, and likely the most-consumed podcast ever, is by a company called Thmanyah, a Saudi Arabian Arabic podcast network and independent journalism platform, according to its website. The video has racked up 144 million views in two years.",
      "Swift, who infrequently gives interviews to journalists, revealed key information about her upcoming album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" and talked about her relationships with Travis Kelce and her family, and her joy of gaining full control of her past work \u2014 a yearslong quest.",

      "Depending on the items you choose, your child's lunch sandwich could cost more this school year than it did in 2024.",
      "That's according to a new report from Deloitte that shows the overall cost of homemade lunches is on the rise. The average cost for a packed lunch is now $6.15, according to Deloitte, up nearly 3% from $5.99 last year. Just under half of the parents polled by the survey said they expect their child's lunch to cost more this September than it did in 2024.",
      "The reason for the price increase, as the Deloitte report points out, is because the cost of groceries has climbed in recent years. Parents are now paying more for staples like whole milk, which is up 7.8% from a year ago, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data for July, as well as for bananas, which are up 7.2%.",
      "The Consumer Price Index report for July, released earlier this week by the BLS, shows\u00a0that overall grocery prices are up 2.2% compared with last year.",
      "Some foods are cheaper",
      "Not all food prices have gone up; in fact, some food items are cheaper this year. In terms of specific lunch items, CBS' price tracker shows that the cost of white bread is actually 6% lower than it was in 2024.",

      "In response to their anticipation of higher lunch prices, caregivers plan to switch from name brands to store brands, choose cheaper sandwich options, and cut down in other household expenses to free up more cash for groceries, according to Deloitte's survey, which polled 1,203 caregivers of school-aged children.",
      "Frugal food shopping in the U.S. has \"generally been on an upward trend since October 2024,\" the report found, though it is still lower today than its peak in 2023.",
      "Cafeteria lunch crunch",
      "It's not just brown bag lunches that could end up costing families more. Cafeteria lunches, which tend to be cheaper than brown bag lunches, could also see a price hike this year.",
      "According to Tuesday's CPI data, the price of food at elementary and secondary schools is up 3.3% since July of last year. To account for inflation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last month that it would funnel more money into the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs \u2014 which provide healthy, low-cost or free meals to children.",
      "To be sure, not everyone will end up paying full price for cafeteria school lunches. In Deloitte's survey, more than half of respondents said their school offers free lunch, regardless of income.",
      "School meal prices range from $2.95 for elementary school to $3.20 for high school a\u00a0survey\u00a0conducted by School Nutrition Association found.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Aug 2025 14:50:37 -0400",
    "summary": "As Social Security celebrates its 90th anniversary, concerns are growing over its funding and recent staffing cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security celebrated its 90th anniversary Thursday, marking a major milestone for the program that supplies monthly benefit checks to almost 70 million senior citizens, disabled people and surviving family members of deceased workers.",
      "When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law on Aug. 14, 1935, he guaranteed for the first time that workers could rely on continuing income in retirement after they turned 65. As it enters its 10th decade, the program is only growing in importance amid an aging population, with a record number of Americans now collecting benefits.",
      "In the next 10 years, Social Security is expected to swell by an additional 12 million recipients, according to the AARP. But even as it grows in importance, the program is also facing mounting problems and growing questions over its long term viability.",
      "While many policy experts believe the program should be expanded, its outgoings now far outpace its income. Some Democratic lawmakers are also questioning the agency's ability to serve retirees after the Trump administration earlier this year made cuts to its workforce in what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities referred to\u00a0as the \"largest staffing cut in SSA's history.\"",
      "As these challenges have mounted, faith in the program has deteriorated, even as three-quarters of Americans say they believe Social Security is \"one of the most important programs\" the government offers, according to a recent AARP survey. Confidence in the future of Social Security has declined by 7% in the last five years, from 43% in 2020 to 36% in 2025, it found.",
      "Asked about these concerns, the Social Security Administration pointed to a Fox News interview Thursday with its commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said he's optimistic about the program's future and that the agency is working on improving its operations.",
      "The White House also took issue with the criticisms, with spokeswoman Liz Huston telling CBS News that the administration is improving customer service and \"preventing illegal aliens from accessing benefits. \"President Trump has made Social Security great again,\" she said.",
      "Funding woes",
      "A major headwind facing Social Security may not be new, but it is fast approaching: The possible insolvency of its trust funds as the gap between its revenue and expenditure grows.",
      "For instance, in 2024, the program cost $1.49 trillion, but total income was $1.42 trillion, according to the 2025 Social Security Board of Trustees' report.",
      "Because of that trend \u2014 which is expected to continue given the aging population \u2014 the Social Security trust funds are forecast to be\u00a0depleted by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast, according to the most recent trustees' report. This so-called \"go-broke\" date has been a major source of stress for Americans who worry that there won't be enough money left by the time they reach retirement age.",
      "While some workers believe that the trust funds' insolvency means Social Security will cease making payments after that date, that is incorrect. Because the program is funded through payroll taxes, Social Security has a constant stream of income \u2014 although without the trust funds' financial cushion, the program will face a shortfall, leading to a cut in benefits.",
      "Without a fix, monthly benefits could be cut by as much as 23%, the Social Security Board of Trustees warned in its 2025\u00a0annual report.",
      "But there are options for shoring up the trust funds. For one, there's a current cap on the amount of income subject to Social Security taxes, which stands at $176,100 in 2025, meaning any earnings above that amount are exempt from the payroll tax.",
      "One remedy would be to lift the cap on payroll taxes, an option that some Democratic lawmakers prefer. Another idea, floated by some Republican lawmakers, is to raise the retirement age, which currently stands at 67 for people born after 1960.",
      "Changes under President Trump",
      "President Trump has vowed not to cut Social Security, noting in a \"Meet the Press\" interview in December that \"we're not touching Social Security, other than we might make it more efficient.\" Nonetheless, concerns have mounted over the Trump administration's changes to the program, including cuts to its staff and the closure of some field offices.",
      "During a press call Wednesday organized by advocacy groups, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, claimed Mr. Trump and others in his administration are \"working overtime to try to dismantle Social Security.\"",
      "Many Americans also say they're worried about what sort of changes the new administration could make. According to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0from NerdWallet, 61% of Americans believe Social Security benefits will be cut under the current administration.",
      "The White House, however, contends that Social Security has become more efficient under Mr. Trump's leadership. In a statement released Thursday, the White House claimed that the agency is handling 70% more calls than last year and that it has cut down on wait times with the help of technology. It also said the average wait times for customers at field offices have declined by 23%.",
      "\"We have taken steps to reduce wait times, enhance security, and make it easier to navigate our programs,\" SSA commissioner Frank Bisignano wrote in an opinion piece for Fox News on Thursday. \"All the while ensuring we pay benefits accurately to those who are eligible to receive them.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday repeated his\u00a0promises to protect the program.",
      "The program will become \"stronger, bigger and better\" and is \"gonna be around a long time\" with Republicans in charge, he added in remarks from the White House.",

    "story": [
      "As recently as 2021, almost half of all U.S. mansions \u2014 homes with at least 5,000 square feet of livable space \u2014 cost $1 million or less. But today, only a handful of cities still offer top-end homes at that price range, according to a new Zillow\u00a0analysis of home prices across the U.S.",
      "Nationwide, mansions are selling for a median price of $1.4 million, but in some parts of the country, high-end properties fetch far more. In four major California cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, the median mansion has a price tag of $4.5 million, Zillow said.",
      "In four metro areas, though, homebuyers can snap up an extra-large residence for under $1 million:",

      "For those willing to trade location for space, mansion values also hover around or slightly more than $1 million across the Midwest and in some Southern cities as well, including Louisville, Kentucky and Birmingham, Alabama, according to Zillow.",
      "\"In general, mansion prices move with general affordability. So in places like Buffalo, Indianapolis, Cleveland and Memphis, in the broad scheme of the U.S., these markets tend to be relatively more affordable,\" Zillow senior economist Kara Ng told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So it makes sense you could find a typical mansion for under $1 million in those regions.\"",
      "Many mansions that below the $1 million mark are less expensive because they are older homes, with a median construction year of 1985 versus 2000 for the median construction year for all mansions, Zillow said.",
      "In 2021, nearly half of all U.S. mansions were worth less than $1 million. Today, just three in 10 fall below the $1 million threshold, according to the report.",
      "Mansions \u2014 and homes in general \u2014 are most costly on the coasts. In San Jose, the median mansion is valued at $6.5 million, for example. \"The coasts tend to be on the pricier side, and that follows general affordability trends,\" Ng said. \"It's hard to build due to geographical constraints, and housing deficits in these areas tends to put upward pressure on prices.\"",
      "To be sure, homebuyers in every price range are getting less for their money, with the median U.S. home sale price reaching\u00a0a record of nearly $400,000 in June, according to Redfin. Tight inventory and high mortgage rates has made it tougher for would-be buyers to enter the property market.",
      "Last year, just 24% of home sales were to first-time homebuyers, down from 50% in 2010, according to data from the National Association of Realtors.",
      "Where are the most mansions under $1 million?",
      "Atlanta, Georgia has the greatest number of mansions \u2014 21,634 \u2014 under $1 million. That accounts for 5% of all mansions under $1 million in the U.S. Look to New York City for the second highest share of large residences \u2014 2,555, \u2014 under $1 million.",

I think we could all speculate the reasons for that, probably tariffs and the impact that, that might have, questions around employment situation,\" Kempczinski said.",
      "According to Kempczinski, the decline in traffic from low-income consumers \u2014 a core demographic for fast-food restaurants \u2014 is an industrywide trend, with breakfast menus across the quick service industry taking the biggest hit.",
      "Why skip breakfast?",
      "As many Americans rein in discretionary spending, industry analysts and executives say one of the first items on the chopping block is breakfast. Instead of heading to the drive-thru for a breakfast sandwich, more Americans are opting to grab something at home, or skip the meal altogether.",
      "\"When consumer uncertainty increases and consumers choose to eat another meal at home, breakfast is often the first place that they do that with,\" Wendy's interim CEO Ken Cook said on the company's earnings call Aug. 8.",
      "That's a stark contrast to the breakfast boom fast-food chains have enjoyed for nearly a decade, which led many restaurants over the years to expand their early morning offerings. Starbucks, which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12 separate items. Wendy's\u00a0reintroduced\u00a0breakfast in 2020 and offers 10 items with eggs.",
      "The cost of fast food has also skyrocketed over the past decade,\u00a0according\u00a0to 2024 report by FinanceBuzz. The personal finance site found that the price of a McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese meal from McDonald's more than doubled in price from $5.39 in 2014 to $11.99 in 2024.",
      "To be sure, reports of slowing traffic at fast-food chains have preceded the recent decline in breakfast sales. On an earnings call in May 2024, McDonald's CEO Kempczinski expressed \"heightened anxiety\" about how the economy was weighing on lower- and middle-income Americans. During that same time, the CEO of Dine Brands, which owns Applebee's and IHOP,\u00a0told\u00a0CNBC that casual restaurants were also seeing a drop in low-income customers.",
      "Still, not all fast-food chains are experiencing declines in breakfast traffic. Both Starbucks and Dunkin' told CBS MoneyWatch they've seen success with breakfast sales.",
      "Reached for comment by CBS MoneyWatch, both McDonald's and Wendy's pointed to their earnings reports.",
      "What falling breakfast sales say about the economy",
      "Experts say that American consumers' decision to skip out on breakfast points to myriad economic pressures facing low- and middle-income consumers ranging from sky-high credit card interest rates to inflation.",
      "\"The fact that the breakfast day part is slowing now, in our opinion, speaks to heightened economic uncertainty and the lower consumer confidence that we've seen, and that really escalated as tariff rhetoric came into the picture,\" Matthew Todd, a director at S&P Global Ratings, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The consumer is very value focused, discerning and selective about how they're spending. I think we would say we think breakfast is the easiest meal to cut because consumers can eat something quickly,\" Todd said.",
      "Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, told CBS MoneyWatch that low- and middle-income Americans have been spending more cautiously since the end of last year, in part due to a \"weakening\" labor market. \"That's adding to their nervousness and their caution so far this year,\" he said.",
      "The most recent jobs report showed hiring slowed in July. The Labor Department also sharply revised job growth for May and June down by a combined 258,000, a sign that hiring was weaker than previously estimated. With the revisions, the U.S. added 19,000 jobs in May and 14,000 in June.",
      "Experts also told CBS MoneyWatch that low-income consumers' purchasing power is already under pressure due to inflation \u2014 something they said\u00a0tariffs could exacerbate. The Consumer Price Index in July showed inflation held steady at 2.7% on an annual basis. Restaurant prices are up 3.9% since July of last year and 0.3% from June.",
      "\"If they have to spend more to buy a pair of shoes or get their hair cut, they're gonna have less to spend on everything else again, including breakfast at a fast-food restaurant,\" Zandi said.",

    "story": [
      "Social Security beneficiaries could see a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) next year, which is slightly more than the 2.5% boost U.S. retirees\u00a0received\u00a0this year.",
      "The new estimate comes from the Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group, which posted its prediction on its website on Tuesday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its latest\u00a0inflation figures.",
      "AARP also\u00a0released\u00a02026 COLA estimates from experts, such as Mike Lynch, managing director of applied insights at Hartford Funds, who predicted a more modest adjustment in line with the 2025 COLA.",
      "The Social Security Administration makes a cost-of-living adjustment each year to ensure benefits payments for U.S. seniors keep pace with inflation. The yearly adjustment, which the agency is scheduled to announce in October, would go into effect in January 2026.",
      "The SSA did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Each fall, the agency uses inflation data from July, August and September to determine the COLA for the next year. The consumer price index (CPI), a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers that tracks the change in prices on everyday items over time, showed that the inflation rate in July held steady at 2.7% on an annual basis, the same as it was in June.",
      "The inflation rate has remained at or below 3% since the start of 2025. However, experts predict it could inch up later in the year as tariffs put more pressure on consumer prices. Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, told CBS MoneyWatch that he estimates headline CPI will rise to 3.7% and core CPI will rise to 3.8% by the second quarter of 2026.",
      "Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at New York City's New School, believes inflation will likely rise and is concerned that a moderate cost-of-living adjustment \"probably won't be enough to cover the inflation rates that we're headed into,\" AARP reported.",
      "Martha Shedden, the president and co-founder of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts, echoed that concern, telling CBS MoneyWatch that based on the current way COLA is calculated, the increase\u00a0is \"not keeping up with seniors' true expenses.\"",
      "According the the AARP, the 2.5% COLA adjustment introduced this year boosted the average Social Security retiree's payment by about $49 a month. The average monthly Social Security check for all beneficiaries was $1,861 in June 2025 and $2,005 for retired workers,\u00a0according to the Senior Citizens League.",
      "In addition to the COLA, some senior citizens will also benefit from a provision included in President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" which provides a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for Americans aged 65 and older.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:40:58 -0400",
    "summary": "Newsmax will pay $67 million to settle a lawsuit accusing it of defaming the voting equipment company Dominion Voting Systems over its role in the 2020 election.",
    "story": [
      "The conservative network Newsmax will pay $67 million to settle a lawsuit accusing it of defaming a voting equipment company by spreading lies about President Trump's 2020 election loss, according to documents filed Monday. The suit against Newsmax was brought by Dominion Voting Systems, which alleged the network published false and defamatory statements claiming the company rigged the election. A Delaware judge ruled partially in favor of Dominion in a decision earlier this year, additional court filings show.",
      "The settlement comes after Fox News Channel paid $787.5 million\u00a0to settle a similar lawsuit in 2023 and Newsmax paid what court papers describe as $40 million to settle a libel lawsuit from a different voting machine manufacturer, Smartmatic, which also was a target of pro-Trump conspiracy theories on the network.",
      "Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis had ruled earlier that Newsmax did indeed defame Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems by airing false information about the company and its equipment. But Davis left it to a jury to eventually decide whether that was done with malice, and, if so, how much Dominion deserved from Newsmax in damages. Newsmax and Dominion reached a settlement before the trial could take place.",
      "In a statement to CBS News on Monday, a Dominion spokesperson said the company was \"pleased to have settled this matter.\"",
      "The settlement originally came to light in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing by Newsmax, which was dated Friday, Aug. 15, the day that a deal was reached, according to the document. Newsmax has agreed to pay the settlement in three installments of $27 million, $20 million and $20 million, with the final installment to be paid in January 2027, the filing said.",
      "Newsmax continues to deny allegations that suggest its coverage of Dominion in the context of the 2020 election was defamatory.",
      "\"Newsmax believed it was critically important for the American people to hear both sides of the election disputes that arose in 2020,\" the company said in a statement published on its website. \"We stand by our coverage as fair, balanced, and conducted within professional standards of journalism.\"",
      "The disclosure of the settlement came as Mr. Trump, who lost his 2020 reelection bid to former President Joe Biden, vowed in a social media post Monday to eliminate mail-in ballots and voting machines, such as those supplied by Dominion and other companies, ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. It was unclear how the Republican president could achieve that.",
      "\"I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, and also, while we're at it, Highly 'Inaccurate,' Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES, which cost Ten Times more than accurate and sophisticated Watermark Paper, which is faster, and leaves NO DOUBT, at the end of the evening, as to who WON, and who LOST, the Election,\" Mr. Trump wrote in the post.",
      "The same judge also handled the Dominion-Fox News case and made a similar ruling that the network repeated numerous lies by Mr. Trump's allies about his 2020 loss, despite internal communications showing Fox officials knew the claims were bogus. At the time, Davis found it was \"CRYSTAL clear\" that none of the allegations was true.",
      "Internal correspondence from Newsmax officials likewise shows they knew the claims were baseless.",
      "\"How long are we going to play along with election fraud?\" Newsmax host Bob Sellers said two days after the 2020 election was called for Biden, according to internal documents revealed as part of the case.",
      "Newsmax took pride that it was not calling the election for Biden, and internal documents show it saw a business opportunity in catering to viewers who believed Mr. Trump won. Private communications that surfaced as part of Dominion's earlier defamation case against Fox News also revealed how the network's business interests intersected with decisions it made related to coverage of Mr. Trump's 2020 election claims.",
      "At Newsmax, employees repeatedly warned against false allegations from pro-Trump guests such as attorney Sidney Powell, according to documents in the lawsuit. In one text, even Newsmax owner Chris Ruddy, a Trump ally, said he found it \"scary\" that Mr. Trump was meeting with Powell.",
      "Dominion was at the heart of many of the wild claims aired by guests on Newsmax and elsewhere, who promoted a conspiracy theory involving deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to rig the machines for Biden. The network retracted some of the more bombastic allegations in December 2020.",
      "Though Mr. Trump has insisted his fraud claims are real, there's no evidence they were, and the lawsuits in the Fox and Newsmax cases show how some of the president's biggest supporters knew they were false at the time. Mr. Trump's then-attorney general, William Barr, said there was no evidence of widespread fraud.",
      "Mr. Trump and his backers lost dozens of lawsuits alleging fraud, some before Trump-appointed judges. Numerous recounts, reviews and audits of the election results, including some run by Republicans, turned up no signs of significant wrongdoing or error and affirmed Biden's win.",
      "After returning to office, Mr. Trump pardoned those who tried to halt the transfer of power during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and directed his Department of Justice to investigate Chris Krebs, a former Trump cybersecurity appointee who had vouched for the security and accuracy of the 2020 election.",
      "As an initial trial date approached in the Dominion case earlier this year, Mr. Trump issued an executive order attacking the law firm that litigated it and the Fox case, Susman Godfrey. The order, part of a series targeting law firms that Mr. Trump has tussled with, cited Susman Godfrey's work on elections and said the government would not do business with any of its clients or permit any of its staff in federal buildings.",
      "A federal judge put that action on hold, saying the framers would view it as \"a shocking abuse of power.\"",

    "story": [
      "Democrats unveiled a proposal Friday that could give California's dominant political party an additional five U.S. House seats in a bid to win the fight to control Congress next year.",
      "The plan calls for an unusually timed reshaping of House district lines to greatly strengthen the Democratic advantage in the state ahead of midterm elections, when Republicans will be defending the party's fragile House majority.",
      "It amounts to a counterpunch to the Texas Republicans' plan to take five Democratically held seats and redraw them to favor the GOP at the urging of President Trump as he tries to avoid losing control of Congress and, with it, prospects for his conservative agenda in the later part of his term.",
      "The California effort seeks to take five of the state's nine GOP districts and make them more favorable to Democrats. Just like in Texas, however, it is by no means a guarantee that Democrats would win all five of these seats if a new California map becomes law.",
      "Making the shift would likely require an amendment to California's state Constitution. Overhauling the current map that is in law would need to be passed by a two-thirds vote in both the state Assembly and state Senate, and then be approved by California voters in an election.",
      "California lawmakers are scheduled to return to Sacramento on Aug. 18 amid the redistricting talk. The California State Legislature will have a short time span to move forward.",
      "If approved by voters in a special election this November, the California blueprint could nearly erase Republican House members in the nation's most populous state. The Democratic plan is intended to win the party 48 of its 52 U.S. House seats, up from 43 currently.",
      "The proposal was released by the campaign arm of House Democrats, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Democrats in the state Legislature will hold hearings and plan to vote on the new maps next week.",
      "\"This is about more than drawing lines on a map. It's about drawing a line in the sand to stop Texas and Trump from rigging the election,\" state Senate Democratic leader Mike McGuire said in a statement.",
      "New districts have boundaries to boost Democratic edge",
      "While a general notion behind drawing districts is to unite what's called communities of interest \u2014 neighborhoods and cities that share similar concerns or demographic traits \u2014 the proposed remapping would create a jigsaw of oddly shaped districts to maximize Democratic clout.",
      "The 1st Congressional District is currently anchored in the state's conservative far northeast corner and is represented by Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Trump supporter. The district has a nearly 18-point GOP registration edge.",
      "Under the proposal, Democrats would end up with a 10-point registration advantage in the district after drastic reshaping to include parts of heavily Democratic Sonoma County near the Pacific Coast.",
      "In a post on the social platform X, LaMalfa called the proposal \"absolutely ridiculous.\" LaMalfa's first congressional district would include parts of Santa Rosa under the proposed maps, an area that is in Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson's district.",
      "In the battleground 41st District east of Los Angeles, represented by long-serving Republican Rep. Ken Calvert, Democratic and Republican registration is currently split about evenly.",
      "But in the redrawn district, Democratic registration would jump to 46%, with GOP registration falling to 26%.",
      "Other Republicans whose districts would see major changes intended to favor Democrats include Rep. Kevin Kiley in Northern California, Rep. Ken Calvert in Riverside County, Rep. David Valadao in the Central Valley farm belt and Rep. Darrell Issa in San Diego County. Also, embattled Democratic incumbents would see their districts padded with additional left-leaning voters.",
      "\"Well, obviously, Newsom's entire goal was to revert to the era of drawing lines based upon partisan political factors, as politicians draw their lines,\" Kiley told CBS Sacramento earlier Friday.",
      "Kiley's current district covers suburbs, small towns and mountain communities from the Sacramento region to the Eastern California border.",
      "The release of the plan came the same day that Texas Republicans began a second special session to approve new congressional maps sought by Trump.",
      "The GOP's first special session in Texas ended without approving new political maps, thwarted by Democrats who staged a nearly two-week walkout that meant not enough lawmakers were present to pass any legislation. Gov. Greg Abbott then quickly called a second session that started without the necessary quorum to conduct business.",
      "Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday that his state will hold a Nov. 4 special referendum on the redrawn districts.",
      "\"We can't stand back and watch this democracy disappear district by district all across the country,\" Newsom said.",
      "The announcement marked the first time any state beyond Texas officially waded into Trump's fight, though several governors and legislative leaders from both parties have threatened such moves.",
      "Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, who heads the House GOP campaign arm, said Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, is \"shredding California's Constitution and disenfranchising voters.\"",
      "\"Californians oppose Newsom's stunt because they won't let a self-serving politician rig the system to further his career,\" said Hudson, who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee.",
      "How will voters react?",
      "Under current law, California has an independent redistricting commission that was approved by voters earlier this century. Newsom has emphasized that the ballot effort would not get rid of the commission, though it would essentially suspend it. If the measure passes, the commission would then resume being able to write maps after the 2030 census.",
      "A big risk for Democrats is whether voters will be open to setting aside district boundaries crafted by the independent commission for ones shaped for partisan advantage.",
      "Some people already have said they would sue over the effort. Republican former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a longtime opponent of partisan redistricting, signaled that he will not side with Democrats even after talking to Newsom. He posted a photo of himself Friday at the gym wearing a T-shirt that said, \"Terminate gerrymandering,\" with a reference to an obscenity and politicians.",
      "\"I'm getting ready for the gerrymandering battle,\" Schwarzenegger said.",
      "House control could come down to a few seats in 2026",
      "On a national level, the partisan makeup of existing district lines puts Democrats within three seats of a majority. Of the 435 total seats, only several dozen districts are competitive. So even slight changes in a few states could affect which party wins control.",
      "New maps are typically drawn once a decade after the census \u2014 the last being in 2020. Many states, including Texas, give legislators the power to draw maps. California is among those that empowers independent commissions with the task.",
      "If approved, a new California map would take effect only if a Republican state does its own redistricting. It would remain through the 2030 elections. After that, Democrats say, they would return mapmaking power to the independent commission voters approved in 2008.",

      "Mr. Trump announced the meeting early Saturday, following his\u00a0summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. In a post on Truth Social, the president said the meeting with Putin \"went very well,\" adding that the same was true of a phone call with Zelenskyy and various European leaders after the fact.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy will be coming to D.C., the Oval Office, on Monday afternoon,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin.\"",
      "European and NATO leaders are expected to accompany Zelenskyy to Washington, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said she was joining at \"the request of President Zelenskyy.\"",
      "Though the nearly three-hour-long meeting between the U.S. and Russian presidents on Friday failed to produce the ceasefire that Mr. Trump had sought, the administration has since pivoted to seeking a broader peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. The decision to abandon a ceasefire was at odds with the goals of the U.S. and European allies heading into the summit, and some analysts say the shift could give Putin more leverage at the negotiating table.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that \"both sides are going to have to make concessions\" to get there.",
      "\"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again,\" Rubio said, noting that doing so would require both sides \"to give.\"",
      "The secretary of state, who attended Friday's summit meeting with Putin, indicated that enough progress was made to sit down with Zelenskyy to \"narrow the gap between the two sides.\"",
      "Rubio said the details of security guarantees for Ukraine, the question of territories and the issue of rebuilding the country still need to be discussed and \"require some more specificity.\"",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday that Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and Europe to offer \"game-changing\" security guarantees, including a possible arrangement in which the allies provide \"Article 5-like protection\" to Ukraine. Article 5 of the NATO charter says an attack on one member nation is considered an attack against all. Putin has been vehemently opposed to Ukraine joining NATO, but a similar security guarantee outside the framework of the alliance might reassure Kyiv that Russia would be deterred from attacking in the future.",
      "Witkoff noted that the administration intends to discuss a possible land swap at Monday's meeting.",
      "\"We're not waiting a week for a meeting with Zelenskyy and the European leaders,\" Witkoff said. \"We are intent on trying to hammer out a peace deal that ends the fighting permanently, very, very quickly. Quicker than a ceasefire.\"",

Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!\" Mr. Trump was referring to Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea in early 2014.",
      "In a\u00a0post on X, Zelenskyy said he'd arrived in Washington for the talks and insisted, \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace.\"",
      "Ahead of Monday's meeting, Russian attacks on Ukraine continued, with a wave of air strikes hitting cities around the country, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa and Sumy, CBS News partner network BBC News reported. Ukrainian authorities said a drone attack on a residential area in the city of Kharkiv overnight killed a toddler, a 16-year-old and five other people.",
      "\"Despite all of the diplomacy and peace efforts, Russia continues to kill civilians,\" Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrii Sybiha said in a social media post. \"Russia is a murderous war machine that Ukraine is holding back.

    "story": [
      "In the hours after convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein died in a Manhattan detention cell, then-U.S. Attorney General William Barr pledged to intervene personally to lead the investigation into Epstein's death.",
      "Among the first to arrive at the Metropolitan Correctional Center soon after Epstein's death in August 2019 were members of Barr's senior staff. The visit to the federal detention center by senior members of the attorney general's staff was highly unusual, a source who was there at the time and witnessed the visit told CBS News. But so was the death in custody of such a controversial figure.",
      "One source didn't recall ever seeing members of the attorney general's senior staff investigate an inmate death in more than 20 years. Another source, involved in the investigation, said such senior visits were rare, and if they occurred, usually pertained to promoting correctional programs, not investigating inmate deaths.",
      "Barr's involvement extended to a personal review of the approximately 11 hours of jail surveillance footage from the night of Epstein's death. He said in an interview with The Associated Press three months later that it showed no one had entered the area where Epstein was housed, and he concurred with the conclusion of the medical examiner: Epstein had died by suicide.",
      "Last month, after the FBI made that video public, an\u00a0analysis by CBS News identified inconsistencies between Barr's description of the video and what it actually showed \u2014 including whether it really proves no one else entered the cell block.",
      "Now, Barr is scheduled to appear on Monday on Capitol Hill, where he will be questioned behind closed doors by members of Congress conducting a review of the Epstein matter.",
      "Sources familiar with the oversight committee's plans tell CBS News they will be asking questions about Barr's involvement in the death investigation.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Barr for comment.",
      "The deposition of Barr, who served two Republican presidents as U.S. attorney general, comes as Epstein's 2019 death in federal custody has come under renewed, intense public and governmental scrutiny. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer, a Republican from Kentucky, issued several deposition subpoenas in August, including to Barr, former President Bill Clinton, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and former FBI Director James Comey.",
      "Barr, a veteran of the George H.W. Bush administration who was serving his second stint as head of the Justice Department under President Trump at the time, said he was \"appalled\" when Epstein was found dead on Aug. 10, 2019, in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center.",
      "Epstein was being held at the now temporarily shuttered federal detention center after being arrested on sex trafficking charges that could have carried a life sentence. His arrest came after years of questions surrounding an earlier controversial prosecutorial deal in Florida where he pleaded to state prostitution charges and a federal felony case was dropped.",
      "Scrutiny around that deal, and his subsequent death, has fueled years of suspicions and conspiracy theories. The furor also has enveloped Epstein's vast network of powerful former friends, including Mr. Trump and former President Clinton, who have disavowed him and have not been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Campaign promises to \"declassify\" files related to Epstein, made by Mr. Trump and his surrogates in 2024, have led to months of political headaches for the White House.",
      "The release last month of what the Justice Department called \"raw\" surveillance video from near Epstein's cell block, rather than settling questions about the night he died, raised new ones. The analysis by CBS News flagged multiple inconsistencies between the video and the 2023 report released by the Justice Department's Inspector General on Epstein's death.",
      "As Congress steps up its inquiry, Barr is the first person scheduled\u00a0to be deposed by the committee.",
      "Barr has acknowledged what he called \"a perfect storm of screw-ups\" at the jail, but said his \"personal review\" of surveillance footage supported the conclusion that Epstein had died by suicide.",
      "As attorney general, Barr faced calls to recuse himself from Epstein's criminal case because he had previously worked for a law firm, Kirkland and Ellis, that had represented Epstein. (Their paths also indirectly crossed decades earlier, in the early 1970s, when Epstein was hired to teach at an elite private school in New York City where Barr's father was the headmaster.)",
      "Here is a look at some unanswered questions Barr may be asked based on a review of the 2023 DOJ inspector general's report, documents released by the Bureau of Prisons, and the surveillance video.",
      "Questions for Barr about Jeffrey Epstein death investigation",
      "Did the video Barr reviewed from MCC have a missing minute?",
      "Before the supposedly \"raw\" surveillance video was released last month, showing about 11 hours of footage from the night Epstein died, Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters that one minute right before midnight was missing was because \"every night is reset, so every night should have the same missing minute,\" from 11:59 p.m. to midnight.",
      "That was later disputed by a government source familiar with the investigation in an interview with CBS News in July. Another high-level government source said the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General are in possession of full unedited copies of the video, and those copies do not have a missing minute. Why the FBI released the video with that small segment missing is unclear, and it is not known if anything notable occurred during that minute.",
      "Does Barr still believe that \"between the time Epstein was locked in his cell at 7:49 p.m. on the night of August 9 and the time he was discovered the next morning at 6:30 a.m., no one entered his tier\"?",
      "Barr made that statement in 2019, but the CBS News video analysis indicates the view from the jail camera does not conclusively prove no one entered Epstein's cell block. A staircase leading to Epstein's cell block is almost entirely out of view from the camera, with just a small sliver of stairs visible. From the video released publicly, experts told CBS News it is impossible to determine whether anyone entered the jail unit and accessed the staircase without being captured on the recording.",
      "Just before 10:40 p.m., the video shows a glimpse of an orange shape moving up the stairs leading to Epstein's tier. The inspector general's report said that it was a jail staffer bringing orange linens or inmate clothing up the stairs. Some video forensic experts who reviewed that footage at the request of CBS News said they were skeptical about that interpretation. They suggested the shape could be a person dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit climbing the stairs. Inmates were typically confined to their cells late at night.",
      "What did the DOJ do to investigate theories other than suicide?",
      "No evidence has surfaced suggesting that anyone else was involved in Epstein's death. He had been placed on suicide watch after an apparent attempt to hang himself a month before, and remained under heightened observation. However, there do remain significant unanswered questions about his death, some of which were raised in a \"60 Minutes\" report in 2020 looking at the medical evidence. Those included questions relating to the autopsy.",
      "A private autopsy commissioned by Epstein's family, conducted alongside the official examination by the medical examiner, raised concerns about the angle of the ligature marks on his neck and the presence of broken neck bones, findings that suggested a level of force greater than typically associated with a hanging. The medical examiner disputed that, saying such fractures can occur in suicides.",

      "Washington \u2014 Former Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown announced a bid to once again represent Ohio in the Senate on Monday, nearly a year after his reelection effort in 2024 fell short.",
      "\"I didn't plan to run for office again. But when I see what's going on, I know I can do something about it for Ohio,\" Brown said in a video announcement. \"That's why I'm running for Senate, because even in these challenging times, I still believe if you stand up for workers, treat people with respect, and always fight for Ohio, you can actually make a difference.\"",
      "Brown, 72, lost his bid for a fourth term in the upper chamber last November against GOP challenger Sen. Bernie Moreno. Brown was the sole Democrat holding statewide office in Ohio and was one of the key targets for Republicans in the 2024 election in which they took control of the Senate.",
      "Brown had historically appealed to ticket-splitters with his strong working-class brand in the state, which he had represented in the Senate since 2007. But President Trump won Ohio by more than 10 percentage points, making Brown's election a steep uphill climb. Moreno beat him by less than four points.",
      "In 2026, Brown is set to face off against Sen. Jon Husted, a Republican who was appointed to fill Ohio's other Senate seat, which Vice President JD Vance vacated. The special election will determine who will serve the remainder of Vance's term, meaning the winner would have to run for election again in 2028.",
      "Husted, 57, was appointed in January by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, and previously served as DeWine's lieutenant governor.",
      "The Ohio race is expected to be a tough battle for Democrats, as the party seeks to retake the majority in the Senate. With 53 Republicans in the upper chamber, Democrats would need to defend seats in a handful of potentially competitive states, while flipping four seats to retake a majority in 2026.",
      "While few races appear comfortably in range, Democrats have been working to recruit formidable candidates, like former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, to boost their chances. Brown's entrance into the race marks the latest recruiting victory for the party.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Trump to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday.",
      "\"We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,\" he told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" He added that it \"was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that\" and called it \"game-changing.\"",
      "Article 5, at the heart of the 32-member military alliance, states that an armed attack against one or more of the members shall be considered an attack against all members.",
      "Witkoff, who had joined Secretary of State Marco Rubio for the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, offered few details on how such an agreement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his long-standing objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership.",
      "Outlining some of the details about the private discussions, Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not \"go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty. And there was plenty more.\"",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at a news conference in Brussels with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, applauded the move. \"We welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine and the 'Coalition of the willing' \u2014 including the European Union \u2014 is ready to do its share,\" she said.",
      "Zelenskyy thanked the United States for recent signals that Washington was willing to support such guarantees, but said much was unclear.",
      "\"It is important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine,\" he said, \"But there are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do, and this is our main task, we need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO, and we consider EU accession to be part of the security guarantees.\"",
      "Witkoff defended Mr. Trump's decision to abandon his push that Russian agree to an immediate ceasefire, which the president had set as a benchmark going into the meeting. Witkoff said the Republican president had pivoted toward a peace deal because so much progress was made.",
      "\"We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,\" Witkoff said, without elaborating. \"We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal.\"",
      "Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he did not believe imposing new U.S. sanctions on Russia would force Putin to accept a ceasefire.",
      "\"If he did this now, the moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks,\" Rubio said. \"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here.\"",
      "Rubio said that Kyiv \"is going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too.\"",
      "\"For example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security,\" Rubio said. \"That's not an unreasonable request. That's something that needs to be worked on.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Sunday wrote on social media, \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!\"",
      "Zelenskyy and European leaders, who heard from Mr. Trump after the summit, are scheduled to meet with him at the White House on Monday.",
      "Rubio said of the talks with Russia, \"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"",
      "Zelenskyy on Sunday night said on social media that he had arrived in Washington, D.C., for Monday's meeting, but pushed back on the Trump administration's comments about ceding territory to Russia.",
      "\"We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably. And peace must be lasting. Not like it was years ago, when Ukraine was forced to give up Crimea and part of our East\u2014part of Donbas\u2014and Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack,\" Zelenskyy wrote, adding \"Crimea should not have been given up then, just as Ukrainians did not give up Kyiv, Odesa, or Kharkiv after 2022.\"",
      "\"I am confident that we will defend Ukraine, effectively guarantee security, and that our people will always be grateful to President Trump, everyone in America, and every partner and ally for their support and invaluable assistance,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace. Thank you!\"",

      "Dozens of Texas House Democrats fled to blue states earlier this month after President Trump suggested the state should redraw its U.S. House district maps to secure more Republican seats. The Democrats have until now remained out of the state to deny Texas' Republican Gov. Greg Abbott a quorum, temporarily derailing a special legislative session that the governor called to reshape the state's congressional maps.",
      "The GOP-led redistricting effort would create five more Republican-leaning House seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. Republicans currently have a narrow majority in the House. Historically, the party that controls the White House typically loses ground in midterm elections. States usually redraw districts each decade to reflect population shifts after the decennial census.",
      "After successfully denying Texas Republicans a quorum multiple times in recent weeks, Democrats notched a small victory when the GOP wrapped the initial special session. With a new special session gaveled in on Friday, the Democrats have begun returning. Some are already in Texas, and the caucus is working on a count to tell whether the chamber will have a quorum Monday, the sources told CBS News.",
      "GOP officials in the state have threatened to arrest the lawmakers to compel their appearance at the state Capitol, and one Republican senator enlisted the help of the FBI to track down the legislators.",

      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, ultimately, yes.",
      "But, I mean, what he means by root causes is this long historical complaints that we've heard repeatedly. This is not a new argument. He's been making this for a long time. And it's the argument that it's Western encroachment. I don't want to get into \u2013 it's just so long.",

      "And what it's going to take to stop the fighting, if we're being honest and serious here, is, both sides are going to have to give, and both sides should expect to get something from this. And that's a very difficult thing to do. It's very difficult, because Ukraine obviously feels, you know, harmed, and rightfully so, because they were invaded, and the Russian side, because they feel like they have got momentum in the battlefield, and frankly, don't care, don't seem to care very much about how many Russian soldiers die in this endeavor.",
      "They just churn through it. So I think what the president deserves a lot of credit for is the amount of time and energy that his administration is placing on reaching a peace agreement for a war that's not a war that started under him. It's half \u2013 you know, it's on the other side of the world.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "You know this well, how long these kind of diplomatic negotiations often take. President Trump was telling European leaders what was discussed was Putin demanding control of Donetsk, a region in the east that his forces do not fully hold. And the U.K. estimates that taking that full area could be as long as another four years.",
      "Putin also is demanding Russian be an official language in Ukraine and something regarding Russian Orthodox churches. Did the U.S. accept all of what Putin laid out at that table?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The United States is not in a position to accept anything or reject anything, because, ultimately, it's up to the Ukrainians. They're the ones that Russia has to make peace with, and Ukraine with Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president said he did come to some agreements.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's up to the Ukrainians to make these conditions.",
      "Well, the agreements were that we were going to try to do things like, for example, get a leader \u2013 a leaders meeting. We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war.",
      "Now, there were some concepts and ideas discussed that we know the Ukrainians could be very supportive of in that meeting. I don't think it's \u2013 we're not going to negotiate this in the media. I understand that everybody wants to know what happened.",
      "But, ultimately, there are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs, that are potentials for progress. We'll be discussing that more in depth tomorrow with our European allies, with the Ukrainians that are coming over. We'll be discussing all of these things, because, ultimately, we do need to find areas where we're making progress and try to begin to narrow the gap between the two sides.",
      "But there's a reason why this war has been going on for 3.5 years. And that is, when it comes to the big issues here, there are still some big differences between both sides. Let's see how much progress we can continue to make. It's \u2013 it's \u2013 it's not been easy, but it's something the president has made a priority, peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And he deserves a lot of credit for that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, ultimately, if \u2013 if Vladimir Putin is going to be offered land that he has not seized yet, but negotiates his way into, doesn't this set a dangerous precedent that the United States now accepts this concept that it is OK to seize land by force?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, Putin has already seized land by force, and that, in and of itself, is not a positive precedent. This whole war is a negative president \u2013 precedent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you demanding withdrawal?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, again, here's the \u2013 in order to have a deal here to end \u2013 to reach the end of this conflict, both sides are going to have to make concessions. That's just a fact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But does that mean accepting\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: In any negotiation, if\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 where Russian forces are now?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, no, but, if \u2013 but this is not about acceptance. This is about what Ukraine can accept and what Russia can accept. They both have to accept it. Otherwise, there won't be a peace deal, OK?",
      "If there aren't concessions, if one side gets everything they want, that's called surrender. That's called the end of the war through surrender. And that's not what we're close to doing, because neither side here is on the verge of surrender or anything close to it.",
      "So, in order for there to be a peace deal \u2013 this is just a fact. We may not like it, it may not be pleasant, it may be distasteful, but in order for there to be an end of the war, there are things Russia wants that it cannot get, and there are things Ukraine wants that it's not going to get.",
      "Both sides are going to have to give up something in order to get to the table in order to make this happen. That's \u2013 that's just the way it is. And, I mean, the sooner we accept that, that's the reality.",
      "Now, what those things are is going to be up to both sides. There's no conditions that can be imposed on Ukraine. They're going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too. And so, for example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to have \u2013 to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security.",
      "That's not an unreasonable request. That's something that needs to be worked on. Territories will have to be discussed. It's just a fact. And there are things that maybe Russia is holding now that they're going to have to give up. Who knows?",
      "The point is, we need to create a scenario where that becomes possible. And that's why this has been so hard, because neither side, up to now, has been willing to give on some of these things. But we'll see if that's possible. It may not be, but we're going to try, and we're going to do everything we can to try to achieve a peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I understand you \u2013 you can't get into specifics in a public conversation, but we're looking at Russian troops and strikes intensifying. Did you hear anything from Vladimir Putin that indicated he is willing to make a single concession?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think there are a couple. I mean, there were not enough for Ukraine. If not, we would be announcing a peace deal this morning, right?",
      "But \u2013 but, certainly, there are some things we notice, changes. There are some changes that I think are possible. I think there's some concepts that were discussed that could potentially lead to something. But, again, all these things have to be verifiable. We \u2013 it isn't real until it's real.",
      "I mean, you \u2013 one thing is what you say you might be willing to consider. Another thing is your willingness to do it. And it always becomes a tradeoff in all of this. But you talk about the intensifying strikes on the Russian side. Yes, I mean, they're a full-time war machine. I mean, that's what's happening. The Russian economy has basically been turned into a full-time wartime economy.",
      "They have a lot of people. It's a big country. It's not just large geographically. It has huge populations. It continues to churn through people. You know, they lost \u2013 20,000 Russian soldiers were killed last month in July in this war. That just tells you the price they're willing to pay.",
      "Not saying any of this is admirable. I'm saying that this is the reality of the war that we're facing. It's become attrition in some ways. It's a meat grinder, and they just have more meat to grind.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you about the security bit you just mentioned there, because Italy's prime minister says that President Trump revived the idea of security guarantees inspired by NATO's Article 5 and a collective security clause that would involve the United States.",
      "How does that work?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I mean\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are these U.S. troops? Are these U.S. monitors?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, that's what we're going to be working on. Well, that's what we're going to be working on.",
      "That's why \u2013 that's one of the reasons why, you know, I talked yesterday to all the national security advisers, a bunch of them from the different European countries. There are European leaders coming here tomorrow, heads of state coming tomorrow, along with President Zelenskyy, to discuss this in more detail.",
      "I mean, the constructs of something like this needs to be built out. Once thing \u2013 it's \u2013 a concept is one thing. The reality, you know, how it's built and how it would work, is another. But those are the kinds of talks that we're going to be having with them, along with some of the other issues that are at play.",
      "But that \u2013 that is one of the \u2013 if you were to break this thing down, I mean, there are \u2013 obviously, there needs to be an agreement on territories and where the lines are going to be drawn. That's not going to be very easy. That's going to be tough. I think there has to be some discussion about security guarantees for Ukraine, because they don't want this war to \u2013 none of us want to see this war in the future.",
      "They're a sovereign country. They have a right to have security agreements with other countries and security alliances with other countries. And then there's the whole issue of reconstruction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Including United States?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: How do you rebuild the country?",
      "Well, potentially. Like I said, that's what we're going to be having a conversation about, and that's what we're going to be meeting \u2013 that's why they're all coming here tomorrow. And that's why we've been talking on the phone for the last 48 hours with them.",
      "And even leading up to it, throughout the week, there were various meetings just to sort of build out some of these ideas. So all of these right now are ideas. They are concepts that require some more specificity. We'll need to work with our partners to see what that looks like.",
      "And I think that's an area where potential progress is real, but that alone won't be enough. There's a bunch of other things that have to be worked through here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, Russia claims it has rescued 700,000 children. I know you know that the warrant out for Vladimir Putin's arrest is for the state-sponsored abduction of kids.",
      "I have seen estimates there are something like 30,000 Ukrainian children who have been abducted. Is the United States demanding, or at least, even just as a statement of goodwill here, that Russia return these children?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I mean, we've repeatedly raised that issue on \u2013 in every forum possible.",
      "And those have also been, by the way, topics of discussion, not just in our meetings with the Ukrainians, but in the negotiations and talks that were going on between Ukraine and Russia at the technical level. These talks were going on in Turkey, as an example, Turkey, over the last few months.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, and nothing so far from the Russians.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's been a topic of discussion as well.",
      "Well, it's unfortunate. Children should be returned to their families. We - - on that position, I don't think there's any ambiguity on our side. And they shouldn't even be, you know, a bargaining chip in regards to a broader negotiation.",
      "But it's just one more element of how tragic this war is. After 3.5 years, this war is getting worse. It's not getting better. You've made the point about the uptick in strikes. This is a war. It's going to get worse. It's not going to get better. And that's why the president is investing so much time in bringing this to an end.",
      "And, by the way, everyone is begging us to be involved in this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The Europeans want us involved. The Ukrainians want us involved. Obviously, the Russians want us involved, because the president is the only leader in the world \u2013 if this is possible, he's the only one that can help make it happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he's got the leverage over Vladimir Putin if he wanted to crush his economy or at least do more damage to it.",
      "But you have held off on those secondary sanctions. President Trump told Fox News his advice to President Zelenskyy is: \"Make a deal. Russia's a very big power and they're not.\"",
      "You know there is concern from the Europeans that President Zelenskyy is going to be bullied into signing something away. That's why you have these European leaders coming as back up tomorrow. Can you reassure them?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, it isn't. That's not why they're coming as back \u2013 that's not true. No, but that's not \u2013 why would \u2013 that's not true.",
      "They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming \u2013 in fact, they're coming here tomorrow because\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that February Oval Office meeting in front of television cameras, where President Zelenskyy was dressed down\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Do you know how many meetings we've had since then?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, no, I know. And I was just up in Alaska\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, but we've had a bunch of meetings since then.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 watching the one with Vladimir Putin, where a red carpet was rolled out for the Russian leader.",
      "It was very different.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, but with Zelenskyy \u2013 we've had more meetings - - we've had \u2013 we've had \u2013 we've had one meeting with Putin and like a dozen meetings with Zelenskyy.",
      "So, that \u2013 but that's not true. They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're coming here tomorrow because we've been working with the Europeans. We talked to them last week. There were meetings in the U.K. over the following \u2013 the previous weekend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they said President Trump was going to demand a cease-fire.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The president's talked to these leaders as early as Thursday.",
      "No, no, but you said that they're coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming here tomorrow \u2013 this is such a stupid media narrative that they're coming here tomorrow because the \u2013 Trump is going to bully Zelenskyy into a bad deal.",
      "We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff. They're coming here tomorrow because they chose to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. We invited them to come. The president invited them to come.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president told those European leaders last week that he wanted a cease-fire. The president went on television, said he would walk out of the meeting if Vladimir Putin didn't agree with on \u2013 he said there would be severe consequences if he didn't agree to one. He said he'd walk out in two minutes.",
      "He spent three hours talking to Vladimir Putin, and he did not get one. So, there's some mixed messages.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Because, obviously, something \u2013 things happened during that meeting.",
      "Well, because obviously things \u2013 look, our goal here is not to stage some production, for the world to say, oh, how dramatic. He walked out. Our goal here is to have a peace agreement, to end this war, OK? And, obviously, we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress, not a lot of progress, but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase.",
      "If not, we wouldn't be having Zelenskyy flying all the way over here. We wouldn't be having all the Europeans coming all the way over here. Now, understand, and take with a grain of salt, I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.",
      "You talk about the sanctions. Look, at the end of the day, if peace is not going to be possible here, and this is just going to continue on as a war, people will continue to die by the thousands. The president has that option to then come in and impose new sanctions.",
      "But if he did this now \u2013 the moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks. You've basically locked in at least another year to year-and-a-half of war and death and destruction. We may unfortunately wind up there, but we don't want to wind up there.",
      "We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war, so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here. We're going to do everything possible to make that happen, if it's doable.",
      "It will require both sides to make concessions. It will require both sides to get things they're asking for. That's how these deals are made, whether we like it or not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, quickly, why did the State Department just announce that they're halting visitor visas for all Gazans coming here for medical aid? Why would some of these kids, for example, who are coming to hospitals for treatment be a threat?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, it's not just kids. It's a bunch of adults that are accompanying them.",
      "Second, we had outreach from multiple congressional offices asking questions about it. And so we're going to reevaluate how those visas are being granted, not just to the children, but how those visas are being granted to the people who are accompanying them, and, by the way, to some of the organizations that are facilitating it.",
      "There is evidence been presented to us by numerous congressional offices that some of the organizations bragging about and involved in acquiring these visas have strong links to terrorist groups like Hamas. And so we are not going to be in partnership with groups that are friendly with Hamas.",
      "So we need to \u2013 we're going to pause those visas. There was just a small number of them issued to children, but they come with adults accompanying them, obviously. And we are going to pause this program and reevaluate how those visas are being vetted and what relationship, if any, has there been by these organizations to the \u2013 to the process of acquiring those visas.",
      "We're not going to be in partnership with groups that have links or sympathies towards Hamas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary of State Marco Rubio, we have to leave it there for this morning. Thank you for joining us.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Colorado Democratic Congressman Jason Crow.",
      "Good to see you in person.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW (D-Colorado): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we start talking about Ukraine, I want to pick up on something, since you sit on the Intelligence Committee.",
      "The secretary of state just said that lawmakers had come to the Trump administration with information that they have been granting visas to individuals with ties to Hamas or with organizations with ties to Hamas. That's a pretty stunning accusation. Israel controls who enters and exits Gaza.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States screens all visas. So is there really a blind spot that you are aware of?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I'm not aware of that. But, if that's true, actually, that is concerning. That would be a problem. I mean, Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization. They should not be traveling anywhere. So, if that's happening, it should be stopped immediately. And the Intelligence Committee has a role to play in that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Intelligence Committee wasn't behind the information presented to the secretary of state?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I have not been briefed on that. I have no information about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "On Ukraine, you know that the U.S. intelligence assessment is that the battlefield is turning in Russia's favor, despite the fact that Putin has to rely on Iran and North Korea to keep this thing going. If neither President Biden nor President Trump were ever willing to commit troops, doesn't the secretary have a point that it has to be hammered out at the negotiating table?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: You know, this absolutely will end at a negotiating table, like most conflicts will.",
      "But what happened on Friday was a historic embarrassment for the United States. There's no other way to put it, right? You listen to what Marco Rubio and the president have said. They keep on saying they're dedicating time. They're making it a priority. They're focusing their attention on it.",
      "In any negotiation, when you're trying to end an armed conflict, there's nothing more important than understanding what motivates your adversary. What is making Vladimir Putin tick in this instance? Vladimir Putin does not care about the amount of time that we're nego \u2013 we're allocating to this, does not care about a B-2 bomber flyover, does not care about a lineup of F-22 fighters rolled out.",
      "He doesn't care about any of that. What Vladimir Putin cares about is basically three things. He cares about economic pressure in the form of sanctions. He cares about political, diplomatic isolation, being a pariah state. And he cares about military defeat. Those are the three things that will end this conflict, if he feels pressure on all of those three fronts.",
      "And this administration continues to be unwilling to do anything to assert pressure in any of those three areas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they have put in place some secondary sanctions, at least on India here. And they haven't pulled back. They would need Congress to help them repeal a lot of these sanctions.",
      "But bigger picture, in hindsight, do you think the United States to date has been too hesitant to actually help Ukraine win this war? President Obama did not send offensive weapons to Ukraine. President Biden was criticized for being perhaps too slow in delivery of certain weapons.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes, there's no doubt.",
      "As you know, I was one of the members of Congress that on a bipartisan basis pushed really hard in the first two years of this war under the Biden administration to do more, to do more quicker. And I was concerned that we were doing just enough to prevent Ukraine from losing and not doing enough to help them win.",
      "And I do believe that, had we done more, and we had done \u2013 done it faster, and that we were willing to be more aggressive in providing aid and support for Ukraine, then they would be in a different position on the battlefield today.",
      "But compare that to what this administration has done, which has relieved almost all pressure. Like, look at what happened on Friday.",
      "U.S. military personnel in uniform literally were on their hands and knees rolling out a red carpet for the most murderous dictator of the 21st century, somebody who has kidnapped and is holding prisoner tens of thousands of Ukrainian children, somebody who started this whole war, right?",
      "This both-sides-ism that the administration is engaging in, that both sides need to come to the table and negotiate, Ukraine is the victim. They are the victim. They didn't start this war. Russia did. And somehow we keep on acting like Vladimir Putin deserves to be brought out into the open like any other head of state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: This is a historic embarrassment and defeat for U.S. foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have served this country in uniform.",
      "I wonder, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, how comfortable you would be with the United States giving this, whatever the Article 5- like security guarantee would look like. Is that something you should see boots on the ground to do?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I don't think boots on the ground would be the way to go, but, certainly, the United States has assets and capability that I think are essential to any type of security guarantee.",
      "I think Europe has to come forward with the forward presence of military, but we can provide intelligence. We can provide economic support, diplomatic support. One of the most important things that we can do right now is actually seize Russian assets. This would be huge. This would be a game-changing thing that would put pressure on Vladimir Putin and actually create security guarantees and reconstruction for Ukraine.",
      "There's over $150 billion of seized Russian assets. And the United States could lead a coalition to seize that money\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 allocate it towards reconstruction, allocate it towards security, allocate it towards the building of a Ukrainian military that could actually resist Russia going forward. But this administration is unwilling to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The last administration was too.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They did agree to the legislation.",
      "But on the immigration front, you and your fellow Democratic lawmakers are now trying to challenge the Trump administration's policy that requires notice to be given before you visit an immigration facility. You just did visit some. What did you see? And how does that compare to the last administration?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, there's an ICE detention center in my district in Aurora, Colorado. I have visited that center 10 times now over the last five years, six years.",
      "And oversight of federal facilities is one of the most important things that any member of Congress does, Air Force bases, military bases, VA hospitals, and ICE detention centers. This administration just tripled the budget of ICE, made it the largest federal law enforcement agency in the history of the United States, bigger than the FBI, ATF, DEA, all others combined.",
      "And they are putting in roadblocks to prevent oversight, to prevent transparency because they are trying to hide what they are doing. That is unacceptable. So we filed a lawsuit to force them to abide by federal law that guarantees us access.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. And we will see where that heads next.",
      "Jason Crow, thank you.",
      "We will be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back. Stay with us.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "Fiona Hill served as the senior director for Russia and European affairs on the National Security Council during President Trump's first term. She joins us now from Waterville, Maine.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "FIONA HILL (Former NSC Senior Director, European and Russian Affairs): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Fiona, you were an advisor during that infamous Helsinki summit in 2018. You've spoke about that in the past. I wonder what you think about how this Alaska summit compared.",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, obviously quite different in \u2013 in many respects. Part of it was the fact that they decided to skip the one-on-one meeting and the lunch. I mean these are usually part of this sort of set of summits like this. And the press conference, obviously, was more of an announcement or a set of announcements. Presentations by both leaders, much more by President Putin, and more of a commentary by President Trump. So, there wasn't that free for all of press questions, which I'm sure was a bit disconcerting for you and others who were present there at Alaska.",
      "But the optics weren't exactly great, as Congressman Crow has laid out, for the United States and for President Trump again. I mean, again, different. But although it was presented as perhaps a show of power by being at a U.S. Air Force Base with the flight passing of the B-52s and the fighter jets, it did certainly looked much more like a show of appreciation for Vladimir Putin. And so the optics were really much more favorable to Putin than they were to the United States. It really looked like Putin set the agenda there, the narrative, and in many respects the tone for the whole summit meeting.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, saying that, you know, the president has a team of advisors around him. In a traditional administration, those advisors would be setting the policy, they would be planning the optics, and they would be thinking through that.",
      "Do you think that the president's team set him up for success here?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, look, it may well have been that one of the demands, because we've heard from Secretary Rubio, which, I have to say, I think was a very fair assessment of where things are. So, it may well have been that one of the demands by the Russians to make any progress in moving further forward was to actually have that kind of show of pomp and pageantry that is \u2013 basically marks Putin's re-entry into international affairs. Maybe the Russians said to them in Moscow, either to Steve Witkoff or to Secretary Rubio or to anybody else that basically they wanted to have a \u2013 a major U.S./Russia bilateral summit appearance before they would move on to the nitty-gritty of anything else in Ukraine. That's, you know, to give them all the benefit of the doubt there.",
      "But it all now depends on what comes out of this. And I think, again, Secretary Rubio made it very clear that it's not going to be easy. He was certainly downplaying any expectations of a major breakthrough, but he did say that it was something that might be possible. And I think that's what's going to be the proof of whether this was actually worth all the effort that they went to in Alaska or not.",
      "And as Congressman Crow said, there's a pretty high bar here because what Putin is doing is pretty brutal. And he's not showing right now any signs whatsoever of giving anything up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom's defense secretary has said that they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help oversee a ceasefire. When you hear these security guarantees being talked about, and the secretary said he is going to negotiate that tomorrow, what should we think \u2013 you know, what form is that going to take? What do you think that should look like?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, look, I think he actually let this out, and you did too in your questions. And I think Congressman Crow has made it very clear as well, it has to be a combination of all of the things that we've already heard discussed on the show today. You have to be able to have some boots on the ground. Congressman Crow said it doesn't have to be the United States. That's actually the case. But it actually has to be some commitment from the United States to enable European forces to actually hold that territory and to provide some security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "The United States is key in terms of its intelligence, in terms of enabling equipment and the information of the data that we would need for all of this to make a security intervention mean something. And it's also essential in terms of all kinds of other forms of equipment and defensive weaponry. We've already heard, of course, about Ukraine needing all kinds of equipment, from javelins in the past, to patriots, now in terms of an integrated missile defense system that Ukraine desperately needs. So, there's a lot there that we all know needs to be done.",
      "And what we really need to see, I think, in these meetings that will take place on Monday and moving forward, is a real commitment to the United States to work with Europeans and to work with Ukraine to make this happen.",
      "Look, this is existential also for European security. So, minimizing the role of Europe here, be it the United Kingdom, be it Poland, be it Finland, be it France, be it Germany, is not the way to go. Europe has to have an equal say in all of this. This is about Europe's future and the future of European security, not just about Ukraine's.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the dynamic between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. You know both men. You've written biographies of Vladimir Putin and, of course, you served under Donald Trump. In one of the Fox interviews that President Trump did, he said that he spoke about mail- in voting in the United States with Vladimir Putin. And during that press address, Putin also claimed that the war wouldn't have happened at all if Donald Trump had been pretty. I mean that's a counter factual, but that's something Trump often says on the \u2013 on the trail. Why would those things be discussed at all if this was about Ukraine?",
      "FIONA HILL: Exactly. Well, look, this is Vladimir Putin, as usual, trying to manipulate U.S. domestic politics. I've seen him do this over and over again, including at Helsinki when he set the president off, not in the press conference, but before that, in a whole diatribe against his political enemies because Putin deliberately asked him about this.",
      "So, Putin knows that President Trump wants to have an acknowledgment of his self-assertion, that the war wouldn't have happened had he not \u2013 had he been in the presidency. And so Putin's giving him something that plays well for President Trump and his own domestic environment. It doesn't play well in the international environment where people know things are much more complicated but it's basically gifting a concession to President Trump himself.",
      "And Putin wants to sow chaos in the American electoral system ahead of the midterms. So, of course, he's laid into this whole issue of mail-in voting. And President Trump asserted in his Fox News interview that there were no countries in the world that allow mail-in voting. Well, Russia allows mail- in voting. And if everybody wants to go out and look, they can look for themselves. In 2020, President Vladimir Putin signed into law Russians being able to vote by mail and also on the internet. And more than 30 other countries also allow some forms of mail-in voting. So, it's just not true that other countries, including Russia, don't use this. It's a pure blatant piece of manipulation, and that's the kind of thing that Putin likes to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And, of course, I don't think you would endorse the outcome of that voting system and those elections are rigged in Russia, correct?",
      "FIONA HILL: Of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: And, I mean, basically Putin wants to see us tie ourselves up in knots between now and the midterms. He's trying to sew chaos. And he's just better used his time with President Trump to push that along.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: It's \u2013 again, it's a diversion. It's a distraction really from the negotiations on Ukraine because Putin doesn't really want to give anything up. So, he gives up basically something that plays well in the political arena for President Trump and something that actually plays very badly for the United States in its own political arena, which is the mail- in voting point that he made.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Fiona Hill, always appreciate your analysis. Thank you for joining us today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: During our trip to Alaska last week for the Trump/Putin summit, we talked with Alaskan Republican Senator Dan Sullivan about the strategic military importance of Alaska. We began by asking about potential offers to Putin to get him to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \"The Telegraph\" was reporting offering Putin a chance to invest in the natural resources off of Alaska's coast, in the Bearing Strait.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN (R-AK): Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you comfortable with that?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, we have plenty of America investors and our allies who want to invest in Alaska's natural resources. We're having a boom here. We don't need Russian investments. We don't need Russian money. They're a competitor of ours when it comes to energy and natural resources and critical minerals. So, I doubt that's on the table. And, you know, I would not \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You'd be upset if there was?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I would not \u2013 I would not support that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your colleague \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And by the way, just to \u2013 on that point though, a contrast. You might remember last time I was on your show we talked about the Biden administration \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about this.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: With this great state of ours.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Shutting us down, right? I mean that was 70 executive orders to shut down, exclusively focused on Alaska, shut down our resource development economy. Our own federal government, the Biden administration, sanctioned my state more than they sanctioned Iran. What we're seeing with President Trump in his administration is a complete 180 on that. Unleashing Alaska's resource potential has been a huge focus of the president since day one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you mentioned how furious you were with the Biden administration for the executive actions they said they were taking to protect natural resources.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They said land conservation was necessary, and the indigenous population here really wanted it.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Right. Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You called it a lie.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I did call it a lie. It was a lie.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said it was national security suicide. Trump has already reversed this.",
      "But are you at all concerned that there are short-term benefits to your state financially, but longer term real damage to the environment here?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: No. Look, Alaska has an incredible record of being able to develop our resources and protect the environment. You walk around here, you see what a pristine, beautiful environment we have here. But we know we need jobs. We need natural resource development. So, we can do both. The entire north slope of Alaska, the Nupiet (ph) community, across the board was against what the Biden administration did, which was lock up the entire natural petroleum reserve of Alaska, which was set aside by Congress to develop our resources. And then he had the audacity to say, hey, I did this on behalf of the native people. That was not true at all. It was an outrage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 so, for activists or for those concerned about the damage here \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You say they just don't know what they're talking about?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, I say \u2013 well, a couple things. There's no place on the planet that has higher standards on protecting the environment than us. And if we need American energy, why would we go, like the Biden administration did, begging from Iran, Venezuela, places that have no environmental standards, when you can get it from America, from American workers, with the highest environmental standards any place on the planet. And secondly, when you have resource development, particularly in our rural communities, you see life expectancies increases \u2013 increasing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in this region \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Arctic is of supreme concern from a national security perspective.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The ice is melting.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Majority of scientists attribute that to global warming, but the end result is there's a potential for an Arctic area for trade routes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Also tapping into the natural resources there.",
      "How does the United States gain an edge in \u2013 in dominating that?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, it's a great question. It's really important. You're mentioning trade routes that are opening up. We've already talked about natural resources, which are huge, up in the Arctic. And what we need to do is recognize that we're an Arctic nation. We're an Arctic nation because of Alaska.",
      "And, look, this has not always been a priority of previous administrations. What we're doing up here, we're rebuilding our military. The one big, beautiful bill certainly does it. As I mentioned, you know, Alaska exudes military might. We're the cornerstone of missile defense, and we're going to be the cornerstone of the president's golden dome initiative. We are the hub of air combat power. You're seeing them flying over here. We have over 100 fifth generation fighters based in Alaska. We have a brand-new U.S. Army airborne division up here. So, we are building out our military, which is great, but also building out our Arctic capabilities.",
      "And again, in the one big, beautiful bill, almost $26 billion investment in the Coast Guard, which is the biggest investment in the Coast Guard in American history by far, 16 icebreakers coming with that, 22 cutters, 40 helicopters, a bunch of shore side infrastructure, a lot of that's going to be in Alaska to defend the Arctic. And we need to defend the Arctic because, as you and I have talked about, the Russians and the Chinese are in our waters and in our airspace all the time, including doing joint operations up here, which is unprecedented.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wanted to ask you about that because the war in Ukraine has hurt Russia's finances \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Made them more dependent on Beijing, including when it comes to exploring up and around the Arctic.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They had a joint bomber task force come here \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Pretty darn close.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Oh, they were in our ADIZs, as they \u2013 as we call it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Air Defense Identification Zone.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, are you concerned this actually becomes a flashpoint?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I think this is already becoming a flash point. I mean the number of times that the Russians and Chinese are doing joint strategic bomber task forces in our airspace and joint naval task forces in our EEZ, in our waters, they're \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Economic Zone?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes. That's happening on a regular basis now, that's unprecedented. They don't do joint operations anywhere else on America's borders. That's for sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Republican chair of the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee says there is far more needed for the U.S. military than what has been provided by the White House and their budget.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: We need to do more and we certainly need to keep it above 3 percent of GDP and growing towards 4 or 5 percent of GDP. It's a dangerous world right now.",
      "But this one big, beautiful bill, the budget reconciliation bill does a lot for our military right now on urgent needs. Shipbuilding. As we have talked about, our Navy, our ability to build ships is completely atrophied. Weapons and ammo systems. The golden dome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you have your own proposal.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But has the Pentagon told you what the golden dome is?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: All right, I mean, I've been working on this with the Pentagon. This is missile defense that is a layered missile defense. So, what that means is, right here, like I said, you have the ground-based missile interceptor \u2013 the missile interceptors in Alaska. You have all the radar systems in Alaska that protect the whole country in terms of ballistic missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: We have new threats. We have hypersonics. We have drones. We have, heck, even we've seen it here in Alaska, spy balloons. What we need to do is upgrade the system with what's called a layered defense. Not just the ground-based system here, but you work it more with different systems, Aegis Ashore, THAD, and then including space-based systems, both for tracking and intercepting. And you to do that with an open architecture in terms of software to integrate those systems. So, I am very familiar with what the golden dome is doing and I'm leading the effort in the Senate on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And, by the way, my state is the cornerstone of all the missile defense right now and will continue to be so.",
      "(END VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You can find more from our interview with Dan Sullivan on our website, facethenation.com and our YouTube page.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza where the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry reports that the total number of starvation- related deaths has now risen to 250, including 110 children. Seven of those deaths in the last 24 hours.",
      "World Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres joins us this morning from Jerusalem. He visited Gaza late last week.",
      "Good morning.",
      "JOSE ANDRES (Founder, World Central Kitchen): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It is rare to get a look inside of Gaza. The IDF does not allow journalists in to freely report. But they let you in. What did you see?",
      "JOSE ANDRES: It was a day trip. I was able to go early in the day and leave before sunset. And I visit our main \u2013 one of our two main kitchens inside Gaza in Derbala (ph). And I was able to visit the few warehouses we have there, the bakery, the kitchens. And I spending a day trying to see what else the teams need, what else we need to be doing, how we are going to be increasing the hot food and bread we are producing right now. So, it was a day again to show support, to see on my own and assess the situation of our own kitchens. And \u2013 and that's how \u2013 what I have to report with that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.N. says that there is starvation happening in Gaza. Israel's prime minister says there is no starvation. What's real?",
      "JOSE ANDRES: Obviously, there is always a gray area. But we are making boxes for children that we know they are in very special need situation. I saw those boxes be made with the name of every one of the children. We need to remember that during many weeks no food was going inside Gaza. And this is to 2 million people.",
      "So, in the places we know we're feeding, we are doing around 200,000 meals a day, but this is only 10 percent of the need. That's why we are trying to increase.",
      "I can say that where we are, obviously people are \u2013 are \u2013 are being fed. At the very minimum. It's not everything they should be receiving, but at the very least they are receiving a piece of bread and a piece of food.",
      "But we need much more aid. We need to make sure that the aid is never interrupted again. We need to make sure that the flow of trucks keeps happening. We need to make sure that we have safe roads so those trucks can reach their intended delivery place. We need to make sure that all the NGOs that are actively trying to do the best they can to take care of people inside Gaza, and this is beyond food, obviously medicine, et cetera, et cetera, we need to make sure that the aid is massive enough that we don't get to those moments where in some areas, like in the north, that these are still very difficult to reach, that we know that people are desperate for food.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned for many weeks no food was allowed in. That was a government policy. There was a blockade for many months. That is now lifted officially.",
      "But as you say, your organization wants to scale up. You are trying to produce 1 million meals a day in Gaza. Can you get the fuel in to do that? Can you get the food in? Are Israeli officials giving you a green light?",
      "JOSE ANDRES: Well, it's a million because we \u2013 we are an organization that we specialize in emergencies and in food. But really we are requesting that all the NGOs that are participating in feeding are giving more access, including us, and other organizations, like Anera (ph), which was one of the organizations we work with that they have been in Gaza for many, many decades, and many others. We need to make sure that everybody has access. For that we need a lot of things. The trucks inside Gaza. We need to remember that the trucks come from outside Gaza. And they are \u2013 they are put aside. And then we need to reload the trucks that are inside Gaza. This takes time. We need more trucks inside. So, the trucking company can have enough people and enough trucks to have a constant flow.",
      "I have to report that as I saw a good flow of trucks going in, around 150 to 250 trucks are going in every day. But even I would say that this is not enough. We need to make sure that we massively increase, that we massively make sure that nobody has to be walking for miles to try to reach a place where they can find a plate of food or use a bag of rice. We need to make sure like what World Central Kitchen does. At one moment we had, you know, 100 to 200 kitchen partners. We need to make sure that we are cooking where people live. We need to make sure that we are feeding them where people are so the people don't have to be again leaving their neighborhoods, leaving their tents and walking for hours back and forth only to try to bring a little bit of food back home.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that \"both sides are going to have to make concessions\" to end Russia's war in Ukraine, hinting at the road ahead for talks aimed at getting Moscow and Kyiv to reach a lasting peace agreement.",
      "\"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" noting that doing so would require both sides \"to give.\"",
      "Full transcript: Secretary of State Marco Rubio on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"",
      "Full transcript: Secretary of State Marco Rubio on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"",
      "President Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday following his\u00a0high-stakes summit with Putin in Alaska last Friday. Mr. Trump called the nearly three-hour meeting with Putin \"extremely productive\" with \"many points\" the two leaders agreed on. But \"there's no deal until there's a deal,\" he said, and no ceasefire was announced.",
      "Rubio, who attended the summit, was thin on details Sunday, saying that \"there are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs.\" He added that the details would be discussed with Zelenskyy and other European leaders on Monday as the administration works to \"narrow the gap between the two sides.\"",
      "\"We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war,\" Rubio said, noting that there were \"some concepts and ideas discussed\" with Putin that they expect the Ukrainians would support.",
      "When asked whether the U.S. would demand Russian withdrawal from Ukrainian territory as part of an agreement, the secretary of state acknowledged that both sides would have to make concessions in order to reach a deal to end the conflict.",
      "\"If one side gets everything they want, that's called surrender,\" Rubio said. \"And that's not what we're close to doing, because neither side here is on the verge of surrender, or anything close to it.\"",
      "Rubio outlined a handful of areas where agreement needs to be reached, including the details of security guarantees for Ukraine, the question of territories \"and where the lines are going to be drawn\" and the issue of rebuilding the country. He said the ideas \"require some more specificity,\" noting that the U.S. will \"need to work with our partners to see what that looks like.\"",
      "Monday's discussions come after Zelenskyy met with Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance in February, when an Oval Office meeting descended into insults and chaos, exposing severe rifts between the U.S. and Ukraine.",
      "Rubio pushed back on the idea that European leaders are joining Zelenskyy in Washington as backup to prevent him from accepting a bad deal after the contentious meeting earlier this year.",
      "\"We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff,\" Rubio said. \"They're coming here tomorrow because they're supposed to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. The president invited them to come.\"",
      "The secretary said that after the meeting with Putin, \"we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress \u2014 not a lot of progress \u2014 but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase.\"",
      "\"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement,\" Rubio added. \"Enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"",
      "Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat, appeared on \"Face the Nation\" after Rubio, and called the meeting with Putin a \"historic embarrassment\" while outlining what he says is needed to end the war.",
      "\"In any negotiation, when you're trying to end an armed conflict, there's nothing more important than understanding what motivates your adversary, what is making Vladimir Putin tick, in this instance,\" Crow said.",
      "Crow argued that Putin doesn't care about things like a B-2 stealth bomber flyover and a lineup of F-22 fighter jets, which were part of a carefully choreographed red-carpet welcome in Alaska.",
      "\"What Vladimir Putin cares about is basically three things: He cares about economic pressure in the form of sanctions; he cares about political, diplomatic isolation\u00a0\u2014\u00a0being a pariah state; and he cares about military defeat,\" Crow said. \"Those are the three things that will end this conflict.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Democratic Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 17, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Colorado Democratic Congressman Jason Crow. Good to see you in person. Before we start talking about Ukraine, I want to pick up on something, since you sit on the Intelligence Committee. The Secretary of State just said that lawmakers had come to the Trump administration with information that they've been granting visas to individuals with ties to Hamas, or with organizations with ties to Hamas. That's a pretty stunning accusation. Israel controls who enters and exits Gaza. The United States screens all visas. So, is there really a blind spot that you are aware of?",
      "REP. JASON CROW: I'm not aware of that. But if that's true, actually, that is concerning. That would be a problem. I mean, Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization. They should not be traveling anywhere. So, if that's happening, it should be stopped immediately. And, you know, the Intelligence Committee has a role to play in that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Intelligence Committee wasn't behind the information presented to the Secretary of State.",
      "REP. CROW: I have not been briefed on that. I have no information about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, on Ukraine: You know that the U.S. intelligence assessment is that the battlefield is turning in Russia's favor, despite the fact that Putin has to rely on Iran and North Korea to keep this thing going. If neither President Biden nor President Trump were ever willing to commit troops, doesn't the secretary have a point that it has to be hammered out at the negotiating table?",
      "REP. CROW: You know, this absolutely will end at a negotiating table, like most conflicts will. But what happened on Friday was a historic embarrassment for the United States. There's no other way to put it. Right? You listen to what Marco Rubio and the president have said. They keep on saying they're dedicating time. They're making it a priority. They're focusing their attention on it. In any negotiation, when you're trying to end an armed conflict, there's nothing more important than understanding what motivates your adversary. What is making Vladimir Putin tick, in this instance. Vladimir Putin does not care about the amount of time that we're nego- we're allocating to this, does not care about a B-2 bomber flyover, does not care about a lineup of F-22 fighters rolled out. He doesn't care about any of that. What Vladimir Putin cares about is basically three things. He cares about economic pressure in the form of sanctions. He cares about political, diplomatic isolation, being a pariah state. And he cares about military defeat. Those are the three things that will end this conflict if he feels pressure on all of those three fronts. And this administration continues to be unwilling to do anything to assert pressure in any of those three areas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they have put in place some secondary sanctions, at least on India here, and they haven't pulled back. They need Congress to help them repeal a lot of these sanctions. But bigger picture, in hindsight, do you think the United States to date has been too hesitant to actually help Ukraine win this war? President Obama did not send offensive weapons to Ukraine. President Biden was criticized for being perhaps too slow in delivery of certain weapons.",
      "REP. CROW: There's no doubt. As you know, I was one of the members of Congress that, on a bipartisan basis, pushed really hard in the first two years of this war, under the Biden administration, to do more, to do more quicker. And I was concerned that we were doing just enough to prevent Ukraine from losing and not doing enough to help them win. And I do believe that had we done more, and we had done it faster, and that we were willing to be more aggressive in providing aid and support for Ukraine, then they would be in a different position on the battlefield today. But compare that to what this administration has done, which has relieved almost all pressure. Like look at what happened on Friday. U.S. military personnel in uniform, literally, were on their hands and knees, rolling out a red carpet for the most murderous dictator of the 21st century. Somebody who has kidnapped and is holding prisoner tens of thousands of Ukrainian children. Somebody who started this whole war, right? This both-sides-ism that the administration is engaging in, that both sides need to come to the table and negotiate. Ukraine is the victim. They are the victim. They didn't start this war. Russia did. And somehow we keep on acting like Vladimir Putin deserves to be brought out into the open like any other head of state. This is a historic embarrassment and defeat for U.S. foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have served this country in uniform. I wonder, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, how comfortable you would be with the United States giving this, whatever the Article Five-like security guarantee would look like. Is that something you should see boots on the ground to do?",
      "REP. CROW: I don't think boots on the ground would be the way to go. But, certainly, the United States has assets and capability that I think are essential to any type of security guarantee. I think Europe has to come forward with the forward presence of military. But we can provide intelligence. We can provide economic support, diplomatic support. One of the most important things that we can do right now is actually seize Russian assets. This would be huge. This would be a game-changing thing that put pressure on Vladimir Putin. And actually create security guarantees and reconstruction for Ukraine. There's over $150 billion of seized Russian assets, and the United States could lead a coalition to seize that money. Allocate it towards reconstruction, allocate it towards security, allocate it towards the building of a Ukrainian military that could actually resist Russia going forward. But this administration is unwilling to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last administration was too, they--",
      "REP. CROW: --That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They did agree to the legislation. But on the immigration front, you and your fellow Democratic lawmakers are now trying to challenge the Trump administration's policy that requires notice to be given before you visit an immigration facility. You just did visit some. What did you see, and how does that compare to the last visit?",
      "REP. CROW: Well, there's an ICE detention center in my district, in Aurora, Colorado. I have visited that center 10 times now over the last five years, six years. And oversight of federal facilities is one of the most important things that any member of Congress does. Air Force bases, military bases, VA hospitals and ICE detention centers. This administration just tripled the budget of ICE. Made it the largest federal law enforcement agency in the history of the United States. Bigger than the FBI, ATF, DEA, all others combined. And they are putting in roadblocks to prevent oversight, to prevent transparency because they were trying to hide what they are doing. That is unacceptable. So we filed a lawsuit to force them to abide by federal law that guarantees us access.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll see where that heads next. Jason Crow, thank you. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, founder of World Central Kitchen, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 17, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry reports that the total number of starvation-related deaths has now risen to 250, including 110 children, seven of those deaths in the last 24 hours. World Central Kitchen founder Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s joins us this morning from Jerusalem. He visited Gaza late last week. Good morning. It is rare to get a look inside of Gaza. The IDF does not allow journalists in to freely report, but they let you in. What did you see?",
      "JOS\u00c9 ANDR\u00c9S: It was a day trip. I was able to go early in the day and leave before sunset, and I visit our main- one of our two main kitchens inside Gaza in Deir al-Balah. And I was able to visit the few warehouses we have there, the bakery, the kitchens, and spending a day trying to see what else the teams need, what else we need to be doing, how we are going to be increasing the hot food and bread that we are producing right now. So this was a day, again, to show support, to see on my own and assess the situation of our own kitchens. And that's what I have to report about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.N. says that there is starvation happening in Gaza, Israel's Prime Minister says there is no starvation. What's real?",
      "ANDR\u00c9S: Obviously, there is always a gray area, but we are making boxes for children that we know they are in very- a special need situation. I saw those boxes being made with the name of every one of the children. We need to remember that during many weeks, no food was going inside Gaza, and this is two- two million people. So in the places we know we are feeding, we are doing around 200,000 meals a day, but this is only 10 percent of the need. That's what we are trying to increase. I can say that where we are, obviously, people are- are being fed at the bare minimum. It's not everything they should be receiving, but at the very least they're receiving a piece of bread and a piece of food. But we need much more aid. We need to make sure that the aid is never interrupted again. We need to make sure that the flow of trucks keeps happening. We need to make sure that we have safe roads so those trucks can reach their intended delivery place. We need to make sure that all the NGOs that are actively trying to do the best they can to take care of people inside Gaza- and this is beyond food, obviously, medicines, etc., etc. We need to make sure that the aid is massive enough that we don't get to those moments where- in some areas, like in the north, that is still very difficult to reach, that we know that people are desperate for food.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned for many weeks no food was allowed in. That was a government policy. There was a blockade for many months. That is now lifted officially. But as you say, your organization wants to scale up. You are trying to produce one million meals a day in Gaza. Can you get the fuel in to do that? Can you get the food in? Are Israeli officials giving you a green light?",
      "ANDR\u00c9S: Well, it's a million because we are an organization that we specialize in emergencies and in food, but obviously we are requesting that all the NGOs that are participating in feeding are given more access, including us and other organizations like Anera, which was one of the organizations we work with that they've been in Gaza for many, many decades- and many others. We need to make sure that everybody has access. For that, we need a lot of things, the trucks inside Gaza. We need to remember that the trucks come from outside Gaza, and there they are put aside. And then we need to reload the trucks that are inside Gaza. This takes time. We need more trucks inside so the trucking company can have enough people and enough trucks to have a constant flow. I have to report that, yes, I saw a good flow of trucks going in. I don't- around 150 to 250 trucks are going in every day. But even I will say that this is not enough. We need to make sure that we massively increase- that we massively make sure that nobody has to be walking for miles to try to reach a place where they can find a plate of food or use a bag of rice. We need to make sure- like what World Central Kitchen does, at one moment we had, you know, 100, 200 kitchen partners. We need to make sure that we are cooking where people live. We need to make sure that we are feeding them where people are, so the people don't have to be, again, leaving their neighborhoods, leaving their tents and walking for hours back and forth only to try to bring little bit of food back home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of walking to designated areas for food, you're referring to the model that the Israelis have set up with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. You are saying that their preferred method of feeding people is not sufficient.",
      "ANDR\u00c9S: Well, it takes a village, right? To feed 2 million people and more in a- in a situation like the people of Gaza are facing. That's why the model we are- we are pushing for is the more kitchens we have, the better. Right now, we have 80 partner kitchens on top of the two main World Central Kitchen kitchens, but that's not enough. We need to make sure that we increase the numbers of World Central Kitchen, the big ones that people can see on the webpage of World Central Kitchen or in my Twitter account. We need to make sure that our partner kitchens, that they produce between 500 and two, three, four thousand meals each. We need to make sure the bakeries are fully loaded with bread. We need to make sure that we have the fuel. That's why we need to be bringing pellets, because we have hundreds of kitchens firing up every day. We need the fuel to be able to cook the food. The big bakery we have, a bakery that was in partnership with the Kingdom of Jordan that is doing almost 50,000 loaves of bread a day. We need diesel to make sure that we are able to move the machinery to be very effective, but that's only one bakery doing 50,000 pitas a day. We need many more bakeries to make sure that we are able to- to cover the demand of 2 million people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, I have to ask you about an incident that happened a few days ago. World Central Kitchen issued a statement saying the Israeli government told you armed people were posing as workers for your organization. Is that the first time that you've heard bad actors are trying to pose as humanitarian workers? Have you experienced exploitation by Hamas?",
      "ANDR\u00c9S: Obviously, World Central Kitchen, we are a young organization. Gaza is a very complicated place. I know this is still kind of under investigation on our side and everybody else. But doubly, we are there to be next to the people of Gaza, next to the Palestinians. At the end, what we have is Palestinians feeding Palestinians. Only in our kitchens, we have around 600 Palestinians doing amazing work just trying to feed their fellow citizens, and that's what we plan to continue to make sure that Palestinians feed Palestinians, that Palestinians take care of themselves, and we're going to be giving them all the support we can to achieve that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I understand you met with a former hostage while you were in- in Israel, whose brother is still being held in Gaza. What did you learn?",
      "ANDR\u00c9S: Yeah, I've been- I've been- I've been- I've been meeting with- with different- but these- I met with Iair Horn. His brother is still in Gaza. You know, we had a two hour conversation. You know, was hard to listen to the story. Obviously, he wants his brother- his brother out. Today is a very massive strike in- in Israel, and everybody is asking for the return of the hostages. That's what should be happening. That's what should be- let's hope that this happens, obviously, alongside of a cease-fire, of peace, where nobody is under bombs, where nobody has their loved ones away, where nobody is losing their loved ones in the middle of- of- of this- of this war, where everybody is fed, where we can start the reconstruction of Gaza, where every children can receive a plate of food that they can go back to school, where, obviously, the hostages are released, where the people of Palestine and Gaza can live in peace and where the people of Israel can live in peace. What is good for you must be good for me. Let's hope that you at least will cover the basic minimums right now of feeding everybody, hopefully also the hostages being released as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, thank you very much for your time this morning.",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Fiona Hill, former senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 17, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. Fiona Hill served as the Senior Director for Russia and European Affairs on the National Security Council during President Trump's first term. She joins us now from Waterville, Maine. Good morning to you.",
      "FIONA HILL: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Fiona, you were an advisor during that infamous Helsinki summit in 2018. You've spoken about that in the past. I wonder what you think about how this Alaska summit compared?",
      "HILL: Well, obviously quite different in many respects. Part of it was the fact that they decided to skip the one-on-one meeting and the lunch. I mean, these are usually part of the sort of set of summits like this. And the press conference, obviously, was more of an announcement, or a set of announcements- presentations by both leaders. Much more by President Putin, and more of a commentary by President Trump. So there wasn't that free-for-all of press questions, which I'm sure was a bit disconcerting for you and others who were present there, at Alaska. But the optics weren't exactly great, as Congressman crow has laid out for the United States and for President Trump, again, I mean, again, different, but although it was presented as perhaps a show of power by being at a US Air Force base with the fight passing of the B-52s and other fighter jets, it did certainly look much more like a show of appreciation for Vladimir Putin. And so, the optics were really much more favorable to Putin than they were to the United States. It really looked like Putin had set the agenda there, the narrative and, in many respects, the tone for the whole summit meeting.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, saying that, you know, the President has a team of advisers around him, and in a traditional administration, those advisers would be setting the policy, they would be planning the optics, and they would be thinking through that. Do you think that the President's team set him up for success here?",
      "HILL: Well, look, it may well have been that one of the demands, because we've heard from Secretary Rubio, which I have to say, I think was a very fair assessment of where things are. So it may well have been that one of the demands by the Russians to make any progress in moving further forward was to actually have that kind of show of pomp and pageantry, that basically marks Putin's re-entry into international affairs. Maybe the Russians said to them in Moscow, either to Steve Witkoff or to Secretary Rubio, or to anybody else, that basically they wanted to have a major US-Russia, bilateral summit appearance before they would move on to the nitty-gritty of anything else in Ukraine. That's to give them- them all the benefit of the doubt there. But, it all now depends on what comes out of this. And I think again, Secretary Rubio made it very clear that it's not going to be easy. He was certainly downplaying any expectations of a major breakthrough. But he did say that there was something that might be possible. I think that's what's going to be the proof of whether this was actually worth all the effort that they went to in Alaska or not. And as Congressman Crow said, there's a pretty high bar here, because what Putin is doing is pretty brutal, and he's not showing, right now, any signs whatsoever of giving anything up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom's Defense Secretary has said that they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help oversee a ceasefire. When you hear these security guarantees being talked about, and the Secretary said he is going to negotiate that tomorrow, what should we think- what form is that going to take? What do you think that should look like?",
      "HILL: Well, look, I think he actually laid this out, and you did too in your questions. And I think Congressman Crow made it very clear as well. It has to be a combination of all of the things that we've already heard discussed on the show today. You have to be able to have some boots on the ground. Congressman Crow that it doesn't have to be the United States. That's actually the case. But, it actually has to be some commitment from the United States to enable European forces to actually hold that territory and to provide some security guarantees for Ukraine. The United States is key in terms of its intelligence, in terms of enabling equipment, and the information and the data that we would need for all of this to make a security intervention mean something. And it's also essential in terms of all kinds of other forms of equipment and defensive weaponry. We've already heard, of course, about Ukraine needing all kinds of equipment, from javelins in the past, to patriots, now, in terms of an integrated missile defense system that Ukraine desperately needs. So there's a lot there that we all know needs to be done, and what we really need to see, I think, in these meetings that will take place on Monday and moving forward, is a real commitment to the United States, to work with Europeans, and to work with Ukraine to make this happen. Look, this is existential, also for European security. So, minimizing the real role of Europe here, be it the United Kingdom, be it Poland, be it Finland, be it France, be it Germany, is not the way to go. Europe has to have an equal say in all of this. This is about Europe's future and the future of European security, not just about Ukraine's.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the dynamic between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. You know both men. You've written biographies of Vladimir Putin, and of course, you served under Donald Trump. In one of the FOX interviews that President Trump did, he said that he spoke about mail-in voting in the United States with Vladimir Putin, and during that press address, Putin also claimed that the war wouldn't have happened at all if Donald Trump had been President. I mean, that's a counterfactual, but that something Trump often says on the- on the trail, why would those things be discussed at all if this was about Ukraine?",
      "HILL: Exactly. Well, look, this is Vladimir Putin, as usual, trying to manipulate U.S. domestic politics. I've seen him do this over and over again, including at Helsinki when he set the president off, not in the press conference, but before that, in a whole diatribe against his political enemies, because Putin deliberately asked him about this. So Putin knows that President Trump wants to have an acknowledgement of his self-assertion that the war wouldn't have happened had he not- had he been in the presidency. And so, Putin is giving him something that plays well for President Trump in his own domestic environment. It doesn't play well in the international environment, where people know things are much more complicated, but it's basically a gift and a concession to President Trump himself. And Putin wants to sow chaos in the American electoral system ahead of the midterms. So, of course, he's led into this whole issue of mail-in voting. And President Trump asserted in his Fox News interview that there are no countries in the world that allow mail-in voting. Well, Russia allows mail-in voting, and if everybody wants to go out and look, they can look for themselves. In 2020, President Vladimir Putin signed into law Russians being able to vote by mail and also on the internet. And more than 30 other countries also allow some forms of mail-in voting. So, it's just not true that other countries, including Russia, don't use this. It's a pure, blatant piece of manipulation, and that's the kind of thing that Putin likes to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And, of course, I don't think you would endorse the outcome of that voting system and that those elections are rigged in Russia. Correct?",
      "HILL: Of course. And I mean, basically, Putin wants to see us tie ourselves up in knots between now and the midterms. He's trying to sow chaos, and he's just basically used his time with President Trump to push that along. It's, again, it's a diversion, it's a distraction, really, from the negotiations on Ukraine, because Putin doesn't really want to give anything up, so he gives up, basically, something that plays well in the political arena for President Trump and something that actually plays very badly for the United States in its own political arena, which is the mail-in voting point that he made.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Fiona Hill, always appreciate your analysis. Thank you for joining us today. We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator.",
      "SEN. DAN SULLIVAN: Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for joining us in your home state.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Welcome to Alaska. The father of the U.S. Air Force called Alaska the most strategic place in the world. That's a quote by Billy Mitchell that I use a lot. And now you see why.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2014 very strategic. And I want to talk to you about a lot of things specific to the state--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014but this is the focus of the world right now\u2014",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: It is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014because of who's coming here.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So from your perspective, you're a supporter of Ukraine\u2014",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: I have been.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014what does a successful Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, summit look like?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, look, I think the President and his team need to be commended. You know, they have put a lot of effort and energy in peace, with regard to Ukraine and Russia, like they're doing all around the world, you know, they're they're making a lot of headway on peace, whether it's the Azerbaijan-Armenia issues, Iran-Israel, Pakistan-India, they're putting a lot of energy into bringing peace to different parts of the world, but they put the most energy into this.",
      "So, look, I think a successful outcome would be, as you know, a com- negotiating peace is very complex, very difficult. Even this kind of high level diplomacy has risks for everybody, including the president and his team. The different elements of a peace agreement, starting with the ceasefire, then you would have territorial issues, concessions or not, then you have security guarantees. But I think this is a place-setting exercise that the administration believes that if they can get a ceasefire, then you would do the other elements that I talked about, the much more complex elements, with Zelenskyy, with our European and NATO allies. So I think the President is going to assess Putin's seriousness on a ceasefire. And if he assesses that, that he's serious, and Putin agrees to a ceasefire, then I think that would be success. Then you move on to the other elements for round two. So this is really preliminary, and I would call it, you know, an exercise in place-setting for the real negotiations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, watch for the ceasefire, and judge success based off of that. Well, the Kremlin has announced there's going to be this joint press conference. The White House says, we'll see, the president said maybe, maybe not. Vladimir Putin is being brought in from the cold. He's been isolated by the world for a reason. Do you think that this is rewarding bad behavior, by giving him this spotlight on the American soil?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Look, two things on that. Vladimir Putin is coming to negotiate with Trump because of the sanctions. I mean, don't take it from me. Listen to our European allies who are definitive on that. The reason Putin is even doing this is because of the threat of serious secondary sanctions. So I think that that is important. And, you know, in terms of American soil, look, I actually think Alaska is the appropriate place. Putin understands one thing, as you know, Margaret, strength and power. And my state exudes strength and power with a huge military here. By the way, we're having a giant military exercise going on right now. I hope Vladimir Putin sees a lot of that military power in the next couple of days. Unleashing American energy, which the President is doing. That's the weapon that Putin fears probably more than anything, when we can compete with them.",
      "And then this is also, you know, a place that demonstrates a huge element of American power and strength, which is our allies. We have allies doing military exercises up here as we speak, the president has been doing a great job with our European allies. Gotten NATO to get to 5%, coordinating with them all week. So I think those are really important. And then finally, you know, as an Alaskan. I think it's important, from the perspective of reminding the Russians that we are quite good negotiators, including the president of the United States. You know, last time we had a big deal with Russia in America, about my state, we got this great state for two cents an acre, $7.2 million, probably the deal of the century. And I think the Russians- I think the Russians probably have to remember that too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly. Don't you think for Vladimir Putin, who, you know, allegedly wants to reconstitute the Russian Empire, that maybe has a little bit of a different meaning for him, arriving here?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, look, I think he has no- I mean, who knows what they think about Alaska, but I know what Alaskans think about Russia. And you know, we're a strong state, like I said. We have enormous power right here. And so again, I think for all these reasons, this is going to be a really important summit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So- he is an indicted war criminal, for a very specific crime of kidnapping Ukrainian children. He's bombed hospitals in Syria. He's massacred people, ordered them at least, he's- he's murdered many of his own people. He's used chemical weapons on British soil. That's why he's under this kind of pressure and U.S. sanctions. Really, are you pleased that he's this close to home?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Look, like I said, I mean the- the part about\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think it normalizes that, that it forgives that, that it brings him back into the fold by giving him that photo op that makes him look so powerful?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: You know, peace is difficult, right? We've had high level discussions with Reagan in Gorbachev, with Stalin, with Mao Zedong. I mean, this is what diplomacy is about, when you try to end wars. And it's- the way you end wars is, you discuss them with the leaders of these countries. Look, I'm no fan of Vladimir Putin. I don't trust anything he says. The key is, when I think what the president has done when you're dealing with a dictator, is show up with strength, and that's what the president's done. Putin is coming to the negotiating tables because he's threatened by these sanctions. The president is rebuilding our military, rebuilding our energy sector, which is critical, critical to my state, and very importantly, as I already mentioned, coordinating really closely with one of the greatest strengths we have, and that's our allies. We are an ally rich nation. Putin is ally poor, and that's a huge strength of ours.",
      "So all of these things, I think, you focus on the strength, get Putin to a ceasefire, and move forward with Ukraine, Zelenskyy, our European allies, in terms of the more complicated elements of a peace negotiation. But it starts with this. Starts with a ceasefire. And look, if President Trump assesses Putin is not being honest, you've seen, you know, a lot of frustration from the president recently saying, hey, I have these good discussions with Putin, then he's out bombing, you know, hospitals and nursing homes. If he assesses that he's not serious, then, as the president said, there'll be severe consequences. And I think that's the kind of pressure we need to keep on to try to get to what everybody wants, which is an end of this war.",
      "END PART ONE",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So if there's no ceasefire Friday, the Republican leader in the Senate is going to put that sanctions bill to a vote finally?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, look, I don't know what the Republican Leader John Thune is going to do I know I'm a--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you like him to?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: -- I'm an original cosponsor of that sanctions bill. I think what we've been doing right now, Lindsey Graham has been leading the charge, doing a great job, which is coordinating with the White House, but the President has already threatened sanctions against India. I think soon they should be threatening sanctions against China. They're a huge secondary buyer as well--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even as those negotiations over trade deals are ongoing?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: I mean, I- look, I think with regard to buying oil and propping up the Putin war machine, the answer is yes, but we are trying to coordinate, and I think we're doing a good job with Leader Thune and Lindsey Graham on that sanctions bill, which has over 80 cosponsors. And look, there might be a time when the White House needs that, there's as you know, ongoing litigation over the tariffs, and having Congress pass legislation with regard to the tariffs makes that much more stronger from a legal perspective. But I think continuing to coordinate with the White House and when and how to do that with our leadership at this moment is the right approach.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the President has also spoken about the opportunities that might exist from a business perspective with Russia. The Telegraph was reporting offering Putin a chance to invest in the natural resources off of Alaska's coast in the Bering Strait. Are you comfortable with that?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, look, we have plenty of American investors and our allies who want to invest in Alaska's natural resources. We're having a boom here. We don't need Russian investments. We don't need Russian money. They're a competitor of ours when it comes to energy and natural resources and critical minerals. So I doubt that's on the table. And you know, I would not--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You'd be upset if--",
      "SEN SULLIVAN: --I would not, I would not support that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your colleague--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: By the way, just on that point, though, a contrast, you might remember the last time I was on your show, we talked about the Biden administration--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I want to talk about this.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: With this great state of ours, shutting us down, right? I mean, that was 70 executive orders to shut down, exclusively focused on Alaska, shut down our resource development economy. As I mentioned when I was on your show last year. You know, the- our own federal government, the Biden administration, sanctioned my state more than they sanctioned Iran. What we're seeing with President Trump and his administration is a complete",
      "180 on that, unleashing Alaska's resource potential has been a huge focus of the president since day one. He literally issued an executive order on day one. So, you know, we're getting a lot of support from this administration, great support on our economy, jobs and resource development. It's a breath of fresh air relative to the Biden administration, and I think we're going to see continued focus on that from this White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been pushing the Trump administration to invest in a project here. The state has a lot of fossil fuels, a lot of natural resources. The project's from the North Slope of Alaska, and it would bring natural gas, perhaps even to Asia, to Japan.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump announced it as a joint venture, but the FT is reporting no Asian partners have made an equity investment or entered supply contracts. What's the reality check? Where is this particular project?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: So this is the big Alaska LNG Project that we've been working on for many, many years. It is a hugely strategic project. We have more natural gas on the North Slope than probably anywhere in the whole world. We've been working on a pipeline and an LNG facility right around here to ship that out. Alaska was the first place to ship LNG anywhere. We started exporting LNG to Japan in the late 1960s.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: So right now, the Trump administration, the president and his cabinet have been pushing this project in their trade negotiation agreements. We've gotten great support from them. There's not--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's not a done deal.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: It's not a done deal yet, because we are- on the private sector side, we're working on what's called the FEED work, the front-end engineering and design that's going to be done in a few months. And that's when we're going to go to these countries and go to the companies in Korea, in Japan, in Taiwan, all very interested, and say, hey, here are the off-take agreements we want you to sign. The President and his team have been working closely with the private sector on this, so we're making more progress on this, Margaret, than we've ever made before. This can be great for Alaskans. Great for our military here. But as you mentioned, this is great for our Asian allies, the Koreans, the Japanese, some of whom are still getting Russian oil and gas. The Taiwanese are all very interested. I've been over those- these countries a number of times to press this project. But we've made more project- we've made more progress on this project with the Trump administration than we ever have. So I'm very bullish on this. And by the way, this will be a game changer, hugely strategic for our allies, for our military, for Alaskans. Estimates of this would create about 20,000 jobs. This is a game-changer strategically, and I'm really appreciative the President spent so much time pressing this project, and we've made good progress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you mentioned how furious you were with the Biden administration for the executive actions they said they were taking to protect natural resources. They said land conservation was necessary, and the indigenous population here really wanted it. You called it a lie.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: I did call it a lie. It was a lie.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said it was national security suicide. Trump has already reversed this. But are you at all concerned that there are short-term benefits to your state financially, but longer-term real damage to the environment here?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: No. Look, Alaska has an incredible record of being able to develop our resources and protect the environment. You walk around here, you see what a pristine, beautiful environment we have here. We love that more than the Biden administration EPA or President Biden himself did. We love that part of our state. But we know we need jobs, we need natural resource development, so we can do both. And here's the thing I did call the president, President Biden, out for lying because the entire North Slope of Alaska, the Inupiat community across the board, was against what the Biden administration did, which was lock up the entire National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska- which was set aside by Congress to develop our resources. And then he had the audacity to say, hey, I did this on behalf of the native people. That was not true at all. It was a outrage. President Trump has reversed all that. The One Big Beautiful Bill, when we talk about the energy component of that legislation, it's almost all unleashing Alaska. So we're excited right now and- but we have a great record of being able to do both, develop natural resources and protect the environment here, and that's what the people of Alaska want.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So- so for activists, or for those concerned about the damage here, you say they just don't know what they're talking about?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, I say- well, a couple things. A, we have the highest standards on the environment in a place in the world. I used to be the Commissioner of Natural resources and Energy- in charge of that. There's no place on the planet that has higher standards on protecting the environment than us. And if we need American energy, why would we go- like the Biden administration did, begging from Iran, Venezuela, places that have no environmental standards when you can get it from America, from American workers with the highest environmental standards any place on the planet. And secondly- and this is something I really try to emphasize- I emphasized it with Secretary Kennedy when he was in town here a couple of weeks ago. You know, when you have resource development, particularly in our rural communities, you see life expectancies increases- increasing. On the North Slope of Alaska, when we started developing our resources, where most of the resources are, you had Inupiat native populations that had very low life expectancies. In 25 years, they increased their life expectancy by almost 13, 14, 15 years more than any other place in the country during that period, because they got good jobs, because they got hospitals, because they got clinics, because they got flushing toilets and running water. So when we're talking about resource development, it's not just the economy and jobs, it's people living longer in my state, and that's as important as it gets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I want to ask you a little bit more about national security, and then talk a little bit more local, if we could. So in this region, the Arctic is of supreme concern from a national security perspective. The ice is melting--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Majority of scientists attribute that to global warming, but the end result is there's a potential for an Arctic area for trade routes--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: --Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --also tapping into the natural resources there. How does the United States gain an edge in dominating that?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, look, it's a great question. It's really important. You're mentioning trade routes that are opening up. We've already talked about natural resources, which are huge up in the Arctic. And what we need to do is recognize that we're an Arctic nation. We're an Arctic nation because of Alaska. And look, this has not always been a priority of previous administrations. When I first got to the Senate, I remember holding up the Biden- or, I'm sorry, the Obama administration Arctic strategy with the Secretary of Defense slamming it down on the dais and saying, Mr. Secretary, this is a joke. We have a huge national interest in the Arctic that we need to protect. It's not some parochial issue for Alaska's senator. This is about national security up here. So it is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --They were trying, I remember back then they were trying for more ice cutters- Icebreakers and all of that--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, it's finally start- well, it's finally starting to happen. What we're doing up here, we're rebuilding our military, the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' certainly does it. As I mentioned, you know, Alaska exudes military might. We're the cornerstone of missile defense, and we're going to be the cornerstone of the President's Golden Dome initiative. We are the hub of air combat power. You're seeing them flying over here. We have over 100 fifth generation fighters based in Alaska. We have a brand new US Army Airborne Division up here. So we are building out our military, which is great, but also building out our Arctic capabilities. Just three days ago, we commissioned finally an Icebreaker in Juneau, Alaska--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I saw that.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: That's going to be home ported in Alaska. Can you imagine that, Margaret? Putting an Icebreaker where the ice is makes sense, but it's never happened until last Sunday. President Trump and his team have been a huge proponent of this. And again, in the 'One Big \u00a0Beautiful Bill,' one of the untold stories of that bill--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: $9 billion in it for Icebreakers.",
      "SEN. SULIVAN: Well, 20- almost $26 billion investment in the Coast Guard, which is the biggest investment in the Coast Guard in American history, by far. 16 Icebreakers coming with that, 22 cutters, 40 helicopters, a bunch of shore side infrastructure, a lot of that's going to be in Alaska to defend the Arctic. And we need to defend the Arctic, because, as you and I have talked about, the Russians and the Chinese are in our waters and in our airspace all the time, including doing joint operations up here, which is unprecedented.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wanted to ask you about that, because the war in Ukraine has hurt Russia's finances, made them more dependent on Beijing, including when it comes to exploring up and around the Arctic. They had a joint Bomber Task Force.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Correct--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --come here pretty darn close.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Oh, they were in our ADIZ, as they as we call it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Air Defense Identification Zone.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, are you concerned this actually becomes a flashpoint?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: I think this is already becoming a flashpoint. I mean the number of times that the Russians and Chinese are doing joint strategic bomber task forces in our airspace and joint naval task forces in our EEZ- in our waters--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --economic zone.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Yes, that's happening on a regular basis now. That's unprecedented. They don't do joint operations anywhere else on America's borders, that's for sure. So again, it's the reason we need to build up, not just our military forces, but our infrastructure. And the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' I got a provision in to start reopening the Adak Navy military base. It was out on the Aleutian island chain. We're going to get a strategic Arctic port built in Nome, Alaska- in western Alaska. So, we need the infrastructure to project power, and we are getting that from this administration- and the Congress. A lot of this is bipartisan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Republican Chair of the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee says there is far more needed for the US military than what has been provided by the White House in their budget.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Again, 150 billion in the One Big, Beautiful Bill, 25 billion for the Coast Guard, which is part of our military. But I want to- you know, I'm someone who is a strong advocate for a strong military, particularly up here. And we need to do more, and we certainly need to keep it above 3% of GDP and growing towards four or 5% of GDP. It's a dangerous world right now, but this One Big, Beautiful Bill, the budget reconciliation bill, does a lot for our military right now. On urgent needs. Ship building, as you and I have talked about, our Navy, our ability to build ships is completely atrophied. Weapons, ammo systems, the Golden Dome. There's a lot in this One Big, Beautiful Bill that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what that is? Have they actually briefed the Senate Armed Services Committee? I know you have your own proposal, but has the Pentagon told you what the Golden Dome is?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Absolutely. Alright. I mean, I've been working on this with the Pentagon. This is missile defense that is a layered missile defense. So what that means is, right here, like I said, you have the ground-based missile interceptor, the missile interceptors in Alaska. You have all the radar systems in Alaska that protect the whole country. In terms of ballistic missiles, we have new threats. We have hypersonics, we have drones. We have, heck, even we've seen it here in Alaska, spy balloons. What we need to do is upgrade the system with what's called a layered defense, not just the ground based system here, but you work it more with different systems, Aegis Ashore, THADD and then including space based systems, both for tracking and intercepting, and you do that with the open architecture in terms of software to integrate those systems. So I am very familiar with what the Golden Dome is doing, and I'm leading the effort in the Senate on it. And by the way, my state is the cornerstone of all the missile defense right now and will continue to be so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm being told that we are running out of time. But I do need to ask you, when you're talking about the big, One, Big, Beautiful Bill, the tax and spending--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: You smile every time you say that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Republican tax and spend bill that just passed, Alaska got a lot of special treatment\u2013",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Alaska did very well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0And your colleague, Senator Lisa Murkowski, acknowledged that, she said the bill wasn't good enough for the rest of the nation. You said you had a dark night of the soul at one point.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Yeah, I did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You almost didn't vote for this.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: No, I had a dark night of soul because I had been working on a provision in that bill--",
      "MARGRET BRENNAN: The Medicaid costs paid for by the federal government--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: The Medicaid FMAP as we call it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: And that had the support of the White House, support of all the Republicans, something I've been working on for almost 10 years. Alaska gets a very low match in terms of Medicaid, one of the lowest in the country, which I think makes no sense. So this changes the formula to help states like mine that have very high health care costs. So that was in the bill, and Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats literally challenged every single good provision in that bill dealing with Alaska. And I mean every provision. Schumer definitely made himself clear that he was the anti-Alaska senator in the Senate. Everything- we fought him. We beat him back on almost everything. They won. Chuck Schumer stripped out a Medicaid increase for Alaska. It was tough on me, because I've been working on that for a long time. We pivoted. We got the Rural Health Care Transformation fund and increased--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You got exemptions for Alaska Natives for new Medicaid and SNAP or food stamps. Work requirements waived for indigenous people. Alaska gets a larger share of rural hospital funds. Why shouldn't people living in other states get those same considerations?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, we have unique challenges up here. Come on up to Alaska--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or it was a tight vote.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: It's a\u2013 What's that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And it was a tight vote. Well, Alaska had a lot of leverage here.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: It's called- It's called good legislating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what about the rest of the country? You acknowledge there are flaws?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: I'm first and foremost the Senator for Alaska. But I care about the rest of the country too, which is why I focus a lot on energy, a lot on our national security, a lot on border security. I care a lot about the border security in the southern part of America. So you know, all senators do that. They take care of their own state. They legislate to help their constituents. My constituents have unique needs, but we also bring a lot to the table for our great country. Like I said, we're protecting the whole country in terms of missile defense right now, we have a huge military up here that we love, that is protecting our interests in the North Pacific, in the Arctic, and we are unleashing American energy, which, of course, helps Alaska but helps America. When Alaska is doing well on energy issues, on critical mineral issues, that helps my constituents but helps the country. And that's again, why I'm so appreciative of the President and his team on recognizing that. The Biden guys, all they wanted to do was shut us down, close off our state. That didn't help anybody. All that helped was the Russians and the Iranians and the Venezuelans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Margaret, great to be here, and welcome to Alaska again. We're glad you're here.",

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Secretary of State Marco Rubio that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 17, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin with Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who attended those talks in Anchorage. Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary.",
      "SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: Good morning. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin did not give President Trump the ceasefire he sought. And now Putin says the root causes of the conflict have to be resolved in a peace agreement. Isn't the root cause the fact that Russia invaded in the first place?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: \u00a0Well, ultimately, yeah. But I mean, what he means by root causes is this long historical complaints that we've heard repeatedly. This is not a new argument, he's been making this for a long time, and it's the argument that it's Western encroachment. I don't want to get into- it's just so long. But the bottom line is that all of- you know, we're not going to focus on all of that stuff. We're going to focus on this: are they going to stop fighting or not? And what it's going to take to stop the fighting. And what it's going to take to stop the fighting, if we're being honest and serious here, is both sides are going to have to give, and both sides should expect to get something from this. And that's a very difficult thing to do. It's very difficult because Ukraine obviously feels, you know, harmed, and rightfully so, because they were invaded. And the Russian side, because they feel like they got momentum in the battlefield, and frankly, don't care, don't seem to care very much about how many Russian soldiers die in this endeavor. They just churn through it. So I think what the President deserves a lot of credit for is the amount of time and energy that his administration is placing on reaching a peace agreement for a war that's not a war that started under him. It's half, you know, it's on the other side of the world. That said, I mean, it's relevant to us. But there are a lot of other issues he could be focused on. So tomorrow, we'll be meeting with President Zelenskyy. We'll be meeting with European leaders. We just met with Putin. He's dedicated a lot of time and energy because he has made it a priority of his administration to stop or end war- stop wars or prevent them. And right now, this is the biggest war going on in the world. It's the biggest war in Europe since World War Two. We're going to continue to do everything we can to reach an agreement that ends the dying and the killing and the suffering that's going on right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You know this well, how long these kind of diplomatic negotiations often take. President Trump was telling European leaders what was discussed was Putin demanding control of Donetsk, a region in the east that his forces do not fully hold, and the UK estimates that taking that full area could be as long as another four years. Putin also is demanding Russian be an official language in Ukraine, and something regarding Russian Orthodox churches. Did the U.S. accept all of what Putin laid out at that table?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: The United States is not in a position to accept anything or reject anything, because ultimately, it's up to the Ukrainians. They're the ones that Russia has to make peace with, Ukraine with Russia--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 --Well, the President said he did come to some agreement--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --It's up to the Ukrainians to make these conditions. Well, the agreements were that we were going to try to do things like, for example, get a leader- a leaders meeting. We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war. Now, there were some concepts and ideas discussed that we know the Ukrainians could be very supportive of in that meeting. I don't think it's- we're not going to negotiate this in the media. I understand that everybody wants to know what happened. But ultimately, there are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs, that are potentials for progress. We'll be discussing that more in depth tomorrow, with our European allies, with the Ukrainians that are coming over. We'll be discussing all of these things, because ultimately, we do need to find areas where we're making progress and try to begin to narrow the gap between the two sides. But there's a reason why this war has been going on for three and a half years, and that is, when it comes to the big issues here, there are still some big differences between both sides. Let's see how much progress we can continue to make. It's- it's- it's not been easy, but it's something the President's made a priority. Peace. And he deserves a lot of credit for that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But ultimately, if- if Vladimir Putin is going to be offered land that he has not seized yet, but negotiates his way into, doesn't this set a dangerous precedent that the United States now accepts this concept that it is okay to seize land by force?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, Putin has already seized land by force, and that, in and of itself, is not a positive precedent. This whole war is a negative precedent--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Are you demanding withdrawal?--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --precedent. Well, again, here's the- in order to have a deal here to end- to reach the end of this conflict, both sides are going to have to make concessions. That's just the facts--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But does that mean accepting--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --in any negotiation--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --where Russian forces are now?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: No, no, but, if- But this is not about acceptance. This is about what Ukraine can accept. And what Russia can accept. They both have to accept it, otherwise there won't be a peace deal. Okay. If there aren't concessions, if one side gets everything they want, that's called surrender. That's called the end of the war through surrender. And that's not what we're close to doing, because neither side here is on the verge of surrender or anything close to it. So in order for there to be a peace deal, this is just a fact, we may not like it, it may not be pleasant, it may be distasteful, but in order for there to be an end of the war, there are things Russia wants that it cannot get, and there are things Ukraine wants that it's not going to get. Both sides are going to have to give up something in order to get to the table, in order to make this happen. That's- that's just the way it is. And I mean, the sooner we accept that, that's the reality. Now, what those things are is going to be up to both sides. There's no conditions that can be imposed on Ukraine. They're going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too. And so, for example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to have- to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security. That's not an unreasonable request. That's something needs to be worked on. Territories will have to be discussed. It's just a fact, and there are things that maybe Russia is holding now that they're going to have to give up. Who knows? The point is, we need to create a scenario where that becomes possible, and that's why this has been so hard, because neither side, up to now, has been willing to give on some of these things. But we'll see if that's possible. It may not be, but we're going to try, and we're going to do everything we can to try to achieve a peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand you, you can't get into specifics in a public conversation, but we're looking at Russian troops and strikes intensifying. Did you hear anything from Vladimir Putin that indicated he is willing to make a single concession?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, I think there are a couple. I mean, there were- not enough for Ukraine, if not we would be announcing a peace deal this morning, right? But- but certainly, there are some things we notice changes. There are some changes that I think are possible. I think there's some concepts that were discussed that could potentially lead to something. But again, all these things have to be verifiable. We- it isn't real until it's real. I mean, you- one thing is what you say you might be willing to consider, another thing is your willingness to do it. And it always becomes a trade off in all of this. But you talk about the intensifying strikes on the Russian side, yeah, I mean, they're a full-time war machine. I mean, that's what's happening. The Russian economy has basically been turned into a full-time wartime economy. They have a lot of people. It's a big country. It's not just large geographically. It has huge populations. It continues to churn through people. You know, they lost- 20,000 Russian soldiers were killed last month, in July, in this war. That just tells you the price they're willing to pay. Not saying any of this is admirable, I'm saying that this is the reality of the war that we're facing. It's become attrition, in some ways. It's a meat grinder, and they just have more meat to grind.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you about the security bit you just mentioned there, because Italy's Prime Minister says that President Trump revived the idea of security guarantees inspired by NATO's Article Five and a collective security clause that would involve the United States. How does that work? Are these U.S. troops? Are these U.S. monitors?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, what we're going to be working on. That's why- that's one of the reasons why, you know, I talked yesterday to all the national security advisors, a bunch of them from the different European countries, or European leaders coming here tomorrow, heads of state coming tomorrow, along with President Zelenskyy, to discuss this in more detail. I mean, the constructs of something like this needs to be built out once it- concept is one thing. The reality, you know, how it's built and how it would work, is another. But those are the kinds of talks that we're going to be having with them, along with some of the other issues that are at play. But, that-that is one of the-if you were to break this thing down, I mean, there are, obviously, there needs to be an agreement on territories and where the lines are going to be drawn. That's not going to be very easy. That's going to be tough. I think there has to be some discussion about security guarantees for Ukraine, because they don't want this war to\u2013none of us want to see this war in the future. They're a sovereign country. They have a right to have security agreements with other countries and security alliances with other countries. And then there's the whole issue of reconstruction\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Including the United States?--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: -- How do you rebuild the country? Well, potentially, like I said, that's what we're going to be having a conversation about, and that's what we're going to be meeting. That's why they're all coming here tomorrow, and-and that's why we've been talking on the phone for the last 48 hours with them, and even leading up to it throughout the week there were various meetings just to sort of build out some of these ideas. So all of these right now are ideas, they are concepts that require some more specificity. We'll need to work with our partners to see what that looks like. And I think that's an area where potential progress is real, but that alone won't be enough. There's a bunch of other things that have to be worked through here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN\u00a0 Yea, well, Russia claims it has rescued 700,000 children. I know you know that the warrant out for Vladimir Putin's arrest is for the state-sponsored abduction of kids. I've seen estimates there are something like 30,000 Ukrainian children who have been abducted. Is the United States demanding, or at least, even just as a statement of goodwill here, that Russia return these children?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Yeah, I mean, we've repeatedly raised that issue on- in every forum possible, and those have also been, by the way, topics of discussion, not just in our meetings with the Ukrainians, but in the negotiations and talks that were going on between Ukraine and Russia at the technical level. These talks were going on in Turkey, as an example. Turkey over the last few months--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Yeah, nothing so far from the Russians --",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --that's been a topic of discussion as well --",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, it's unfortunate. Children should be returned to their families. We- on that position, I don't think there's any ambiguity on our side. And they shouldn't even be, you know, a bargaining chip in regards to a broader negotiation. But it's just one more element of how tragic this war is. After three and a half years, this war is getting worse. It's not getting better. You've made the point about the uptick in strikes. This is a war. It's going to get worse. It's not going to get better, and that's why the President is investing so much time in bringing this to an end. And, by the way, everyone is begging us to be involved in this. The Europeans want us involved. The Ukrainians want us involved. Obviously, the Russians want us involved because the President is the only leader in the world- if this is possible, he's the only one that can help make it happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, he's got the leverage over Vladimir Putin if he wanted to crush his economy or at least do more damage to it, but you have held off on those secondary sanctions. President Trump told Fox News his advice to President Zelenskyy is make a deal, Russia's a very big power and they're not. You know there is concern from the Europeans that President Zelenskyy is going to be bullied into signing something away. That's why you have these European leaders coming as back up tomorrow. Can you reassure them?",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 No, it isn't. That's not why they're coming as back- that's not true. No but that's not, why, that's not true. They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming- in fact --",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well that February Oval Office meeting in front of television cameras, where President Zelenskyy was dressed down --",
      "SEC. RUBIO: -- Do you know how many meetings we've had since then?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, no, I know. And I was just up in Alaska --",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Yeah, but we've had a bunch of meetings since then.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- watching the one with Vladimir Putin where a red carpet was rolled out for the Russian leader. It was very different--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: -- No, but it wasn't Zelenskyy. We've had more meetings, we've had, we've had, we've had one meeting with Putin and like a dozen meetings with Zelenskyy. So that, but that's not true. They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're coming here tomorrow because we've been working with the Europeans. We talked to them last week. There were meetings in the UK over the following, the previous weekend --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- And they said the President Trump was going to demand a ceasefire --",
      "SEC. RUBIO: -- The President's talked to these leaders as early as Thursday. No, no, but you said that they're coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming here tomorrow- this is such a stupid media narrative that they're coming here tomorrow because the- Trump is going to bully Zelenskyy into a bad deal. We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff. They're coming here tomorrow because they chose to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. We invited them to come. The President invited them to come.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President told those European leaders last week that he wanted a cease fire. The President went on television, said he would walk out of the meeting if Vladimir Putin didn't agree with him. He said there would be severe consequences if he didn't agree to one. He said he'd walk out in two minutes. He spent three hours talking to Vladimir Putin, and he did not get one,so--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --Because obviously something, things happen during that meeting, well, because obviously things,look our goal here is not to stage some production for the world to say, oh how dramatic he walked out. Our goal here is to have a peace agreement to end this war. Okay? And obviously we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress, not a lot of progress, but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase. If not, we wouldn't be having Zelenskyy flying all the way over here. We wouldn't be having all the Europeans coming all the way over here. Now understand, and take with a grain of salt, I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this. You talk about the sanctions. Look, at the end of the day, if peace is not going to be possible here, and this is just going to continue on as a war, people will continue to die by the thousands, the President has that option to then come in and impose new sanctions. But if he did this now, the moment the President puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks. You've basically locked in at least another year to year and a half of war and death and destruction. We may unfortunately wind up there, but we don't want to wind up there. We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here. We're going to do everything possible to make that happen if it's doable. It will require both sides to make concessions. It will require both sides to get things they're asking for. That's how these deals are made, whether we like it or not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Before I let you go, quickly, why did the State Department just announced that they're halting visitor visas for all Gazans coming here for medical aid? Why would some of these kids, for example, who are coming to hospitals for treatment be a threat?",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 Well, first of all, it's not just kids, it's a bunch of adults that are accompanying them. Second, we had outreach from multiple congressional offices asking questions about it, and so we're going to reevaluate how those visas are being granted, not just to the children, but how those visas are being granted to the people who are accompanying them. And by the way, to some of the organizations that are facilitating it. There is evidence, it's been presented to us by numerous congressional offices, that some of the organizations bragging about and involved in acquiring these visas have strong links to terrorist groups like Hamas. And so we are not going to be in partnership with groups that are friendly with Hamas. So we need to- we're going to pause those visas. There was just a small number of them issued to children, but they come with adults accompanying them, obviously, and we are going to pause this program and reevaluate how those visas are being vetted and what relationship, if any, has there been by these organizations to the- to the process of acquiring those visas. We're not going to be in partnership with groups that have links or sympathies towards Hamas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary of State, Marco Rubio. We have to leave it there for this morning. Thank you for joining us.",

      "Republican West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced Saturday that he was sending a contingent of 300 to 400 Guard troops to Washington, while Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster authorized the deployment of 200 of his state's National Guardsmen and Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said his state would send 150 military police at the request of the Defense Department.",
      "\"West Virginia is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation's capital,\" Morrisey said.",
      "Maj. Gen.

      "Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican from Vermont, declined on Friday to send the state's National Guard troops to the nation's capital. Scott's chief of staff, Jason Gibbs, told Vermont Public that while public safety is a \"legitimate concern\" in cities across the country, \"the governor just does not support utilizing the guard for this purpose, and does not view the enforcement of domestic law as proper use of the National Guard.\"",
      "The activations suggest the Trump administration sees the need for additional manpower after the president personally played down the need for Washington to hire more police officers.",
      "By adding outside troops to join the existing National Guard deployment and federal law enforcement officers temporarily assigned to Washington, Mr. Trump is exercising even tighter control over the city. It's a power play that the president has justified as an emergency response to crime and homelessness, even though district officials have noted that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump's first term in office.",
      "A White House official\u00a0told CBS News Saturday that National Guard members deployed to D.C. \"may be armed,\" but that they would not make arrests. This was a reversal from earlier in the week, when a Defense Department official told CBS News that deployed Guard members would not be armed at the request of local law enforcement partners. The official also said at the time they would not have weapons in their vehicles.",
      "\"The National Guard is not making arrests at this time \u2013 they may be armed, consistent with their mission and training, to protect federal assets, provide a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deter violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence,\" the White House official said Saturday.",
      "A protest against Mr. Trump's intervention drew scores to Dupont Circle on Saturday afternoon before a march to the White House, about 1.5 miles away. Demonstrators assembled behind a banner that said \"No fascist takeover of D.C.,\" and some in the crowd held signs that said \"No military occupation.\" Mr. Trump was at his Virginia golf club after Friday's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.",

      "On Friday, the administration reversed course on an order that aimed to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration as an \"emergency police commissioner\" after the district's top lawyer sued to contest.

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is signaling it will more heavily scrutinize applications filed by legal immigrants seeking American citizenship, in its latest effort to tighten access to U.S. immigration benefits.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency overseeing the country's legal immigration system, instructed officers on Friday to consider additional factors when determining whether immigrants applying for U.S. citizenship have a \"good moral character.\"",
      "Typically, legal immigrants with U.S. permanent residency, also known as a green card, can apply for naturalized American citizenship after a 3- or 5-year period, depending on their case. Demonstrating \"a good moral character\" has long been one of the requirements in U.S. immigration law for American citizenship, alongside passing English and civics tests.",
      "For decades, under Republican and Democratic administrations, the \"good moral character\" assessment has generally been satisfied if applicants don't have any of the criminal offenses or disqualifying conduct outlined in U.S. immigration law. Those disqualifying factors range from violent crimes like murder and aggravated felonies to drug offenses and being a \"habitual drunkard.\"",
      "But a policy issued Friday by USCIS expands the \"good moral character\" assessment, saying that determination must involve \"more than a cursory mechanical review focused on the absence of wrongdoing.\" Instead, the review, the agency told its officers, should be \"a holistic assessment of an alien's behavior, adherence to societal norms, and positive contributions that affirmatively demonstrate good moral character.\"",
      "The directive orders officers to place a \"greater emphasis\" on applicants' \"positive attributes and contributions,\" listing community involvement, family caregiving and ties, educational attainment, \"stable and lawful\" employment, the length of time spent in the U.S., and paying taxes as some of those factors.",
      "The memo also mandates \"greater scrutiny\" of factors that show applicants lack a \"good moral character,\" beyond the crimes and disqualifying conduct detailed in U.S. immigration law.",
      "Those factors, the policy said, include \"acts that are contrary to the average behavior of citizens in the jurisdiction where aliens reside,\" including actions that are \"technically lawful\" but also \"inconsistent with civic responsibility within the community.\" USCIS listed \"reckless or habitual traffic infractions, or harassment or aggressive solicitation\" as some of those actions.",
      "Lastly, the new USCIS policy instructs officers to weigh factors that could show that applicants who have engaged in wrongdoing have rehabilitated, such as complying with probation, paying overdue taxes or child support and receiving letters of support from their community.",
      "Over the past decade, the U.S. government has naturalized between 600,000 and 1 million immigrants as citizens annually, USCIS figures show.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, USCIS chief spokesman Matthew Tragesser said the directive is another effort by President Trump's administration to \"restore integrity\" to the U.S. immigration system.",
      "\"U.S. citizenship is the gold standard of citizenship \u2014 it should only be offered to the world's best of the best,\" Tragesser added. \"Today, USCIS is adding a new element to the naturalization process that ensures America's newest citizens not only embrace America's culture, history, and language but who also demonstrate Good Moral Character.\"",
      "Doug Rand, a former senior USCIS official during the Biden administration, suggested the Trump administration's policy is designed to scare legal immigrants from applying for American citizenship and require officers to put their \"thumb on the scale\" to find more reasons to deny applications.",
      "\"They're trying to increase the grounds for denial of U.S. citizenship by kind of torturing the definition of good moral character to encompass extremely harmless behavior,\" Rand said, citing the policy's reference to traffic infractions.",
      "While the Trump administration has launched a highly visible crackdown on illegal immigration by deploying thousands of troops to the southern border, expanding immigration raids across the country, and fast-tracking deportations of those in the U.S. illegally, it has simultaneously moved to restrict legal immigration, with less fanfare.",
      "The Trump administration has virtually shut down refugee admissions, terminated Biden-era programs that allowed migrants to enter the U.S. legally, limited visas for certain countries and implemented aggressive vetting procedures for legal immigration benefits. Those efforts include expanded vetting of social media activity of legal immigrants and stricter screening requirements for some applications.",

    "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 09:15:54 -0400",
    "summary": "For more than 40 years, glaciologist Mauri Pelto has been measuring shrinking glaciers in Washington State. He's been joined by his daughter, artist-scientist Jill Pelto, whose watercolors provide another view of the drastically-changing landscape.",
    "story": [
      "In the rugged North Cascade Mountains of Washington State, no one likely knows this glacier better than Mauri Pelto, who says, \"My life has been shaped by this ice.\"",
      "For more than 40 years, Pelto, a glaciologist and a professor at Nichols College in Massachusetts, has returned to this remote wilderness. \"We got 6,000 measurements on this glacier,\" he said.",
      "Today, the crunch of footsteps in the snow is now rivaled by the sound of melting ice. \"It's always melting off,\" he said. \"The crevasses are changing. We can hear the water flowing under our feet.\"",
      "Pelto founded the North Cascade Glacier Climate Project as a grad student in 1984. He vowed to measure these glaciers every summer for 50 years. This is Year 42. In that time the glaciers have changed more than he has, shrinking by 40%. Some have disappeared.",
      "Pelto's work has been featured by NASA, and fed into a worldwide glacier database. Of the 47 glaciers he has studied, returning to them year after year, he says 12 are now gone, \"nine of them just in the last five years.\"",
      "Climate scientists say warmer summers and drier winters, driven by our burning of fossil fuels, are accelerating the loss. Seven of the 10 worst years for glacier melt worldwide have happened since 2010, according to Climate Central.",
      "Or just ask Mauri Pelto where the ice used to be. \"Almost 50 feet above my head just a decade ago,\" he said.",
      "Glaciers are Earth's water towers, storing 70% of the freshwater supply, vital for drinking, farming, and the health of many ecosystems. As they melt, sea levels are rising, and coastal flooding is getting worse.",
      "During his annual treks to the North Cascades, Pelto has hiked nearly 6,000 miles, and slept 800 nights in a tent. \u00a0\"We got our picture window,\" he said of the view. \"It's also one of those places that's really special to us as a family.\"",
      "His son Ben, daughter Jill, and now his nine-month-old granddaughter Wren have joined him in the field.",
      "Jill Pelto has spent 17 summers by her dad's side, but she doesn't just collect data. As the project's art director, she paints it. The data points that she and her dad measure eventually will go into her art. \"Data is a story about something in the real world and that story has meaning and emotion,\" she said. \"And that's what I'm trying to bring into my art.\"",
      "Her watercolor paintings are more than just beautiful landscapes; they reveal the science. Look closely and you see a bar graph of glacier decline in the North Cascades. One piece showing temperature rise and ice loss made the cover of Time magazine.",
      "Jill said, \"I think sometimes when people see data there's this instant reaction, and so it's not like the data is any different in my art, but something about that combination maybe gets people to kind of put down the wall of like, 'Oh, I can't understand this,' or 'You know, this is not something I'm interested in.'\"",
      "I said, \"The average person is not going to read a scientific report, but they will see a painting. And it does impact you in a different way.\"",
      "\"Yes, definitely,\" said Jill.",
      "Her art has given her dad a new way to share the story he's been recording for the past 42 years. And it's also changed their relationship: \"We do it so seamlessly at this point,\" Mauri said.",
      "\"Feels like you're one team out here?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah,\" he replied.",
      "Jill added, \"This bigger project just means so much to us and has shaped our lives. So, sharing that year after year is beyond special.\"",
      "And now, Mauri Pelto has just eight summers left to fulfill his 50-year promise. Asked what he thinks it will be like to no longer come out to the glaciers, Mauri replied, \"I don't know, I can't remember what it was like to not come out here. This landscape has been shaped by ice, and so to understand the landscape and the ice, you really have to walk across it.\"",

      "The fish is believed to have hatched in 1961, long before a man walked on the moon, long before the first known test-tube baby, and even before President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. DNR officials said, with some whimsical logic, that if the fish were to have gone through human schooling, it would have graduated the same year as former president Barack Obama and Princess Diana of Wales.",
      "A typical lake trout in Lake Superior is thought to be roughly 25 to 30 years old. Prior to this new discovery, the oldest trout reported in the lake was estimated to have reached 42 years of age.",

    "summary": "Federal funding cuts to mRNA technology research doesn't just impact COVID vaccines \u2014 experts say it could stall progress in treatment for cancers, rare disease and more.",
    "story": [
      "If you think last week's decision by the federal government to halt $500 million in funding\u00a0for vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology will only affect COVID vaccines, think again.",
      "These types of vaccines\u00a0use\u00a0messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the body to make proteins that induce an antibody response to protect against a pathogen. The science behind it is also being studied for a wide range of other uses, from fighting cancer to treating autoimmune conditions and more.",
      "Health experts have criticized the move to defund this research, pointing to the impact it will have on America's ability to develop breakthroughs against deadly or debilitating diseases.",
      "Jeff Coller, professor of RNA biology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins University, called the cuts a \"completely reckless decision from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\" that was \"clearly being made for political motivations and not those that are rested in our science.\"",
      "Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, who served in the first Trump administration, said the technology \"helps us develop vaccines and new treatments,\" and warned that cuts could halt progress in one of the \"most promising areas of modern medicine.\"",
      "\"People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology,\" Adams said in a recent appearance on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "mRNA studied for pancreatic cancer, rare diseases and more",
      "Collier said one of the most exciting avenues for mRNA technology is in the treatment of deadly cancers, including pancreatic cancer, which is fatal for many patients within six months to a year.",
      "In recent years, researchers have been testing the effectiveness of using an mRNA vaccine to target the cancer. A small NIH-funded clinical trial by Sloan Kettering in 2023 used infusions of an mRNA vaccine to help boost T cells in the immune system of pancreatic cancer patients. The results, published in the journal\u00a0Nature, showed improvements among about 50% of participants.",
      "\"It was, in essence, the start of a cure for pancreatic cancer, where half of the patients in that study were surviving,\" Coller said.",
      "The early results encouraged scientists, but the small sample size called for further studies, which led to a\u00a0Phase 2 trial published in Nature earlier this year.",
      "Experimental mRNA-focused treatments have also showed promise in fighting lung,\u00a0colorectal and gastric cancers. For example, a study published online in the journal Gastric Cancer\u00a0found a mRNA-based vaccine led to robust gastric tumor regression in mice.",
      "And earlier this year, the world was was awed by news that an infant named KJ Muldoon became the first patient to undergo personalized gene-editing treatment using a technique known as CRISPR to fix a rare and potentially fatal genetic disorder.",
      "As Coller pointed out, the CRISPR technology had to be delivered via mRNA.",
      "\"This opens a floodgate for rare diseases,\" he said. \"We're now talking about, could we use the same technology to go after all rare diseases?\"",
      "Autoimmune diseases are another area of research, for treating things like multiple sclerosis, Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease.",
      "While all of these are still at the early research stage, Coller urged the importance of investing in this technology now for future progress.",
      "\"We need to do experiments and see where we can get with the next generation of mRNA-based drugs,\" he said.",
      "Like with COVID-19, there has also been continued research on mRNA-based vaccines for infectious diseases like the flu, RSV, Zika virus and cytomegalovirus, known as CMV, an infection that can be harmful to babies exposed during the mother's pregnancy.",
      "\"We're at a point where, if we continue to develop this technology, we'll get more personalized, bespoke medicine that we can use on patients and improve health care outcomes,\" Coller said.",
      "How is mRNA medicine so versatile?",
      "RNA stands for ribonucleic acid, an essential molecule in the body's cells. It is similar to DNA but has different functions. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, carries the information required for making proteins.",
      "As Coller put it: \"If your DNA is a cookbook, your mRNA is an individual recipe that's telling your body what to do.\"",
      "To harness that power for treating disease, \"All we're doing with this technology is giving it new recipes. We're taking advantage of this powerful natural system that exists in your body,\" he said.",
      "The versatility and potential to help such a range of illnesses is what has experts like Coller \u2014 who was not immediately impacted by the funding cuts \u2014 hoping the administration will reinstate funding for mRNA research.",
      "\"We have to keep moving forward,\" he said. \"People wanting to improve their family's lives and their children's lives is a bipartisan issue, it's truly an American issue. So we've got to keep moving.\"",

    "summary": "ULA's Vulcan is replacing the company's workhorse Atlas 5 rocket and the already-retired Delta 4 family of launchers.",
    "story": [
      "United Launch Alliance fired off its first operational Vulcan rocket Tuesday, boosting two military satellites into space in the first U.S. Space Force-sanctioned flight of a new launcher that eventually will replace the company's Atlas 5 and already-retired Deltas.",
      "Equipped with four solid-fuel strap-on boosters for additional takeoff power, the 198-foot-tall Vulcan's two methane-fueled BE-4 engines thundered to life at 8:56 p.m. EDT, instantly propelling the rocket away from pad 41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.",
      "Arcing over the Atlantic Ocean on an easterly trajectory, the Vulcan put on a spectacular sky-lighting show as it roared aloft atop nearly 3 million pounds of thrust and a jet of brilliant exhaust visible for miles around.",
      "The four strap-on boosters were jettisoned about 90 seconds after liftoff, followed three-and-a-half minutes later by burnout and separation of the Vulcan's 109-foot-tall first stage.",
      "The Centaur second stage's two hydrogen-fueled Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10C engines ignited and took over from there, but in keeping with standard policy for military missions, ULA ended its launch commentary at that point and the rest of the flight was carried out in secrecy.",
      "At least two satellites were believed to be on board: one fully classified spacecraft and an experimental satellite that will carry out tests of upgraded atomic clocks and navigation technology that could lead to more accurate, jam-proof Global Positioning System-type data for military and commercial users.",
      "Both satellites were bound for geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the equator, where spacecraft take 24 hours to complete one orbit, thus appearing stationary in the sky.",
      "GPS satellites operate in 12,500-mile-high orbits, but Navigation Technology Satellite 3, or NTS-3, will operate from its much higher perch using an advanced phased array antenna that can electronically direct signals to receivers in multiple locations across broad regions.",
      "It is the Pentagon's first experimental navigation satellite since GPS precursors were launched in the 1970s. Along with the NTS-3 satellite, designed and built by L3Harris Technologies, the program includes a ground-based control system and receivers linked by software that enable rapid reprogramming as needed for upgrades or to utilize different signals.",
      "\"GPS is such an integral part of our lives today,\" said Joanna Hinks, a senior aerospace engineer with the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. \"You probably all use it in ways that you didn't even realize throughout your morning.",
      "\"And with NTS-3, we are going to be experimenting with a number of different technologies that look at how we can continue to evolve and augment GPS to make sure that it remains the gold standard that our warfighters need.\"",
      "While the major goal of the flight is launching the USSF-106 payloads, the launch marked a major milestone for United Launch Alliance.",
      "It was the third launch of the powerful new Vulcan after two test flights last year and the first to be \"certified\" by the Space Force to carry costly national security spy satellites and other expensive military spacecraft.",
      "\"This mission is headed directly to geosynchronous orbit and will be one of our longest missions to date,\" said Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of government and commercial programs. \"This is the sole purpose of this vehicle. It was purposely designed to support these missions doing direct inject to geo for the Space Force.\"",
      "The Vulcan is replacing ULA's already-retired Delta family of rockets and the venerable Atlas 5, which is powered by a Russian-built RD-180 first stage engine. Criticism of ULA's use of Russian engines for launches of American military satellites and NASA spacecraft helped fuel congressional pressure for a new all-American launcher.",
      "Thirteen Atlas 5's are left in ULA's inventory, all of them slated for civilian launches as ULA, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, transitions to an all-Vulcan fleet.",
      "In the meantime, SpaceX dominates the world launch market with its partially reusable and highly successful kerosene-fueled Falcon 9 and triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets. So far this year, SpaceX has launched 97 Falcon 9s.",
      "But ULA President and CEO Tory Bruno said the Vulcan's first stage, using high-performance BE-4 engines provided by Blue Origin \u2014 owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 and its high-power Centaur upper stage make the rocket particularly well suited for launching heavy military payloads into hard-to-reach orbits.",
      "\"It is specifically designed for these exotic orbits that are primarily for the government,\" he said. \"And this particular mission is the quintessential example. It is a direct injection to geosynchronous orbit. That means that it is a very, very long-duration mission.\"",
      "He said the first stage is, in effect, delivering the Centaur to space with a full load of propellant \"to go from LEO (low-Earth orbit) to somewhere else, like all the way to the geo belt, which is 20 times higher up. And what that translates to in capability (is) certainly more mass and more accuracy than is easily done by others.\"",
      "While he didn't mention SpaceX or its Falcon Heavy by name, or ULA's retired Delta 4 Heavy, Bruno said \"if you're a typical three-core heavy launch vehicle and ... really derived from a vehicle optimized for that LEO mission, you're going to have to have three cores to get out there, and you're going to have to expend all of them.",
      "\"And here's the really complicated rocket science. You know, one core is cheaper and more efficient than three expendable cores. It's literally that simple.\"",
      "That, coupled with the high-energy Centaur upper stage, gives ULA the capability to launch heavy payloads directly to high orbits without requiring satellites to use their own thrusters \u2014 and limited propellant \u2014 in transit.",
      "ULA is expanding its ground infrastructure and expects to launch nine flights in 2025, reaching a cadence of two per month by the end of the year. The company expects to launch between 20 and 25 flights in 2026.",

      "The achievement is \"one of those unforgettable peaks that define great human and technological adventures,\" the SolarStratos mission said in a statement.",
      "At cruising altitude, Domjan actually crossed paths with a commercial airliner, SolarStratos said, calling the moment \"a powerful symbol of what the decarbonized aviation of tomorrow might look like.\"",
      "Domjan's flight lasted five hours and nine minutes.",
      "\"I share this moment of joy with all the people who have been preparing for this achievement for years,\" the 53-year-old said.",
      "The data will be sent to the World Air Sports Federation governing body, which will decide whether to validate the new record.",
      "\"It is the pressure altitude corrected to standard density altitude that is recognized as the official reference for aviation altitude records,\" the SolarStratos team said.",
      "Domjan \u2014 whose company bio describes him as a \"eco-adventurer\" and lecturer who pilots planes, gliders and helicopters \u2014 is aiming to be the first to take a solar-powered plane above 10,000 meters, flying at the same altitude as airliners. If that barrier is broken, the team hopes to go on and make a first manned solar-powered flight into the stratosphere, which at Switzerland's latitude begins at around 12,000 meters.",
      "\"This achievement marks a major milestone on the path toward reaching the stratosphere using only solar power -- and already fulfils the mission's goal: to capture imaginations with emblematic, spectacular challenges that promote solar energy and the protection of our biosphere and planet,\" SolarStratos said.",
      "The front-mounted single propeller plane, registration HB-SXA, is made of carbon fiber to ensure lightness and strength. SolarStratos is 9.6 meters long, and its huge wingspan of 24.8 meters accommodates the 22 square meters of high-spec solar panels topping the wings, and allows for flying at low speeds.",
      "The plane, which SolarStartos calls \"daring and finely engineered,\"\u00a0can take off at low speeds, from 50 kilometers per hour upwards. Its maximum speed is 140 kph, while its cruising speed is around 80 kph.",
      "\"Tomorrow can be better than what we have today\"",
      "In 2012, the pioneering Domjan became the first person to sail around the world in a fully solar-powered boat, a journey that began in Miami in 2010.",
      "\"It's important to demonstrate what we can achieve with solar energy,\" the adventurer told AFP.",
      "\"The dream of flight is probably the oldest dream of mankind,\" he said.",
      "\"My goal is to show to the young generation of today and tomorrow that tomorrow it will still be possible to fly without burning any fossil energies,\" he said.",
      "\"This is what we want to achieve: it's really to show that the world of tomorrow can be better than what we have today,\" he added.",
      "A warm-up flight on July 31 got to 6,589 meters, surpassing the plane's previous best in 2024.",
      "A first attempt on Friday was quickly abandoned when the forecast thermals failed to materialize, saving the batteries for Sunday when the plane got to 8,224 meters.",
      "During the first phase of record attempts, the aircraft has to make maximum use of rising warm air currents to climb to around 4,000-5,000 meters. It then has to recharge its batteries at this altitude before climbing again.",
      "Before takeoff, the batteries must be fully charged using solar energy, and the plane has to land under its own power \u2014 it cannot glide back in on zero charge \u2014 and have at least 16% charge in the batteries.",
      "If the flight is to be certified as a record, all the energy used during the flight must have been produced by the solar cells. The current record was set in 2010 by the Solar Impulse experimental plane, with Swiss pilot Andre Borschberg at the controls.",

      "It's also introducing thousands of perishable grocery items to its offerings, and will expand services to a total of 2,300 new locales by the end of 2025. The move positions Amazon as a strong competitor to Instacart and Walmart+, both of which offer same-day grocery delivery services.",
      "The new delivery offerings include options from the produce, dairy, meat, seafood, baked goods and frozen foods departments. Additionally, customers can have households goods, electronics, apparel and more, delivered on the same day that the orders are placed.",
      "The service is available to Amazon Prime members for free, for orders that total at least $25. Nonmembers are also eligible for same-day delivery, but for a $12.99 fee.",
      "According to the company, more than 150 million Americans rely on Amazon, where they've spent $100 billion on groceries and household goods in 2024 alone \u2014 which doesn't include sales from Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh.",
      "\"Overall, this expansion to offer same-day delivery of perishable groceries creates a one-stop shop for an array of customer needs,\" Telsey Advisory Group analysts said in a research note.",
      "They added, \"Importantly, we believe this is a strong move for Amazon, deepening relationships with and share of wallet among its Prime member customers, as well as positioning the company to compete better with other leaders in the grocery space, like Albertsons, Kroger, Target and Walmart.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Aug 2025 21:53:00 -0400",
    "summary": "ULA's Vulcan is replacing the company's workhorse Atlas 5 rocket and the already-retired Delta 4 family of launchers.",
    "story": [
      "United Launch Alliance fired off its first operational Vulcan rocket Tuesday, boosting two military satellites into space in the first U.S. Space Force-sanctioned flight of a new launcher that eventually will replace the company's Atlas 5 and already-retired Deltas.",
      "Equipped with four solid-fuel strap-on boosters for additional takeoff power, the 198-foot-tall Vulcan's two methane-fueled BE-4 engines thundered to life at 8:56 p.m. EDT, instantly propelling the rocket away from pad 41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.",
      "Arcing over the Atlantic Ocean on an easterly trajectory, the Vulcan put on a spectacular sky-lighting show as it roared aloft atop nearly 3 million pounds of thrust and a jet of brilliant exhaust visible for miles around.",
      "The four strap-on boosters were jettisoned about 90 seconds after liftoff, followed three-and-a-half minutes later by burnout and separation of the Vulcan's 109-foot-tall first stage.",
      "The Centaur second stage's two hydrogen-fueled Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10C engines ignited and took over from there, but in keeping with standard policy for military missions, ULA ended its launch commentary at that point and the rest of the flight was carried out in secrecy.",
      "At least two satellites were believed to be on board: one fully classified spacecraft and an experimental satellite that will carry out tests of upgraded atomic clocks and navigation technology that could lead to more accurate, jam-proof Global Positioning System-type data for military and commercial users.",
      "Both satellites were bound for geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the equator, where spacecraft take 24 hours to complete one orbit, thus appearing stationary in the sky.",
      "GPS satellites operate in 12,500-mile-high orbits, but Navigation Technology Satellite 3, or NTS-3, will operate from its much higher perch using an advanced phased array antenna that can electronically direct signals to receivers in multiple locations across broad regions.",
      "It is the Pentagon's first experimental navigation satellite since GPS precursors were launched in the 1970s. Along with the NTS-3 satellite, designed and built by L3Harris Technologies, the program includes a ground-based control system and receivers linked by software that enable rapid reprogramming as needed for upgrades or to utilize different signals.",
      "\"GPS is such an integral part of our lives today,\" said Joanna Hinks, a senior aerospace engineer with the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. \"You probably all use it in ways that you didn't even realize throughout your morning.",
      "\"And with NTS-3, we are going to be experimenting with a number of different technologies that look at how we can continue to evolve and augment GPS to make sure that it remains the gold standard that our warfighters need.\"",
      "While the major goal of the flight is launching the USSF-106 payloads, the launch marked a major milestone for United Launch Alliance.",
      "It was the third launch of the powerful new Vulcan after two test flights last year and the first to be \"certified\" by the Space Force to carry costly national security spy satellites and other expensive military spacecraft.",
      "\"This mission is headed directly to geosynchronous orbit and will be one of our longest missions to date,\" said Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of government and commercial programs. \"This is the sole purpose of this vehicle. It was purposely designed to support these missions doing direct inject to geo for the Space Force.\"",
      "The Vulcan is replacing ULA's already-retired Delta family of rockets and the venerable Atlas 5, which is powered by a Russian-built RD-180 first stage engine. Criticism of ULA's use of Russian engines for launches of American military satellites and NASA spacecraft helped fuel congressional pressure for a new all-American launcher.",
      "Thirteen Atlas 5's are left in ULA's inventory, all of them slated for civilian launches as ULA, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, transitions to an all-Vulcan fleet.",
      "In the meantime, SpaceX dominates the world launch market with its partially reusable and highly successful kerosene-fueled Falcon 9 and triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets. So far this year, SpaceX has launched 97 Falcon 9s.",
      "But ULA President and CEO Tory Bruno said the Vulcan's first stage, using high-performance BE-4 engines provided by Blue Origin \u2014 owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 and its high-power Centaur upper stage make the rocket particularly well suited for launching heavy military payloads into hard-to-reach orbits.",
      "\"It is specifically designed for these exotic orbits that are primarily for the government,\" he said. \"And this particular mission is the quintessential example. It is a direct injection to geosynchronous orbit. That means that it is a very, very long-duration mission.\"",
      "He said the first stage is, in effect, delivering the Centaur to space with a full load of propellant \"to go from LEO (low-Earth orbit) to somewhere else, like all the way to the geo belt, which is 20 times higher up. And what that translates to in capability (is) certainly more mass and more accuracy than is easily done by others.\"",
      "While he didn't mention SpaceX or its Falcon Heavy by name, or ULA's retired Delta 4 Heavy, Bruno said \"if you're a typical three-core heavy launch vehicle and ... really derived from a vehicle optimized for that LEO mission, you're going to have to have three cores to get out there, and you're going to have to expend all of them.",
      "\"And here's the really complicated rocket science. You know, one core is cheaper and more efficient than three expendable cores. It's literally that simple.\"",
      "That, coupled with the high-energy Centaur upper stage, gives ULA the capability to launch heavy payloads directly to high orbits without requiring satellites to use their own thrusters \u2014 and limited propellant \u2014 in transit.",
      "ULA is expanding its ground infrastructure and expects to launch nine flights in 2025, reaching a cadence of two per month by the end of the year. The company expects to launch between 20 and 25 flights in 2026.",

      "Hurricane Erin was on a path to head up the Atlantic Ocean and likely bring \"life-threatening surf and rip currents\" across the U.S. East Coast this week, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Monday. The hurricane wasn't expected to make landfall in the U.S. or neighboring island nations.",
      "Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, strengthened back into a Category 4 storm Sunday night as it churned over the Atlantic Ocean north of the Caribbean. It\u00a0exploded to a Category 5 on Saturday before weakening to a Category 3 early Sunday morning, then regaining strength again later in the day.",
      "As of 2 p.m. EDT Monday, Erin had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph. The storm's center was about 140 miles north of Grand Turk Island, the capital island of Turks and Caicos, and about 850 miles south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. It was moving west-northwest at 10 mph. A\u00a0Category 4 hurricane\u00a0is defined as having maximum sustained winds from 130 mph to 156 mph and is considered a major storm, capable of causing catastrophic damage.",
      "Maps show Hurricane Erin's forecast path",
      "Erin is a large storm that's expected to remain powerful for the next several days, forecasters said.",
      "The center of the storm was expected to pass to the east of the southeastern Bahamas on Monday, turn to the north Tuesday and move between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast by the middle of the week, the hurricane center said.",
      "Some additional strengthening was possible Monday. \"Erin is likely to remain a dangerous major hurricane through the middle of this week,\" forecasters said.",
      "Erin's hurricane-force winds extended outward up to 80 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extended up to 230 miles from the center, forecasters said.",
      "Tropical storm warnings were in effect for Turks and Caicos and the southeast Bahamas, the hurricane center said. The Bahamian government issued a tropical storm watch for the central Bahamas. A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, while a watch means they are possible.",

      "How will Hurricane Erin affect the U.S.?",
      "Erin is not forecast to hit the U.S. directly, but coastal areas along the Eastern Seaboard will feel its effects with dangerous rip currents and high waves of over 20 feet over the next several days.",
      "\"These rough ocean conditions will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip currents,\" the hurricane center warned.",

      "\"It's just not going to be a very safe environment to be in the ocean,\" Brennan said Monday.",
      "North Carolina's Outer Banks, in particular, should monitor the progress of Erin, the hurricane center advised, noting that in addition to rip currents, there is a risk of strong winds associated with the outer rainbands during the middle part of the week. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for\u00a0Hatteras Island and\u00a0Ocracoke Island.",
      "Along the Outer Banks, the National Weather Service warned of the potential for severe flooding to reach buildings and roads. Many roadways will likely be under several feet of water and inaccessible for several days due to the flooding.",
      "First hurricane of the Atlantic season",
      "Erin formed as a tropical storm\u00a0last week west of the island nation of Cabo Verde, a few hundred miles off Africa's western coast. It is the fifth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which started in June and runs through November. Erin strengthened to a hurricane on Friday.",
      "So far this year, Tropical Storm Chantal is the only one to have made landfall in the U.S., bringing deadly flooding to North Carolina in early July. In June, Barry made landfall as a tropical depression on Mexico's eastern coast.",
      "Erin's increased strength comes as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its peak in September. According to the hurricane center, most of the season's activity typically happens between mid-August and mid-October. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, hurricane season starts on May 15 with a peak in activity typically seen in late August.",

      "The civilian workforce in America is around 170 million people strong as of June 2025, data from Statista shows. While there's no cap on the number of hours Americans can work per week, federal law mandates that workers be paid a minimum wage.",
      "That wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009. However, many cities and states across the country have passed legislation to enforce higher minimums adjusted for today's cost of living. Most recently in July, the minimum wage was raised in 15 states and cities.",

      "The Texas House of Representatives gaveled in at noon Monday with Democratic members present, marking an official end to the quorum break that froze the Legislature for two weeks.",
      "Most of the House Democratic Caucus left the state earlier this month, denying the Republican majority the required attendance to conduct business. House rules require 100 members to be present; Republicans hold 88 seats.",
      "The Democratic quorum break was triggered by a Republican push to redraw the state's U.S. House district maps that would net the GOP up to five more seats in the 2026 midterm elections. Last week, the absent lawmakers had signaled they were ready to return to Austin after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott ended a first special session and Democrats in California moved forward with a plan to respond.",
      "\"Our return allows us to build the legal record necessary to defeat this racist map in court, take our message to communities across the state and country, and inspire legislators across the country how to fight these undemocratic redistricting schemes in their own statehouses,\" state Rep. Gene Wu, the Democratic leader, said in a statement issued Monday morning.",
      "As the House returned to business, the redistricting proposal and dozens of other bills were referred to their respective committees. The redistricting committee is expected to meet on Tuesday. The Senate's redistricting committee passed the proposed maps along party lines on Sunday evening.",
      "Redistricting fight spreads",
      "Abbott put redistricting on the agenda at the urging of President Donald Trump, who wants to shore up Republicans' narrow U.S. House majority to avoid losing control of the chamber, and with it, prospects for Trump's conservative agenda in the later part of his term.",
      "It is unusual for redistricting to take place in the middle of the decade and typically occurs once at the beginning of each decade to coincide with the census.",
      "In response to the efforts in Texas, California Democrats are also moving ahead with their own reshaping of congressional districts to counteract Texas, putting in motion a potentially widening and unusually timed redistricting battle nationwide.",
      "Many states, including Texas, give legislators the power to draw maps. California is among those that empower independent commissions with the task.",
      "The nation's two most populous states have been at the forefront of the resulting battle, which has reached into multiple courtrooms and statehouses controlled by both parties.",
      "Impact on midterm elections",
      "On a national level, the partisan makeup of existing district lines puts Democrats within three seats of a majority. Of the 435 total House seats, only several dozen districts are competitive. So even slight changes in a few states could affect which party wins control.",
      "Texas' maps would aim to give the GOP five more winnable seats.",
      "California Democrats, who hold supermajorities in both chambers \u2014 enough to act without any Republican votes \u2014 on Friday unveiled a proposal that could give Democrats there an additional five U.S. House seats. But any changes would first need the approval of state lawmakers and voters. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom has said that his state will hold a Nov. 4 special referendum on the redrawn districts.",

      "\"Internet culture is changing the English language and the effect is fascinating to observe and capture in the Dictionary,\" Colin McIntosh, the lexical program manager at Cambridge Dictionary, said in a statement.",
      "There have been a total of 6,212 words added, the dictionary said. A number of them have been linked to celebrities or public officials, and others have been popularized by Gen Z and Gen Alpha.",
      "\"We only add words where we think they'll have staying power,\" McIntosh said.",
      "Here are some of the newly added words and their meanings, according to Cambridge Dictionary:",
      "skibidi",
      "Skibidi was coined by the creator of \"Skibidi Toilet,\" an animated YouTube series. It became popular on social media, leading to phrases like \"What the skibidi are you doing?\" and \"That wasn't very skibidi rizz of you.\"",
      "Cambridge Dictionary defines skibidi as \"a word that can have different meanings such as 'cool' or 'bad,' or can be used with no real meaning as a joke.\"",
      "delulu",
      "Delulu, a play on the word delusional, means \"believing things that are not real or true, usually because you choose to.\"",
      "The word has even reached political discourse: Earlier this year, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, \"They are delulu with no solulu.\"",
      "Tradwife",
      "Tradwife \"reflects a growing, controversial Instagram and TikTok trend that embraces traditional gender roles,\" Cambridge Dictionary says. Short for traditional wife, it is \"a married woman, especially one who posts on social media, who stays at home doing cooking, cleaning, etc. and has children that she takes care of.\"",
      "Broligarchy",
      "Broligarchy, combining bro and oligarchy, is defined as \"a small group of men, especially men owning or involved in a technology business, who are extremely rich and powerful, and who have or want political influence.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:43:11 -0400",
    "summary": "Incomes are still trailing inflation four years after the pandemic-era surge in prices, causing a financial pinch for many households.",
    "story": [
      "Wages still haven't caught up with inflation, four years after the pandemic caused prices to soar and created a cost-of-living crisis for many households, a new study finds.",
      "Americans on average are earning 1.2 percentage points below the rise in the cost of living over the past four years, which means that the typical worker's pay increases over that time haven't yet caught up to higher prices, according to Bankrate's 2025 Wage to Inflation Index.",
      "The findings come as Americans remain sour about the economy, with 55% rating it as either very or fairly bad, according to a July poll from CBS News. Three-quarters said their incomes haven't kept up with inflation, while a majority also said they've seen prices creep higher in recent weeks and also expect that to continue.",
      "But some professions are falling further behind than others, with educators seeing the biggest gap between income growth and inflation during the past four years, the study found. Teachers have long struggled with a \"wage gap,\" meaning that they typically earn less than college graduates working in other fields, due to issues such as constraints on school funding,\u00a0according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.",
      "\"Wage growth is often a reflection of who has the power in the labor market,\" Bankrate economic analyst Sarah Foster told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If there are more job openings than workers to fill them, businesses will often lift pay to retain or attract talent.\"",
      "She added, \"On the flip side, if there are too few job openings, companies don't have to work as hard to keep workers because they have nowhere to really go.\"",
      "Overall, the 1.2 percentage point gap between the typical workers' pay growth and inflation during the past four years signals that many households are continuing to feel financial strain, Foster added. Even before the pandemic, millions of Americans were\u00a0struggling to save for emergencies.",
      "\"Wages not keeping up with inflation translate to outright purchasing-power destruction,\" Foster said. \"These are funds that households could be using to stash away for their goals, like saving for retirement and a home, or building up their safety nets and emergency fund.\"",
      "The professions that have outpaced inflation include those that saw a spike in demand after the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality workers, she added. \"Health care, meanwhile, is driving job growth lately, accounting for 88% of private-sector payroll growth last month,\" Foster said.",
      "Wage dissatisfaction",
      "Only about 54% of Americans say they are satisfied with their current wages, according to a new analysis from Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That represents the lowest satisfaction level since the NY Fed began tracking the measure in 2014.",
      "Even high-income households, which contribute about\u00a0half of all consumer spending\u00a0and drive economic growth, are facing bigger financial hurdles, including surging delinquencies on credit cards and auto loans, according to recent research.",
      "For instance, the share of all new jobs that pay above-average wages has fallen to 7% this year, down from 38% prior to 2020, according to credit-scoring company VantageScore. That can make it tougher for professionals to find new jobs if they suffer a job loss, the group noted.",
      "Workers in white-collar industries like finance and business services \"speak of a frozen job market,\" Foster noted. \"Employed workers in the sector can't find anywhere else to go and unemployed workers struggle to find new work.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:40:58 -0400",
    "summary": "Newsmax will pay $67 million to settle a lawsuit accusing it of defaming the voting equipment company Dominion Voting Systems over its role in the 2020 election.",
    "story": [
      "The conservative network Newsmax will pay $67 million to settle a lawsuit accusing it of defaming a voting equipment company by spreading lies about President Trump's 2020 election loss, according to documents filed Monday. The suit against Newsmax was brought by Dominion Voting Systems, which alleged the network published false and defamatory statements claiming the company rigged the election. A Delaware judge ruled partially in favor of Dominion in a decision earlier this year, additional court filings show.",
      "The settlement comes after Fox News Channel paid $787.5 million\u00a0to settle a similar lawsuit in 2023 and Newsmax paid what court papers describe as $40 million to settle a libel lawsuit from a different voting machine manufacturer, Smartmatic, which also was a target of pro-Trump conspiracy theories on the network.",
      "Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis had ruled earlier that Newsmax did indeed defame Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems by airing false information about the company and its equipment. But Davis left it to a jury to eventually decide whether that was done with malice, and, if so, how much Dominion deserved from Newsmax in damages. Newsmax and Dominion reached a settlement before the trial could take place.",
      "In a statement to CBS News on Monday, a Dominion spokesperson said the company was \"pleased to have settled this matter.\"",
      "The settlement originally came to light in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing by Newsmax, which was dated Friday, Aug. 15, the day that a deal was reached, according to the document. Newsmax has agreed to pay the settlement in three installments of $27 million, $20 million and $20 million, with the final installment to be paid in January 2027, the filing said.",
      "Newsmax continues to deny allegations that suggest its coverage of Dominion in the context of the 2020 election was defamatory.",
      "\"Newsmax believed it was critically important for the American people to hear both sides of the election disputes that arose in 2020,\" the company said in a statement published on its website. \"We stand by our coverage as fair, balanced, and conducted within professional standards of journalism.\"",
      "The disclosure of the settlement came as Mr. Trump, who lost his 2020 reelection bid to former President Joe Biden, vowed in a social media post Monday to eliminate mail-in ballots and voting machines, such as those supplied by Dominion and other companies, ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. It was unclear how the Republican president could achieve that.",
      "\"I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, and also, while we're at it, Highly 'Inaccurate,' Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES, which cost Ten Times more than accurate and sophisticated Watermark Paper, which is faster, and leaves NO DOUBT, at the end of the evening, as to who WON, and who LOST, the Election,\" Mr. Trump wrote in the post.",
      "The same judge also handled the Dominion-Fox News case and made a similar ruling that the network repeated numerous lies by Mr. Trump's allies about his 2020 loss, despite internal communications showing Fox officials knew the claims were bogus. At the time, Davis found it was \"CRYSTAL clear\" that none of the allegations was true.",
      "Internal correspondence from Newsmax officials likewise shows they knew the claims were baseless.",
      "\"How long are we going to play along with election fraud?\" Newsmax host Bob Sellers said two days after the 2020 election was called for Biden, according to internal documents revealed as part of the case.",
      "Newsmax took pride that it was not calling the election for Biden, and internal documents show it saw a business opportunity in catering to viewers who believed Mr. Trump won. Private communications that surfaced as part of Dominion's earlier defamation case against Fox News also revealed how the network's business interests intersected with decisions it made related to coverage of Mr. Trump's 2020 election claims.",
      "At Newsmax, employees repeatedly warned against false allegations from pro-Trump guests such as attorney Sidney Powell, according to documents in the lawsuit. In one text, even Newsmax owner Chris Ruddy, a Trump ally, said he found it \"scary\" that Mr. Trump was meeting with Powell.",
      "Dominion was at the heart of many of the wild claims aired by guests on Newsmax and elsewhere, who promoted a conspiracy theory involving deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to rig the machines for Biden. The network retracted some of the more bombastic allegations in December 2020.",
      "Though Mr. Trump has insisted his fraud claims are real, there's no evidence they were, and the lawsuits in the Fox and Newsmax cases show how some of the president's biggest supporters knew they were false at the time. Mr. Trump's then-attorney general, William Barr, said there was no evidence of widespread fraud.",
      "Mr. Trump and his backers lost dozens of lawsuits alleging fraud, some before Trump-appointed judges. Numerous recounts, reviews and audits of the election results, including some run by Republicans, turned up no signs of significant wrongdoing or error and affirmed Biden's win.",
      "After returning to office, Mr. Trump pardoned those who tried to halt the transfer of power during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and directed his Department of Justice to investigate Chris Krebs, a former Trump cybersecurity appointee who had vouched for the security and accuracy of the 2020 election.",
      "As an initial trial date approached in the Dominion case earlier this year, Mr. Trump issued an executive order attacking the law firm that litigated it and the Fox case, Susman Godfrey. The order, part of a series targeting law firms that Mr. Trump has tussled with, cited Susman Godfrey's work on elections and said the government would not do business with any of its clients or permit any of its staff in federal buildings.",
      "A federal judge put that action on hold, saying the framers would view it as \"a shocking abuse of power.\"",

      "The Texas measles outbreak\u00a0that sickened hundreds of people earlier this year is officially over, according to state health officials.",
      "The Texas Department of State Health Services declared in a\u00a0news release\u00a0Monday the end of this year's measles outbreak centered in West Texas, after more than 42 days passed since any new reported case in counties with previous evidence of ongoing transmission.",
      "\"DSHS will continue to monitor for new cases but will cease updating the interactive outbreak dashboard,\" the statement said, adding 42 days with no new cases is when public health professionals consider an outbreak over because it is double the disease's maximum incubation period.",
      "Since the outbreak began in late January, 762 cases of measles have been confirmed in Texas, with more than two-thirds of them among children.\u00a0Two children\u00a0who were not vaccinated died.",
      "\"I want to highlight the tireless work of the public health professionals across the state who contributed to the containment of one of the most contagious viruses. We arrived at this point through a comprehensive outbreak response that included testing, vaccination, disease monitoring and educating the public about measles through awareness campaigns,\" DSHS Commissioner Dr. Jennife Shuford said in the release. \"I also want to recognize the many health care professionals who identified and treated cases of a virus that most providers had never seen in person before this outbreak.\"",
      "Though the outbreak is declared over in the state, the release warned that there are still ongoing outbreaks in the United States and it is \"likely that there will be additional cases of measles this year in Texas.\"",
      "\"Health care providers should continue to be vigilant and test for measles if their patient has symptoms compatible with the virus,\" the release stated.",
      "Measles\u00a0is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases, can cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say\u00a0the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0highly safe and effective.",
      "In 2025, the United States has recorded the most\u00a0measles cases\u00a0in more than 30 years, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows, with more than 1,300 infections confirmed in at least 39 states.",

The second data breach, announced in\u00a0July 2024, involved hackers unlawfully downloading AT&T data from a third-party cloud platform, exposing the records of calls and texts of \"nearly all\" of AT&T's cellular customers.",
      "Multiple lawsuits were filed in state and federal courts across the country after both incidents, which were ultimately consolidated into two class-action cases.",
      "Following a ruling from a federal judge, the settlement administration for AT&T\u00a0said on Aug. 4 that a proposed settlement has been reached for $177 million, with $149 million earmarked for the first settlement class and $28 million set aside for the second settlement class.",
      "The settlement, however, still has to be approved. According to the settlement website, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas will hold a final approval hearing on Dec. 3, 2025. In the meantime, impacted AT&T customers can file for compensation.",

Customers can also mail the form to AT&T Data Incident Settlement, c/o Kroll Settlement Administration LLC, P.O. Box 5324, New York, NY 10150-5324. It must be postmarked by November 18.",
      "As stated on the settlement website, if you file a claim, you give up your right to sue AT&T.",
      "How much will I get?",
      "People whose data was exposed in the breach announced in March 2024 are eligible for up to $5,000 and can make claims for \"payment for losses that occurred in 2019, or later,\" according to the settlement website.",
      "Those who were part of the second breach announced in July of last year are eligible for up to $2,500 \"for losses that occurred on or after April 14, 2024,\" the settlement administration said.",
      "In both cases, customers must provide documentation showing that the losses they incurred are \"fairly traceable\" to the AT&T data breaches. Proof can include receipts and other documents \"not self-prepared by the claimant that documents the costs incurred,\" according to the settlement website.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday as the U.S. pursues a long-lasting peace agreement to end Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the meeting early Saturday, following his\u00a0summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. In a post on Truth Social, the president said the meeting with Putin \"went very well,\" adding that the same was true of a phone call with Zelenskyy and various European leaders after the fact.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy will be coming to D.C., the Oval Office, on Monday afternoon,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin.\"",
      "European and NATO leaders are expected to accompany Zelenskyy to Washington, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said she was joining at \"the request of President Zelenskyy.\"",
      "Though the nearly three-hour-long meeting between the U.S. and Russian presidents on Friday failed to produce the ceasefire that Mr. Trump had sought, the administration has since pivoted to seeking a broader peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. The decision to abandon a ceasefire was at odds with the goals of the U.S. and European allies heading into the summit, and some analysts say the shift could give Putin more leverage at the negotiating table.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that \"both sides are going to have to make concessions\" to get there.",
      "\"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again,\" Rubio said, noting that doing so would require both sides \"to give.\"",
      "The secretary of state, who attended Friday's summit meeting with Putin, indicated that enough progress was made to sit down with Zelenskyy to \"narrow the gap between the two sides.\"",
      "Rubio said the details of security guarantees for Ukraine, the question of territories and the issue of rebuilding the country still need to be discussed and \"require some more specificity.\"",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday that Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and Europe to offer \"game-changing\" security guarantees, including a possible arrangement in which the allies provide \"Article 5-like protection\" to Ukraine. Article 5 of the NATO charter says an attack on one member nation is considered an attack against all. Putin has been vehemently opposed to Ukraine joining NATO, but a similar security guarantee outside the framework of the alliance might reassure Kyiv that Russia would be deterred from attacking in the future.",
      "Witkoff noted that the administration intends to discuss a possible land swap at Monday's meeting.",
      "\"We're not waiting a week for a meeting with Zelenskyy and the European leaders,\" Witkoff said. \"We are intent on trying to hammer out a peace deal that ends the fighting permanently, very, very quickly. Quicker than a ceasefire.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post Sunday night, Mr. Trump said, \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!\" Mr. Trump was referring to Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea in early 2014.",
      "In a\u00a0post on X, Zelenskyy said he'd arrived in Washington for the talks and insisted, \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace.\"",
      "Ahead of Monday's meeting, Russian attacks on Ukraine continued, with a wave of air strikes hitting cities around the country, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa and Sumy, CBS News partner network BBC News reported. Ukrainian authorities said a drone attack on a residential area in the city of Kharkiv overnight killed a toddler, a 16-year-old and five other people.",
      "\"Despite all of the diplomacy and peace efforts, Russia continues to kill civilians,\" Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrii Sybiha said in a social media post. \"Russia is a murderous war machine that Ukraine is holding back. And it must be stopped through transatlantic unity and pressure. Moscow must stop the killing in order to advance diplomacy.\"",
      "Russian state media reported Ukraine had carried out a drone attack in Donetsk, overnight which killed a 62-year-old woman.",
      "Monday's meeting between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy comes months after a contentious February Oval Office meeting between the two leaders and Vice President JD Vance exposed a severe rift, with tensions erupting on camera as Vance accused Zelenskyy of ingratitude. In recent months, Mr. Trump's posture appeared to shift as he expressed frustration with Putin over Russia's ongoing drone and missile attacks, including what Ukraine described as the largest such attacks since the invasion began in February 2022.",

      "Washington \u2014 Former Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown announced a bid to once again represent Ohio in the Senate on Monday, nearly a year after his reelection effort in 2024 fell short.",
      "\"I didn't plan to run for office again. But when I see what's going on, I know I can do something about it for Ohio,\" Brown said in a video announcement. \"That's why I'm running for Senate, because even in these challenging times, I still believe if you stand up for workers, treat people with respect, and always fight for Ohio, you can actually make a difference.\"",
      "Brown, 72, lost his bid for a fourth term in the upper chamber last November against GOP challenger Sen. Bernie Moreno. Brown was the sole Democrat holding statewide office in Ohio and was one of the key targets for Republicans in the 2024 election in which they took control of the Senate.",
      "Brown had historically appealed to ticket-splitters with his strong working-class brand in the state, which he had represented in the Senate since 2007. But President Trump won Ohio by more than 10 percentage points, making Brown's election a steep uphill climb. Moreno beat him by less than four points.",
      "In 2026, Brown is set to face off against Sen. Jon Husted, a Republican who was appointed to fill Ohio's other Senate seat, which Vice President JD Vance vacated. The special election will determine who will serve the remainder of Vance's term, meaning the winner would have to run for election again in 2028.",
      "Husted, 57, was appointed in January by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, and previously served as DeWine's lieutenant governor.",
      "The Ohio race is expected to be a tough battle for Democrats, as the party seeks to retake the majority in the Senate. With 53 Republicans in the upper chamber, Democrats would need to defend seats in a handful of potentially competitive states, while flipping four seats to retake a majority in 2026.",
      "While few races appear comfortably in range, Democrats have been working to recruit formidable candidates, like former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, to boost their chances. Brown's entrance into the race marks the latest recruiting victory for the party.",

    "summary": "Miners want to return to the treasured landscape, promising an economic boost while raising fears of how modern gold extraction could forever change the region.",
    "story": [
      "A gold rush brought settlers to South Dakota's Black Hills roughly 150 years ago, chasing the dream of wealth and displacing Native Americans in the process.",
      "Now, a new crop of miners driven by gold prices at more than $3,000 an ounce are seeking to return to the treasured landscape, promising an economic boost while raising fears of how modern gold extraction could forever change the region.",
      "\"These impacts can be long term and make it so that tourism and outdoor recreation is negatively impacted,\" said Lilias Jarding, executive director of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance. \"Our enjoyment of the Black Hills as a peaceful place, a sacred place, is disturbed.\"",
      "The Black Hills encompass over 1.2 million acres, rising up from the Great Plains in southwest South Dakota and extending into Wyoming. The jagged peaks are smaller than those of the Rocky Mountains, but the lush pine-covered hills are sacred to the Lakota Sioux people and serve as a destination for millions of tourists who visit Mount Rushmore and state parks.",
      "Dramatic landscape changes come with modern mining",
      "One gold mine now operates in the Black Hills, but companies have proposals before state and federal agencies for another one, plus exploratory drilling sites that they hope will lead to full-fledged mines. That has prompted opposition by Native American tribes and environmentalists who argue the projects are close to sacred sites, will contaminate waterways and permanently scar the landscape.",
      "Gold extraction has changed dramatically in the decades since prospectors first began panning for gold in the Black Hills. The industry now typically relies on massive trucks and diggers that create deep, multitiered pits and use chemicals like cyanide to extract the gold.",
      "The land can never return to its original state. The Homestake mine, once the largest and deepest gold mine in the Western Hemisphere, now sits barren in Lead, South Dakota, and is used for scientific research.",
      "Interest in Black Hills gold mining has soared along with the price of the metal. When the Homestake mine closed in 2002, gold sold for about $300 an ounce. Now it goes for about 10 times as much.",
      "Joseph Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council, attributes the price spike to global economic uncertainty.",
      "\"Gold tends to be a stable asset,\" he said. \"That actually performs well in inflationary times, and holds its value in recessionary times. That's why gold as an asset in investment.\"",
      "President Trump also boosted the industry by issuing an executive order in March to increase American mineral production, calling for expedited permitting and reviews.",
      "Colin Paterson, professor emeritus of geological engineering at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, notes that Black Hills gold is encased in rock. To extract it, the rock is crushed and then a chemical like cyanide is used to dissolve the mineral and remove it.",
      "Mining brings revenue, but renews Black Hills fight",
      "Coeur Mining runs the single active mine in the Black Hills, but the company Dakota Gold has plans for an open pit mine to begin operating in 2029. The company is also targeting the area near the old Homestake site to build an underground mine where workers would descend hundreds or even thousands of feet into shafts.",
      "According to data provided by Dakota Gold, they believe the net present value for the deposits could range from $1.6 billion to $2.1 billion, CBS affiliate KELO-TV reported last month.",
      "Jack Henris, president and chief operating officer of Dakota Gold, estimated the open pit mine would create up to 250 jobs and result in the company paying the state up to $400 million in taxes over the life of the mine. Dakota Gold will conduct an environmental study and surveys of soil and vegetation to ensure safe operation, Henris said.",
      "\"Most of the people that work here are from this area and just love to live here,\" he said. \"So we're a big part of the Hills and we love them just as much as other folks.\"",
      "To a great extent, gold mining helped create the modern Black Hills region.",
      "The U.S. government signed a treaty in 1868 that recognized the Sioux Nation's right to the Black Hills, but the government seized the land after the discovery of gold and allowed settlers into the region. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled the Sioux were entitled to compensation, but they have not accepted any and maintain their claim to the land.",
      "Tribes have largely opposed mining in the Black Hills.",
      "\"There's a central truth about mining in the Black Hills in that it was never the most mineral rich place there ever was,\" said Taylor Gunhammer, local organizer with the Indigenous advocacy group NDN Collective and an Oglala Sioux, one of the Lakota people. \"It's not even the actual mineral content of the Black Hills that is so attractive to mining companies. It's the permissive nature of the officials who oversee mining.\"",
      "Some proposed projects, such as Dakota Gold's mine, are on private land and only subject to state rules, not the U.S. Forest Service regulations required for projects on public acreage.",
      "Environmentalists have focused their opposition on the possibility of chemicals leaks. They note that Coeur's Wharf mine has had nearly 200 spills and that the former Homestake mine was closed because it contaminated a nearby creek.",
      "Coeur's environmental manager, Jasmine McCauley, said in a statement that each spill was \"thoroughly investigated, mitigated, and corrective actions are put in place to prevent reoccurrence.\" The company is always improving its processes, she added.",
      "Lakota People's Law Project\u00a0and the\u00a0Black Hills Clean Water Alliance have also voiced opposition to the proposed drilling and mining for gold in the area, KELO-TV reported.",
      "Jarding, of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance, said she remains concerned about the number of projects in the works.",
      "\"It's really important that people understand the exponential growth in mining activity that's been happening in the Black Hills over the last five years or so,\" Jarding said. \"There are currently active mining claims on 271,000 acres in the Black Hills. That's 20% of the whole Black Hills that is potentially going to be subject to mining.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Trump to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday.",
      "\"We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,\" he told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" He added that it \"was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that\" and called it \"game-changing.\"",
      "Article 5, at the heart of the 32-member military alliance, states that an armed attack against one or more of the members shall be considered an attack against all members.",
      "Witkoff, who had joined Secretary of State Marco Rubio for the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, offered few details on how such an agreement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his long-standing objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership.",
      "Outlining some of the details about the private discussions, Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not \"go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty. And there was plenty more.\"",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at a news conference in Brussels with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, applauded the move. \"We welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine and the 'Coalition of the willing' \u2014 including the European Union \u2014 is ready to do its share,\" she said.",
      "Zelenskyy thanked the United States for recent signals that Washington was willing to support such guarantees, but said much was unclear.",
      "\"It is important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine,\" he said, \"But there are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do, and this is our main task, we need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO, and we consider EU accession to be part of the security guarantees.\"",
      "Witkoff defended Mr. Trump's decision to abandon his push that Russian agree to an immediate ceasefire, which the president had set as a benchmark going into the meeting. Witkoff said the Republican president had pivoted toward a peace deal because so much progress was made.",
      "\"We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,\" Witkoff said, without elaborating. \"We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal.\"",
      "Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he did not believe imposing new U.S. sanctions on Russia would force Putin to accept a ceasefire.",
      "\"If he did this now, the moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks,\" Rubio said. \"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here.\"",
      "Rubio said that Kyiv \"is going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too.\"",
      "\"For example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security,\" Rubio said. \"That's not an unreasonable request. That's something that needs to be worked on.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Sunday wrote on social media, \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!\"",
      "Zelenskyy and European leaders, who heard from Mr. Trump after the summit, are scheduled to meet with him at the White House on Monday.",
      "Rubio said of the talks with Russia, \"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"",
      "Zelenskyy on Sunday night said on social media that he had arrived in Washington, D.C., for Monday's meeting, but pushed back on the Trump administration's comments about ceding territory to Russia.",
      "\"We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably. And peace must be lasting. Not like it was years ago, when Ukraine was forced to give up Crimea and part of our East\u2014part of Donbas\u2014and Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack,\" Zelenskyy wrote, adding \"Crimea should not have been given up then, just as Ukrainians did not give up Kyiv, Odesa, or Kharkiv after 2022.\"",
      "\"I am confident that we will defend Ukraine, effectively guarantee security, and that our people will always be grateful to President Trump, everyone in America, and every partner and ally for their support and invaluable assistance,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace. Thank you!\"",

      "Hurricane Erin was on a path to head up the Atlantic Ocean and likely bring \"life-threatening surf and rip currents\" across the U.S. East Coast this week, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Monday. The hurricane wasn't expected to make landfall in the U.S. or neighboring island nations.",
      "Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, strengthened back into a Category 4 storm Sunday night as it churned over the Atlantic Ocean north of the Caribbean. It\u00a0exploded to a Category 5 on Saturday before weakening to a Category 3 early Sunday morning, then regaining strength again later in the day.",
      "As of 2 p.m. EDT Monday, Erin had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph. The storm's center was about 140 miles north of Grand Turk Island, the capital island of Turks and Caicos, and about 850 miles south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. It was moving west-northwest at 10 mph. A\u00a0Category 4 hurricane\u00a0is defined as having maximum sustained winds from 130 mph to 156 mph and is considered a major storm, capable of causing catastrophic damage.",
      "Maps show Hurricane Erin's forecast path",
      "Erin is a large storm that's expected to remain powerful for the next several days, forecasters said.",
      "The center of the storm was expected to pass to the east of the southeastern Bahamas on Monday, turn to the north Tuesday and move between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast by the middle of the week, the hurricane center said.",
      "Some additional strengthening was possible Monday. \"Erin is likely to remain a dangerous major hurricane through the middle of this week,\" forecasters said.",
      "Erin's hurricane-force winds extended outward up to 80 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extended up to 230 miles from the center, forecasters said.",
      "Tropical storm warnings were in effect for Turks and Caicos and the southeast Bahamas, the hurricane center said. The Bahamian government issued a tropical storm watch for the central Bahamas. A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, while a watch means they are possible.",
      "Hurricane Erin's \"spaghetti models\"",
      "A \"spaghetti map\" of the forecast models shows the storm skirting the Caribbean islands and remaining well offshore of the U.S. East Coast as it moves north and curves back over the Atlantic.",
      "A high-pressure system in the Atlantic was expected to steer Erin away from the U.S. coast while a cold front was also forecast to push the hurricane offshore, CBS News Bay Area meteorologist Jessica Burch reported.",
      "How will Hurricane Erin affect the U.S.?",
      "Erin is not forecast to hit the U.S. directly, but coastal areas along the Eastern Seaboard will feel its effects with dangerous rip currents and high waves of over 20 feet over the next several days.",
      "\"These rough ocean conditions will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip currents,\" the hurricane center warned.",
      "Mike Brennan, the hurricane center's director, said the dangerous conditions were expected to last for much of the week across almost the entire East Coast. He urged people to heed any warnings from local officials.",
      "\"It's just not going to be a very safe environment to be in the ocean,\" Brennan said Monday.",
      "North Carolina's Outer Banks, in particular, should monitor the progress of Erin, the hurricane center advised, noting that in addition to rip currents, there is a risk of strong winds associated with the outer rainbands during the middle part of the week. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for\u00a0Hatteras Island and\u00a0Ocracoke Island.",
      "Along the Outer Banks, the National Weather Service warned of the potential for severe flooding to reach buildings and roads. Many roadways will likely be under several feet of water and inaccessible for several days due to the flooding.",
      "First hurricane of the Atlantic season",
      "Erin formed as a tropical storm\u00a0last week west of the island nation of Cabo Verde, a few hundred miles off Africa's western coast. It is the fifth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which started in June and runs through November. Erin strengthened to a hurricane on Friday.",
      "So far this year, Tropical Storm Chantal is the only one to have made landfall in the U.S., bringing deadly flooding to North Carolina in early July. In June, Barry made landfall as a tropical depression on Mexico's eastern coast.",
      "Erin's increased strength comes as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its peak in September. According to the hurricane center, most of the season's activity typically happens between mid-August and mid-October. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, hurricane season starts on May 15 with a peak in activity typically seen in late August.",

      "Driven by social media and celebrities, Cambridge Dictionary has added thousands of new words over the last 12 months. Among the new entries are skibidi, delulu, tradwife and broligarchy.",
      "\"Internet culture is changing the English language and the effect is fascinating to observe and capture in the Dictionary,\" Colin McIntosh, the lexical program manager at Cambridge Dictionary, said in a statement.",
      "There have been a total of 6,212 words added, the dictionary said. A number of them have been linked to celebrities or public officials, and others have been popularized by Gen Z and Gen Alpha.",
      "\"We only add words where we think they'll have staying power,\" McIntosh said.",
      "Here are some of the newly added words and their meanings, according to Cambridge Dictionary:",
      "skibidi",
      "Skibidi was coined by the creator of \"Skibidi Toilet,\" an animated YouTube series. It became popular on social media, leading to phrases like \"What the skibidi are you doing?\" and \"That wasn't very skibidi rizz of you.\"",
      "Cambridge Dictionary defines skibidi as \"a word that can have different meanings such as 'cool' or 'bad,' or can be used with no real meaning as a joke.\"",
      "delulu",
      "Delulu, a play on the word delusional, means \"believing things that are not real or true, usually because you choose to.\"",
      "The word has even reached political discourse: Earlier this year, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, \"They are delulu with no solulu.\"",
      "Tradwife",
      "Tradwife \"reflects a growing, controversial Instagram and TikTok trend that embraces traditional gender roles,\" Cambridge Dictionary says. Short for traditional wife, it is \"a married woman, especially one who posts on social media, who stays at home doing cooking, cleaning, etc. and has children that she takes care of.\"",
      "Broligarchy",
      "Broligarchy, combining bro and oligarchy, is defined as \"a small group of men, especially men owning or involved in a technology business, who are extremely rich and powerful, and who have or want political influence.\"",
      "This word was used to describe the group of tech leaders, such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, who attended President Trump's inauguration in January.",
      "lewk",
      "Used often on social media, lewk is a play on the word look and means \"a particular style, fashion, or outfit, especially one that is unusual and impressive.\"",
      "inspo",
      "Also popular on social media, inspo is short for inspiration and defined as \"something, especially something posted on the internet, that gives you ideas for doing something or that makes you want to do something.\"",
      "mouse jiggler",
      "A mouse jiggler is \"a device or piece of software used to make it seem as though a computer mouse is moving so that it seems as though you are working when you are not.\" The term was created amid an increase in remote working since the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "The Associated  Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday as the U.S. pursues a long-lasting peace agreement to end Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the meeting early Saturday, following his\u00a0summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. In a post on Truth Social, the president said the meeting with Putin \"went very well,\" adding that the same was true of a phone call with Zelenskyy and various European leaders after the fact.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy will be coming to D.C., the Oval Office, on Monday afternoon,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin.\"",
      "European and NATO leaders are expected to accompany Zelenskyy to Washington, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said she was joining at \"the request of President Zelenskyy.\"",
      "Though the nearly three-hour-long meeting between the U.S. and Russian presidents on Friday failed to produce the ceasefire that Mr. Trump had sought, the administration has since pivoted to seeking a broader peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. The decision to abandon a ceasefire was at odds with the goals of the U.S. and European allies heading into the summit, and some analysts say the shift could give Putin more leverage at the negotiating table.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that \"both sides are going to have to make concessions\" to get there.",
      "\"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again,\" Rubio said, noting that doing so would require both sides \"to give.\"",
      "The secretary of state, who attended Friday's summit meeting with Putin, indicated that enough progress was made to sit down with Zelenskyy to \"narrow the gap between the two sides.\"",
      "Rubio said the details of security guarantees for Ukraine, the question of territories and the issue of rebuilding the country still need to be discussed and \"require some more specificity.\"",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday that Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and Europe to offer \"game-changing\" security guarantees, including a possible arrangement in which the allies provide \"Article 5-like protection\" to Ukraine. Article 5 of the NATO charter says an attack on one member nation is considered an attack against all. Putin has been vehemently opposed to Ukraine joining NATO, but a similar security guarantee outside the framework of the alliance might reassure Kyiv that Russia would be deterred from attacking in the future.",
      "Witkoff noted that the administration intends to discuss a possible land swap at Monday's meeting.",
      "\"We're not waiting a week for a meeting with Zelenskyy and the European leaders,\" Witkoff said. \"We are intent on trying to hammer out a peace deal that ends the fighting permanently, very, very quickly. Quicker than a ceasefire.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post Sunday night, Mr. Trump said, \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!\" Mr. Trump was referring to Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea in early 2014.",
      "In a\u00a0post on X, Zelenskyy said he'd arrived in Washington for the talks and insisted, \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace.\"",
      "Ahead of Monday's meeting, Russian attacks on Ukraine continued, with a wave of air strikes hitting cities around the country, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa and Sumy, CBS News partner network BBC News reported. Ukrainian authorities said a drone attack on a residential area in the city of Kharkiv overnight killed a toddler, a 16-year-old and five other people.",

      "Air Canada began canceling flights Thursday ahead of a possible strike by its flight attendants that could impact hundreds of thousands of travelers.",
      "A complete shutdown of the country's largest airline threatens to impact about 130,000 people a day.",
      "On Friday, the carrier said in a post on X that the \"wind down\" ahead of an impending strike had led to 294 flight cancellations, affecting 55,726 people.",
      "In a social media post Thursday, the airline\u00a0said\u00a0that nearly 300 flight attendants, \"twice as much as usual,\" did not report to work Thursday night.",
      "\"This will result in additional cancellations,\" the airline said. \"We regret the inconvenience to customers.\"",
      "Mark Nasr, chief operations officer for Air Canada, said the airline has begun a gradual suspension of Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge operations.",
      "\"All flights will be paused by Saturday early morning,\" he said.",
      "Nasr said this approach will help facilitate an orderly restart, \"which under the best circumstances will take a full week to complete.\"",
      "He said a first set of cancellations involving several dozen flights will impact long-haul overseas flights that were due to depart Thursday night.",
      "Late Thursday night, the carrier said on X that 34 flights had been canceled with almost 8,000 people impacted and 19 additional flights were canceled impacting more than 3,000 people \"due to unplanned crew book-offs.",
      "\"By tomorrow evening, we expect to have canceled flights affecting over 100,000 customers,\" Nasr said. \"By the time we get to 1 a.m. on Saturday morning, we will be completely grounded.\"",
      "He said a grounding will affect 25,000 Canadians a day abroad who may become stranded. They expect 500 flights to be canceled by the end of Friday.",
      "The union representing around 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants issued a 72-hour strike notice on Wednesday. If a deal isn't reached or the government doesn't intervene, the flight attendants will begin striking on Saturday, Aug. 16.",
      "In response to the strike notice, the airline issued a lockout notice.",
      "Nasr said customers whose flights are canceled will be eligible for a full refund, and said the airline has also made arrangements with other Canadian and foreign carriers to provide alternative travel options \"to the extent possible.\"",
      "\"We regret the impact a disruption will have on our customers, our stakeholders and the communities we serve,\" Air Canada CEO Michael Rousseau said in a previous statement.",
      "On Tuesday, Air Canada said it had reached an impasse with the union as the two sides remained far apart in contract talks. The union has said its main sticking points revolve around what it calls flight attendants' \"poverty wages\" and unpaid labor when planes aren't in the air, while Air Canada said it had offered a 38% increase in total pay over four years, as well as other benefits.",
      "\"Despite our best efforts, Air Canada refused to address our core issues,\" the union said in a bargaining update posted online.",
      "The union rejected a proposal from the airline to enter a binding arbitration process, saying it prefers to negotiate a deal that its members can then vote on.",

    "summary": "A Hong Kong court heard final arguments Monday in the landmark national security trial of former pro-democracy newspaper founder Jimmy Lai, who could be sentenced to up to life in prison if convicted.",
    "story": [
      "A Hong Kong court heard final arguments Monday in the landmark national security trial of former pro-democracy newspaper founder Jimmy Lai, who could be sentenced to up to life in prison if he is convicted.",
      "Lai, 77, was arrested in 2020 under a national security law imposed by Beijing following anti-government protests in 2019. He is being tried on charges of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiring with others to issue seditious publications.",
      "Lai founded Apple Daily, one of the local media outlets that was most critical of Hong Kong's government. His high-profile case has stretched nearly 150 days, almost double the original estimate, and is widely seen as a trial of press freedom and a test for judicial independence in the Asian financial hub.",
      "It is unclear when a verdict will be delivered, and closing arguments in the trial were expected to last about eight days, CBS News partner network BBC News reported.",
      "Prosecutor Anthony Chau said on Monday that Lai was arrested for collusion in August 2020, but he continued to make requests for sanctions, a blockade or other hostile activities in the following months.",
      "Chau suggested that the appeals for foreign actions did not only target individuals, but also China, while the foreign collaborations Lai had were long-term and persistent.",
      "A prosecution document shown in court argued that the law doesn't prohibit normal international exchanges. But how Lai attempted to draw an analogy of what he did to the cooperation between Hong Kong's prosecuting authority and the International Association of Prosecutors was bewildering.",
      "\"It is surprising to see that D1 (Lai) raised freedoms of thought and association as his shield,\" it said in the document.",
      "Chau is expected to wrap up his closing statement Tuesday.",
      "Earlier, prosecutors alleged Lai asked foreign countries, especially the United States, to take actions against Beijing \"under the guise of fighting for freedom and democracy.\"",
      "On the first day of his testimony, Lai denied he had asked then-Vice President Mike Pence and then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to take action against Hong Kong and China during the 2019 protests.",
      "When Lai's lawyer questioned him about an Apple Daily report saying he had asked the U.S. government to sanction Beijing and Hong Kong leaders, he said he must have discussed it with Pompeo, as he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the report by the now-defunct newspaper he founded.",
      "But Lai said he would not have encouraged foreign sanctions after the national security law was enacted on June 30, 2020.",
      "Closing arguments have been delayed twice, first due to the weather then to concerns over Lai's health.",
      "On Friday, his lawyer, Robert Pang, said Lai had experienced heart palpitations while in prison. The judges wanted him to secure a heart monitor and medication first.",
      "After Friday's hearing, the Hong Kong government alleged foreign media outlets had attempted to mislead the public about Lai's medical care. It said a medical examination of Lai found no abnormalities and that the medical care he received in custody was adequate.",
      "When Lai entered the courtroom on Monday, he waved and smiled to those sitting in the public gallery and briefly instructed his legal team in a voice audible to public attendees. He closed his eyes at times when the prosecution laid out its legal arguments.",
      "The heart monitor was delivered to Lai and he had no complaints about his health, Chau said.",
      "Lai's yearslong detention in solidarity confinement has drawn concerns from foreign governments and rights groups. President Trump, before being elected to his second term in November, said he would talk to Chinese leader Xi Jinping to seek Lai's release. \"I will get him out,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "In a Fox News radio interview released Aug. 14, Mr. Trump denied saying he would save Lai, but rather that he would bring the issue up.",
      "\"I've already brought it up, and I'm going to do everything I can to save him,\" he said.",
      "China has accused Lai of stirring a rise in anti-China sentiments in Hong Kong and said it firmly opposes the interference of other countries in its internal affairs.",
      "Dozens of people waited in the rain Monday for a seat in the main courtroom to see Lai.",
      "Former Apple Daily reader Susan Li said she worried about Lai's health as he looked visibly thinner and she would continue to pray for him. \"I wanted to let him know we are still here,\" she said.",
      "When Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to China in 1997, Beijing promised to retain the city's civil liberties for 50 years. But critics say the promise has become threadbare after the introduction of the security law, which Chinese and Hong Kong authorities insist was necessary for the city's stability.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Trump to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday.",
      "\"We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,\" he told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" He added that it \"was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that\" and called it \"game-changing.\"",
      "Article 5, at the heart of the 32-member military alliance, states that an armed attack against one or more of the members shall be considered an attack against all members.",
      "Witkoff, who had joined Secretary of State Marco Rubio for the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, offered few details on how such an agreement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his long-standing objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership.",
      "Outlining some of the details about the private discussions, Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not \"go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty. And there was plenty more.\"",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at a news conference in Brussels with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, applauded the move. \"We welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine and the 'Coalition of the willing' \u2014 including the European Union \u2014 is ready to do its share,\" she said.",
      "Zelenskyy thanked the United States for recent signals that Washington was willing to support such guarantees, but said much was unclear.",
      "\"It is important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine,\" he said, \"But there are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do, and this is our main task, we need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO, and we consider EU accession to be part of the security guarantees.\"",
      "Witkoff defended Mr. Trump's decision to abandon his push that Russian agree to an immediate ceasefire, which the president had set as a benchmark going into the meeting. Witkoff said the Republican president had pivoted toward a peace deal because so much progress was made.",
      "\"We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,\" Witkoff said, without elaborating. \"We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal.\"",
      "Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he did not believe imposing new U.S. sanctions on Russia would force Putin to accept a ceasefire.",
      "\"If he did this now, the moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks,\" Rubio said. \"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here.\"",
      "Rubio said that Kyiv \"is going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too.\"",
      "\"For example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security,\" Rubio said. \"That's not an unreasonable request. That's something that needs to be worked on.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Sunday wrote on social media, \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!\"",
      "Zelenskyy and European leaders, who heard from Mr. Trump after the summit, are scheduled to meet with him at the White House on Monday.",
      "Rubio said of the talks with Russia, \"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"",
      "Zelenskyy on Sunday night said on social media that he had arrived in Washington, D.C., for Monday's meeting, but pushed back on the Trump administration's comments about ceding territory to Russia.",
      "\"We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably. And peace must be lasting. Not like it was years ago, when Ukraine was forced to give up Crimea and part of our East\u2014part of Donbas\u2014and Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack,\" Zelenskyy wrote, adding \"Crimea should not have been given up then, just as Ukrainians did not give up Kyiv, Odesa, or Kharkiv after 2022.\"",
      "\"I am confident that we will defend Ukraine, effectively guarantee security, and that our people will always be grateful to President Trump, everyone in America, and every partner and ally for their support and invaluable assistance,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started.

      "Police said they had arrested 32 as part of the nationwide demonstration \u2014 one of the fiercest since the uproar over six hostages found dead in Gaza last September.",
      "\"Military pressure doesn't bring hostages back \u2014 it only kills them,\" former hostage Arbel Yehoud said at a demonstration in Tel Aviv's hostage square. \"The only way to bring them back is through a deal, all at once, without games.\"",
      "\"Today, we stop everything to save and bring back the hostages and soldiers. Today, we stop everything to remember the supreme value of the sanctity of life,\" said Anat Angrest, mother of hostage Matan Angrest. \"Today, we stop everything to join hands \u2014 right, left, center and everything in between.\"",
      "Protesters at highway intersections handed out yellow ribbons, the symbol that represents the hostages, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which organized the stoppage, said.",
      "Even though Israel's largest labor union, Histadrut, ultimately did not join Sunday's action, strikes of this magnitude are relatively rare in Israel. Many businesses and municipalities decided independently to strike.",
      "Still, an end to the conflict does not appear near. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has demanded the immediate release of the hostages but is balancing competing pressures, haunted by the potential for mutiny within his coalition.",
      "Israeli leaders criticize demonstrations",
      "Netanyahu addressed the protests on Sunday at a cabinet meeting, saying they were benefiting Hamas.",
      "\"Those who are calling today for an end to the war without Hamas' elimination are not only hardening Hamas' position and delaying the release of our hostages, they are also ensuring that the horrors of October 7 will repeat themselves and that we will have to fight an endless war,\" the prime minister said.",
      "Far-right members of his cabinet insist they won't support any deal that allows Hamas to retain power. The last time Israel agreed to a ceasefire that released hostages, they threatened to topple Netanyahu's government.",
      "Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Sunday called the stoppage \"a bad and harmful campaign that plays into Hamas' hands, buries the hostages in the tunnels and attempts to get Israel to surrender to its enemies and jeopardize its security and future.\"",
      "National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, in a statement, accused protesters of trying to \"weaken Israel.\" Like Smotrich, he said the strike \"strengthens Hamas and delays the return of the hostages.\"",
      "Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry reported that 47 people were killed and at least 226 were wounded across the territory in the last 24 hours alone. Meanwhile, hospitals and eyewitnesses in Gaza reported at least 17 aid-seekers had been killed by Israeli forces on Sunday, including nine awaiting aid trucks close to the Morag corridor. The death toll among Palestinians waiting for food and other aid in Gaza has climbed this summer, sparking outcry around the world as\u00a0starvation and malnutrition run rampant in the enclave.",
      "Hamza Asfour said he was just north of the corridor, awaiting a convoy, when Israeli snipers fired, first to disperse the crowds, then from tanks hundreds of meters away.",
      "He saw two people with gunshot wounds \u2014 one in the chest and other in the shoulder.",
      "\"It's either to take this risk or wait and see my family die of starvation,\" he said. \"There is no other option.\"",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which runs the distribution points, said there was no gunfire Sunday \"at or near\" its sites, which sit at the end of aid truck routes.",
      "Israel's military did not immediately respond to questions about strikes in the three areas.",
      "Israel's air and ground war has already killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza and displaced most of the population. The United Nations is warning that levels of starvation and malnutrition in Gaza are at their highest since the war began.",
      "The Hamas-led attack in 2023 killed around 1,200 people in Israel. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed 61,897 people in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry, which does not specify how many were fighters or civilians but says around half were women and children.",
      "2 more children die from malnutrition-related causes",
      "On Sunday, two children died of malnutrition-related causes in Gaza, bringing the death toll from such causes over the last 24 hours to seven, according to Gaza's health ministry. The total number of deaths related to starvation has risen to 251, including 110 children, said the health ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.",
      "While demonstrators in Israel demanded a ceasefire, Israel began preparing for an invasion of Gaza City and other populated parts of the besieged strip, aimed at destroying Hamas.",
      "The military body that coordinates its humanitarian aid to Gaza said Sunday that the supply of tents to the territory would resume. COGAT said it would allow the United Nations to resume importing tents and shelter equipment into Gaza ahead of plans to forcibly evacuate people from combat zones \"for their protection.\"",
      "The majority of assistance has been blocked from entering Gaza since Israel imposed a total blockade in March after a ceasefire collapsed when Israel restarted its offensive. Deliveries have since partially resumed, though aid organizations say the flow is far below what is needed. Some have accused Israel of \"weaponizing aid\" through blockades and rules they say turn humanitarian assistance into a tool of its political and military goals.",
      "Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen's capital on Sunday, escalating strikes on Iran-backed Houthis, who, since the war began, have fired missiles at Israel and targeted ships in the Red Sea.",
      "Both the IDF and a Houthi-run television station in Yemen announced the strikes. Al-Masirah Television said they targeted a power plant in the southern district of Sanhan, sparking a fire and knocking it out of service, the Yemeni station said. Israel's military said Sunday's strikes targeted energy infrastructure it claimed was being used by the Houthis, and were launched in response to missiles and drones aimed at Israel.",
      "While some projectiles have breached its missile defenses \u2014 notably during its 12-day war with Iran in June \u2014 Israel has intercepted the vast majority of missiles launched from Yemen.",
      "U.S. blocks visitor visas from Gaza",
      "The U.S. Department of State on Saturday announced that it would stop issuing visitor visas for people from Gaza.",
      "\"All visitor visas for individuals from Gaza are being stopped while we conduct a full and thorough review of the process and procedures used to issue a small number of temporary medical-humanitarian visas in recent days,\" the department wrote in a social media post.",
      "Some humanitarian groups have condemned the pause because those visas may be issued to people in need of medical treatment abroad, CBS News partner BBC News reported.",
      "The nonprofit organization Palestine Children's Relief Fund said in a statement to BBC News that the decision \"will have a devastating and irreversible impact on our ability to bring injured and critically ill children from Gaza to the United States for lifesaving medical treatment.\"",

      "Iraqi officials have begun the excavation of what is believed to be a mass grave left behind by ISIS\u00a0during its rampage across the country a decade ago.",
      "Local authorities are working with the judiciary, forensic investigations, Iraq's Martyrs' Foundation, and the directorate of mass graves to carry out the excavation of the site of a sinkhole in al-Khafsa, south of the northern city of Mosul, the state-run Iraqi News Agency reported Sunday.",
      "Ahmad Qusay al-Asady, head of the Martyrs Foundation's mass graves excavation department, told The Associated Press that his team began work at Khasfa on Aug. 9 at the request of Nineveh province's Gov. Abdulqadir al-Dakhil.",
      "The operation is initially limited to gathering visible human remains and surface evidence while preparing for a full exhumation that officials say will require international support.",
      "After an initial 15 days of work, the foundation's Mosul teams will build a database and start collecting DNA samples from families of suspected victims.",
      "Al-Asady explained that laboratory processing and a DNA database must come first to ensure proper identification. Full exhumations can only proceed once specialized assistance is secured to navigate the site's hazards, including sulfur water and unexploded ordnance.",
      "Khasfa is \"a very complicated site,\" he said.",
      "Based on unverified accounts from witnesses and families and other unofficial testimonies, authorities estimate that thousands of bodies could be buried there, he said.",
      "Scores of mass graves containing thousands of bodies of people believed to have been killed by ISIS\u00a0have been found in Iraq and Syria.",
      "Some of the mass graves found in Iraq over the past two decades are believed to date back to the early 1990s, during Saddam Hussein's regime. Other mass graves include bodies of women and children.",
      "At its peak, ISIS ruled an area half the size of the United Kingdom in Iraq and Syria and was notorious for its brutality. It beheaded civilians and enslaved and raped thousands of women from the Yazidi community, one of Iraq's oldest religious minorities. The extremist group has boasted of massacring Shiites and other opponents, often releasing gruesome videos and pictures of the killings.",
      "The group was defeated in Iraq in July 2017, when Iraqi forces captured the northern city of Mosul. Three months later, it suffered a major blow when Kurdish forces captured the Syrian northern city of Raqqa, which was the group's de facto capital. The war against ISIS officially ended in March 2019, when U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces captured the eastern Syrian town of Baghouz, which was the last sliver of land the extremists controlled.",
      "Rabah Nouri Attiyah, a lawyer who has worked on more than 70 cases of missing people in Nineveh, told the AP that information he obtained from the foundation and different Iraqi courts during his investigations points to Khasfa as \"the largest mass grave in modern Iraqi history.\"",
      "Al-Asady, however, said investigators \"cannot confirm yet if it is the largest mass grave\" to be found in Iraq, \"but according to the size of the space, we estimate it to be one of the largest.\"",
      "Attiyah said roughly 70% of the human remains at Khasfa are believed to belong to Iraqi army and police personnel, with other victims including Yazidis.",
      "He said he has interviewed numerous eyewitnesses from the area who saw IS fighters bring people there by bus and kill them. \"Many of them were decapitated,\" he said.",
      "Attiyah's own uncle and cousin were police officers killed by IS, and he is among those hoping to identify and recover the remains of loved ones.",
      "Testimonies and witness statements, as well as findings from other mass graves in Nineveh, indicate that most of the military, police and other security forces personnel killed by IS are expected to be found at Khasfa, along with Yazidis from Sinjar and Shiite victims from Tal Afar, he said.",

      "\"We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war,\" Rubio said, noting that there were \"some concepts and ideas discussed\" with Putin that they expect the Ukrainians would support.",

      "\"Historically, ads for jeans have been provocative,\" he noted. \"Look back to Calvin Klein\u2019s advertising campaign in the early 1980s featuring Brooke Shields; there was a lot of criticism about how a 15-year-old girl was being portrayed. The ads turned out to have a positive result for both Klein and Shields, and in many ways put the actress/model on the map.\"",
      "Honig continued, \"As far as the Sweeney ads being too sexual or aimed at \u2018male gazing,\u2019 I would point to the highly successful Pepsi ad campaign with Cindy Crawford, which was recently rebooted. Gloria Vanderbilt\u2019s advertising campaign was all about her name being on a woman\u2019s backside.\"",
      "\"The bottom line here is that American Eagle decided to push the envelope in much the same way Klein and Vanderbilt did,\" he added. \"Like it or not, the campaign is sparking discussion and getting a lot of notice, which is likely what they set out to do.\"",

      "Many assume that memory loss and cognitive decline are an inevitable part of aging \u2014 but new research suggests that doesn\u2019t have to be the case.",
      "A 25-year study from Northwestern University analyzed the brains of \"super agers\" to determine what traits they share that may contribute to their mental resilience.",
      "\"Super agers\" are defined as people 80 and older who show \"outstanding memory performance\" that is on par with those who are three decades younger, according to the researchers.",
      "'MISSING LINK' TO ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE FOUND IN STUDY OF HUMAN BRAIN TISSUE",
      "\"\u2018Super ager\u2019 is not a condition, but rather a term we defined at Northwestern on the basis of a score on a memory test over age 80,\" lead author Sandra Weintraub, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and neurology at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"We were interested in memory aging because memory decline is the most common complaint in older adults. One can be \u2018super\u2019 in many ways, and this is just one.\"",
      "\"Super agers\" are defined as people 80 and older who show \"outstanding memory performance\" that is on par with those who are three decades younger. (iStock)",
      "In the study, the researchers analyzed 79 brains that were donated by super agers and identified some key differences compared to those who \"age typically.\"",
      "Some of the brains contained amyloid and tau proteins, which typically accumulate in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, while other brains showed no sign of these toxins.",
      "ALZHEIMER\u2019S RESEARCHERS SAY TARGETING BRAIN SUGAR COULD HELP PROTECT AGAINST DEMENTIA",
      "\"Some super agers have very few of these proteins, so for some reason they don\u2019t manufacture them,\" Weintraub noted. \"But we found some super agers\u2019 brains contained large numbers of these proteins, despite maintaining their cognitive health until death.\"",
      "This means there may be different biological pathways to super aging \u2014 \"one resistance and the other resilience,\" she said.",
      "\"If your relative is forgetful at age 80, it may not be part of aging, but of disease.\"",
      "With the resistance group, they don\u2019t make the plaques and tangles, Weintraub said. In the resilience group, they make them, but they don\u2019t have any impact on their brains.",
      "While \"typically aging\" brains show thinning of the cortex \u2014 which is the outer layer of the brain that helps with decision-making, motivation and regulation of emotions \u2014 the super agers\u2019 brains did not show this characteristic.",
      "TWO CANCER DRUGS SHOW PROMISE IN REVERSING ALZHEIMER'S DEVASTATING EFFECTS",
      "Super agers were also found to have a greater number of \"von economo neurons,\" which are brain cells that control social behavior. The researchers also found that this group had larger \"entorhinal neurons,\" which are essential for powering memory, the release stated.",
      "In terms of behavior, the super agers were also found to be \"highly social\" with strong interpersonal relationships, according to the study findings.",
      "Challenging assumptions",
      "\"There is the common assumption that aging implicitly brings cognitive decline and that loss of short-term memory is part of \u2018normal aging,\u2019\" lead author Sandra Weintraub, professor of psychiatry and neurology at Northwestern Medicine, told Fox News Digital.",
      "ALZHEIMER'S RISK COULD RISE WITH SPECIFIC SLEEP PATTERN, EXPERTS WARN",
      "\"The truth is that on average, cognitive test scores decline, but the variance among individuals within that average span gets larger and larger with age,\" she continued.",
      "\"That means that loss is not inevitable, and that if your relative is forgetful at age 80, it may not be part of aging, but of disease.\"",

      "The listserv, which included at least five judges from across the nation and CJP leaders, was active from September 2022 to May 2024, and facilitated correspondence between the group's members as they traded links on climate studies, congratulated one another on hosting recent environmental events, shared updates on recent climate cases that were remanded to state courts and encouraged participation in other CJP meet-ups.",

      "The governor is moving to hold a special election this year, to obtain voter approval to undo the constitutional amendments that created the non-partisan redistricting commission. A two-thirds majority vote in the Democrat-dominated California legislature would be needed to hold the referendum.",
      "The legislature is back in session in Sacramento on Monday, and Democrats in both chambers are expected to approve the maps \u2013 which would create up to five more left-leaning congressional districts at the expense of the Republican minority \u2013 by the end of this week.",

There is no debate. There's no input. Even the legislature in California doesn't have input. The DCCC is just ending it. That is why we need to stop Newsom's power grab.\"",

      "\"Customer service platforms are considered a treasure trove because they store detailed personal data, transaction histories, and sometimes have capabilities to reset passwords or override security settings,\" Amper notes. \"Unlike core financial systems, many lack robust security controls, making them accessible to attackers armed with partial user information.\"",
      "What this means for you",
      "Air France-KLM's breach shows just how quickly cybercriminals are adapting. With AI-powered impersonation, even experienced customer service representatives can be tricked. Your best defense is to stay vigilant, use stronger authentication and actively monitor your accounts for any unusual activity.",
      "A woman booking airline travel on her laptop\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What hackers do with the stolen data",
      "Once hackers gain access to this data, they can quickly convert it into profit.",
      "\"This starts when attackers use stolen data such as loyalty program numbers, recent transactions or service request information to impersonate customers in future interactions,\" Amper says.\u00a0\"Loyalty points and frequent flyer miles act as digital currency that can be monetized or redeemed for rewards. These pieces of information are treated as puzzle pieces to build complete identity profiles.\"",
      "These profiles often appear for sale on the dark web. Criminals can also reuse them to break into other accounts or launch highly targeted scams.",
      "How to protect yourself after a breach",
      "Amper warns that scammers often move quickly after a breach, sending fake alerts that seem legitimate.",
      "\"Post-breach, watch for phishing lures tailored to you, like emails citing your recent Air France flight, urging a 'security update' with a dodgy link. Scammers thrive on urgency.\"",
      "If you were notified, or even suspect that your data was part of this breach, take these steps immediately:",
      "Use\u00a0app-based authentication, security keys or biometrics wherever possible. Unlike basic text message codes, these methods are far harder for cybercriminals to intercept, even if they already have some of your personal information from the breach.",
      "Scammers may reference real flights, loyalty program balances or recent transactions to trick you into clicking malicious links. Pair your caution with strong antivirus tools which can block dangerous websites, phishing attempts and malware before they get a chance to run. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Google has confirmed that a hacking group known as ShinyHunters stole customer data from one of its internal Salesforce databases used to manage business client relationships. The company disclosed the breach in a blog post published in early August, noting that the stolen data included\u00a0\"basic and largely publicly available business information, such as business names and contact details.\"",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The breach was carried out by ShinyHunters, a well-known cybercriminal group formally tracked as UNC6040. The group has recently been linked to a string of high-profile incidents involving companies such as AT&T, Ticketmaster, Allianz Life and Pandora. In this case, the attackers targeted Google's corporate Salesforce system, which the company uses to store contact information and notes about small and medium-sized businesses.",

      "Cisco, Qantas and Pandora have all reported similar breaches in recent months, which now appear to be part of a broader campaign targeting cloud-based customer relationship management tools.",
      "In its blog post, Google warned that ShinyHunters may be preparing a public leak site. Ransomware gangs often use this tactic to extort companies, threatening to publish stolen data.

      "While organizations like Google may be prime targets, individuals are often the weakest link that attackers exploit. But with a few smart practices, you can dramatically reduce your risk.",
      "The Google breach happened because employees gave up sensitive information over a phone call. No legitimate IT team will ever ask you to share your password or 2FA codes over the phone. If someone does, it's a major red flag.",

      "Phishing emails and messages often include links that take you to fake websites designed to steal your login credentials or personal information. These messages usually create a sense of urgency, asking you to verify an account, reset a password or claim a reward. Instead of clicking the link, take a moment to inspect the message.",

      "2. Shredding and mixing: Machines shred the cleaned fibers and combine them with synthetic hydrocarbon wax, which serves as a binder.",
      "3. Pellet formation: The blended material is pressed, heated and cut into small pellets that can be easily stored and transported.",
      "4. Asphalt integration: These pellets are added to reclaimed asphalt and bitumen. During heating, the pellets melt and release reinforcing fibers that strengthen the final asphalt mix.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Stronger roads and a cleaner planet thanks to cigarette butt recycling",
      "Recycled cigarette butts make asphalt stronger, more flexible and longer-lasting. The fibers released during mixing act as micro reinforcement, improving fatigue resistance and helping roads withstand heavy traffic and temperature changes. The wax in the pellets lowers the temperature needed to mix asphalt, reducing both energy use and emissions during production. Beyond performance, this method gives cigarette waste a second life. By repurposing billions of discarded filters, cities can reduce litter and pollution while building more sustainable infrastructure.",

      "What cities are doing next with recycled cigarette butts",

As more cities explore cleaner, smarter infrastructure, this kind of solution could play a big role in the future of street design.",

These commands remain invisible in Gmail's standard view but are still accessible to Gemini. Once you request a summary, the AI can be tricked into presenting fake security alerts or urgent instructions that appear to come from Google.",

      "Just because a summary appears in Gmail or Docs does not mean it is automatically safe. Treat AI-generated suggestions, alerts or links with the same caution you would any unsolicited message. Always verify critical information, such as security alerts or phone numbers, through official sources.",
      "If an email seems unusual, especially if it is unexpected or from someone you do not recognize, avoid using the AI summary feature. Instead, read the full email as it was originally written. This lowers the chance of falling for misleading summaries.",
      "Watch for emails or messages that create a sense of urgency, ask you to verify account details or provide unexpected links or contact information, even if they appear trustworthy or come from familiar sources. Attackers can use AI to craft realistic-looking alerts or requests for sensitive information, sometimes concealed within automatically generated summaries. So, always pause and scrutinize suspicious prompts before responding.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "Ensure that Google Workspace and your browser are always running the latest version. Google regularly releases security updates that help prevent newer types of attacks. Also, avoid using unofficial extensions that have access to your Gmail or Docs.",
      "AI-driven scams like the Gemini summary attack don't happen in a vacuum. They often begin with stolen personal information. That data might come from past breaches, public records or details you've unknowingly shared online. A data removal service can help by continuously scanning and requesting the removal of your information from data broker sites. While no service can wipe everything, reducing your digital footprint makes it harder for attackers to personalize phishing attempts or link you to known breach data.

      "How these trackable shoes work",
      "Instead of baking in a GPS system, Skechers took a simpler route. The model, officially called Skechers GO RUN Elevate 2.0 - Find My Skechers, features a screw-secured compartment beneath the insole. That's where you can insert your own\u00a0Apple AirTag. Once inside, the AirTag becomes invisible and unnoticeable to the child wearing the shoes. From there, all tracking happens through Apple's Find My app, which works on any iPhone. It updates the tag's location as long as it remains near an Apple device. Since AirTags were made to track objects like keys and bags, slipping one into a shoe was just a matter of time.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The pros: Clever design and smart functionality",
      "Skechers designed these shoes with both practicality and peace of mind in mind. They feature an adaptive closure system with stretch laces and an adjustable instep strap, making it easy for kids to slip them on and off without help. Comfort isn't an afterthought either. Each pair includes a Skechers Air-Cooled Goga Mat insole with high-rebound cushioning, giving growing feet the support they need throughout the day. Plus, they're machine washable, which saves parents time and effort. The standout feature is the hidden AirTag-compatible compartment tucked beneath the heel of the insole. It comes with a screw-tight cover that keeps the tracker secure and discreet. There's no external AirTag branding, so the shoes look like any regular pair of Skechers. With a breathable mesh and synthetic upper, durable rubber outsole, and 1 1/4-inch heel height, the design delivers both style and function. They're available in sizes for boys and girls, and even without an AirTag, they work perfectly as everyday sneakers.",
      "Skechers GO RUN Elevate 2.0 - Find My Skechers. (Skechers)",
      "The cons: Tracking isn't foolproof",
      "Still, parents should be aware: these are not GPS shoes with real-time, all-the-time tracking.\u00a0AirTags\u00a0rely on nearby Apple devices to update their location. If the tag moves out of range or its battery dies, the updates stop. Another issue? Anyone who has access to your Apple account can view the tag's location. While you can manage and revoke access in your iPhone settings, this means privacy depends on your own security habits. And yes, it's possible for someone to remove the battery and disable an AirTag in seconds. That means this shoe-tracking feature won't replace supervision; it's simply a backup.",

      "Skechers GO RUN Elevate 2.0 - Find My Skechers. (Skechers)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you're a parent looking for a low-cost way to track where your child's shoes are, this is a creative solution. It's less intrusive than giving them a phone and more flexible than a built-in GPS system. You control the tracker, you install the battery, and you decide who gets access. But don't confuse shoe tracking with child safety. These trainers can offer location updates, but they can't think, speak, or call for help. Think of them as one extra tool, not your only one.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Skechers'\u00a0AirTag-ready shoes bring smart design to a simple parenting problem: knowing where your kid's shoes are. They're clever, budget-friendly, and discreet. But while they offer convenience and comfort, they don't offer total protection. As with any tech aimed at families, it's important to balance innovation with caution. The shoes give you more visibility, but not full security.",

      "The foundation said that as more aid flows into Gaza, families will now be about to use the program to secure their parcels in advance, \"bringing more ease, dignity, and order to the collection process.\" Under the current set-up at distribution sites, the GHF noted that younger, more fit men often outpace women, children, older men and people with disabilities to access aid, which is collected on a first-come, first-served basis.",
      "\"This is real progress,\" GHF Executive Director John Acree said in a statement. \"It both demonstrates that GHF\u2019s model is working and reflects our commitment to adapting to the needs of those we serve and delivering on President Trump\u2019s call for innovation to get more humanitarian aid into the hands of the people who need it most in Gaza.\"",

      "\"It has always been our plan to offer a way for families to reserve aid in advance and guarantee access, just as other aid organizations do,\" Acree said. \"Until now, however, conditions on the ground have made implementation of such a program impossible. But with more aid flowing into Gaza and GHF\u2019s deliveries helping stabilize food availability, conditions are improving.

The whistleblower said in the complaint that \"the IDF is actively helping the\u00a0Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) get food into the hands of civilians while U.N. agencies, including WFP and OCHA, through their unwillingness to coordinate with the IDF, are inhibiting the distribution of such aid.\"",
      "The whistleblower continued, \"As has been recently shown through openly available imagery, the IDF has provided clearance for thousands of tons of U.N. humanitarian goods that are now sitting inside of Gaza, awaiting distribution. The U.N. must be held accountable to pick up and distribute such aid. I urge you to launch an independent investigation into this matter to determine the extent to which U.N. agencies, by refusing to coordinate with the IDF on essential issues, including security, are abusing U.S. taxpayer funds rather than using them to deliver the aid the American people are donating \u2013 and whether such actions are being taken independently by U.N. officials in Gaza or at the direction of the U.N.

It is a moral and legal obligation, and our duty to the American taxpayer, to work with our partners to ensure this ends immediately.\u202fThere is endless video evidence of Hamas looting, not to mention members of the aid-industrial complex who have admitted that looting exists by reporting it as 'self-distribution,' in a poor attempt at an aid corruption coverup.\"",

As a result of investigations, numerous UNRWA personnel affiliated with Hamas have been referred to the State Department for suspension or debarment proceedings.\"",
      "Fox News Digital\u00a0reported on August 1 that the U.S. State Department urged in a report that the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) that provides aid to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip needs to be abolished and is beyond reform.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump met for about an hour at the White House on Monday with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an accelerating effort to end a grinding war with Russia on terms acceptable to both sides.",
      "Trump greeted the Ukrainian leader in the early afternoon with a smile and warm handshake \u2014 a stark difference from the tense televised meeting the two men held in February in the Oval Office.",
      "Fresh off a summit in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump summoned Zelenskyy to see if they can resolve sticking points centered on Ukraine's future security and the status of territory that the Russian military has seized in eastern and southern Ukraine.",
      "A number of European leaders joined Zelenskyy and Trump at the White House on Monday to work toward a breakthrough in a more than three year conflict that Trump himself has cautioned could erupt in a third world war if allowed to persist.",
      "Asked if U.S. troops would help secure a peace deal, Trump did not rule out the possibility.",
      "As a condition of ending the war, Putin has insisted that his country retain about 20% of Ukrainian territory that it now controls. For his part, Zelenskyy has said that Ukraine's constitution forbids him to cede any land.",
      "Trump and Zelenskyy spoke to the press corps in the Oval Office before meeting privately. The U.S. president suggested he won't abandon efforts to forge a peace deal, though he conceded the Russia-Ukraine conflict has proved particularly stubborn.",
      "\"It's never the end of the road,\" Trump said. \"People are being killed and we want to stop that. So, I would say it's not the end of the road. I think we have a good chance of doing it.\"",
      "Zelenskyy sat to Trump's right in a dark, formal outfit complete with a collar \u2014 a departure from his normal wartime garb, which Trump remarked upon favorably. (At Zelenskyy\u2019s last meeting at the White House a reporter asked him why he wasn\u2019t wearing a suit).",
      "When a reporter asked if he was prepared redraw Ukraine's map if it would end the war sooner, Zelenskyy did not answer directly.",

      "When his meeting with Trump ended, Zelenskyy said: \"We had a very good conversation \u2014 maybe the best one.\"",
      "What happens next is far from clear. Trump said he will call Putin when he's done with the negotiations for the day. Depending on the progress made, he said he would try to convene a meeting that hasn't happened since the war began \u2014 a trilateral summit with himself, Putin and Zelenskyy.",
      "\"A lot of people were killed last week,\" Trump said, adding, \"And I know the president [Zelenskyy], I know myself and, I believe, Vladimir Putin want to see it ended.\"",
      "Trump scheduled a full slate of afternoon meetings with Zelenskyy along with European officials including French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",

      "\"We will come to a resolution today I think on almost everything, including probably the security,\" Trump said before the start of that meeting.",
      "Europe looms large in any accord between the combatants. Looking to prevent future Russian attacks, European nations would be an important part of any security guarantees that Ukraine has requested as part of any peace deal.",
      "But the U.S. also may play a part, Trump said \u2014 a surprising admission from the \"America First\" president. If there's a Trump foreign policy doctrine, it's that he wants to extricate the U.S. from foreign wars and shift some of the peacekeeping burden from the U.S. to other countries.",
      "Yet when asked if he would deploy Americans to Ukraine to help preserve a peace deal, Trump did not dismiss the idea out of hand.",

      "With the TV cameras present, the tone was far more cordial than in Zelenskyy's last visit. In that February meeting, Vice President JD Vance sat beside Trump and berated Zelenskyy for not showing enough gratitude to the president. This time, Vance sat in the same place but stayed silent.",
      "In the last visit, Trump memorably told Zelenskyy that he didn't hold any \"cards\" and and that his country was \"in big trouble.\"",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re gambling with World War III, and what you doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, that\u2019s backed you,\u201d Trump told Zelenskyy at the time.",
      "The meeting was ultimately cut short.",
      "Who holds the better \"cards\" at this point? a reporter asked Trump on Monday.",
      "\"I don't want to say that,\" the president replied.",
      "Trump has lately stepped up his role in ending the conflict. With an eye on the Nobel Peace Prize, he met privately with Putin at a military base in Anchorage on Friday to jumpstart peace talks. He and Putin strode down a red carpet together before a private meeting that lasted nearly three hours.",
      "Though he said beforehand he wanted a ceasefire, Trump left the the summit without one and said he was shifting his aim instead toward a full-fledged \"peace agreement.\"",
      "The Trump administration's messaging has at times been muddled. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday on NBC News' \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that a ceasefire was \u201cnot off the table.\"",
      "In the same interview, Rubio said that \u201cno one is pushing Ukraine to give that up,\u201d referring to land occupied by Russia. Later in the day, Trump appeared to undercut Rubio when he reposted a Truth Social user who declared, \u201cUkraine must be willing to lose some territory to Russia otherwise the longer the war goes on they will keep losing even more land!!\u201d",
      "In a post to Truth Social Sunday night, Trump seemed to place the onus of ending the war on Zelenskyy, as opposed to Putin, who sent tanks rolling into Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Trump wrote that Ukraine must give up Russian-annexed Crimea and also abandon any hopes of joining NATO \u2014 one of Putin's demands.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight,\" Trump wrote in his post.",
      "Zelenskyy took a different posture. In a post on X late Sunday, he wrote that \u201cRussia must end this war, which it itself started.\u201d",
      "The meetings on Monday give the leaders a forum to discuss future security guarantees for Ukraine, which U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff floated as potentially looking similar to NATO\u2019s Article 5.",
      "Ukraine hopes to negotiate an ironclad security guarantee, similar to Article 5's all-for-one provision, and convince Trump that a temporary ceasefire is necessary to begin real peace talks, according to a Ukrainian source familiar with the goals. The security guarantees should be a treaty-level obligation, the source said, which require Senate approval.",
      "A challenge for Zelenskyy is persuading Trump that Russia should give up the territory it seized by force. One European official said it was their belief that Ukraine would never give up all of its eastern Donbas region, much of which Russia controls.",
      "In the run-up to the Alaska summit, Trump said that an end to the war would include \u201csome swapping of territories.\u201d",

      "The Texas House gaveled in on Monday with a quorum for the first time in two weeks after Democratic lawmakers who fled the state returned following a standoff over Republicans' redistricting effort.",
      "GOP leaders in the state House said they would take up their plan aimed at padding their party\u2019s majority in the U.S. House on Wednesday.",
      "A group of Democratic lawmakers had left the state en masse earlier this month in a move that temporarily blocked Republicans from enacting a new  congressional map in the state, sparking a national political firestorm over redistricting.",
      "Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows on Monday said that the Democrats who had arrest warrants issued against them would only be allowed to leave the chamber under certain circumstances.",
      "\"Members who have not been present until today, for whom arrest warrants were issued, will be granted written permission to leave only after agreeing to be released into the custody of a designated [Department of Public Safety] officer appointment under the rules of the house,\" he said, adding that the officers would \"ensure your return Wednesday at 10 a.m.\"",
      "\"For those still absent, civil arrest warrants remain in force,\" Burrows added.",
      "In opening Monday's session, Burrows referenced the standoff.",
      "\"The House has been through a tumultuous two weeks, but this institution long predates us and will long outlast each of us. ... This body has endured wars, economic depressions and quorum breaks dating back to the very first session. It will withstand this too,\" Burrows said. \u201cWe are done waiting. We have a quorum. Now is the time for action. We will move quickly, and the schedule will be demanding until our work is complete.\"",
      "The Democrats last week decided to end their standoff after they prevented Texas Republicans from passing a redrawn congressional map during a first special legislative session and after California Democrats countered with their own redistricting proposal. But Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called for a second special session, and with enough Democratic lawmakers now present in Texas, the GOP-controlled Legislature will be able to advance its new map.",
      "\u201cWe killed the corrupt special session, withstood unprecedented surveillance and intimidation, and rallied Democrats nationwide to join this existential fight for fair representation \u2014 reshaping the entire 2026 landscape,\u201d Texas House Democratic Caucus Chair Gene Wu said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re returning to Texas more dangerous to Republicans\u2019 plans than when we left. Our return allows us to build the legal record necessary to defeat this racist map in court, take our message to communities across the state and country, and inspire how to fight these undemocratic redistricting schemes in their own statehouses.\u201d",
      "Texas Democrats, without any real legislative power, won praise nationwide from members of their party for delaying Republicans pursuit of a rare, mid-decade redistricting effort and raising awareness of the issue. The two-week quorum break has been costly, with the Democratic lawmakers facing a $500 fine for each day they were absent. And many faced security threats while away from their families.",
      "Democrats began setting the stage for their eventual return last week, declaring victory Republicans' decision to end their first special legislative session without a vote. They said their second condition to return was for California Democrats to release a plan that would seek to offset any changes Texas Republicans made to their map, which they did on Friday.",
      "The more than 50 Texas Democrats left the state on Aug. 3, the day before the first special session began, leaving the state House short of the quorum needed to consider legislative business.",
      "They received a heroes welcome from prominent Democratic governors in the states they decamped to, like Illinois, California and New York. The issue became a national rallying cry for Democrats, amid their argument that President Donald Trump and national Republicans were pursuing a power grab to insulate themselves from potential political peril in next year's midterm elections.",
      "But Republicans back in Texas were deeply critical of their colleagues. They authorized ceremonial civil arrest warrants against the fleeing members and docked them heavy fines. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Abbott sought court orders to remove more than a dozen of them from their seats. And Republicans then moved, in their absence, to consider legislation to respond to the devastating flooding outside San Antonio, accusing Democrats of shirking their responsibility to victims.",
      "\"Instead of confronting those challenges, some of our colleagues have fled the state in their duty. They've left the state, abandoned their posts, and turned their backs on the constituents they swore to represent,\" Burrows said on the House floor on Aug. 4 in response to the Democrats' quorum break.",
      "But Democrats have been fiercely critical of those accusations, arguing the Legislature could have dispatched with bipartisan flood relief first, and only waited to hold the issue as hostage to compel Democrats to return.",
      "During Friday morning's final meeting of the first special House session, the House had 95 of the 100 members necessary to move forward, meaning that it would take the return of a only few Democrats to allow the House to go back into session.",
      "And the redistricting plan passed the state Senate last week over the protests of state Democrats. While most of the Democratic state Senators walked out during the debate over the bill, two remained, allowing the bill to pass."

      "Hurricane Erin strengthened back into a Category 4 behemoth over the weekend, the latest shift in what has been a remarkably fast-changing storm.",
      "The hurricane\u2019s behavior in recent days makes it one of the fastest-strengthening Atlantic hurricanes on record, and yet another indication that climate change is increasing the risk of rapidly intensifying storms.",
      "Erin became the first hurricane of this year\u2019s Atlantic season on Friday and exploded in strength from a Category 1 into a Category 5 storm in a little over 24 hours. Even after it weakened and re-strengthened into a Category 4 storm, Erin\u2019s jaw-dropping transformation ranks it among the five fastest storms to grow from Category 1 to Category 5.",
      "The hurricane is expected to grow larger and strengthen even more on Monday as it passes east of the Bahamas, according to the National Hurricane Center\u2019s latest advisory. Heavy rainfall is forecasted for parts of Hispaniola on Monday, and for Turks and Caicos and parts of the southeast and Central Bahamas through Tuesday.",
      "But it\u2019s the storm\u2019s \u201crapid intensification\u201d that has experts taking note.",
      "Rapid intensification describes an increase in sustained wind speeds of at least 35 mph over a 24-hour period, according to the National Hurricane Center.",
      "Erin\u2019s maximum sustained wind speed increased around 75 mph in 24 hours, from Friday morning into Saturday.",
      "Climate change is increasing the risk of rapidly intensifying storms, primarily due to warmer-than-usual sea surface temperatures and high levels of moisture in the atmosphere \u2014 key ingredients needed for storms to gather strength.",
      "Erin's journey near the Bahamas on Monday will take it over warm waters hovering in the mid-80 degree Fahrenheit range, which could help it intensify further. A warmer atmosphere as a result of global warming also holds more moisture, which enables storms to gather strength and dump more rainfall over land.",
      "A 2023 study published in the journal Scientific Reports found that tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean were around 29% more likely to undergo rapid intensification from 2001 to 2020, compared to 1971 to 1990.",
      "Indeed, rapid intensification has been well documented in recent years. In 2019, Hurricane Dorian\u2019s peak winds increased from 150 mph to 185 mph in nine hours. Hurricane Ian in 2022 underwent two rounds of rapid intensification before it made landfall in Florida.",
      "Last year, Hurricane Milton\u2019s maximum sustained wind speed increased by an astonishing 90 mph in roughly 25 hours. Other recent examples of rapid intensification include Hurricane Harvey in 2017, Hurricane Laura in 2020, Hurricane Ida in 2021 and Hurricane Idalia in 2023.",
      "Still, the process of rapid intensification remains difficult to forecast. Scientists know that warm sea surface temperatures, moist air and favorable atmospheric conditions are necessary pieces of the puzzle, but understanding how it will happen for specific storms \u2014 and when \u2014 will require more research.",
      "In the coming days, the National Hurricane Center said Erin will move between Bermuda and the east coast of the United States.",
      "Though the storm is not expected to make a direct hit with land, the hurricane will generate swells, life-threatening surf and rip currents for the Bahamas, Bermuda, the eastern seaboard of the U.S. and Atlantic Canada."

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 In the plaza that Israelis have christened \u201cHostage Square,\u201d hundreds of thousands of people banged drums, shouted slogans and booed mentions of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others in his right-wing government.",
      "Some held pictures of those still in captivity in Gaza, others vented their frustration over plans for a new military offensive in some of the enclave\u2019s most populated areas that many Israelis fear could further endanger the lives of the remaining hostages, 20 to 50 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "Among the demonstrators at Sunday\u2019s protest was Ruby Chen, the father of Itay Chen, an Israeli American soldier who was among the 1,200 killed in the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, and whose body remains in Gaza.",
      "\u201cThe Jewish Bible speaks about the Jewish life,\u201d Chen told NBC News. \u201cLife comes before revenge, and that is exactly what we are asking for this government to remember.\u201d",
      "The protest in Tel Aviv on Sunday was one of dozens organized nationwide, including outside of politicians\u2019 homes, at military headquarters and on major highways. Demonstrators blocked lanes and lit bonfires. Some restaurants and theaters closed in solidarity. Police said they arrested 38 people.",
      "The nationwide marches were on the same day as a general strike called by organizations representing relatives of those still in captivity. One of those groups, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, said in a statement that nearly 1 million people had attended rallies nationwide.",
      "In Hostage Square, the boisterous atmosphere softened as former hostages and family members of those still being held took to the largest of three soundstages to demand the release of the remaining hostages. Around 250 people were taken hostage on Oct. 7.",
      "Many of the speeches, signs and prepared videos appealed directly to President Donald Trump in English, pleading with him to compel Netanyahu to \u201cseal the deal\u201d with Hamas.",
      "While Sunday\u2019s protests were among some of the largest and fiercest in 22 months of war, smaller demonstrations held on a weekly basis have yet to sway the government to end the conflict, which Netanyahu has said he is determined to continue until Hamas is completely destroyed.",
      "The prime minister and his top officials poured scorn on Sunday\u2019s demonstrations.",
      "\u201cThose who today call for an end to the war without defeating Hamas are not only hardening Hamas\u2019s position and delaying the release of our hostages, they are also ensuring that the horrors of Oct. 7 will be repeated,\u201d the prime minister told his Cabinet on Sunday.",
      "His ultranationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, one of the Cabinet's most hawkish right-wing voices, in a post on X called the protests a \u201ctoxic and harmful campaign that plays into the hands of Hamas, buries the hostages in tunnels, and tries to bring the State of Israel to surrender to its enemies and endanger its security and future.\u201d",
      "Their government\u2019s approach appears to have the backing of Trump. \u201cWe will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed,\u201d he wrote Monday on Truth Social. \u201cPlay to WIN, or don\u2019t play at all!\u201d",
      "While Israeli media reported that Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir met with senior officials on Sunday to finalize the plans for the expanded operations in Gaza, it remains unclear when the country\u2019s military will begin the new offensive in the north of the enclave and in what Netanyahu has called the \u201ccentral camps\u201d of Gaza.",
      "The U.N. humanitarian office said last week that 1.35 million people were already in need of emergency shelter items in Gaza, so any armored incursion could displace hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom have been uprooted multiple times during a war that has killed more than 62,000 people, according to health officials in the Hamas-run enclave.",
      "Two children were among five people who died of malnutrition-related causes, the Gaza Health Ministry said Monday, bringing the total number of malnutrition-related deaths to 263.",
      "The United Nations also warned that levels of starvation and malnutrition in Gaza are at their highest since the war began. Much of the aid destined for Gaza has been prevented from entering since Israel imposed a total blockade in March after ending a ceasefire. Deliveries have since partially resumed, though aid organizations say the flow is far below what is needed.",
      "In Hostage Square, some held up pictures of emaciated Palestinians, but many simply wanted an end to the fighting and a deal to free those hostages who remain in Gaza.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure that most of the Israelis are here with us now,\u201d said Keren Leibovitz, 54, whose son Tomer was killed on Oct. 7, 2023, while he was serving in the Israeli military.",
      "Leibovitz added that before Israel worked on completely defeating Hamas, the majority of her countrymen \u201cwant the war to end and they want the hostages to come back.\u201d"

      "The conservative cable news channel Newsmax will pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by the voting machine company Dominion over baseless claims that the 2020 presidential election was rigged, according to a new regulatory filing.",
      "The settlement averts what promised to be a high-profile trial.",
      "Newsmax and Dominion Voting Systems agreed to the settlement on Friday, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The payments will be made in three installments by January 2027, the filing said.",
      "\u201cWe are pleased to have settled this matter,\u201d a Dominion spokesperson said in response to a request for comment.",
      "In a statement, Newsmax said it \u201cbelieved it was critically important for the American people to hear both sides of the election disputes that arose in 2020.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe stand by our coverage as fair, balanced, and conducted within professional standards of journalism,\u201d the company added in part.",
      "No additional details were immediately available through the court records system in Delaware, where the defamation lawsuit was filed.",
      "In a complaint filed in August 2021, Dominion accused Newsmax of having \u201cmanufactured, endorsed, repeated and broadcast a series of verifiably false yet devastating lies about Dominion\u201d during and after the 2020 election.",
      "The \u201coutlandish and far-fetched fictions\u201d included that Dominion \u201ccommitted election fraud by rigging the 2020 Presidential Election\u201d and \u201cpaid kickbacks to government officials,\u201d according to the complaint.",
      "This year, a Delaware judge ruled that Newsmax had defamed Dominion but said a jury must decide whether the conservative news brand had done so with \u201cactual malice,\u201d which must be proved for a public figure to succeed in a defamation case.",
      "Newsmax previously agreed to pay $40 million to the voting technology company Smartmatic to settle another election defamation lawsuit.",
      "Newsmax is not the only conservative cable news channel that faced legal action over content aired around the 2020 election. Dominion and Fox News reached a staggering $787.5 million settlement in April 2023 hours after a trial jury was sworn in."

    "summary": "When Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
    "story": [
      "When Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired all of the members of an influential vaccine panel earlier this summer, he said the committee was \u201cplagued with persistent conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "But new research, published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, finds that the two major vaccine advisory committees have had record-low conflicts of interest for nearly the past decade.",
      "Kennedy has long held that members of the vaccine advisory panels to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration maintain close ties to the pharmaceutical industry. At his first confirmation hearing in January, Kennedy claimed that 97% of the CDC advisers had conflicts of interest.",
      "\u201cWhen he started citing these big statistics like 97%, I thought, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s really big,\u2019\u201d said lead study author Genevieve Kanter, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Southern California Sol Price School of Public Policy. \u201cWhen I started looking at the vaccine data, I wasn\u2019t really seeing those kinds of numbers.\u201d",
      "The study looked at how common conflicts of interest were over the last two decades for members of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the FDA\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC).",
      "During that time period, the vaccine panels each met about four times a year, with the most frequent meetings happening from 2016 through 2024.",
      "The study found that since 2016, only 6.2% of ACIP members and 1.9% of VRBPAC members have reported a conflict of interest at any given meeting.",
      "What\u2019s more, the type of conflict typically considered the most concerning \u2014 income from vaccine makers \u2014 had been virtually eliminated among both committees.",
      "Of those with reported conflicts of interest, less than 1% involved personal income from vaccine companies, such as consulting fees, royalties, stocks or ownership, the study found.",
      "Kanter said that in the early 2000s, conflicts of interest on the committees were much higher \u2014 peaking at 43% for ACIP in 2000 and 27% for VRBPAC in 2007.",
      "Back then, it was generally the accepted norm for advisory committee members to have conflicts of interest, she added.",
      "But starting around 2007 and 2012, members of the FDA\u2019s VRBPAC started to undergo a more stringent vetting process, including requirements to disclose conflicts of interest and recuse themselves from voting on vaccines for which conflicts exist, Kanter said. It\u2019s less clear when ACIP started to push for a more rigorous vetting process, she said.",
      "For ACIP, reported conflicts fell to 5% by 2024. For VRBPAC, reported conflicts have stayed below 4% since 2010, including 10 years where there were no reported conflicts at all.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re relatively low,\u201d Kanter said. \u201cAlthough there are certainly some who advocate for zero conflict or financial interests.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s difficult to create an advisory panel of experts with no conflicts of interests, she added.",
      "The panels are typically made up of top experts in the fields of infectious diseases, pediatrics, immunology and public health. Vaccine makers often reach out to these experts to oversee their clinical trials or to play an advisory role when developing a new product.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a balancing act,\u201d Kanter said. \u201cYou do want people who have done the clinical research on safety and efficacy.\u201d She added that her previous research has shown that people who have financial ties to the competitor of any given product being discussed often don\u2019t vote any differently than people who have no financial ties.",
      "In a statement, Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said: \u201cSecretary Kennedy is committed to eliminating both real and perceived conflicts to strengthen confidence in public health decisions.\u201d",
      "\u200b\u200bDorit Reiss, a vaccine policy expert at the University of California, San Francisco, said it\u2019s important for advisory panels to maintain low conflicts of interest because it helps prevent \u201cskewed decision-making.\u201d",
      "After Kennedy fired all 17 members of ACIP, he replaced them with eight new appointees, including several well-known vaccine critics. (One person dropped out before the committee\u2019s first meeting, leaving the group with seven.)",
      "\u201cAnti-vaccine activists define conflicts of interests differently than the rest of us,\u201d Reiss said. \u201cThey believe in a grand conspiracy where pharma controls the media and government, so for them, for example, an NIH grant would be a conflict of interest, or working in a health care organization.\u201d",
      "Several of Kennedy\u2019s new appointees, however, have ties to anti-vaccine groups or have served as expert witnesses in vaccine-related lawsuits, testifying on behalf of the plaintiffs suing vaccine makers.",
      "Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor who specializes in public health, said he wasn\u2019t surprised by the new study's findings, noting that it\u2019s common practice for committee members to recuse themselves from voting if a conflict arises.",
      "Gostin said he believes Kennedy\u2019s rationale for replacing ACIP members was a \u201cmere smoke screen for his real reason,\u201d which was to replace reputable vaccine scientists with anti-vaccine activists.",
      "\u201cMany if not most current members of ACIP have been closely associated with anti-vaccine advocacy groups, including the one previously led by Kennedy,\u201d he said."

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says that Bcc is a group of bacteria most commonly found in dirt and soil. It can spread between people and cause lung infections. Those with compromised immune systems are particularly at risk when they come into contact with Bcc. The good news: DermaRite Industries says they have not received any reports of illness.",

    "story": [
      "Wearing sunscreen is non-negotiable. Experts have told us over and over that applying it daily can lower your risk of developing skin cancer and prevent early signs of aging. And while there are some rules around the type of sunscreens that are best \u2014 like you should opt for a SPF 30 or higher \u2014 other things are generally thought to be dependent on personal preference. For example, some people may prefer a mineral option, while others like a chemical sunscreen. Formula consistency is another thing that has always been thought to be up to preference \u2014 silky serum, creamy lotion, whatever.",
      "But the US Food and Drug Administration just issued warnings to several popular sunscreen brands, suggesting that there is one type of sunscreen that is better left on the shelf. These brands all sell trendy mousse sunscreens (also called whipped sunscreen), and the FDA says this specific type of formulation may not be safe. Below, everything you need to know about this warning.",
      "Why is the FDA issuing warnings about mousse sunscreen?",
      "Whipped sunscreens from brands like Supergoop! and Vacation Inc. have been one of the trendier beauty products of the summer. But the FDA is letting consumers know that they should proceed with caution. On August 12, they posted a message on X that said, \u201cBeware of sunscreen products in mousse form because they might not be effective. The FDA issued five warning letters to companies marketing sunscreen products in mousse form.\u201d",
      "The FDA explained that regulations allow brands to market sunscreens as creams, lotions, sticks, sprays and a few other formulations \u2014 but they do not allow for mousse or whipped formulations. They also said that certain companies have created bottles that look like cans of whipped cream, which can put consumers at risk if ingested.",
      "The brands that received warning letters are Supergoop!, Vacation Inc., Kalani Sunwear, Fallian Cosmeceuticals (TiZo brand) and K & Care Organics. These letters don\u2019t necessarily mean the mousse sunscreens produced by these brands are unsafe. The FDA just requires that any new form is required to have sufficient data proving they are safe and effective \u2014 and those things haven\u2019t been submitted.",
      "The brands have 15 working days to respond. If they fail to comply, it is possible that the products could be pulled from the market.",
      "Other sunscreens we love",
      "The coming weeks will be very telling when it comes to mousse sunscreens and whether or not these companies address the concerns raised by the FDA.

      "LingLong Wei was diagnosed with thyroid cancer on June 26 last year in a health downturn that's \"directly related to events that took place during her time\" at MSU from 2008 and 2011 pursuing  a master\u2019s degree in horticulture, according to a lawsuit filed in Ingham County Circuit Court.",
      "\"During Ms. Wei\u2019s field research she was required by Michigan State University to spray dangerous amounts of hazardous pesticides and herbicides,\"  the civil complaint said,",
      "Wei claims she was exposed to herbicides that included paraquat dichloride, glyphosate and oxyfluorfen, which have been linked to cancer.",
      "Wei was not properly trained or given the proper training or protective equipment to work with such dangerous chemicals, the lawsuit said.",
      "With 20/20 hindsight, Wei blamed herself for not pushing the school for more safety protocols.",
      "\"Back then, when I was a student at MSU, I did speak up about my concerns, but no one listened,\" Wei told reporters in Lansing.",
      "\"I was scared because of how the department treated me. So I did not advocate strongly (enough) for my own protection, especially things I was told everything was OK and that exposure was harmless.\"",
      "Wei, a foreign student from China, said she's been left with a permanent scar near her throat due to her cancer and doesn't know if she'll be able to have children someday.",
      "She theorized that MSU didn't act on her concerns, assuming she'd soon be outside of the United States and thus no longer  MSU's concern.",
      "\"Too often, international students are overlooked because some assume they will return home after graduation, leaving their concerns unheard,\" Wei said.",
      "The former student's attorney, Maya Green, said her client was woefully ill-equipped to do the work MSU had her doing.",
      "\"She was subjected to hazardous pesticides without proper gloves, without proper protective equipment, without proper respiratory masks, without proper training,\" Green said.",
      "\"Ms. Wei was thrown out there to spray these pesticides and herbicides without being protected. Miss Wei was in a foreign country. Ms. Wei was speaking a foreign language, engaging in foreign activity at the disposal of Michigan State University.\"",
      "The former Michigan State student is seeking $100 million.",
      "\"Ms. Wei was constantly reassured that what she was doing was not harmful to her, and she relied on that. She relied on Michigan State University, she relied on her superiors, to her detriment.\"",
      "Michigan State spokesperson Amber McCann declined to discuss Wei's case.",
      "\"While we cannot offer comment on pending litigation, we do want to emphasize that Michigan State University prioritizes the health and safety of our entire campus community,\" McCann said.",
      "\"Appropriate and required training and necessary personal protective equipment is provided in compliance with applicable university policies and state and federal laws.\""

      "\"Rush is like 'The Hunger Games' for college girls,\" Morgan says in a video interview with TODAY.com.",

      "Morgan's mom, Lori Cadenhead, is right by Morgan's side in the interview, just as she is on the reality show, which follows Morgan's journey through the 2024 rush process at the University of Alabama. Morgan rushed for a second time in 2024 because she did not receive a bid in 2023.",
      "\"My mom was like, 'You should rush! That'd be so cool if you got in. And then we could do all the parent events and stuff,'\" Morgan says.",

And then I kept on bringing up the fact that these are your friends for life. I just wanted her to be part of something.\"",
      "Sorority rush season at the University of Alabama \u2014 Bama Rush for short \u2014 requires a whole new vocabulary with terms like PNMs (potential new members), OOTDs (outfits of the day) and RushTok (the corner of TikTok dedicated to videos about sorority rush week). Well-versed in RushTok, Morgan even posts an OOTD video for this very interview.",
      "In the episode airing on Sept. 1, viewers watch as Morgan gets dropped from rush the second year in a row ... but she certainly grows throughout the process.",
      "\u201cI was really sad because I put a lot into it,\u201d Morgan says. \u201cBut at the same time, it was a relief, because in order to be in a sorority, I would have had to do a complete 180. I don\u2019t know if I would have been 100% myself.\u201d",
      "In a video she posted on Bid Day 2024 that has 1.5 million views, Morgan said, \u201cTo everyone who was dropped or withdrew from recruitment, please remember this: We\u2019re all a part of a much larger sisterhood, one that\u2019s not defined by Greek letters.\"",
      "She also gave a special shoutout to her mom, who traveled from Florida to Tuscaloosa to support her daughter during rush week.",
      "Rush: Take Two",
      "When Morgan first began posting rush videos on TikTok in 2023, she stood out from other PNMs. She gained notoriety for chugging orange juice, dressing differently than other PNMs and perhaps not taking rush \"seriously\" enough.",
      "\"Rushing was a thing that you did, in a sense,\" Morgan explains of her first rush experience. \"It's a great way to meet your classmates before class starts. Is a great way to get connected with the other girls. It is a really nice bonding experience for a lot of the freshmen. So that's kind of why I did it.\"",
      "\"The second time I did it, it was largely because I'd seen what it was about, what they were doing, how they treated each other, how they acted, and I really wanted to be part of it,\" she says. \"I wanted it the second time more than I did the first, I think. I thought that if I gave it a real try, and was a little bit more sorority girl-ish, then maybe I would get in.\"",
      "Lori adds, \"I think there also might have been a little bit of a 'You guys didn't think I was good enough, but I promise I can do this.'\"",
      "Dealing With Negativity",
      "It can be hard for Lori to sit back and watch negative comments appear on Morgan's posts.",
      "\"it sucks. It really does,\" Lori says. \"Especially the last month when Morgan started talking about rush again, I feel like they're coming for her. The comments are just not 'sorority girl sisterhood' comments. Let's just put it that way.\"",
      "The ladies suspect that many of the most negative comments are coming from students on campus. \"They're making fake accounts quicker than their little fingers can type,\" Lori says.",
      "Luckily, however, she notes that her daughter has \"a pretty thick skin.\"",
      "Laughing, Morgan adds, \"I think that it bothers her more than it bothers me personally. I don't mind.\"",
      "In fact, Morgan would absolutely advise an incoming freshman to give Bama Rush a whirl.",
      "\"I'm not not self-aware enough to realize that my experience is one of one,\" she says. \"It was an interesting combination of social media and the way I acted that got me the results that I got. A normal freshman going through this process is not going to have to deal with anything that I've had to deal with.\"",
      "Life After Sorority Rush",
      "Morgan, who will be graduating from college in December, has found her people outside of sororities.",
      "\"I was part of book club. I tried fencing ... wasn't for me,\" she says, pausing for a laugh. \"I mostly just hang out on campus with my friends.\" She will also grab coffee with people who reach out to her via social media. \"One of my closest friends I met that way the first year that I rushed,\" she adds.",
      "Morgan is also funneling her creativity into writing a book. Spoiler alert: It's not about rush.",
      "\"It's a dystopian young adult book and the tagline is, 'What if every 10 years the government made you wipe your memory?'\" she says proudly.",
      "Morgan says she would consider writing about her rush experience, but, she says, \"I'd have to leave school before we ever touch that.\"",

      "Accompanying a countdown the night of Aug. 13, a series of colored locks popped up at the bottom of the site. Dedicated Swift fans knew: Something was coming.",
      "The colored locks \u2014 orange, red, blue and silver \u2014 turned out to be deluxe editions of her previously announced 12th studio, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl.\u201d Many online users predicted this, and when 7 p.m. ET rolled around, they were proven right.",
      "Now, after listening closely, zooming in on Swift\u2019s background and crunching some numbers, fans think the \u201cNew Heights\u201d episode has even more Easter eggs, which are subtle hints at her next big musical or career move.",
      "Swifties have since formulated a big theory: The international pop sensation will perform at the Super Bowl halftime show.",
      "The halftime performer for the 2026 Super Bowl has not yet been announced, so all fan theories are pure speculation at this point. (For context, Kendrick Lamar was announced as the Apple Music Super Bowl 59 Halftime Show performer Sept. 8, 2024.)",
      "What we do know is that the 2026 Super Bowl marks the 60th NFL championship, and the game will be played at Levi\u2019s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, on Feb. 8, 2026. Levi's Stadium is home to the San Francisco 49ers.",
      "Below, we break down three \u201cclues\u201d that some Swift fans are latching onto as they try to predict what\u2019s ahead for the singer.",
      "All That Sourdough Talk",
      "Swift\u2019s \u201cNew Heights\u201d episode featured a rare look inside the singer\u2019s life. Speaking with the co-hosts \u2014 her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and his brother, Jason Kelce \u2014 she spilled on the beginning of her high-profile romance with the footballer, discussed the recent purchase of her master recordings and finally, previewed her upcoming 12th album.",
      "She also dished on her daily life outside of performing for millions, admitting that she has \u201cgranny\u201d hobbies, which, in her words, \u201ccould be categorized as hobbies you could have had in the 1700s.\u201d",
      "Specifically, she was eager to talk about baking sourdough bread, and revealed some of the flavors she\u2019s made, including cinnamon swirl, blueberry lemon and Funfetti.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really talking about bread 60% of the time now,\u201d Swift said.",
      "Swift is know for being very intentional with her words and actions. For example: She teased that her 11th album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d would actually be a double album by pointedly holding up two fingers during her Grammys acceptance speech in February 2024. She subtly confirmed the Easter egg when she announced the double album on Instagram and included a peace sign emoji.",
      "In a similar vein, intrepid Swifties quickly connected a few dots from this sourdough conversation.",
      "They theorized that 60% might not have been a random number, and instead could have been a reference to Super Bowl 60. Plus, the mascot for the San Francisco 49ers, the home team of Super Bowl 60's Levi\u2019s Stadium, is none other than a gold miner named \u2026 Sourdough Sam.",
      "The official TikTok account for the 49ers has joined in on the fun. The team posted a TikTok amid the flurry of speculation, a video of Levi's Stadium's exterior set to the memorable line of dialogue from \u201cJersey Shore,\u201d \u201cWhat's going on here? Why is everyone acting weird towards me?\u201d",
      "\u201cweird that 4+9 is\u202613,\u201d one user commented on the post, referring to a number long associated with Swift.",
      "Crunching the Numbers",
      "In addition to a passing mention of 60%, Swifties also clocked a few other seemingly random numbers the singer mentioned during her two-hour \u201cNew Heights\u201d interview. At the start, she thanked Jason Kelce for his enthusiastic introduction, saying, \u201cThank you for screaming for, like, 47 seconds for me.\u201d",
      "Later in the episode, when asked how many countries she performed the \u201cEras Tour\u201d in, she answered: 47,000. (The actual answer is 21 countries.)",
      "Some fans dug into that number and realized that the 47th show of Swift\u2019s record-breaking \u201cEras Tour\u201d was at Levi\u2019s Stadium.",
      "They also pointed out that adding Swift\u2019s lucky number, 13 \u2014 the \u201cNew Heights\u201d episode fittingly dropped on Aug. 13 \u2014 to 47, they equal 60. Plus, the 2025-2026 NFL season will mark Swift\u2019s beau Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce\u2019s 13th season.",
      "To fans\u2019 credit, Swift said on the podcast that when it comes to planting an Easter egg, \u201cI love numerology. I love math stuff. I love dates.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m never going to plant an Easter egg that ties back to my personal life,\u201d Swift added. \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be toward music or something I\u2019m coming up with, something I have coming up, a plan I have coming together \u2014 something that you don\u2019t know that I\u2019m saying for a specific reason that you\u2019ll hear later and you\u2019ll go back and be like, \u2018Oh my god.\u2019\u201d",
      "A Glimpse of a Super Bowl Trophy",
      "Then, there\u2019s the background of the \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast. Swift and Travis Kelce recorded the podcast together and sat in front of a bookshelf that we already know was filled with Easter eggs.",
      "In the background, fans spotted four boxes in orange, red, blue and silver, labeled with \u201cT.S.\u201d on the front. Like the locks on the website, we now know those boxes represented the four deluxe editions of \u201cThe Life of the Showgirl.\u201d",
      "Also on the shelf? A statue resembling the iconic Vince Lombardi trophy, awarded to each year\u2019s Super Bowl champs. (An important note: Both Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce have won the Super Bowl with their respective NFL teams, so spying that trophy isn\u2019t necessarily out of the ordinary.)",
      "The trophy is positioned on the shelf on its side, which some fans argue could be a play on it being \u201chalfway,\u201d ergo, a wink at the halftime show.",
      "\u201cI want Easter eggs to be a certain thing, where if you are a part of the fandom and you want to experience music in a normal way, then you don\u2019t even see these,\u201d Swift said during the podcast. \u201cYou don\u2019t even care what that thing is above that doorway, under that dimly lit flickering light over there that\u2019s upside down in Braille. You don\u2019t need to know what that is.\u201d",
      "During that moment, some TikTok users slowed down the footage of Swift and think she may have pointing to the trophy and purposefully leaning to the side to put it in view."

      "Bob Odenkirk reprises his role as Hutch Mansell, an off-the-books government assassin, in \u201cNobody 2.\u201d",
      "The new film, now out in theaters, is a follow up to Odenkirk's 2021 film \u201cNobody,\u201d which introduced the actor as a middle-class working suburban dad with a lethal past.",
      "In the first film, Hutch\u2019s seemingly domestic life unravels after two intruders break into his home. His decision not to fight back strains his marriage and leaves him questioning whom he has become. When a bus fight puts him up against Russian mobster Yulian Kuznetsov, Hutch enlists help from his father, David (Christopher Lloyd), and brother Harry (RZA) to take down Kuznetsov's crew. The film ends with Hutch and his family moving into a new home \u2014 but their return to normal appears to be short-lived when Hutch receives a phone call that suggests his assassin days aren\u2019t quite over yet.",
      "Now, four years later in \u201cNobody 2,\u201d Hutch is still trying to keep his two worlds apart. \u201cIt\u2019s basically about work-life balance but with an assassin as the worker,\u201d Odenkirk tells TODAY.com in an exclusive interview.",
      "Read on to learn more about \u201cNobody 2\u201d and what Odenkirk has to say about the possibility of a \u201cNobody 3\u201d and other sequels.",
      "(Warning: Spoilers from \u201cNobody 2\u201d below\u2026)",
      "What Happens in 'Nobody 2'?",
      "\u201cNobody 2\u201d opens with Hutch going through the motions of being a contract killer for the government while balancing being an involved dad and devoted husband. Though he feels he's found a way to manage both, Odenkirk tells TODAY.com Hutch knows that's far from the truth.",
      "\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s got a balance in his life, but he knows he\u2019s wrong ... (though) he wishes he did,\u201d Odenkirk says. \u201cHe has his actions, his missions that he\u2019s doing, and he enjoys those. And then he\u2019s got his family, which he is kind of ignoring, and he starts to become very aware of the fact that he\u2019s not staying connected with his family because he\u2019s just too preoccupied.\u201d",
      "In an effort to reconnect with his family, Hutch takes his wife, kids and dad on a summer vacation to a run-down theme park in Plummerville, where his dad once took him and his brother to when they were kids. But his promising family plans quickly unravel when Hutch gets into a dust-up with the local sheriff.",
      "\u201cThe vacation is filled, as most vacations can be, with annoyances and problems and shortcomings, and then that all builds up inside him, and he explodes,\u201d Odenkirk tells TODAY.com.",
      "As tensions mount, Hutch\u2019s instincts take over, and the trip turns into something much more dangerous when he discovers that Plummerville is a base for a massive bootlegging operation. What begins as a chance to bond with his family soon becomes another mission.",
      "In the official trailer, Hutch is seen in brutal physical fights, while his wife Becca (Connie Nielsen) urges him to \u201cfix it\u201d \u2014 a clear sign he\u2019s right back in the kind of high-stakes conflict he can\u2019t seem to avoid.",
      "Though the comedy action film leans more towards \"John Wick\" than \"National Lampoon's Vacation,\" Odenkirk says the film offers relatable moments.",
      "\u201cGetting the garbage out on garbage day and not making it to your son\u2019s basketball games because you are working and trying to plan a vacation,\" Odenkirk explains. \"These are all things I think people can relate to.\u201d",
      "How Does 'Nobody 2' End?",
      "\u201cNobody 2\u201d ends with a blow out fight between Hutch and his crew and the local police force and mobsters who work for Lendina (Sharon Stone) \u2014 the ruthless crime boss who runs the bootlegging operation through Plummerville. Hutch becomes Lendina's target after he meddles in her operation by saving the theme park operator's son, whom she had kidnapped, and burning down her massive fortune.",
      "Odenkirk calls the \u201clast third of the film ... a James Bond film, but with a family involved.\u201d It includes explosions, large-scale action sequences and an ending that circles back to Hutch\u2019s core conflict: protecting his family while accepting who he really is.",
      "In the end, Lendina and her crew are eliminated after a fiery and  intense battle that ultimately brings the family together following their harrowing experience.",

      "While most end-credits and post-credits scenes help to wrap up any loose ends from the film or tease the next chapter in a franchise, the final scene in \u201cNobody 2\u201d only offers snapshots of what happened during the family's action-packed vacation in Plummerville. It includes pictures taken by Hutch's daughter that show various moments from their vacation and epic battle at the amusement park.",
      "Will There Be a 'Nobody 3'?",
      "In an exclusive interview with TODAY.com, Odenkirk says he would be down to do another \u201cNobody\u201d sequel, officially reprising his role of Hutch.",
      "\u201cI want a 'Nobody 3' and a 'Nobody 4,'\u201d he says. But, according to Odenkirk, there has yet to be an official conversation to get the ball rolling on it.",
      "\u201cIf the audience likes it \u2026 they decide, not us,\u201d he explains.",
      "On the date of publication, \u201cNobody 2\u201d has already scored a 77% score on Rotten Tomatoes from critics and a 91% audience score.",
      "What Does Bob Odenkirk Say About 'Nobody 3'?",
      "Whether or not a third \u201cNobody\u201d film gets green-lit, Odenkirk already has a specific direction in mind. Just as \u201cNobody 2\u201d is set four years after the first film, he sees the next installment reflecting another time jump, four years after \u201cNobody 2.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow those kids are older, Hutch really needs to reconnect before they split apart,\u201d he says of his on-screen children, Sammy (Paisley Cadorath) and Brady (Gage Munroe). In a potential third film, Odenkirk says his son would now be a 22-year-old adult, which could bring \u201canother level of trying to stay connected and a different set of tensions and challenges.\u201d",
      "Aside from all the action, Odenkirk says the balance of relatable family dynamics is at the heart of the series. \u201cThese films are meant to ... connect with our audience and connect this character on a common shared sense of family tension, and then let them become part of an action movie.\u201d",
      "He also says there could be space for Becca's backstory, which he revealed they filmed for \"Nobody 2.\"",
      "\"We know that backstory. In fact, we wrote it into \u2018Nobody 2,\u2019 but we didn\u2019t shoot it because we didn\u2019t have room in the story,\" Odenkirk tells TODAY.com. \"But we do know who Hutch and Becca are. We do know how they met, and we do know that they both know, if they cast their minds back to how they met, they both know that they are with a kick a-- spouse, and sometimes they forget that.\"",

      "(Warning: Spoilers from \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d below\u2026)",
      "Nearly 20 years after their last collaboration, Denzel Washington and Spike Lee are teaming up again for a crime thriller that shows the two-time-Oscar-winning actor going to great lengths to protect his family and his music empire.",
      "Lee\u2019s \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d a modern re-imagining of the 1963 film \u201cHigh and Low\u201d by Japanese auteur Akira Kurosawa (which was a loosely based on Ed McBain's 1959 novel \u201cKing\u2019s Ransom\u201d), introduces audiences to Washington\u2019s character, David King, a music mogul at a New York City music label called Stackin\u2019 Hits Records. David intends to thwart a merger at the company so he can buy the label and have complete control of the company he helped build. But on the day of his planned business deal, David receives a call from a mysterious man who says he has abducted him son, Trey (Aubrey Joseph), and will not return him safely until he receives $17.5 million.",
      "David tells the police he will pay the ransom but changes his mind once he learns that the kidnapper accidentally took the son of his driver, Paul, played by Jeffrey Wright. Despite the mix up, the abductor calls again and says he still wants David to fork over the money or Paul\u2019s son, Kyle (Elijah Wright), will die.",
      "The ruthless unknown figure making demands at the other end of the line is played by rapper A$AP Rocky. During the movie\u2019s final act, Washington and A$AP Rocky\u2019s characters come face-to-face for the first time in two intense scenes, exchanging bars and jabs. There\u2019s an effortlessness to the back-and-forth between them, a groove that is also felt in the way Washington carries himself the entire film.",
      "Washington tells TODAY.com that reuniting with Lee and making \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d their sixth film together and first since 2006\u2019s \u201cInside Man,\u201d felt familiar.",
      "\u201cIt was just like (an) old hat, you know, like putting the glove back on,\u201d he says about their reunion. \u201cBang, here we go. There\u2019s a rhythm to it.\u201d",
      "Below, Washington and Wright break down pivotal scenes in \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d and discuss working with each other and A$AP Rocky. Read on to find out what the two co-stars shared and how the \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d ends.",
      "Jeffrey Wright Unpacks Heart-Wrenching Scene With Denzel Washington",
      "After learning that his son is safe, David is reluctant to pay the ransom, knowing that if he does then he won\u2019t have enough money to buy back ownership of Stackin\u2019 Hits Records. During one of the most emotional moments in the movie, Paul goes to his boss and pleads with him to help bring his son home. Wright opens up about shooting the taxing scene to TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the critical question (at the center of the film): \u2018What would you do?\u2019 But in this case, I am in the middle of it,\u201d says Wright. The Academy Award nominee adds that having his son Elijah portray Kyle \u2014 in his feature film debut \u2014 made the scene feel more real.",
      "\u201cAs a father, with my son Elijah playing the role, that helped kind of intensify the stakes for me,\u201d Wright shares. \u201cIt\u2019s also a little bit of this edge in there, this challenge in there, because you\u2019re coming with your hand out in a place of almost helplessness.\u201d",
      "He continues, \u201cSo, I wanted to make sure that that was done, but he was able to maintain his sense of dignity at the same time, being completely exposed to the hard facts of the danger that his son was in.\u201d",
      "Wright explains that the conversation is portrayed differently in Kurosawa\u2019s film \u2014 which follows a wealthy shoe executive named Kingo (Toshiro Mifune) whose family becomes the target of a ruthless kidnapper \u2014 because it represents the differences in social classes specific to Japanese culture.",
      "He says his character\u2019s \u201cHigh and Low\u201d counterpart (Aoki, played by Yutaka Sada) is \u201ccompletely submissive, almost to the point of he\u2019s completely powerless. I wanted to see if I could kind of right the balance there a little bit.\u201d",
      "But David remains unconvinced he should pay the hefty ransom following Paul\u2019s emotional plea and rejects him. It isn\u2019t until the music titan has a harsh heart-to-heart with his own son that he changes his mind.",
      "David agrees to meet A$AP Rocky\u2019s character, later revealed to be aspiring rapper Yung Felon, while working with authorities to set a trap. He rides the subway to the Yankee Stadium stop in the Bronx and accidentally drops the backpack containing the $17.5 million and a tracking device. Through a series of diversions, Yung Felon evades the police and gets away with the cash. He honors his word and sets Kyle free, leaving the teen bloodied and bruised in a park.",
      "What Happens at the End of \u2018Highest 2 Lowest\u2019?",
      "Although David is seen as a local hero, his fellow music executives realize that he used their money for the ransom and threaten to sue him for breach of contract. He leaves his office and decides to stroll the Brooklyn Bridge and listen to songs from artists who sent demos to the label in hopes of receiving a record deal. David, with the self-described \u201cbest ears in the business,\u201d notices that one of the tracks features an artist with the same voice as the kidnapper.",
      "When the police aren\u2019t quick to investigate his theory, David and Paul follow a tip that leads them to Yung Felon\u2019s apartment and later to a studio where he is recording a song. David, armed, goes into the studio alone and confronts Yung Felon. The young artist calls out David for not recognizing his talents sooner, blaming the exec for his lack of success in life.",
      "Washington praises A$AP Rocky\u2019s performance in their scenes together, telling TODAY.com, \u201cHe came in ready, and so did I, and we just hit the ball back and forth across the net. It was simple. It was easy because he was prepared, and so was I.\u201d",
      "The 70-year-old actor adds, \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful young artist. He\u2019s a wonderful young actor, and the sky\u2019s the limit for him.\u201d",
      "Yung Felon fires a gunshot at David before running away and boarding a train. But David is right behind him, and the two fight before the mogul gains the upper hand. Yung Felon is arrested and publicly claims he is innocent as he arrives at a courthouse surrounded by supporters. Privately, he accepts a plea deal to go to prison for a couple decades. He also has a final request: to speak to David one more time.",
      "The two sit down, separated by a glass partition, for another sparring of words. Yung Felon says his popularity has caused his song to skyrocket on charts around the world. He says multiple labels are interested in him, but he wants David to sign him. David rebuffs his offer, revealing that he no longer works for Stackin\u2019 Hits Records and is starting a smaller, independent label. Yung Felon becomes enraged as he is dragged away by guards.",
      "In the final scene, David meets with a new artist named Sula (Aiyana-Lee), discovered by his son, who wants to be a star. She sings an original song for him, titled \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d before David promises to make her dream come true.",
      "At the end of the film it's revealed the David's new label will be a family managed business."

      "Odenkirk\u2019s character, who was first introduced in the Bryan Cranston-led crime drama \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d received a spinoff series in 2015 that served as an origin story for Saul Goodman. It followed the Albuquerque, New Mexico criminal defense attorney, born Jimmy McGill, and his transformation from aspiring lawyer to the ambitious, and at times morally ambiguous, lawyer with ties to the criminal underworld.",
      "Created and executive produced by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, the same team behind \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d ended with Odenkirk\u2019s character serving an 86-year prison sentence after confessing to his crimes, which included supporting Walter White (Cranston)\u2019s drug operation and acknowledging the role he played in Howard\u2019s death.",
      "In an exclusive interview with TODAY.com on Aug. 14, Odenkirk shares his thoughts on a \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d follow-up and details on his character's specific storyline.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not getting out (of prison). If there\u2019s another Saul show, it takes place inside prison,\u201d he says emphatically, noting that the story would follow Saul's life behind bars.",
      "Odenkirk, who has played Saul Goodman for over a decade while on both AMC series, recognizes the impact his character has had on him both personally and professionally. \u201cThat part turned my life around, and I\u2019ve given more to that part than anything I\u2019ve done, \u201c he says.",
      "He's also aware of the strain it's put on him, telling The Hollywood Reporter that after years of playing Saul, in addition to his \u201cNobody\u201d character of Hutch, a highly-skilled assassin, he's \u201cfine with moving on\u201d from them.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re guys who, for different reasons, have pretty big chips on their shoulders, and that\u2019s hard to play after a while,\u201d Odenkirk told the outlet. \u201cYou can\u2019t just carry that guy around all the time.\u201d",
      "But, Odenkirk reveals to TODAY.com, a \"Better Call Saul\" revival is not out of the question. The actor exclusively tells us what it would take for him to reprise his \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d character and jump back into that universe.",
      "\u201cVince Gilligan and Peter Gould created that show. There are some of the best writers who ever worked in TV,\u201d he says. \u201cSo if they were to think of something in that world, of course I would do it.\u201d",
      "Though Odenkirk admits he would be up for the challenge, he feels it might be bit of a long shot.",
      "\u201cBut I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he says of a \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d sequel or spinoff happening. \u201cI think they\u2019ve all moved on to some more amazing projects that you\u2019ll soon see.\u201d",
      "Odenkirk is referring to Gilligan\u2019s new Apple TV+ sci-fi drama called \u201cPluribus,\u201d which stars his \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d co-star Rhea Seehorn.",
      "The series, which has already been picked up for two seasons by Apple TV+, is described as a \u201cpsychological sci-fi drama set in a reimagined version of modern-day Albuquerque.\u201d Though official plot details have not yet been released, Odenkirk tells TODAY.com that the new show is \u201cgoing to be a great one.\u201d",
      "\u201cLook forward to the best written show on TV for years to come,\u201d he teases of the new series.",
      "While fans will have to wait until November 7 to see \u201cPluribus\u201d hit the small screen, Odenkirk\u2019s new action film, \u201cNobody 2,\u201d is now available in theaters nationwide.",
      "(\u201cNobody 2,\u201d a Universal film, is owned by TODAY.com\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.)"

      "For more than a decade, the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine \u2014 of which Kramatorsk is one of the largest cities still holding out \u2014 has been the focal point of intense battles and diplomatic disputes.",
      "For Kyiv, the Donbas is a vital industrial hub and defensive buffer, a resource-rich region that Ukraine fiercely claims as its sovereign territory with deep cultural roots.",
      "For the Kremlin, it is both a tactical target and a political lever, with Putin framing the region as historically linked to Russia while placing it at the heart of the territorial ambitions he has pursued with military force.",
      "Its fate may now be decided in the Oval Office rather than on the battlefield.",
      "What is the Donbas?",
      "Made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Donbas is an industrial powerhouse spanning roughly 20,000 square miles, making it roughly the size of West Virginia. It is rich in coal and metal deposits, and shaped by industrial towns and strategically important ports on the Sea of Azov.",
      "After Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, Moscow-backed separatists fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, a conflict that lasted eight years and killed an estimated 14,000 people, according to the United Nations.",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has vowed that Ukraine will not hand over the Donbas in exchange for peace. The region serves as a defensive buffer and a center of industry, and giving it up would weaken the country military and economically.",
      "While Ukraine is deeply fatigued by the war, about 75% of Ukrainians also object to formally ceding any land to Russia, according to polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology."

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 In the plaza that Israelis have christened \u201cHostage Square,\u201d hundreds of thousands of people banged drums, shouted slogans and booed mentions of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others in his right-wing government.",
      "Some held pictures of those still in captivity in Gaza, others vented their frustration over plans for a new military offensive in some of the enclave\u2019s most populated areas that many Israelis fear could further endanger the lives of the remaining hostages, 20 to 50 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "Among the demonstrators at Sunday\u2019s protest was Ruby Chen, the father of Itay Chen, an Israeli American soldier who was among the 1,200 killed in the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, and whose body remains in Gaza.",
      "\u201cThe Jewish Bible speaks about the Jewish life,\u201d Chen told NBC News. \u201cLife comes before revenge, and that is exactly what we are asking for this government to remember.\u201d",
      "The protest in Tel Aviv on Sunday was one of dozens organized nationwide, including outside of politicians\u2019 homes, at military headquarters and on major highways. Demonstrators blocked lanes and lit bonfires. Some restaurants and theaters closed in solidarity. Police said they arrested 38 people.",
      "The nationwide marches were on the same day as a general strike called by organizations representing relatives of those still in captivity. One of those groups, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, said in a statement that nearly 1 million people had attended rallies nationwide.",
      "In Hostage Square, the boisterous atmosphere softened as former hostages and family members of those still being held took to the largest of three soundstages to demand the release of the remaining hostages. Around 250 people were taken hostage on Oct. 7.",
      "Many of the speeches, signs and prepared videos appealed directly to President Donald Trump in English, pleading with him to compel Netanyahu to \u201cseal the deal\u201d with Hamas.",
      "While Sunday\u2019s protests were among some of the largest and fiercest in 22 months of war, smaller demonstrations held on a weekly basis have yet to sway the government to end the conflict, which Netanyahu has said he is determined to continue until Hamas is completely destroyed.",
      "The prime minister and his top officials poured scorn on Sunday\u2019s demonstrations.",
      "\u201cThose who today call for an end to the war without defeating Hamas are not only hardening Hamas\u2019s position and delaying the release of our hostages, they are also ensuring that the horrors of Oct. 7 will be repeated,\u201d the prime minister told his Cabinet on Sunday.",
      "His ultranationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, one of the Cabinet's most hawkish right-wing voices, in a post on X called the protests a \u201ctoxic and harmful campaign that plays into the hands of Hamas, buries the hostages in tunnels, and tries to bring the State of Israel to surrender to its enemies and endanger its security and future.\u201d",
      "Their government\u2019s approach appears to have the backing of Trump. \u201cWe will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed,\u201d he wrote Monday on Truth Social. \u201cPlay to WIN, or don\u2019t play at all!\u201d",
      "While Israeli media reported that Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir met with senior officials on Sunday to finalize the plans for the expanded operations in Gaza, it remains unclear when the country\u2019s military will begin the new offensive in the north of the enclave and in what Netanyahu has called the \u201ccentral camps\u201d of Gaza.",
      "The U.N. humanitarian office said last week that 1.35 million people were already in need of emergency shelter items in Gaza, so any armored incursion could displace hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom have been uprooted multiple times during a war that has killed more than 62,000 people, according to health officials in the Hamas-run enclave.",
      "Two children were among five people who died of malnutrition-related causes, the Gaza Health Ministry said Monday, bringing the total number of malnutrition-related deaths to 263.",
      "The United Nations also warned that levels of starvation and malnutrition in Gaza are at their highest since the war began. Much of the aid destined for Gaza has been prevented from entering since Israel imposed a total blockade in March after ending a ceasefire. Deliveries have since partially resumed, though aid organizations say the flow is far below what is needed.",
      "In Hostage Square, some held up pictures of emaciated Palestinians, but many simply wanted an end to the fighting and a deal to free those hostages who remain in Gaza.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure that most of the Israelis are here with us now,\u201d said Keren Leibovitz, 54, whose son Tomer was killed on Oct. 7, 2023, while he was serving in the Israeli military.",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 As U.S. television series produce longer and fewer episodes, a new genre from China is gaining American fans by going in the opposite direction.",
      "Known as minidramas, micro dramas or vertical dramas, they are soap operas condensed into a minute or two per episode.",
      "Each show, reminiscent of a telenovela, is divided into dozens of chapters, each about two minutes long and with all the soapy elements: cheesy romance, over-the-top drama and abundant cliff-hangers.",
      "\u201cThe revenge ones, oh, my God, they\u2019re so good,\u201d California-based retail business owner Jacarius Murphy told NBC News in a video interview.",
      "Murphy is a fan of the minidramas, known as duanju in Chinese, which focus heavily on romance, revenge and fantasy. The stories tend to involve wealthy characters such as a chief executive who\u2019s secretly a vampire or a billionaire living a double life \u2014 characters often played by American actors.",
      "\u201cPeople want this fast dopamine hit, and they can snack on it while they\u2019re waiting,\u201d said Anina Net, an American actor based in Los Angeles who has worked on minidramas for the past four years.",
      "The genre originated in China, where production companies have tapped into the popularity of short-form, vertical-produced, TikTok-style video content. About half of China\u2019s 1.4 billion people consume dramas in this style, according to a report released in March by the state-owned China Netcasting Services Association.",
      "The industry made $6.9 billion in revenue last year, more than China\u2019s total box office sales.",
      "The shows are \u201cstill quite limited in genre, mostly romance-focused, with sweet, domineering CEO tropes and modern settings,\u201d said Kaidi Dai, a Shanghai-based minidrama producer.",
      "Now, having figured out the Chinese market, the same companies are expanding into the U.S., where minidramas are finding success just a few years after the failure of Quibi, a short-lived, short-form mobile streaming service. The shows are available on platforms such as ReelShort, DramaBox and GoodShort, which offers free episodes and in-app purchases, as well as subscriptions.",
      "Minidramas cost far less to make than standard TV shows and can make millions of dollars in revenue through a combination of user purchases and advertising. But adapting them to the U.S. market takes some tweaking, said Chinese filmmaker Gao Feng, also known as Frank Tian, who has a minidrama production company based in New York.",
      "Rather than remaking Chinese shows, his company hired longtime U.S. residents to craft stories that would appeal to American audiences.",
      "\u201cI believe that scripts determine 65-70% of a project\u2019s success,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cApart from werewolves, CEO romances and hidden identities, we should explore new genres.\u201d",
      "While many short dramas have been based on successful Chinese stories, \u201cif a platform cannot innovate continuously, it will face significant challenges,\u201d he added.",
      "Among the most popular shows is \u201cThe Double Life of My Billionaire Husband,\u201d which tells the story of a woman whose husband is better off financially than he appears. All 60 episodes can be viewed in less than 70 minutes on ReelShort, the California-based, Chinese-backed minidrama platform that released it in 2023.",
      "\u201cHilariously bad, oddly addictive,\u201d reads one IMDb review of the show, which had more than 485 million views on ReelShort as of Friday.",
      "The Chinese-backed short-video app has vied with TikTok as the most popular product in the entertainment section of Apple\u2019s U.S. app store.",
      "\u201cThe short videos on TikTok have laid a solid foundation for the popularity of short dramas,\u201d Yan Min, who helped organize an industry conference in China last year, said in an interview.",
      "Min said ReelShort and other companies were advertising on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok to attract new users, catering to the \u201cevolving viewing habits of younger generations, who have grown up with platforms like TikTok and are accustomed to short, engaging content.\u201d",
      "U.S. entertainment companies have taken notice of the trend. Netflix said in May that it was testing a vertical feed made up of clips from its shows and movies, while Disney said last month that it was investing in DramaBox through its accelerator program.",
      "Though minidramas seeking U.S. audiences are increasingly using actors with American backgrounds, they often shoot in scenic Chinese locations like the coastal city of Qingdao, with its Western-style villas and architecture, for greater authenticity.",
      "\u201cWe seek actors and screenwriters who grew up in the U.S. and naturally embody an American style. Then we incorporate some Chinese elements,\u201d said Ann An, a Beijing-based freelance producer for several minidramas made for foreign audiences.",
      "Turnarounds are incredibly fast in the industry as producers strive to keep costs low. An said a show can finish filming in 10 days, with a budget of under $70,000.",
      "The biggest key to the success of minidramas, though, is the cliff-hangers, which push viewers to keep paying for the next episode.",
      "\u201cThe scriptwriters know exactly where to place these cliff-hangers, and they execute them very well,\u201d said Apple Yang, a minidrama director based in London.",
      "That helps explain the appeal of minidramas even if their overall quality is sometimes \u201cunderwhelming,\u201d said Ying Zhu, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University\u2019s Academy of Film.",
      "\u201cMake the dialogue real and less mechanic. Make it funny when possible and biting when needed,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cOne minute can pack in a lot of info if done well.\u201d"

    "summary": "Arab governments that have been advocates for the Palestinian cause are now facing criticism for their response to the suffering in Gaza caused by Israel's war.",
    "story": [
      "Arab governments that for decades have been fierce advocates for the Palestinian cause are now facing criticism for their timid response to the extreme suffering in Gaza caused by Israel's war, risking a dangerous rift with their increasingly restive citizens.",
      "As deaths from starvation and Israeli bombardment have mounted, Palestinians, their supporters and some analysts have directed their anger toward Arab rulers in the region whom they perceive as being too passive and quiet. They point to countries outside the Middle East who have publicly criticized Israel and tried to stop it from expanding its military operations in Gaza.",
      "\u201cWhere are the Arabs? The Arabs are napping. The Arabs are nowhere to be seen. The Arabs, and I\u2019m talking about the Arab rulers, have buried their heads in the sand,\u201d said Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics.",
      "The situation in Gaza has become even more dire as Palestinians risk their lives to get food. An aid distribution system implemented by the U.S. and the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has led to hundreds more Palestinians being killed, often by Israeli soldiers.",
      "Wafaa Eeed, a Palestinian woman in Gaza, told NBC News last month that she had walked several miles to a GHF aid distribution site on July 24, a day set aside only for women. She and two other witnesses said they were shot at, pepper-sprayed and tear-gassed.",
      "\u201cArab states, why don\u2019t you help us? We don\u2019t want the Americans,\u201d Eeed said.",
      "Two women were killed on their way to the site, a Gaza health official said. The GHF said at the time that there were \u201cno incidents\u201d at the site itself.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said that \"troops operating in the Rafah area identified suspects who approached them, posing a threat to the troops\" and fired warning shots.",
      "It was not aware of casualties, and the shots were fired \"hundreds of meters away\" from the GHF site before its opening hours, it said.",
      "Israel also denies there is starvation in Gaza, contradicting medics in the Palestinian enclave, global aid groups and even a close ally, President Donald Trump.",
      "Some Arab leaders dependent on American aid and security guarantees are wary of angering the U.S. and Israel and see little strategic advantage in helping Palestinians, whom they may even see as a threat, experts say.",
      "Arab states have participated in airdrops of aid and food convoys into Gaza, but Palestinians and aid groups say it\u2019s nowhere near enough to ward off a looming famine. Egypt and Qatar have also mediated talks among Israel, the U.S. and Hamas, but they have not led to an end to the conflict.",
      "Several Latin American states, along with Spain, Ireland and Norway, have blasted Israel for its conduct in Gaza and threatened sanctions or a downgrade of diplomatic ties.",
      "And in recent weeks, longtime Israeli allies like France and Australia have pledged to officially recognize Palestine \u2014 a move decried by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government. In late 2023, South Africa filed a case with the United Nations\u2019 top court alleging that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.",
      "Arab states have been much less vocal, with Egypt and Jordan even cracking down on pro-Palestinian protests and activism, fearing they could turn against the country\u2019s leaders, experts say.",
      "\u201cPalestine resonates deeply in the Arab imagination,\" Gerges said. \"Palestine reminds Arabs of the subservience of their governments. Palestine reminds Arabs of the hegemony and domination and the continuing colonialism and imperialism of the West.\"",
      "He added, \u201cI would say that Gaza, the tragedy of Gaza, the destruction of Gaza, could really serve as a time bomb that implodes the Arab political order from within.\u201d",
      "Polling before Oct. 7, 2023, showed that most Arab citizens rejected normalizing ties with Israel, a sentiment subsequent surveys show has only deepened since.",
      "A survey published in June by pollster Arab Barometer found that support for such a move has collapsed, not exceeding 13 percent in the seven countries surveyed.",
      "The Egyptian and Jordanian embassies in the U.S., along with the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this story.",
      "Egypt and Jordan, even with the crackdown, have allowed limited protests, though hundreds of activists have also been arrested, according to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.",
      "The Gulf states rarely allow protests, but they have largely maintained diplomatic and trade links with Israel throughout its devastating offensive in the Gaza strip that began after the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, in which some 1,200 were killed and 250 taken hostage.",
      "Health officials in Gaza say that more than 61,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed in the ensuing war.",
      "Many academics, including Israeli scholars, have in recent months joined rights groups in condemning Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza as genocide, a charge Israel vehemently denies.",
      "\u201cDespite the genocide, in the middle of the genocide, this extraordinary depravity that we see in Gaza, not a single Arab state that has relations with Israel has cut relations with Israel, although other states in other parts of the world have,\u201d said Ussama Makdisi, professor of history and chancellor\u2019s chair at the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were among the Arab states that signed the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020, paving the way for economic and diplomatic ties with Israel. Saudi Arabia had been set to follow, but the Gaza conflict put those plans on hold.",
      "For Gulf Arab states, better ties with Israel have little to do with public attitudes and more to do with realpolitik, experts say. The Gulf states host several U.S. military bases that analysts say help shield them from regional rival Iran and also help maintain Western access to the region\u2019s vast energy supplies.",
      "Access to Israel\u2019s vibrant tech sector has also been a draw for some Arab states, who have used its surveillance technology to stifle dissent, experts and rights groups say.",
      "\u201cThose regimes in the Arab world that depend on the U.S. for their security, they don\u2019t depend on their legitimacy vis a vis their own people. They depend on U.S. protection, U.S. military bases,\u201d Makdisi said.",
      "Houthi rebels, who control large parts of Yemen, have fired missiles and drones at Israel and ships in the region in what they say is an attempt to end Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, but Yemen is alone among Arab states in pressuring Israel militarily. Arab countries could apply economic pressure through oil embargoes or restricting access to the Suez Canal and Arab airspace, but experts say such moves are unlikely.",
      "Arab countries once supplied Palestinian militant groups with weapons, funding and bases from which to attack Israel, but such solidarity proved costly and dangerous.",
      "In Jordan, tensions between Palestinian militant groups and the ruling monarchy exploded into the \u201cBlack September\u201d civil war in 1970, leading to the militants\u2019 eventual expulsion and relocation to Lebanon.",
      "The presence of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon in the 1970s exacerbated the country\u2019s civil war and triggered an Israeli invasion in 1982 to target \u201cPalestinian terrorists.\u201d",
      "More recently, Israel invaded Lebanon last year, heavily bombing southern Beirut in an offensive against the Hezbollah militant group, which had been firing rockets at Israel in solidarity with Hamas.",
      "Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran, which has led some Arab states to distance themselves from both groups.",
      "For Ryan Crocker, former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Lebanon and Kuwait, lukewarm Arab support for the Palestinian cause is less about U.S. and Israeli pressure and more about self-preservation.",
      "\u201cThe Palestinians, both the cause, the PLO and the population, in the Jordanian and Lebanese examples, have both been seen as a threat to the rule of these Arab regimes,\u201d Crocker told NBC News.",
      "The U.S. and Israel had floated plans for Arab countries to accept tens of thousands of Gaza refugees, but the idea was flatly rejected, with those Arab countries fearing both renewed Palestinian militancy and accusations of aiding ethnic cleansing, experts say.",
      "Crocker compared Palestinians to the Kurds, another stateless group in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a saying among the Kurds, who are scattered between Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, that they have no friends but the mountains,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, the Palestinians don\u2019t even have the mountains.\u201d"

      "European leaders announced that they would join Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington on Monday as they seek to navigate America\u2019s new approach to ending the war after Trump signaled that he was reversing his insistence on a ceasefire and instead pursuing a permanent peace deal \u2014 seemingly aligning the United States with the Kremlin.",

      "But Grebenyuk, who said he worked at a window manufacturing factory, added that he thought it was \u201cunlikely anything will change dramatically,\u201d after the talks to end the war, which entered its fourth year in February.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t expect anything,\u201d he said.",
      "Elena Ionova, a soloist with Moscow\u2019s Operetta Theatre, also said that it was \u201cgood that this meeting is happening,\u201d but that she didn\u2019t \u201ctrust people on the other side.\u201d She added that she was \u201cworried about Putin\u2019s fate.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course, we would all like for all of this to end and end, at least, without any major catastrophes,\u201d she said.",
      "It is hard to get an accurate sense of the weight of public opinion in Russia as a result of Putin\u2019s yearslong crackdown on dissent, which has stifled political opposition and free speech.",
      "A recent survey by the independent pollster Levada Center showed that the level of support for Putin's military campaign in Ukraine remained high at 75% in Russia, but that nearly two-thirds of respondents supported peace talks.",
      "The venue for those talks is itself significant.",
      "Trump and Putin will meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a  military base that was crucial to U.S. efforts to counter the then-Soviet Union during the Cold War.",
      "It sits just outside Anchorage, the largest city in the territory,   which the U.S. bought from Russia for $7.2 million in 1867 \u2014 a sale that has since been viewed as na\u00efve by Russians after Alaska was found to contain vast natural resources.",
      "Putin aide Yuri Ushakov signaled Thursday that while the primary focus of the summit would be Ukraine, economic ties between the two nations would also be on the agenda. Putin hinted that a nuclear arms control treaty may also be discussed.",
      "Ukraine and its allies may fear Putin offering Trump other incentives to distract from his hard-line position on the war he launched by invading his neighbor.",
      "\u201cStripped of political narratives and competing interests, and based on Putin\u2019s own statements and actions, his core demands have not changed,\u201d said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a Berlin-based think tank.",
      "Those demands have previously included Ukraine ceding all the land that Putin claims to have annexed and accepting permanent neutrality, with a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO. Putin claims four Ukrainian regions \u2014 Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 as well as the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which he annexed in 2014, although Russian forces do not fully control all of the territory in each region.",
      "Zelenskyy and Ukrainian officials have long said they would not concede any territory that Russia illegally annexed. Ukraine has also insisted that any agreement must include \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d from its allies so that Moscow is not able to launch future aggression.",
      "Stanovaya added that she thought Putin intended to \u201cpropose to Trump that the war be brought to an end, and will press the point that he genuinely wishes it to stop.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis main objective is to persuade Trump that Europe and the current Ukrainian leadership are the obstacles to ending the conflict, and that a cessation of hostilities is possible if there are guarantees that Ukraine will not use any pause to rearm,\u201d she said on X, adding that the Russian president \u201cwill strongly promote the idea that the U.S. and Russia are two great nations that should maintain good relations regardless of local conflicts.\u201d",
      "In Moscow, Ionova, the opera singer, said she hoped \u201ceverything will be fine,\u201d adding, \u201cWe wish that this summit will be successful for us, for Russia.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "KHARKIV, Ukraine \u2014 Even as his family sobbed into the dirt of his brother\u2019s grave, Ukrainian soldier Artem Reshetilov warned President Donald Trump that he should not compromise with Russia during Friday\u2019s peace talks in Alaska.",
      "His brother, Andrei, 38, was killed by a Russian artillery strike while fighting to defend Ukraine\u2019s front lines. At the funeral on the eve of the talks in Anchorage \u2014 which Ukraine has not been invited to \u2014 Reshetilov urged Trump not to bend to Vladimir Putin\u2019s demands of more Ukrainian land.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have to compromise with the enemy and give up our beloved land because this enemy won\u2019t stop,\u201d said Reshetilov, 46, as hundreds of Ukrainian flags, each marking the grave of a fallen soldier, flapped in the breeze behind him at this cemetery near the major northeastern city of Kharkiv.",
      "Like many who will not be present in Anchorage, he told NBC News he fears Russia could merely use a ceasefire to \u201creturn even stronger\u201d and attack Ukraine and even other countries in Europe.",
      "\u201cWe know Russia and they never keep agreements,\u201d he added.",
      "These fears are not confined just to Ukrainian hearts but shared by governments, experts and people across Europe and beyond who fear what Trump might agree to with Putin in a bid to resolve a war he once promised the American people he could fix in 24 hours.",
      "Hours before the talks Friday, Trump suggested that he and Putin would discuss territorial swaps between Russia and Ukraine \u2014 despite previously assuring European allies that he wouldn\u2019t. But Trump said that \"I've got to let Ukraine make that decision\" and that his aim was to set up future talks between the two warring neighbors.",
      "Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Alaska, Trump said that he would not deal economically with Russia until the war was over. He also said it was possible Ukraine could emerge from negotiations with their much desired \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d against Russia attacking again.",
      "If Russia does not agree to peace the consequences \u201cwill be very severe,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this for my health. I\u2019d like to focus on our country, but I\u2019m doing this to save a lot of lives.\u201d",
      "Follow live updates here",
      "Alarmed at being frozen out of the talks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his government this week turned to European leaders for a lifeline, hoping to influence the high-stakes summit and prevent a potential disaster for Ukraine.",
      "A flurry of diplomacy culminated Wednesday with an emergency video call between Trump, Zelenskyy and leaders from Britain, France, Germany, the European Union and NATO, all of whom urged the American president not to capitulate to Putin. Trump said afterward that he had assured them there would be \u201cvery severe consequences\u201d if Putin did not agree to end the war.",
      "U.S. allies came away hopeful they had steered the president away from a potential Putin diplomatic trap, but nonetheless remain anxious, European diplomats and former U.S. officials said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s looking better today than it did a week ago,\u201d said William Taylor, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. \u201cThe Ukrainians and the Europeans were all worried that Trump and Putin would get together and make some decisions for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Even so, the apprehension is palpable.",
      "\u201cWe all are preparing ourselves for an outcome that may be highly problematic,\u201d said one European official who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks.",
      "So far, Ukrainian officials and European allies have tried to tread carefully to avoid antagonizing Trump. But if the talks produce a lop-sided proposal favoring Russia, \u201cthen there is no way that Europe can simply pretend that everything is simply OK,\u201d the European official said.",
      "Asked for a response to these criticisms, the White House directed NBC News to statements Trump has made this week saying that it would be up to Ukraine and Russia to make a deal and that this meeting was merely a \u201clistening exercise\u201d that could lead to an eventual summit between the warring leaders.",
      "What\u2019s caused the most consternation in Ukraine is Trump\u2019s repeated suggestions that he could negotiate a \u201cland swap\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, having previously suggested it would be unrealistic for Ukrainians to expect the return of lands illegally invaded and currently occupied by Russia.",
      "The American president told European leaders this week that he would not discuss territory divisions during his sit-down with Putin, two European officials and three other people briefed on the call told NBC News.",
      "That\u2019s not to say opinion in Ukraine hasn\u2019t shifted. A survey by pollster Gallup this month suggested the public  now favors a negotiated solution \u2014 though the majority still reject Russia\u2019s absolutist terms.",
      "Regardless of what Trump and Putin discuss, Ukraine\u2019s absence renders the entire exercise absurd and insulting for many in the country actually under attack.",
      "\u201cWhy should they talk about Ukraine without Ukraine\u2019s participation?\u201d said Oksana Andrusyak, 26, who works as a communications analyst in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.",

      "Putin has said he is ready for peace \u2014 but only if Ukraine essentially surrenders. Rather than showing willingness to wind up his war, he is killing more Ukrainian citizens than ever.",
      "There were more civilian casualties in July than in any other month of the war \u2014 286 people killed and 1,388 injured \u2014 the United Nations announced last month."

    "story": [
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska \u2014 Toward the end of Donald Trump\u2019s first term, his national security adviser turned to him in the Oval Office and said he should win the Nobel Peace Prize for his work normalizing relations between Israel and some Arab states.",
      "Another aide chimed in, saying the last president, Barack Obama, had won the award \u201cfor nothing.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s attitude was, \u2018Whatever,\u2019\u201d recalled the adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, in an interview. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t concerned about the recognition.\u201d",
      "Any whiff of indifference is now gone. Back in office, Trump and his aides are intensifying a public campaign to snag the award, citing a string of peace deals while making a case that snubbing him again would be an injustice.",
      "Day by day, the White House is amplifying Trump's role in curbing hostilities and putting out the message that this most combative of presidents is at heart a \"peacemaker.\"",
      "Aides have highlighted his role in settling disputes between Israel and Iran, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Cambodia and Thailand, and Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, promoting \"worldwide calls\" from the heads of several of those nations for Trump to win the peace prize.",
      "Trump is also touting his efforts to end a worrying conflict between two nuclear-armed combatants, India and Pakistan. He suggested he used trade as an inducement to stop the fighting, though an Indian official has denied that Trump's mediation made any difference.",
      "Speaking last month, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the president has \u201cbrokered, on average, about one peace deal or ceasefire per month during his six months in office. It\u2019s well past time that President Trump was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d she added.",
      "A difference between this term and the last is that now, \u201che actually wants it,\" a senior official in Trump\u2019s first term said about the Nobel Peace Prize, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t just want to talk about it.\u201d",
      "Now comes his best shot. On Friday, Trump will fly to Alaska for a sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin aimed at ending a war with Ukraine that has produced close to 1.5 million casualties on both sides.",
      "The odds of a breakthrough are tough, but if Trump brokers a truce on terms that are fair to Ukraine, that would be a diplomatic triumph that eluded both Obama and President Joe Biden.",
      "In the run-up to the summit, the Nobel prize has appeared to be top of mind in Trump's circle. Without prompting, Leavitt  portrayed Trump as deserving of the prize in three out of her four press briefings in July. In prior months, she hadn\u2019t brought up the award.",
      "Trump has posted about the prize a total of seven times on his social media site since his second term began, six of them in June and July. A theme of his is that while he\u2019s earned the accolade, he won\u2019t win it.",
      "\u201cThe president feels that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, but does not think he will get it,\u201d a White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe has remarked that it will go to someone who writes a book about how Donald Trump thinks rather than Donald Trump himself.\u201d",
      "In a visit to the White House in April, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re was asked about Trump\u2019s prospects of winning the award, announced annually in Oslo.",
      "He didn\u2019t bite.",
      "\u201cOn that prize, that is a committee taking care of that which is completely working on its own terms and I cannot comment on that,\u201d St\u00f8re said.",
      "Trump smiled and looked across the Cabinet Room table at the prime minister: \u201cI like that question,\u201d he said.",
      "The award is solely in the hands of the Nobel selection committee; politicians don\u2019t pick the winner. But Trump has reportedly raised the issue with Norway before. Last month, he called the country\u2019s finance minister, former NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, to talk tariffs and brought up the peace prize, a Norwegian news outlet wrote Thursday.",
      "The White House official said that the president and Stoltenberg did speak, but could not say that the conversation was focused on the prize. Stoltenberg confirmed in a statement that he spoke to Trump about tariffs but would not go into further details of the call.",
      "Trump is surrounded by reminders of past presidents who\u2019ve won what is arguably humanity\u2019s most prestigious award. Obama, whose portrait hangs in the White House, won it less than a year into his presidency and even he acknowledged at the time that his accomplishments were \u201cslight\u201d in contrast to other Nobel laureates.",
      "Just a few paces from the Oval Office, Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s Nobel Prize is on display, signifying both the challenge and opportunity that Trump faces. Roosevelt won in 1906 for bringing an end to another Russian conflict: a war with Japan.",
      "As much as he aligns himself politically with working Americans, Trump has long been attuned to elite opinion. He takes pride in recounting that his late uncle, John Trump, taught at the acclaimed Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has described his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, as \u201cthe hardest school to get into, the best school in the world.\u201d",
      "In announcing the Kennedy Center honorees on Wednesday, Trump said that he had long wanted one for himself. The president now plans to host the Kennedy Center Honors this year, teasing to reporters, \"maybe ... next year we\u2019ll honor Trump.\"",
      "A Nobel Peace Prize would be the ultimate validation.",
      "\"If the Israel-Hamas/Iran and Russia-Ukraine conflicts get resolved, there\u2019s no way that they can\u2019t give President Trump the Nobel Peace Prize,\" O'Brien said.",
      "\u201cThe Nobel committee may not like Trump,\" he added. \"They may not like his personality. They may not like his populism, but if the award has any meaning, they have to give it to him.\u201d",
      "Of course, the Nobel selection committee has its own ideas about what it takes to win. The five-member body appointed by the Norwegian parliament may be weighing other criteria apart from the peace deals the White House has tallied.",
      "In his will, Alfred Nobel stated that the prize should go to those \u201cwho shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations.\u201d",
      "Since Trump took office, some longtime U.S. allies have seen fraternal bonds fray. Trump has rolled out stiff tariffs in pursuit of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda meant to create more jobs at home. He stunned various world capitals with his calls for acquiring Greenland, Canada and the Panama Canal.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize has become something of a joke in foreign capitals,\u201d a former British diplomat said. \u201cHis claims to Canada, Panama, Greenland, etc., as well as tariff wars and the assaults on America\u2019s democratic institutions, incline governments in the opposite direction.\u201d",
      "What happens in the Nobel committee\u2019s closed-door deliberations is a closely guarded secret. The panel accepts nominations through the end of January and announces the winner in October. It waits 50 years before revealing even a list of nominees.",
      "Handicapping possible winners of the 2025 prize, a Norwegian think tank didn\u2019t mention Trump\u2019s name. The handful of front-runners the group cited included \u201cSudan\u2019s Emergency Response Rooms,\u201d the prime minister of Qatar, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, and the Women\u2019s International League for Peace & Freedom.",
      "It\u2019s far from clear that the Nobel committee is susceptible to persuasion. Pressure, publicity and coalition-building work in politics, the arena Trump knows well. But the Nobel committee is insulated from that world.",
      "The prize \u201cis not something you campaign for,\u201d a Western diplomat said. \u201cThis is a decision made by people who are independent and have their own point of view. You can\u2019t buy it. Norway doesn\u2019t need the money.\u201d",
      "Last week, Trump held a meeting at the White House with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan to mark a rapprochement between the two countries. Questioned by a reporter, both leaders plumped for Trump\u2019s Nobel candidacy.",
      "Nikol Pashinyan, prime minister of Armenia, said, \u201cWe will promote for that.\u201d",
      "Turning to Trump, he said, \u201cHopefully you will invite us\u201d to the award ceremony.",
      "\u201cFront row,\u201d Trump said."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 The marathon national security trial of pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai is nearing conclusion in Hong Kong as President Donald Trump vowed to \u201cdo everything I can to save\u201d the media tycoon from what critics say is political persecution by Chinese authorities.",
      "Closing arguments in the landmark trial, which began in December 2023, were set to begin this week after a five-month break following the end of Lai\u2019s testimony in March. But they were postponed twice on Thursday and Friday, first due to a severe thunderstorm that closed courts and then to allow time for Lai, who has complained of heart palpitations, to receive medication and a portable heart monitor.",
      "They are expected to resume Monday and last about 10 days, with a verdict by the three handpicked judges coming in October at the earliest.",
      "Lai, a 77-year-old British citizen who is one of the Chinese territory\u2019s most prominent democrats, was arrested in August 2020 under a Beijing-imposed national security law over his role in mass anti-government protests in 2019 that sometimes turned violent. He has since spent almost 1,700 days in solitary confinement, during which time his son says his health has declined significantly.",
      "Lai has pleaded not guilty to two national security charges of conspiring to collude with foreign forces and a third count under colonial-era legislation of publishing seditious materials in Apple Daily, his now-defunct pro-democracy tabloid. If convicted, he could face life in prison.",
      "The U.S. and other governments have criticized the case as politically motivated and called for Lai\u2019s immediate release. Trump said Thursday that he would \u201cdo everything I can to save him\u201d in talks with Chinese officials, even if Chinese President Xi Jinping \u201cwould not be exactly thrilled\u201d to let him go.",
      "Trump appeared to be softening a claim he made about Lai last year, when he said on a podcast that \u201c100%, I\u2019ll get him out\u201d of China and that it would be \u201cso easy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t say 100% I\u2019d save him. I said 100% I\u2019m going to be bringing it up. And I\u2019ve already brought it up,\u201d Trump said Thursday in an interview with Fox News Radio, without giving details.",
      "The government of Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997, said Wednesday that Lai was receiving a fair trial and accused \u201cexternal forces\u201d of trying to interfere in Hong Kong courts. Hong Kong and mainland Chinese officials say the national security law and related local legislation were necessary to restore stability in the international financial hub after the protests.",
      "With a verdict still weeks away, the hearing on Friday drew fewer people than rulings and sentencings in recent cases such as the sedition trial against two Stand News journalists or the subversion trial against 47 pro-democracy politicians and activists.",
      "But members of the public still lined up hours before the hearing amid heavy police presence to secure seats in the main courtroom and catch a glimpse of Lai.",
      "First in line was local activist Lui Yuk-lin, who arrived before 1 a.m. and said she was concerned about Lai\u2019s health.",
      "\u201cHe used to have a big belly. But after many years in jail, it\u2019s now gone,\u201d said Lui, who wore a T-shirt bearing the American flag and the words \u201cLand of the Free.\u201d",
      "Members of the public gallery waved at Lai, wearing a white windbreaker and thick-rimmed black glasses, as he appeared in the courtroom Friday in a glassed-in area surrounded by four guards. Lai smiled and waved back at supporters.",
      "Western diplomats were also in attendance.",
      "During his 52 days of testimony, Lai denied allegations that he lobbied the U.S. to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China. He said that while Apple Daily held anti-communist views, he did not use the media outlet to promote Hong Kong independence.",
      "Lai also referred to himself as a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d at least twice during questioning, drawing fierce rebukes from the bench.",
      "Lai has already been convicted in three separate cases related to unauthorized assembly and is serving five years and nine months in prison over a 2022 fraud conviction, cases that have also been criticized as politically motivated.",
      "Spectators waved again as Lai exited the courtroom on Friday.",

    "story": [
      "Russia's Vladimir Putin sounded positive Thursday on the eve of  his talks with President Donald Trump in Alaska, saying he believed the American leader was making \"quite energetic and sincere efforts\" toward peace in Ukraine.",
      "A day ahead of their summit, Putin convened a meeting of advisers to inform them \"about how the negotiation process on the Ukrainian crisis is going,\" the Kremlin said in a readout translated by NBC News.",
      "The Russian leader said the Trump administration is making \"quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the fighting, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict.\"",
      "Those efforts are intended \"to create long-term conditions of peace between our countries and in Europe, and in the world as a whole,\" he added, particularly if the negotiations are extended to cover strategic offensive weapons treaties.",
      "This suggests that a deal on nuclear arms control could be part of the talks. Russia suspended its participation in the New START \"reduction in strategic offensive arms\" agreement in 2023.",
      "Earlier Thursday, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov said the summit would start with head-to-head talks between Trump, Putin and their translators at 11:30 a.m. local time (3:30 p.m. ET) and would be followed by a joint news conference. The White House later confirmed this.",
      "Trump \"wants to exhaust all options to try to bring this war to a peaceful resolution,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News.",
      "The top-level Russian delegation will include Putin, Ushakov, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Putin's longtime friend and investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev, Ushakov said on a call with journalists in Moscow.",
      "The primary topic of the meeting will be Ukraine, he said, but he added that he expected the \"huge, and unfortunately hitherto untapped, potential\" of economic ties between the U.S. and Russia would also be discussed.",
      "As well as Putin's openly stated goal of subjugating Ukraine, he also wants to end Russia's exile from the Western financial system following economic sanctions imposed by Washington, the European Union and others. Trump has not yet lifted these punishments but has expressed a desire to end Russia's economic pariah status.",
      "NBC News asked Trump in a press gaggle on Thursday whether he would offer Putin access to rare earth minerals as an incentive to end the war with Ukraine.",
      "\"We\u2019re going to see what happens with our meeting. We have a big meeting. It\u2019s going to be, I think, very important for Russia, and it\u2019s going to be very important for us,\" Trump said, without offering additional details. He later added that the earth minerals are \u201cvery unimportant\u201d compared to \u201ctrying to save lives.\u201d",
      "The talks come as Ukraine marked a grim new record with 286 civilians killed and 1,388 injured in July, according to the United Nations.",
      "\u201cFor the second month in a row, the number of civilian casualties in Ukraine hits a new three-year high,\u201d Danielle Bell, the head of the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cOnly the first three months after the Russian Federation launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine saw more killed and injured than in this past month.\u201d",
      "The Trump-Putin summit has prompted howls of dismay and anxiety across Ukraine and Europe, which have not been invited to the talks and fear what the American president may agree to with his Russian counterpart about the conflict raging on their continent.",
      "They have been confined to their own diplomatic scrambling, including dozens of calls between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other leaders, culminating in a video call between these parties and Trump himself Wednesday.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Putin \u201cis bluffing\u201d in saying he wants peace.",
      "On Thursday, the Ukrainian leader flew to London and met his British counterpart, Prime Minister Keir Starmer, for what both called a \"productive meeting.\" As well as the prospect of Britain financing the small drones that have become central to Ukraine's battlefield defense, the pair discussed the Alaska talks, \"which present a viable chance to make progress as long as Putin takes action to prove he is serious about peace,\" a spokesperson from Starmer's office, No. 10 Downing St., said in a statement.",
      "After Wednesday's call with Zelenskyy, Starmer and others, Trump said he had assured them that there would be \"very severe consequences\" \u2014 without elaborating what those might be \u2014 if Putin did not agree to end the war during their sit-down discussion.",
      "Two European officials and three other people briefed on the call told NBC News that he told them he would not discuss possible divisions of territory with the man flying in from the Kremlin."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0President Donald Trump told European leaders during a call on Wednesday that he does not intend to discuss any possible divisions of territory when he meets with  Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska this week, according to two European officials and three other people briefed on the call.",
      "Trump said on the call, which also included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that he is going into the meeting with Putin with the goal of securing a ceasefire in Ukraine, those sources said.",
      "Trump and European leaders agreed that a ceasefire in Ukraine has to be implemented before peace negotiations can begin, the European officials and two other people briefed on the call said. Some of the European leaders were left with the impression from the call that Trump is not optimistic about the results of his meeting with Putin, they added.",
      "The call on Wednesday took place just days ahead of Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin, which is planned for Friday. European and Ukrainian officials have been nervous about the president\u2019s meeting with the Russian leader since he announced it last week. Among their concerns is that Trump and Putin might agree to the parameters of a peace deal, including territorial divisions, and then try to pressure Ukraine to agree to it. Trump\u2019s comments last week that there would \"be some land swapping\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, in particular, put Zelenskyy and European leaders on edge.",
      "But the two European officials and three other people briefed on Wednesday\u2019s call said all the leaders agreed that Ukraine must be included in negotiations and should be the one to decide what territorial concessions it might be willing to make. They also said the leaders were united in their belief that if Putin does not agree to a ceasefire, Trump will likely levy new sanctions on Russia.",
      "Two additional people familiar with Wednesday\u2019s call said European leaders left feeling positive about Trump\u2019s plans for his meeting with Putin. One of them said achieving a ceasefire is expected to be the priority for Trump in the meeting. The other person expressed confidence that Ukrainian territory would not be negotiated without Ukraine.",
      "A European official said there was still concern that the president could shift his position yet again once he is in the room with Putin, especially as he has so far proven reluctant to put concrete pressure on Russia and follow through on threats of additional sanctions.",
      "\u201cSometimes these positions change and get revised in a matter of hours,\u201d one European official said.",
      "European governments and Ukraine are also anxious about how the aftermath of the meeting would be handled, that European official said, and whether the details of what was discussed or agreed would be clearly explained or addressed in a joint statement.",
      "In response to a request for comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement: \"The White House does not discuss details of the President\u2019s private diplomatic conversations. However, President Trump has been clear that he wants to end this war and stop the killing, and Friday\u2019s meeting with President Putin will serve as an important moment in this process.\u201d",
      "Trump said Wednesday after the call that it was \u201cvery good\u201d and suggested that another meeting involving Zelenskyy could quickly follow his sit-down with Putin.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a very good chance that we\u2019re going to have a second meeting, which will be more productive than the first, because the first is I\u2019m going to find out where we are and what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cI would like to do it almost immediately, and we\u2019ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy and myself, if they\u2019d like to have me there.\u201d",
      "The president also said Russia will face \u201csevere consequences\u201d if Putin doesn\u2019t agree to end the war.",
      "Vice President JD Vance assured Zelenskyy and European allies on the call that the U.S. would not negotiate with Russia about a solution for the war in Ukraine without Ukraine or without Europe, according to two German government officials involved.",
      "Vance said afterward during remarks to U.S. troops at RAF Fairford in the U.K. that \u201cone of our most important shared security goals in Europe\u201d is ending the war in Ukraine."

      "A man accused of faking his own death and fleeing the United States to avoid sexual assault allegations was convicted of rape in Utah on Wednesday, prosecutors said.",
      "A Salt Lake County jury found Nicholas Alahverdian, who has been identified and charged by authorities in Utah as Nicholas Rossi, guilty after three days of testimony. Deliberations began on Wednesday.",
      "He will be sentenced on Oct. 20, the Salt Lake County District Attorney's Office said. He faces five years to life in prison.",
      "\"We are grateful to the survivor in this case for her willingness to come forward, years after this attack took place,\" Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said in a statement. \"We appreciate her patience as we worked to bring the defendant back to Salt Lake County so that this trial could take place and she could get justice. It took courage and bravery to take the stand and confront her attacker to hold him accountable.\"",
      "Alahverdian's defense attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday night.",
      "Alahverdian faces a second rape trial in nearby Utah County scheduled for September.",
      "In 2022 \u2014 two years after an online obituary stated that Alahverdian died of non-Hodgkin lymphoma \u2014 Alahverdian was arrested in Scotland under the name Arthur Knight.",
      "Speaking with a British accent and appearing in a wheelchair, he denied that he was Alahverdian and claimed that he was an Irish orphan who had become a businessman.",
      "In his opening statement, the prosecutor in the Salt Lake County case said that Alahverdian admitted his true identity under oath last year. He accused Alahverdian of raping a 24-year-old woman in 2008 after a whirlwind romance and engagement.",
      "At trial, the victim testified that Alahverdian quickly became controlling and mean after she bought their rings and lent him money for rent. When she removed the ring and told him their relationship was over, they fought and he eventually assaulted her, she testified.",
      "Alahverdian\u2019s defense lawyer, MacKenzie Potter, compared the allegations to an \u201cold puzzle from the thrift store,\u201d saying that \u201cnot all the pieces are there.\u201d",
      "The victim\u2019s story had changed over time, Potter said, and it can\u2019t be verified.",
      "Alahverdian, who was raised in Rhode Island\u2019s foster youth system and later became an outspoken aide in that state\u2019s legislature, was previously accused or convicted in other assault and sex crimes cases involving women with whom he was in relationships.",
      "In a case in Massachusetts in 2010, a woman he was married to at the time told authorities he held her down, grabbed her neck, struck her in the face, and refused to let her leave their home following an argument over a crying baby.",
      "Alahverdian pleaded no contest to misdemeanor domestic assault and was sentenced to probation.",
      "In Ohio in 2008, a woman whom Alahverdian met on MySpace accused him of sexually assaulting her while walking to class at a local community college. He denied the allegation and was charged with public indecency and sexual imposition, a misdemeanor crime indicating sexual contact against a person\u2019s will.",
      "After a trial, Alahverdian was fined and ordered to register as a sex offender.",
      "The second Utah case, also from 2008, involves a woman who said they\u2019d started dating after they met on MySpace. An affidavit in support of an arrest warrant shows that she told authorities that she broke it off after he became increasingly aggressive and borrowed money without paying her back.",
      "On Sept. 13 of that year, she said she went to his home after he said he\u2019d pay her back, according to the affidavit. He instead raped her, according to the document.",
      "A sexual assault kit was completed the next day, authorities have said, but a backlog in testing meant that Alahverdian was not identified as a suspect until a decade later. Alahverdian has pleaded not guilty in that case."

      "Zelenskyy attended the meeting in person, having touched down by helicopter in Berlin where he was greeted by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. It is the latest of what Zelenskyy says have been more than 30 conversations with world leaders this week.",

      "The White House is yet to comment, but ahead of the talks Trump described his European colleagues as \u201cgreat people who want to see a deal done\u201d in a Truth Social post.",
      "Most European leaders fear that Russia will not stop at the 20% of Ukraine it currently occupies following its 2022 full-scale invasion, and instead may use this land grab from which to launch further attacks on Moscow\u2019s former Soviet vassals. Putin has described the fall of the USSR as a historic tragedy, and believes the Baltic states, which are now members of the E.U. and NATO, should be brought back within his sphere of influence.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s calls are a show of European unity behind Ukraine and other Russian neighbors who fear its next move. E.U. leaders will hold separate telephone discussions before and after the call with Trump, the latter including Canada, indicating the level of coordination between them.",
      "European powers say that there must be a ceasefire before peace talks can begin \u2014 something rejected by Russia \u2014 and that negotiations cannot happen without Ukraine. They argue Ukraine must have \u201csecurity guarantees,\u201d perhaps in the form of Western peacekeepers, so the Kremlin does not use the pause to regroup and attack again."
